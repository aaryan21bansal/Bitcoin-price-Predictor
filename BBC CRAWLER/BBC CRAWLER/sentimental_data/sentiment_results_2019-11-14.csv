"An ""audacious"" attempt to steal two valuable paintings by Rembrandt from a south London gallery has been thwarted, police say. An intruder broke into Dulwich Picture Gallery on Wednesday night but the paintings were ""secured at the scene"", it was confirmed on Thursday. Neither of the art works, by the Dutch golden age painter, left the grounds. The gallery praised their ""robust security"" and ""the swift response of the Metropolitan Police."" TheRembrandt's Light exhibition,externaland gallery will remain closed for now, while a ""full investigation"" takes place. The police said an intruder used a canister to spray an officer in the face with an unknown substance, and as a result was able to get away. The officer did not suffer serious injuries and quickly recovered both paintings, with the help of security staff, ""This was an audacious attempted burglary and was clearly planned in advance,""said detective inspector Jason Barber,externalfrom the Flying Squad. ""Two paintings in the exhibition were targeted and it was only down to the prompt response of gallery security staff and the courage and swift intervention of officers that these two works of art were not stolen. Thankfully both the paintings were quickly recovered and secured."" The exhibition on ""one of the greatest painters who ever lived"" opened last month and focused on 35 of his paintings, etchings and drawings, including those owned by the gallery and others on loan from The Louvre and Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum.

"Curiosity has been exploring Gale Crater, which once hosted a body of liquid water The oxygen in Martian air is changing in a way that can't currently be explained by known chemical processes. That's the claim of scientists working on the Curiosity rover mission, who have been taking measurements of the gas. They discovered that the amount of oxygen in Martian ""air"" rose by 30% in spring and summer. The pattern remains a mystery, but researchers are beginning to narrow the possibilities. While the changes are most likely to be geological in nature, planetary scientists can't completely rule out an explanation involving microbial life. The results come from nearly six Earth years' (three Martian years') worth of data from the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument, a portable chemistry lab in the belly of the Curiosity rover. The scientists measured seasonal changes in gases that fill the air directly above the surface of Gale Crater on Mars, where Curiosity landed. They havepublished their findings in the journal JGR-Planets.,external The Martian atmosphere is overwhelmingly composed of carbon dioxide (CO2), with smaller amounts of other gases such as molecular nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar), molecular oxygen (O2) and methane (CH4). Curiosity rover senses methane spike So where did the Mars methane go? Can this box answer the biggest question on Mars? Agencies aim to bring back rocks from Mars Nitrogen and argon followed a predictable seasonal pattern, changing according to how much CO2 was in the air (which is in turn linked to changes in air pressure). They expected oxygen to follow this pattern too, but it didn't. Oxygen rose during each northern hemisphere spring and then fell in the autumn. They considered the possibility that CO2 or water (H2O) molecules released oxygen when they broke apart in the atmosphere, leading to a short-lived rise. But it would take five times more water than there actually is to produce the additional oxygen, and CO2 breaks up too slowly to generate it over such a short time. ""We know oxygen is created and destroyed on Mars through the energy provided by sunlight breaking down CO2 and H2O, both of which are observed in the atmosphere of Mars. The thing that doesn't make sense is the size of the variation - it doesn't match what we expect to see,"" Dr Manish Patel, from the Open University - who was not involved with the study, told BBC News. ""Given that Curiosity makes measurements at the surface of Mars, it is tempting to think that this is coming from the surface - but we have no evidence for that. Geologically-speaking, it seems unlikely - I can't think of a process that would fit."" The results may point to a reservoir of oxygen close to the Martian surface Dr Timothy McConnochie, from the University of Maryland in College Park, who is one of the authors on the JGR-Planets paper, told the BBC: ""You can measure the water vapour molecules in the Martian atmosphere and you can measure the change in oxygen... There just aren't enough water molecules. ""Mars in general has a pretty small amount of water vapour, and there's several times more oxygen atoms that mysteriously appear than there is in the water vapour on the entire planet."" They also considered why the oxygen dropped back to levels predicted by known chemistry in the autumn. One idea was that solar radiation could break up oxygen molecules into two atoms, which then escaped into space. But after running the numbers, scientists concluded it would take at least 10 years for the oxygen to disappear in this way. In addition, the seasonal rises aren't perfectly repeatable; the amount of oxygen varies between years. The results imply that something is producing the gas and then taking it away. Dr McConnochie thinks the evidence suggests a source of oxygen in the near-surface. ""I think it points to a reservoir (of oxygen) in the soil that interchanges with the atmosphere,"" he said. ""To exchange (with the atmosphere) fairly rapidly on a seasonal timescale it has to be close to the surface. If it's deeper, any process is going to be slower,"" he told BBC News. An experiment carried out by the Viking landers in the 1970s provides tantalising clues in the oxygen mystery Some supporting evidence for this comes fromNasa's Viking landers,external, which touched down on the Red Planet in the 1970s. Results from the Viking Gas Exchange Experiment (GEX) showed that when the humidity was increased in a chamber containing a sample of Martian soil, it led to a release of oxygen. However, says Dr McConnochie, the temperature in the Viking spacecraft chamber was much warmer than it would be outside, even during spring and summer. This complicates any attempt to apply the results to the Martian environment: ""It's a tantalising clue, but it's not helping us solve the problem directly,"" he explained. Mars does become more humid during spring and summer. Water-ice gets deposited on the poles during the winter. Then, throughout the summer, there is a release of water vapour in the polar regions. There could be a link between the humidification of the entire planet at this time and the release of oxygen. Intriguingly, the changes in oxygen are similar to those seen for methane, which increases in abundance by about 60% in summer for inexplicable reasons. It's unclear whether there's any connection though. The methane mystery has attracted much attention over the years because most of Earth's methane is produced by living organisms. Though there are several ways that methane could be released by geological processes on Mars, the production of this gas by microbes living deep beneath the surface remains a tantalising possibility. Oxygen, too, can be produced by microorganisms. The possibility that biology is behind the changing levels of the gas in the Martian atmosphere can't be ruled out. But the scientific bar on such claims is set very high indeed. It's a very remote possibility, but we still don't understand enough about the behaviour of oxygen to use it as an indicator for life. In addition, the near sub-surface of Mars is a very difficult place to live because of the high levels of radiation that leak through the Martian atmosphere, large variations in temperature and limited availability of water. ""With current instruments on Mars spacecraft, we have no way of knowing whether biology is producing the springtime rise in oxygen. Abiotic processes look very promising, so we'll need to firmly rule them out first before pursuing microbial contribution,"" Prof Sushil Atreya, from the University of Michigan, who is a co-author on the study, told BBC News. But he added that future missions would make interrelated measurements that could shed light on Martian habitability. Dr Manish Patel says that oxygen can last for years in the Martian atmosphere Dr Patel said: ""Whilst I believe biological activity in the Martian sub-surface at some point in Mars' history is a real possibility, there is no way to explain this through oxygen-producing microbes - we are missing the copious other indicators that would come along with that. ""Maybe it's all hidden, but as a scientist, I can only comment on what we observe - and an extraordinary claim requires an extraordinary observation."" The notion of oxygen being locked up in some chemical form in the Martian soil remains much more likely. ""One phenomenon that applies to most gas molecules is they stick to surfaces... especially anything with a lot of surface area. That sticking, that adsorption, changes on the basis of temperature,"" Tim McConnochie explained. ""Oxygen is a very active molecule, so it changes to some other form and then sticks and then changes back. The tricky thing is the forms of oxygen we know about in the Martian soil are the ones that are pretty stable."" One of these stable molecules is a compound called perchlorate, which is widespread in Martian soil. It doesn't give up its oxygen easily, but it's possible that exposure to high energy radiation - cosmic rays, for example - could make some of it break down, leaving by-products. One potential by-product is hypochlorite - found in bleach - which is less stable and thus more prone to releasing its oxygen. ""I feel we're closer to an idea of how to release it from the soil than we are to an idea of how to sequester it back into the soil,"" said Tim McConnochie. But he explained: ""Presumably there is some cycle that sequesters it."" Prof Atreya explained: ""There are at least three potential abiotic reservoirs of oxygen in the surface/subsurface of Mars - oxidant, in the form of perchlorates; oxidant in the form of hydrogen peroxide; and oxidised rocks or hydrated minerals. ""Water-rock reactions in the past, or even today if liquid water exists beneath the surface or as brines, were most likely responsible for the third reservoir."" Dr Patel believes it may not be possible to apply the result from Gale Crater to the whole of Mars. ""This has been highlighted by the recent methane measurement, where Curiosity measured a huge amount of methane, but it wasn't detectable by the NOMAD and ACS instruments on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which makes measurements of these things at a global-scale and at higher sensitivity."" The authors of the study in JGR-Planets say they are throwing out the problem to scientists in the field, in a bid to harness expertise from across the community. We've learned huge amounts about the Red Planet over the last few decades, but it's clear from this there are still lots of puzzles to crack.

"This video can not be played Sir Ed said Labour and the Tories are ""competing to bankrupt Britain"". A Liberal Democrat government would spend Â£100bn tackling the effects of climate change and protecting the environment, the party's deputy leader has announced. Sir Ed Davey said the five-year investment would ""jump-start"" efforts to combat the ""climate emergency"". The pledge would be funded through borrowing and tax changes, to be set out in detail in the party's manifesto. The Conservatives and Labour both have targets to reduce carbon emissions. Sir Ed, who served as secretary of state for energy and climate change in the coalition government, said his party would ""decarbonise capitalism"" if elected. Live: Election campaign latest What is a climate emergency? He said a Lib Dem administration would be a ""government of business"" by stopping Brexit, increasing investment in infrastructure, and promoting new green jobs. Speaking in Leeds, he also pledged his party would build a new tram or metro system in the West Yorkshire city. Sir Ed, who is also the party's finance spokesman, said the climate investment would include a new Â£10bn ""renewable power fund"" to leverage more than Â£100bn of extra private climate investment. Environmental campaigners recently floated a replica of a British home in the River Thames to highlight rising sea levels ""This will fast track deployment of clean energy, to make Britain not just the world leader in offshore wind, but also the global number one in tidal power too. ""And we will invest Â£15bn more to make every building in the country greener, with an emergency ten-year programme to save energy, end fuel poverty and cut heating bills.""

General election 2019 policy guide Green Party pledges to appoint 'carbon chancellor' The party said the policy would be funded through Â£85bn of borrowing and Â£15bn raised through tax changes, which will be detailed in its manifesto. Sir Ed also attacked the ""fantasy economics"" of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, claiming that the spending plans unveiled by the two parties represent a ""debate between fantasies"". ""Fantasies born of nostalgia for a British Imperial past. Competing with fantasies from a failed 1970s ideology."" He said his party would not do any kind of deal with Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn if no party wins a majority on 12 December. But he said they would vote ""issue by issue"" with a minority Conservative or Labour government, in an effort to make them more ""moderate"". ""What we will not do is have a coalition or have a supply and confidence relationship, because we think these parties have become too extreme,"" he said. This video can not be played Could your vote save the planet? This Matters looks into what's really going on in this election He also repeated his claim that stopping Brexit would deliver a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" for public services, due to better economic growth. BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the vast majority of forecasts do expect the economy would be bigger if the UK were to stay in the EU. But he added the size of that ""bonus"" cannot be predicted with any certainty, and Â£50bn was not a hugely significant amount in terms of overall government expenditure. The Lib Dem climate pledge follows the Green Party's promiseto appoint a ""carbon chancellor""to allocate Â£100bn per year towards climate change. Labour has announced it would make all new-build homes""zero carbon"" by 2022, as well asreducing the UK's carbon emissions by 10%through a huge home improvement programme.

"Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has claimed the Conservatives offered his candidates jobs and peerages to try to get them to stand down. Mr Farage also said his candidates received ""thousands of phone calls and emails"" trying to get them to withdraw ahead of next month's election. He made the claims shortly after candidate nominations closed before the 12 December poll. The Tories denied offering Brexit Party candidates jobs or peerages. Mr Farage has confirmed his candidates will not contest seats won by the Tories at the 2017 general election, but will stand candidates against the party elsewhere. Conservative figures have urged his party not to run in Labour-held marginal constituencies, fearing his candidates could divide the Brexit-backing vote. Farage: Tories should stand down in Labour seats Where are the seats that could turn the election? A really simple guide to the UK general election In a video posted on Twitter, Mr Farage said that he, along with eight ""senior figures"" in his party, had been offered peerages to stand down. He said the offer had been made by people ""deep inside Number 10 Downing Street"" - although he did not think Prime Minister Boris Johnson was involved. ""As you can imagine, I said I do not want, and I will never have, anything to do with this kind of behaviour,"" he said. A Tory source has told the BBC the Brexit Party candidate in Peterborough was offered an unpaid role in education in the hope it would convince him to stand aside. Mike Greene is standing for the party in the Cambridgeshire constituency, which Labour held narrowly at a by-election in June. It is understood friends of Mr Greene had indicated that the role could be enough of an inducement. Mr Greene's team confirmed the offer of a role had been made to him, but said their candidate would definitely be running. Mr Farage also later said his candidates had been ""subjected to thousands of phone calls, and emails and threats all over the country"" to get them to stand aside. He said candidates had been offered jobs ""in the negotiating team, jobs in government departments and hints at peerages too"". A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said: ""We don't do electoral pacts - our pact is with the British people."" ""The only way to get Brexit done and unleash Britain's potential is to vote for your local Conservative candidate"". Speaking on BBC Question Time, Conservative party chairman James Cleverly said allegations that his party has offered peerages were ""completely unfounded"". ""There are a number of people who went to the Brexit Party, who had been up until very, very recently Conservatives,"" he said. ""I have no doubt that Conservatives will have spoken to people they know locally and said 'if you genuinely want to deliver Brexit, the only way of doing that is with a Conservative majority government'. ""I have no doubt conversations like that have been happening up and down the country."" But he added: ""I'm telling you that I have no truck with a pact or agreements. Nigel Farage has asked for one for months. We said no."" Labour party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""It looks like Boris Johnson is trying to stitch-up this election by offering jobs to Brexit party candidates to get them to stand down. ""This gives a whiff of the corrupt way the establishment works. We can't allow the Tories to run the country a minute longer. It's time for real change."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said the Conservative Party had seen a ""hard-right takeover"" that ""has now been endorsed by both Trump and Farage"". ""As Nigel Farage has admitted, the Liberal Democrats are the only party at this election that can take seats from the Conservatives, stop Brexit and build a brighter future,"" he added.

"The plane was en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down over a rebel-held area of eastern Ukraine An international inquiry into the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 believes high-level Russian officials were directing separatists in eastern Ukraine linked to the attack. Investigators allege a top aide of President Vladimir Putin was in contact with rebel leaders on a regular basis. All 298 people on board were killed when a missile struck the plane over rebel-held territory on 17 July 2014. Russia's foreign ministry has rejected the latest findings. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said international investigators had manipulated the inquiry to suit a predetermined conclusion. ""They publish some material, part of which turns out to be fake, and another part is not confirmed."" she told reporters. Four charged with murder for downing flight MH17 MH17 plane crash in Ukraine: What we know The 298 who perished Investigators have charged four people, including a separatist defence chief. The suspects are due to go on trial, probably in absentia, in April 2020. The Netherlands-based inquiry team have not linked Russia directly to the attack on the plane but they say ""intercepted phone-calls"" show contact with two of the four suspects already charged with murdering the passengers and crew. While MH17 is not mentioned in the phone-taps, provided by Ukraine's SBU intelligence, investigators believe Moscow officials knew what was going on on the ground and had influence over ""administrative, financial and military matters"" in the separatists' self-styled Donetsk People's Republic (DPR). This video can not be played How does a Buk missile system work? The inquiry has already said the Bukh Telar missile launch system came from Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade based at Kursk. They are now appealing for more witnesses to come forward. The inquiry team names Vladislav Surkov, a former Kremlin strategist and deputy prime minister, and Sergey Aksyonov, the man placed in charge of Crimea when it was occupied and annexed by Russia months before. They say Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu is also mentioned in several calls. ""The indications for close ties between Russian government officials and leaders of the DPR raise questions about their possible involvement in the deployment of the Buk Telar which brought down flight MH17 on 17 July 2014,"" said Andy Kraag, head of the criminal investigation division of Dutch police. Two of the suspects already charged are mentioned in the phone-taps. Igor Girkin was so-called defence minister in the DPR and, according to prosecutors, Sergei Dubinsky was his deputy. DPR leaders always insisted they were volunteers not directed by anyone but the inquiry team says it has spoken to witnesses who say key figures were directed from within Russia. They say DPR leader Alexander Borodai was recorded,externalsaying: ""I'm carrying out orders and protecting the interests of one and only state, the Russian Federation. That's the bottom line."" They also quote Mr Borodai apparently talking to Vladislav Surkov a fortnight before the MH17 disaster talking about Russian reinforcements. This video can not be played An animated video from the Dutch Safety Board shows the damage to the plane and how it was caused Investigators believe leading rebels were equipped by Russia's FSB security service with secure phones that cannot be tapped and operate via the internet, apparently nicknamed ""the glass"". Sergei Dubinsky, they allege, called someone named Semenov saying: ""Those are special phones, you cannot buy them. They are gotten through Moscow. Through FSB."" Although four people have been charged and are due to go on trial in April, probably in absentia, it is thought more evidence could yet emerge from rebel ranks in the DPR. The aim of the inquiry team is to find out who ultimately pushed the button that brought down MH17 en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and who was in charge. The 298 who died included 193 Dutch nationals, 43 Malaysians, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, 10 Britons, four Belgians, four Germans, three Philippine nationals, one New Zealander and one Canadian. Russia has argued that the investigation and trial is aimed at discrediting the country in the eyes of the international community.

"Five rockets were launched from Gaza hours after the ceasefire A ceasefire between Israel and militants in Gaza appears to be holding, despite the launch of several rockets hours after it took effect. The truce ended two days of intense fighting in which militants fired some 450 rockets towards Israel and Israeli aircraft carried out waves of strikes. Early on Thursday, a family of eight were killed in an air strike in Gaza. The fighting left 34 Palestinians dead and 111 injured in total, while 63 Israelis needed medical treatment. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 25 of the Palestinian fatalities were militants. The escalation began on Tuesday when a senior commander of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Baha Abu al-Ata, and his wife were killed in an Israeli air strike. The Israeli prime minister said Abu al-Ata was ""responsible for most of the terror attacks in the last year from the Gaza Strip"" and called him a ""ticking bomb"". This video can not be played Gaza militants retaliated with rocket fire - then Israel responded with further air strikes PIJ spokesman Musab al-Buraim said early on Thursday that it had agreed to a ceasefire brokered by Egypt after Israel was ""forced to accept the conditions set by the Palestinian resistance"". Those conditions were to stop ""assassination operations"" and the use of live fire against protesters near the Gaza border fence, and to start implementing steps to end the blockade of Gaza, he added. Life in the Gaza Strip Is peace between Israel and Palestinians out of reach? Israel did not publicly confirm the ceasefire, but Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Army Radio that ""quiet will be answered with quiet"". He also said he considered it a ""matter of success"" that the dominant militant group in Gaza, Hamas, had not been involved in the hostilities. Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan denied any concessions had been made to PIJ, tweeting that the group ""wanted a ceasefire and it received no commitments in exchange"". Palestinian Islamic Jihad said it had forced Israeli to accept conditions for the ceasefire IDF Spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said its operation in Gaza, dubbed ""Black Belt"", had achieved all of its objectives. ""With a combination of military personnel from a variety of units who specialize in SIGINT [signals intelligence], HUMINT [human intelligence], we were able to attack cells and close the circle against targets very quickly. That's what killed 25 terrorists who were in the midst of carrying out hostile activity,"" he added. UN Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov said both the UN and Egypt had ""worked hard to prevent the most dangerous escalation in and around Gaza from leading to war"" and called on all sides to ""show maximum restraint"".

However, five rockets were launched from Gaza about five hours after the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF said. Two were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system. There were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage. In the late afternoon, rocket alert sirens sounded in Israeli communities near the Gaza border and the IDF said another rocket was shot down. Meanwhile, Gaza's health ministry said eight members of the Abu Malhous family, including five children and two women, were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, before dawn on Thursday. The Israeli military said the deadly air strike in Deir al-Balah had targeted a militant commander The ministry said the dead were all civilians. But the IDF insisted that the head of the family, Rasmi Abu Malhous, was a commander of a PIJ rocket-launching unit. ""He was an Islamic Jihad commander and he, like many others, had the tactic of hiding ammunition and military infrastructure in their own residence,"" spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus told AFP news agency. ""Of course we try always to minimise the amount of non-combatants killed or injured."" A neighbour, Mohammed Mazro, disputed the IDF's account. ""They were children, civilians, not militants and they have nothing to do with politics,"" he told AFP. ""They were innocent people, asleep.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Our immigration strategy is based on fairness, justice and the economic needs of our society."" Jeremy Corbyn has refused to say if he wants the number of immigrants coming to the UK to rise or fall. In an interview with the BBC, the Labour leader said people should be ""realistic"" about needing to fill jobs so the economy's needs can be met. He said: ""Putting arbitrary figures on it as successive governments have done simply doesn't work."" The Tories say theywould aim to cut overall immigrationbut will not set targets, if they win the election. BBC home editor Mark Easton said immigration was ""not the electoral issue it once was"", with pollsters saying it is at its lowest level of concern for almost two decades. But he added: ""Some communities remain concerned that foreign arrivals put extra pressure on public services and jobs, and those voters are often in the Labour seats that the Tories are looking to take."" So where do main parties stand on immigration? Will Jeremy Corbyn's long march lead to power- Election translator: Key words explained In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg on a campaign visit to Scotland, Mr Corbyn hinted that Labour would make it easier for families to bring relatives to live in the UK from overseas and for foreign workers to come to the UK . He said Labour's immigration policy was ""based on fairness and justice, and on the economic needs of our society, and they are considerable"". Mr Corbyn added: ""We have to be realistic that in this country we have 40,000 nurse vacancies, we have a great shortage of doctors, we have shortages of many skills, and they cannot be met very quickly because we're not training enough people, so there's going to be immigration in the future."" But asked again whether he wanted the figure to be higher or lower, the Labour leader just said: ""I want our system to be decent, to be fair, and our services to be properly run and properly staffed."" Mr Corbyn said a motion passed at his party's conference, calling for ""freedom of movement"" - the right of EU citizens to live and work in any other EU country - to be maintained and extended after Brexit ""doesn't necessarily form part of the manifesto"". This is despite his shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, tweeting earlier about Labour's ""commitment"" to the pledge. Mr Corbyn said her remarks were specifically about those EU citizens with settled status - people who have lived in the UK for five years, applied to the Home Office, and have been given the right to stay in the country for as long as they like - and to aid the reunion of families. But he added: ""I have made my case very clear about the value of migration to our society, about the stability of people living in our society, about the horrors of the hostile environment created deliberately by Theresa May, and others, and the uncertainty that so many EU nationals have been put through. ""I think that uncertainty should finish, they should have guaranteed rights to remain in Britain."" Mr Corbyn said Labour's eventual policy on immigration would also depend on the outcome of Brexit - with his party promisingto renegotiate a deal with the EU within three months after winning an election and putting it to the public against Remain in a further referendum. He called the plan ""a sensible approach"", adding: ""I recognise why people voted Remain and why people voted Leave in different parts of the country and for different reasons - in my own communities where I represent and also all across the country. ""[But] I think that is actually a sensible approach that a very large number of people [have] come to think, well, at least somebody has been grown-up about this."" Len McCluskey, the leader of the biggest Labour-supporting union, Unite, and a key ally of Mr Corbyn, has called for new employment policies to address concerns about freedom of movement. This video can not be played Unite union leader Len McCluskey: ""Labour is not a Remain party"" Mr McCluskey told the BBC: ""Labour's policy will be to protect all workers - migrant workers as well as British workers. It will be done with labour market regulations. ""It won't stop the free movement of labour. ""It will effectively make certain that greedy bosses, agency companies, are not abusing working people."" Mr McCluskey denied a newspaper report that he had told Jeremy Corbyn to take a tough line on free movement of workers. More than 130 Labour candidates have signed a pledge to campaign to Remain in the EU - which would mean accepting the continuing right of EU citizens to seek work in the UK. But Mr McCluskey stressed that Labour ""is not a Remain"" party and a referendum with a Leave option - ""a fair deal"" - would be offered to voters if Labour wins the election. The Conservatives have said they will end free movement from the EU on 1 January 2021, if they win the election and get their Brexit deal through Parliament by 31 January. The party made its promise to reduce ""immigration overall"" in a press release on Thursday, quoting Home Secretary Priti Patel, and reiterating its plan for a ""points-based"" immigration system, which would apply to EU and non-EU migrants. However, in an interview later in the day, Mrs Patel was asked several times before saying the party would ""look to reduce the numbers"" through better immigration controls. The Conservatives also are expected to ditch their long-standing commitment to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country - to below 100,000, after repeatedly failing to meet it.

"(L-R) Jacob Sporon-Fiedler, Nathan Selcon, Gurjaipal Dhillon and Mohammed Afzal were sentenced at the Old Bailey A group of men who ran an operation worth more than Â£65m distributing illegal steroids have been jailed. Danish national Jacob Sporon-Fiedler ran an Indian pharmaceutical company that supplied four tonnes of anabolic steroids per month to Europe. His gang in the UK included former bodybuilding champion Nathan Selcon who had a Â£1m home in Milton Keynes. Sporon-Fiedler and Selcon admitted conspiring to import steroids at the Old Bailey. Sporon-Fiedler, 38, was jailed for five years and four months. Selcon, 45, was also found guilty of conspiring to manufacture steroids and was sentenced to six years in prison. Three other men were also convicted for their roles: Gurjaipal Dhillon, from Southall, west London, arranged dozens of unlicensed steroid shipments from India to Europe and was found guilty of conspiring to import a class C drug. The 65-year-old was jailed for five years. Mohammed Afzal, 34, from Slough, Berkshire, helped to set up the lab near Heathrow Airport which was used to make own branded drugs. He was found guilty of conspiring to manufacture steroids and was sentenced to two years in prison. Alexander Macgregor, 50, of Maidenhead, Berkshire, owned a corporate logistics company and was found guilty of conspiring to manufacture steroids. He is due to be sentenced at a later date due to illness. Police raided two laboratories connected to the gang The steroids - which were similar to those used by the London Bridge and Westminster terrorists - were said to have been sold to bodybuilders, gym users and possibly professional athletes, the court heard. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it had evidence of at least Â£65m worth of drugs connected to the gang but the true figure could run into the hundreds of millions. An investigation began when 600kg of anabolic steroids were seized at Heathrow in 2014. The NCA raided a laboratory on an industrial estate near Heathrow Airport in March 2015 and discovered packaging for Â£43m worth of steroids. The group was also connected to another lab in Slough which produced about Â£10m worth of steroids before it was raided by Thames Valley Police in 2009. Sentencing the men, Judge Angela Rafferty QC said: ""I am satisfied this was a long-running, sophisticated and well managed operation and no [previous steroid case] is comparable to the scale of this particular conspiracy. This was exceptionally large."" Senior investigator at the NCA David Cunningham said afterwards: ""If Sporon-Fiedler thought he could trade class C illicit anabolic steroids and be beyond the reach of law enforcement, he was wrong.""

"This video can not be played Emotional reunions after the California school shooting Two students, aged 16 and 14, have been killed and three others injured by a gunman who opened fire at a secondary school in California, officials say. The victims died in a brief, 16-second gun attack shortly before classes began on Thursday at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles. The attack came on the 16th birthday of the suspect, named by US media as fellow student, Nathaniel Berhow. The suspect then shot himself in the head and died several hours later. America's gun culture in charts What do US Democrats want to do about guns? No motive has been established so far, with police saying the attacks ""still remains a mystery"". Students and teachers spoke of how they barricaded themselves in classrooms amid chaotic scenes, carrying out an active shooter drill that many schools have implemented in recent years following deadly attacks around the country. It was first reported at 07:38 local time (15:38 GMT) on Thursday, LA county sheriff Alex Villanueva said, adding that police were at the scene within two minutes. This video can not be played LA county sheriff: ""I hate to have Saugus added to Sandy Hook and Columbine"" The suspect was standing in the school courtyard when he took a .45-calibre semi-automatic pistol from his backpack and opened fire for about 16 seconds before turning the gun on himself, Sheriff's Captain Kent Wegener said. ""He just fires from where he is. He doesn't chase anybody. He doesn't move,"" Capt Wegener said. Students barricaded themselves in classrooms under an active shooter drill for more than an hour as police tried to determine if the gunman was still at large. Officers found six people suffering from gunshot wounds and transferred them to local hospitals. The suspect was later identified as one of those injured. The names of those who died have not yet been released. They were a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. The three injured, also as-yet unnamed, were two girls, aged 14 and 15, and a 14-year-old boy. They are all in a stable condition. All attended Saugus High School. The suspect had no known connection to the victims, Capt Wegener said. The attack came on the suspect's 16th birthday. The FBI said it appeared he had acted alone and was not affiliated with any particular group or ideology. The Associated Press quoted a fellow student, Brooke Risley, as saying the suspect was introverted but ""naturally smart"", adding that he had a girlfriend and was a boy scout. AP said the boy lived locally in a modest home, and that his father died two years ago. A neighbour told Reuters the boy had struggled with his father's death. Investigators have searched the home and interviewed the boy's mother and girlfriend. There were no initial indications that he had been bullied at school. There were reports of an Instagram posting saying ""Saugus have fun at school tomorrow"", but it was later revealed the account was not owned by the suspect. One student told NBC she was doing her homework when people started running. ""I was really, really scared. I was shaking,"" she said. This video can not be played Saugus High School students ""barricaded doors"" during shooting Another student, named as Azalea, told CBS she and her classmates had barricaded the classroom door with chairs. ""It was just really scary, having everybody panic and call their parents, saying they love you."" US marks a year since Parkland shooting 2018 'worst year for US school shootings' Teacher Katie Holt told NBC she was huddled in her office with 30 students when a girl ran in saying she had been shot. Ms Holt dressed the injuries as best she could her with her gunshot-wound kit, with a fellow student applying pressure. There were emotional reunions once the lockdown was lifted. Jeff Turner, 58, told the New York Times he found his daughter, Micah, upset and crying. ""She was saying, 'I feel guilty that I didn't stay and help the people who were shot,'"" he said. ""And that was the thing that made me break down in tears."" The school has an unarmed sheriff's deputy and nine ""campus supervisors"" with guard training, district administrator Collyn Nielson told Associated Press. There are a number of security cameras but no metal detectors, and lockdown drills are held three times a year. News of the attack emerged during a Senate debate on gun control legislation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, was arguing for gun control when he was given a note with the news. ""We are complicit if we fail to act,"" he said. ""It is not just a political responsibility, it is a moral imperative."" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement that his department took school shootings ""very seriously"" and would help the authorities ""develop trainings and resources to improve response capabilities and better protect soft targets"". Gun control, and the right to bear arms, is a divisive political issue in the US. About 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one, according to a 2017 survey, and the rate of murder or manslaughter by firearm in the country is the highest in the developed world. According to the Washington Post, more than 230,000 young people in the US have experienced gun violence at school since the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in 1999. The US journal Education Week has been listing school shootings since 2018. It saysthere have been 22 incidents that have resulted in death or injury so far in 2019,external. There were 24 such incidents last year, it says, but the casualty toll was higher, at 114. That includes the 17 people killed in the deadliest incident -at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine's Day. The Everytown gun control advocacy group,external, using separate methodology, said Saugus was the 85th incident of gunfire at a school this year, but that includes those where there were no casualties.

"Nicola Sturgeon has predicted Jeremy Corbyn will soon back her call for a Scottish independence vote in 2020. The SNP leader was responding to further confusion over Mr Corbyn's position on a second Scottish independence referendum. The Labour leader said on Thursday that indyref2 would not happen in the first two years of his party winning power. The previous day, he initially told journalists that a referendum would not happen in the first five-year term. But just hours later,he clarified that a referendum would not be held in the ""early years""of a Labour government, with the party's focus instead being on ""massive investment"" in Scotland. Mr Corbyn and Scottish Labour have said they will campaign against independence if the issue is put to another referendum. But a Scottish Labour candidate in a key target seat for the party ahead of the general election told BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley that the ""mixed messaging"" from Mr Corbyn on the issue was a ""disaster"" for the party. And Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""Yesterday it was 'not in the first term'. Today, it's 'not in the first two years'. By the end of the week, at this rate, Corbyn will be demanding #indyref2020"".

The prospect of a second vote on independence and Brexit was discussed atfirst minister's questions, with the Conservatives also raising questions about the timing of a vote. Nicola Sturgeon has said she will request a transfer of power from Westminster by the end of this year, with the goal of holding a referendum in the second half of 2020. But the first minister has also given her support to having another referendum on Brexit next year. If Labour wins power, it has committed to renegotiating the Brexit deal with the EU, before putting this ""credible Leave option"" to the public in a fresh vote, up against Remain. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his wife Laura Alvarez (wearing hat) with Labour activists while canvassing in Glasgow on Wednesday evening Interim Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw asked Ms Sturgeon which vote would come first, saying he was ""not sure the first minister has thought through her big double referendum promise"". He said: ""When is all this supposed to happen? Both referendums on the one day, or different days? Which vote would come first - indyref, euroref - which?"" Ms Sturgeon replied: ""My priority - and I can't believe Jackson Carlaw hasn't actually cottoned on to this yet - my priority is to give the people of Scotland the opportunity to choose independence next year and I look forward to delivering on that."" This led Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie to say Ms Sturgeon had ""abandoned Remain voters across the UK"", saying this was ""hugely disappointing"". He said: ""If you are a Remainer in Scotland, you should know that the SNP will twist every vote into an endorsement of independence. Her party will always put independence ahead of anything else."" This evening Jeremy Corbyn will wrap up his trip to Scotland with a rally in Edinburgh. Labour are expecting hundreds of supporters to turn up. Winning seats in Scotland could be crucial to Mr Corbyn's hopes of getting into Number Ten, but long gone are the days when Labour could rely on definitely returning a healthy number of Scottish MPs. Despite recent disasters at the polls - including coming FIFTH in the European elections in Scotland - a number of candidates I've spoken to are upbeat and say they're getting decent reception from voters. But this trip has not gone according to plan for Mr Corbyn. He has - not for the first time - been unclear about Labour's position on a second independence referendum. Yesterday, he said he wouldn't allow for in his first term (5 years). He then said in the ""formative years"" of a Labour government. This morning he suggested not in the first two years. This might all sound a bit like splitting hairs, but some candidates here are worried that not being clear on independence is harming their chances of winning votes from unionists, who helped the party do well in 2017. One candidate told me earlier Mr Corbyn's comments had been a ""bloody disaster"". The fear is those who oppose independence will side with the Conservatives or the Lib Dems- while independence supporters will vote SNP. There's another school of thought though. The leadership in Scotland doesn't think independence will be a key issue on 12 December. They're confident that - over the next month - their focus on ending austerity, investing in the economy and climate change will cut through. Mr Corbyn said this morning in Midlothian that voters make their decision based on a number of issues. Some in Scottish Labour are desperately hoping independence isn't the main one.

About 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one, according to a 2017 survey, and the rate of murder or manslaughter by firearm in the country is the highest in the developed world. According to the Washington Post, more than 230,000 young people in the US have experienced gun violence at school since the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in 1999. The US journal Education Week has been listing school shootings since 2018. It saysthere have been 22 incidents that have resulted in death or injury so far in 2019,external. There were 24 such incidents last year, it says, but the casualty toll was higher, at 114. That includes the 17 people killed in the deadliest incident -at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine's Day. The Everytown gun control advocacy group,external, using separate methodology, said Saugus was the 85th incident of gunfire at a school this year, but that includes those where there were no casualties.

"Zipporah Kuria: ""They've robbed us of our closure"" Zipporah Kuria was fighting back tears. Eight months after the Boeing 737 Max crash that killed Ms Kuria's father, Joseph Waithaka, the site of impact was covered on Thursday and unidentified remains of the victims were buried in rows of identical coffins. But Ms Kuria wasn't there. Officials from Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are believed to have attended a ceremony at the site, but because of the short notice Ms Kuria and other relatives of the dead were unable to attend. Family members of three separate victims told the BBC they were only notified of the ceremony days ago. As a result, only relatives of two of the 157 victims attended. ""It is absurd. It makes me shudder that Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are at my father's funeral and I'm not,"" Ms Kuria said. What went wrong in the 737 Max cockpit? Boeing accused of building 'flying coffins' The crash happened in a rural area to the south-east of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It left behind a deep crater which until this week still contained accident debris and some human remains. Families of those killed say they were left horrified after they visited the site last month and found that recent rains had uncovered bones and other items. Some, they said, were floating in flood water in the crater. Rows of coffins were placed neatly in the crater Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 was lost minutes after take-off on what should have been a routine flight from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital Nairobi on 10 March. It came down in farmland, in a deeply rural area. In the immediate aftermath, those human remains that could be found were removed, along with the plane's flight recorders and large items of wreckage. The crash is believed to have occurred after a flight control system known as MCAS deployed at the wrong time, forcing the nose of the aircraft down when the pilots were trying to gain height. A similar malfunction has been blamed for the loss of a near-identical 737 Max in Indonesia a year ago. The aircraft has been grounded for the past nine months, banned from flying by aviation authorities around the world. 157 people died when Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed The violence of the impact of the Ethiopian Airlines flight meant that when my colleagues and I visited the site in May, there was still a great deal of smaller debris lying in the fields. The deep impact crater itself remained, alongside huge mounds of earth from the recovery operation, with a rough wooden fence the only barrier to access. Animals were able to roam freely across the site. There were no guards and no official presence. After that, the victims' relatives say, the situation worsened as a result of seasonal rains. They have been demanding action. Samya Rose Stumo was 24 years old and was on board ET302 Nadia Millieron, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died in the crash, recently told the BBC: ""There were bones being revealed all the time and local people are coming to the site and covering them. We want Ethiopian Airlines to move the piles of earth into the crater, take the unidentifiable remains into the crater and to cover everything"". Ethiopian Airlines, which is managing the site, told victims' families it was aware of the issue, but claimed insurance issues had prevented it from taking action. But after coming under pressure from the relatives, and following an investigation by the BBC, it appears those difficulties have now been overcome. On Thursday, rows of coffins were placed neatly in the crater. These contained remains that had previously been removed for forensic analysis, but which could not be identified due to contamination. Then they were covered over and the crater itself was filled, the dark earth matching the surrounding fields. The site is now a permanent grave. 'My entire family died in 737 Max crash' Boeing 'doesn't understand our grief' Relatives of the victims believe Ethiopian Airlines had a duty to keep them informed about the burial and should have given them more notice. The BBC has approached the carrier for a comment. Boeing has refused to comment on reports that one of its senior executives, Jennifer Lowe, was among those present. The company said in a statement: ""We continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 and we are committed to helping those affected by these tragedies."" Last month, Ms Kuria travelled with her family to Ethiopia to collect and bring home some of her father's remains. She said it was ""heartbreaking"" that she was unable to get to the site in time for the covering of the site. ""My dad is being buried, well most of him, as we only received a small amount of him back,"" she said. She said she would have jumped on a flight if it had been possible. ""They've robbed us of our closure,"" she said.

" by Iain Watson Jeremy Corbyn was speaking to me just before going on stage to deliver his 87th speech of the 2015 Labour leadership campaign. His credo didn’t sound like that of a Stalinist or Trotskyist - terms used in much of the tabloid press to describe, or indeed denounce, him. But this wasn’t a speech to a local Labour Party, or an anti-war rally, or the Durham Miners’ Gala. The venue was deep inside what many would have assumed to be “enemy” territory - a theatre in Chelmsford (Conservative majority at the time: 18,250) and it was filled to capacity. Jeremy Corbyn had acquired Essex appeal. He didn’t have style. He wasn’t a great orator. He didn’t - on stage at least - demonstrate humour. But he had something. Possibly it was political conviction, combined with a lack of slickness that had attracted both converts and the curious. Perhaps he’d caught the zeitgeist - in an era of political disillusionment, lack of experience was seen as a positive asset. He had never been a government minister, he had never been a shadow minister. Corbyn was someone barely known outside left-wing politics. The journey from relative obscurity to Corbynmania had been as swift as it was unexpected. Under recently changed party rules, contenders required the support of 35 MPs to get on the Labour leadership ballot. Corbyn had cleared this threshold just one minute and 45 seconds before nominations closed at midday on 15 June. Fewer than half of the MPs backing him were actual supporters from Labour’s left. The rest were MPs who - following Labour’s unexpectedly bad election defeat - wanted the fullest possible debate on the party’s future and “lent” support. Not much thought had been put into which MP should be the left’s leadership candidate, according to Corbyn. “We decided somebody should put their hat in the ring. And, unfortunately, it’s my hat in the ring,”he told the Guardian. “Well, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell have done it before, so it was my turn.” Although he had stumbled into the contest, the subsequent campaign was professionally organised. As a result of reforms by the previous leader Ed Miliband, voting was open not just to party members but also registered supporters. Those to the left of Labour were encouraged through social media campaigns to sign up. Some who had abandoned the party during the Blair years returned. Members and former members of the Green Party seemed to be particularly enthused. And some people who simply hadn’t been involved in politics were engaged by Corbyn’s distinctive anti-austerity message. September 2015: Corbyn supporters awaiting the Labour leadership election result outside Parliament September 2015: Corbyn supporters awaiting the Labour leadership election result outside Parliament His campaign was given rocket boosters when he not only opposed the Conservative government’s welfare cuts, but rebelled against his own party’s interim leadership, who wanted to abstain. The extent of Corbyn’s appeal may have surprised many of his fellow Labour MPs, but the potential reservoir of support had been built up over many years of activism. While still at grammar school in Shropshire, Corbyn had founded the Wrekin Young Socialists, and had produced a magazine and organised protests against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War. It was an ideal pedigree for someone who would go on to form the Stop the War coalition in 2001. This was set up to oppose intervention in Afghanistan after 9/11, but it came into its own in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. One protest in central London attracted as many as 750,000 people, according to police estimates (the organisers said it was even bigger), with demonstrators drawn from many political parties. Stop the War’s website in 2015 rather astutely publicised a link to register as a Labour supporter and vote for Corbyn. It accompanied this with a helpful guide entitled “How to vote for Jeremy as leader” and called for his “strong alternative voice to war and austerity” to get a hearing. He paid them back when he apologised, as party leader, for the previous Labour government’s support for the Iraq war. September 2015: Jeremy Corbyn becomes Labour leader September 2015: Jeremy Corbyn becomes Labour leader Corbyn’s trade union background also stood him in good stead. A former official for the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers, and then the public service union NUPE (now Unison) in the 70s, Corbyn was perfectly content to accept trade union funding for his campaign - though mostly from Unite, under the left-wing leadership of Len McCluskey, who was to be an important ally in the years to come. On 12 September 2015, Corbyn was elected as Labour’s leader, gaining more votes than his three rivals - ex-ministers Burnham and Yvette Cooper, and former shadow minister Liz Kendall - put together.

On 12 September 2015, Corbyn was elected as Labour’s leader, gaining more votes than his three rivals - ex-ministers Burnham and Yvette Cooper, and former shadow minister Liz Kendall - put together. The 1980s may be remembered as the Thatcher era, but for much of the decade, London was run by radical left-wing politicians intent on confronting the Conservative government wherever they could. Ken Livingstone ran the GLC from 1981 until its abolition in 1986, and in Islington the red flag flew over the town hall. Jeremy Corbyn was very much part of this era. He was elected as a Labour councillor in the London borough of Haringey in 1974, where he chaired the council’s planning committee. The former council leader Toby (now Lord) Harris says, “I have known him for more than 40 years and his political position has hardly shifted.” 1975: Jeremy Corbyn (left), then a Haringey borough councillor, with colleague Les Silverstone 1975: Jeremy Corbyn (left), then a Haringey borough councillor, with colleague Les Silverstone Corbyn takes issue with those who say that he is still in some ways the local councillor and campaigner who is immersed in politics at the expense of all else. His first wife Jane Chapman - who was also a Labour councillor - seemed to think that he spent more time in meetings than he spent with her. The couple broke up in 1979. Afterwards,she told the Daily Mail: “We didn’t do things that I liked such as going to the cinema or to clubs. I wanted a different work-life balance.” Leader profiles: Boris Johnson Jo Swinson Nicola Sturgeon Nigel Farage He had already become a vegetarian. Chapman commented that “he showed little interest in food” and would happily eat baked beans straight from the can. In other words, this anti-austerity campaigner led a life which was, well, austere. He himself describes his lifestyle as “frugal”. “He was very passionate in opposing public sector cuts,” says Harris (at that time, cuts by the 1974-79 Labour government). But Corbyn’s political interests were always global as well as local.  He adds: “He feels passionate about national liberation struggles.” In this, he was following the Corbyn family pattern. His parents Naomi and David met at a gathering in London in the 30s to oppose Franco’s attempt to seize power in Spain. 1984: The newly-elected member for Islington North 1984: The newly-elected member for Islington North Before standing for elected office, the young Corbyn undertook voluntary work overseas, spending two years as a youth worker in Jamaica in the late 60s. He has also travelled extensively in Latin America. “I have got very few qualifications,” he once told me (he dropped out of North London Polytechnic), “but I have a fascination of reading, and read a lot.” He became an MP for Islington North, a seat which borders Haringey, in the general election of 1983. He was the beneficiary of a Labour Party split - the sitting MP had defected to the newly formed SDP, creating a vacancy. Although he won the seat, the party went down to a disastrous defeat nationally on a manifesto that championed some of Corbyn’s thencauses celebres- among them, withdrawal from the EU and the abolition of nuclear weapons. For the next three decades, he tended to come to prominence usually for campaigning on issues close to his heart - opposing the apartheid regime in South Africa, and the authoritarian regime of Augusto Pinochet, the military leader who ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990. Corbyn’s second wife Claudia Bracchitta had fled Chile, aged 11, with her parents, following the brutal coup that ousted the democratically elected left-wing government of Salvador Allende. Support for Pinochet from elements in the US administration fuelled Corbyn's distrust of American intervention around the world - a distrust that has never been dispelled. While some of Corbyn’s campaigns endeared him to sections of the left, they also helped keep him on the backbenches. And some causes he supported were far more controversial within Labour’s ranks, never mind with the wider public. While he gained respect - after initial scepticism - for championing the cause of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six, wrongly convicted of terrorist offences, Corbyn’s wider support for Irish unity was more problematic. He fell foul of the then Labour leader Neil Kinnock when he invited two Irish Republican former prisoners - who had not been wrongfully convicted - to the House of Commons in 1984. This was just weeks after the IRA had bombed Brighton’s Grand Hotel during the Conservative conference - coming close to killing Margaret Thatcher. Then, as now, he portrayed himself as a pioneer of the peace process. Kinnock was not the only Labour leader that Corbyn would displease. He rebelled against Tony Blair’s government 533 times – and even voted against his party quite frequently under Ed Miliband’s more left-wing leadership. In 2009 at a Palestine Solidarity meeting he referred to “our friends from Hezbollah” and “our friends from Hamas”. His defence, when criticised, was similar to his stated reasons for meeting Irish republicans. He told Channel 4 News that “to bring about a peace process, you have to talk to people with whom you profoundly disagree”. Initially, that also appeared to be his approach to leading Labour. In 2015, the newly elected Labour leader found himself in a strange position. He was popular among new party members and supporters, but not among most of his fellow MPs. To many of them, Jeremy Corbyn looked both too weak and too radical for the electorate. The party was behind in the polls and a defeat worse than that suffered by Michael Foot in 1983, appeared to beckon. Some wouldn’t serve in his shadow cabinet, but Corbyn did try to reach out at first. Leadership challenger Andy Burnham became shadow home secretary. Angela Eagle, who would later launch an abortive attempt to oust him, served initially at his top table. Hilary Benn (left) was removed as shadow foreign secretary following a public disagreement over Syrian air strikes Hilary Benn (left) was removed as shadow foreign secretary following a public disagreement over Syrian air strikes Tensions were not long in arising. Three months after Corbyn became leader, the government decided to extend bombing raids to Syria. The Labour leader was furious when the shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn publicly sided with the Conservatives in backing air strikes. It symbolised a gap - soon to become a chasm - between the party in Parliament and the wider membership which backed Corbyn. Matters came to a head in the wake of the 2016 European referendum. Labour MPs said the leader’s lack of enthusiasm for the Remain campaign had contributed to its defeat. A plot to oust Corbyn - not, as it turned out, a very well-developed one - had been discussed before the referendum and was put into action soon after. Eight out of 10 of Corbyn’s parliamentary colleagues voted no confidence in him and leading figures in his shadow cabinet resigned. I am told Corbyn himself was close to resignation at one point but, according to his former chief of staff Katy Clark, he felt he would be letting down the members who had placed their trust in him. His trade union ally Len McCluskey declined to broker a deal that would have seen Corbyn agree to stand down ahead of the next scheduled election in 2020. June 2016: Momentum holds a ""Keep Corbyn"" rally outside Parliament, following calls for the Labour leader's resignation June 2016: Momentum holds a ""Keep Corbyn"" rally outside Parliament, following calls for the Labour leader's resignation It was about this time that the grassroots movement Momentum started to flourish. Set up by veteran left winger Jon Lansman, and Corbyn’s closest political ally, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, it aimed to harness the spirit of the leadership campaign in order to prepare for, and defend, a future left-wing government. “From the beginning we expected people to resist, and when they did we were prepared,” says Lansman. Momentum’s membership rose from about 2,000 before what he terms “the coup”, to 20,000. It has since doubled its membership again. And while Corbyn was seen as - at best - a mundane parliamentary performer by some long-standing MPs, the challenge to his leadership gave him back his mojo. He did what he did best - addressing rallies of supporters, and campaigning around the country. Research from the ESRC party members projectshowed that most of those who had joined Labour before 2015 backed the leadership challenger Owen Smith - but most newer members, attracted by Corbyn’s message, remained steadfastly loyal. Corbyn’s second leadership victory was won comfortably, and led to a shadow cabinet not exactly in his image, but much closer to his own politics. Grassroots members, outraged at the leadership challenge, also voted for a ruling national executive that shared Corbyn’s outlook. When Theresa May called a general election in 2017, many (though not all) pollsters underestimated Labour’s position (including the company employed by the party’s head office). Poor local election results seemed to presage a disaster. So much so that not one but two putative leadership campaigns began to form. His well-attended rallies in marginal seats were initially dismissed as displacement activity and preaching to the converted. But May often proved awkward and stilted on the campaign trail, while Corbyn revelled in his appearances on the stump. He astounded many on his own side by taking Labour to a 40% vote share in the 2017 election. Standing outside Labour’s HQ, reporting on the result, I spoke to one of the strategists who emerged smiling from the anonymous building. “How did you do that?” I asked. “No idea,” he said. “We did a lot on social media in the closing stages but I had no clue if it was being effective.” Corbyn had gained the highest number of votes for Labour since 1997 (although Tony Blair had won a landslide, while Corbyn went down to defeat) and the party’s biggest increase in vote share since the post-war landslide. Corbyn believes this relative success of the 2017 campaign had much to do with a  manifesto that was distinctly different not just from the Conservatives, but from New Labour, whose brave new dawn ended in the twilight of the 2008 financial crash. It had at its heart higher taxation for the better-off and a plan to bring the railways - along with the water industry in England - back into public ownership. The 2017 election result also had much to do with keeping both longstanding and newer, more left-wing supporters, on board - a task made easier by a poor Conservative campaign and a weak Lib Dem alternative. The sometimes dismissive tone towards Corbyn in the press was revised and far fewer people laughed at the idea that he could one day be prime minister. In the immediate aftermath of the election his personal ratings - which have since slumped - were far more positive than May’s He was lauded by festival goers at Glastonbury where he delivered a speech from the main Pyramid Stage - once the preserve of rock royalty. “The commentariat got it wrong,” he told the crowd. “The elite got it wrong. Politics is about the lives of all of us, and the wonderful campaign that I was involved with, that I was so proud to lead, brought people back into politics because they believed there was something on offer for them.” At Glastonbury, and throughout the summer of 2017, the chant of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” (to the tune of the White Stripes hit, “Seven Nation Army”) seemed ubiquitous. Indeed later that year his deputy Tom Watson - a regular Glastonbury attendee, with whom Corbyn has had a strained relationship - led a chorus from the stage at Labour’s annual conference. But the price of apparent popularity is scrutiny. Corbyn’s second period of leadership has not been entirely sure-footed.  One of Jeremy Corbyn’s close colleagues puts it like this: “You have to understand that Jeremy does move on issues, but he moves very slowly.” In an era of fast-moving media, some question whether Corbyn is flexible enough to change his position - especially when it becomes all but untenable - or whether he has the judgement to inoculate himself against issues that have become toxic. Corbyn has made it clear on many occasions that he opposes “anti-Semitism and all forms of racism”. Yet he remains accused by some in his own party of doing too little, too late when it comes to tackling anti-Semitism. His leadership victory brought in some activists who had been in parties to the left of Labour, as well as some former activists that had left over Iraq. Corbyn takes the same line as his mentor, the late Tony Benn, that “there are no enemies on the left”. He opposed Neil Kinnock’s expulsion of Militant activists in the 80s, along with many on Labour’s left who termed it a “witch hunt”. However, Militant wasn’t just a grouping of left-wing Labour supporters. It was a front for the Revolutionary Socialist League - a Trotskyite group that sought to infiltrate a non-revolutionary, democratic socialist party. So it could be argued that in Labour’s broad church, Corbyn has always been happy to keep an open door to its left. And the recent arrival, or re-entry, of some on the left who had been critical of Israeli governments and Western policy in the Middle East, seems to have coincided with an increase in allegations of anti-Semitism. Although the overall number of cases is still relatively small, the political impact has been big. Following the attempt to oust him in 2016, Some of Corbyn’s supporters became more raucous on social media. Insiders say these self-styled cheerleaders did him no favours by claiming that the issue was essentially anti-Corbyn propaganda, when party officials had uncovered examples of anti-Semitism among some of his self-declared supporters. One poll, by YouGov for the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, suggested more than eight  out of 10 Jewish voters believed that Labour was too tolerant of anti-Semitism, and tainting the brand of an anti-racist party, in the view of many of its MPs. Whether this perception is fair, the anti-Semitism row raised questions about Corbyn’s own leadership abilities. July 2018: Jewish community groups protest outside Parliament against the Labour Party's response to anti-Semitism allegations July 2018: Jewish community groups protest outside Parliament against the Labour Party's response to anti-Semitism allegations His support for attempts to add caveats to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism, insisting that free speech on Israel should be protected when deciding whether party members would be disciplined, caused friction even within the left of the party. Corbyn’s judgement was also called into question when it was revealed that in 2012, he had defended a mural depicting bankers playing what appeared to be Monopoly on the backs of the poor. Many saw it as a classic anti-Semitic trope, including the then Labour (now Lib Dem) MP Luciana Berger, who brought it to wider attention. Corbyn was forced on the defensive, saying he should have looked more closely at the image. Party processes in dealing with complaints of anti-Semitism have been speeded up. His supporters point out that he didn’t halt the expulsion of long-standing ally Ken Livingstone, or try to prevent another close colleague, the Derby MP Chris Williamson, from being disciplined for saying that Labour had “given too much ground” on the issue. But Labour is now being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The well-publicised allegations have already hit Corbyn hard politically - gnawing away at trust, advertising internal divisions, and making his claim to the moral high ground less firm. Lord Harris may consider that Corbyn’s views have remained rigid, but his position on other matters has certainly become more flexible - for instance, unilateral nuclear disarmament, an issue on which he campaigned in 1983. Many of Corbyn’s trade union backers had wanted him to maintain and renew the deterrent, and the party’s policy of multilateral not unilateral nuclear disarmament has remained the same. However, that doesn’t mean he has accepted the concept of deterrence. At his first party conference as leader in 2015, he made it clear that he would never press the nuclear button. On the issue of Brexit, Corbyn has also shown flexibility. There is a good reason for this. During the failed 2016 leadership challenge, the members were on his side against the parliamentarians. On Brexit, the grass roots were more in step with MPs - pro-Remain, and in favour of a second referendum. Corbyn’s own views seem to have evolved - accommodating, if not embracing, the aspirations of some of the newer, younger pro-EU members. But his critics say that he should have led from the front. He opposed membership of the then-EEC at the 1975 referendum and happily stood on the 1983 Labour manifesto calling for withdrawal. Like Benn, he has been suspicious of an organisation where he believes unelected Brussels bureaucrats have huge influence - including initiating legislation. Corbyn's views on Europe are thought to echo those of his political ally, the late Tony Benn (pictured here in 2009) Corbyn's views on Europe are thought to echo those of his political ally, the late Tony Benn (pictured here in 2009) In the 2016 referendum, he addressed plenty of meetings for the Remain cause, but pro-EU MPs sensed a lack of gusto. As one MP said to me at the time, “He is far more interested in food banks than euro federalism”. A prominent Momentum member said he believed Corbyn hoped initially to “get Brexit out of the way, and move on to issues that really mattered”. Interviewed on a Channel 4 show during the referendum campaign, he himself put his enthusiasm for EU membership at “the top half of the five-10 range; seven, maybe seven-and-a-half out of 10”. He was then swift - some thought a little too swift - to say he would respect the result of the referendum. He tried to negotiate a Leave deal in the dying days of the May premiership, but this was subsequently abandoned - apparently amid fears that she could not deliver enough of her own MPs in support of it. But he changed position again - offering a new referendum with Remain on the ballot paper if there had been a Labour government. He wanted to negotiate what he called a “credible Leave option” to give voters a choice. But what is interesting is that he shifted not because of pressure applied by those who almost always criticise him. Key voices on the left grew louder in calling for a clearer Remain stance, especially after disastrous European election results in May 2019. These included John McDonnell, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, and shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis. But for some on the left, he was too stubborn. He wouldn't make Labour an avowedly Remain party. I was told that was a red line he would not cross. Others think that while he has shown flexibility, he hasn’t shown agility. Even some of his own inner circle feel he should have displayed more clarity during the European election campaign. Corbyn wouldn't say if he would adopt a neutral stance between Leave and Remain in a Labour-instigated referendum, if he had made it to 10 Downing St. That would have been decided in due course at a special conference. Crueller critics say he was sitting on the fence over whether he’ll sit on the fence. So doubts remained over whether he would have been nimble enough to react to the public and the party’s mood in No 10.

So doubts remained over whether he would have been nimble enough to react to the public and the party’s mood in No 10. Pre-arrange an interview with Jeremy Corbyn, and he is far more engaging, disarming - even charming - than you might imagine. He’ll sometimes tell you about a book he has been reading. He will occasionally poke gentle fun at his internal opponents. He once told me his 2016 leadership challenger Owen Smith offered him the post of party president if he’d stand aside. He then said in hushed tones, with a glint in his eye: “Of course I found out this post didn’t actually exist.” He once took me through the history of a building society advertised in a hoarding behind him, as he warmed up for an interview on the campaign trail. And recently, he gave a colleague his top holiday tips for a visit to Mexico (his third wife, Laura Alvarez – whom he married in 2012 – is Mexican). But often he is more thin-skinned, resenting in particular those who try to get an unauthorised word from him outside his front door. He is fiercely protective of his privacy and that of his family. He would say he is open to scrutiny, but that he draws the line at intrusion. In his acceptance speech as party leader in 2015, Corbyn denounced the “appalling levels of abuse” that members of his family suffered during the campaign and he appealed to reporters to “leave them alone in all circumstances”. And there are circumstances where Corbyn himself would like to be left alone. He once chided Channel 4’s Cathy Newman and myself for talking over each other as we fired off questions to him. Martyn Sloman - a member of Islington Labour in the 1980s - told me Corbyn behaved much the same way to party members as to the press. He was never rude or aggressive, says Sloman, but he didn’t like being challenged: “That was his weakness. He didn’t like criticism at all. He bridled at it.” And some said his thin skin would need to transform into a rhino hide if he were to go from opposition leader to prime minister. But did he really want the job? Or was he - as some critics suggest - more interested in moving Labour permanently to the left? Lansman said that the Corbyn leadership had changed Labour irrevocably. “We are never going back to neo-liberalism,” he says. “That’s been decided forever - well, for a generation. The party is a fundamentally different party and there is no going back.” And it’s certainly true that the party has changed rapidly under Corbyn’s leadership. Before the election, the levers of power in the party were controlled by his supporters. If he was willing to be as ruthless, and as determined in the face of adversity, his backers believed he could lead a radical government. But before becoming Labour leader, his appetite for power seemed to be rather limited. In his Guardian interview in 2015 – when he got on the leadership ballot but before he won the contest – he said: “At my age I’m not likely to be a long-term contender, am I?” He often sidestepped the direct question. Soon after becoming Labour leader, Corbyn chose to answer the question in this way: “The best type of leader is a reluctant leader.” He certainly reflected long and hard when most of his MPs wanted to oust him in 2016, but he didn’t resign. He has resilience. And he has made it clear that despite speculation he would have served a full term as prime minister if elected. Some detractors questioned how far he would have been in charge if elected. They pointed to the influence wielded by advisers, such as former political commentator turned strategist Seumas Milne,  and Andrew Murray, a veteran of the Stop the War coalition. But this was dismissed by one insider, who said there is a myth of “the good king and the bad advisers” - they insist that Jeremy Corbyn knows his own mind and his staff reflect rather than mould his views. There is a belief in his inner circle that “dark forces in the Establishment” would do whatever they could to stop him entering Downing Street. There was a call for an investigation when the Times, in June, alleged that senior civil servants had questioned his physical fitness for office. McDonnell, however, claimed that Labour’s leader was the “fittest person I know”. But some opponents may have been closer to home. Momentum has supported his leadership but has at times also shown its independence. I’m told that its founder, Jon Lansman, hopes that John McDonnell will become the next party leader. ButMcDonnell himself recently told GQ magazinethat the next leader should be a woman. What is remarkable is that, on the brink of an election, in the bars, cafes and corridors at Labour’s recent conference, there was widespread speculation over who should be Corbyn’s replacement. I was even told of aputschthat never really quite came to shove. In July this year, leading Labour peers took out a newspaper advert arguing that Jeremy Corbyn “had failed the test of leadership”. It was dismissed at the time as the predictable opposition of those ennobled by Corbyn’s predecessors. But the initiative didn’t come out of the blue. It was designed to give impetus to some on the left who were trying to sound out shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey as a replacement. Any potential plot quickly evaporated, but those mulling over whether or how to proceed  wanted to clear out some of the key figures in the leader’s office too - and that part of the plan now seems to have come to fruition. Corbyn’s robust gatekeeper Karie Murphy - a close friend and ally of Unite’s Len McCluskey - was moved aside to a role in the party’s head office. Some of the Labour leader’s supporters believed that a move to drain his authority was under way. Corbyn’s position has also been weakened by the announced departure of Andrew Fisher - his policy guru who managed to be close both to the Labour leader and the shadow chancellor. In a letter to friends -seen initially by the Sunday Timesand subsequently by the BBC -  he denounces “a lack of professionalism and competence” in the backroom operation. He says that, while he hopes he is proved wrong, “I no longer have faith that we can succeed”. But there is no full frontal assault and it’s still likely Corbyn himself will choose when and how to go - though McDonnell has said this would only happen in the event of another election defeat. But his continuing supporters insist Jeremy Corbyn is here for the long haul. He is both fit and willing to take Labour to power. His pitch at his annual conference was that he could  bring a “different type of leadership” to politics. And his supporters would insist that after the divisions of the Brexit debate, it’s this serial rebel who is best placed to unite the country. His current catchphrase is “trust the people”. We won’t have to wait long to find out if they are willing to trust him. Pre-arrange an interview with Jeremy Corbyn, and he is far more engaging, disarming - even charming - than you might imagine.

"Hospital performance in England is at its worst level on record, data shows. Key targets for cancer, hospital care and A&E have been missed for over three years - with delays for hospital care and in A&E hitting their highest levels since both targets were introduced. The monthly figures - the last before the election - prompted Labour and the Liberal Democrats to attack the Tories' record on the NHS. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""huge demand"" was to blame. He said only the Tories could be trusted to have a ""strong, dynamic economy"" to ensure the rises in the NHS budget being planned could be made. ""I'm afraid when I look at the rival proposals and the economic disaster that Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party would cause, that will make it impossible for us in the long term to fund the NHS."" But Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the performance figures were ""disgusting"" and a lack of staff and funding was to blame. And Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said the Tories had a ""shameful"" record. Is the NHS facing unprecedented demand? All the parties are proposing to increase the NHS budget. The government announced a five-year funding plan last year, which would see the front-line budget rise by 3.4% a year up to 2023. On Wednesday, Labour said it would spend more - 3.9% extra a year. The Lib Dems are proposing to use a penny rise in income tax to invest extra in social care, mental health and public health. Demand for all services is rising and the NHS is still managing to see the over-whelming majority in time. But performance has been deteriorating for a number of years - and is now well below what it should be. The figures show: 4.42 million patients on the waiting list at the end of September, the highest number ever 84.8% of them waiting under 18 weeks - below the 92% target and the worst performance since the target was introduced, in 2012 76.9% of cancer patients starting treatment within 62 days - below the 85% target 83.6% of A&E patients admitted or transferred within four hours in October - below the 95% target and the worst performance since the target started was introduced, in 2004 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also missing their targets, although health is devolved so NHS decisions are taken by the administrations in those parts of the UK. How well does the NHS spend its money? 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail Frances Reid, 55, is one of many patients to have faced a long wait. She said she was left in ""excruciating"" pain waiting for a hip replacement. Ms Reid, from South Cambridgeshire, was referred for surgery in January 2018, after struggling for the previous two years with hip pain. She should have been seen in April 2018, but waited until July for her surgery. The NHS ended up paying for her to be treated at a private unit because of the wait. ""The final weeks were really difficult,"" she says. ""I was waking up six, seven times a night and had to use walking sticks to get around. ""Daily tasks like shopping became very difficult."" Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society of Acute Medicine, said: ""These figures are truly worrying as we haven't even reached the 'traditional' winter period yet."" He said urgent action was needed, warning the system was ""imploding"". British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the NHS was facing a ""catastrophe"". ""This is completely unfair for patients and staff."" But Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, tweeted senior staff should be more careful with the language they used, criticising the use of imploding in particular. However, he admitted he was worried about the ""huge pressure"" on the system at this point before the full onset of winter. NHS England conceded hospitals were under pressure, seeing ""more older and sicker patients"". A spokesman said, with winter coming, hospitals would be opening extra beds. But he urged the public to play their part by getting the flu jab and using the 111 phone line and NHS online services ""as first port of call for non-emergencies"".

"This video can not be played Labour's John McDonnell pledged ""free broadband for the country"" if the party gets elected Labour has promised to give every home and business in the UK free full-fibre broadband by 2030, if it wins the general election. The party would nationalise part of BT to deliver the policy and introduce a tax on tech giants to help pay for it. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC the ""visionary"" Â£20bn plan would ""ensure that broadband reaches the whole of the country"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""a crackpot scheme"". The plan includes nationalising parts of BT - namely its digital network arm Openreach - to create a UK-wide network owned by the government. Mr McDonnell said the roll-out would begin with communities that have the worst broadband access, followed by towns and smaller centres, and then by areas that are currently well served. LIVE: Latest from the election campaign trail Will fibre broadband be obsolete by 2030? Conservatives' Â£5bn plan for full fibre - does it add up? A really simple guide to the UK general election What are nationalisation and privatisation? A Labour government would compensate shareholders by issuing government bonds. The shadow chancellor said Labour had taken legal advice, including ensuring pension funds with investments in BT are not left out of pocket. As with other planned Labour nationalisations, he said MPs would set the value of the company at the time of it being taken into public ownership. Mr McDonnell told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Labour would add an extra Â£15bn to the government's existing Â£5bn broadband strategy, with the money to come from the party's proposed Green Transformation Fund. Having already announced plans to nationalise water, rail and now broadband, Mr McDonnell said this latest plan was ""the limit of our ambitions"". A new entity, British Broadband, would run the network, with maintenance - estimated to cost Â£230m a year - to be covered by the new tax on companies such as Apple and Google. ""We think they should pay their way and other countries are following suit,"" said Mr McDonnell. Labour has not yet completed the final details of how the internet giant tax would work, saying it would be based ""percentage wise'' on global profits and UK sales, raising potentially as much as Â£6bn. Mr McDonnell said that if other broadband providers did not want to give access to British Broadband, then they would also be taken into public ownership. Labour has costed its policy from a report produced byFrontier Economics in 2018,external, which was originally produced for the Department of Digital, Culture Media and Sport. Broadband packages in the UK cost households an average of around Â£30 a month, according to comparison site Cable - which people would no longer have to pay under Labour's scheme. The party claims it would ""literally eliminate bills for millions of people across the UK"". According to a report from regulator Ofcom earlier this year, only 7% of the UK has access to full-fibre broadband. The government hit its target to bring superfast broadband to 95% of homes by December 2017 - at a cost of Â£1.7bn - but the internet speeds are significantly lower than those of full-fibre. This video can not be played The BBC's Helen Catt looks at the main events of Thursday's election campaign. BT chief executive Philip Jansen told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Labour had under-estimated the price of its pledge. But he said he was happy to work with whoever wins the election to help build a digital Britain, although the process for implementing Labour's plan would not be ""straightforward"". He added that the impact of any changes on BT pensioners, employees, shareholders - and the millions of investors via pension schemes - needed to be carefully thought through. The company has disputed the cost of rolling out fibre broadband to every home and business, saying it would cost closer to Â£40bn than Â£20bn. The BBC's business editor, Simon Jack, said Labour's proposal had caught BT ""off-guard"", as Mr McDonnell had said in July that he had no plans to nationalise the telecoms giant. Following Labour's announcement, BT's share price initially fell by 3% before recovering slightly. Julian David, chief executive of TechUK, which represents many UK tech firms, said: ""These proposals would be a disaster for the telecoms sector and the customers that it serves. The Tories say the full cost of Labour's plan would be Â£83bn over 10 years, rather than the Â£20bn claimed by Labour, arguing they had greatly underestimated the cost of re-nationalising parts of BT, broadband roll-out and salary costs. Mr Johnson said Labour's plan would cost the taxpayer ""many tens of billions"" and that the Conservatives would deliver ""gigabit broadband for all"". He has previouslypromised Â£5bn to bring full-fibre to every homeby 2025. But Mr McDonnell said the Conservatives' funding plan for improving broadband was ""nowhere near enough"". The Lib Dems called Labour's announcement ""another unaffordable item on the wish list"". The SNP called Labour's plans a ""pie-in-the-sky"" promise and said the Scottish government was putting Â£600m in to broadband. All sides are agreed: The UK has fallen behind competitors in rolling out a fibre network - the gold standard where a fibre optic cable arrives directly into your home - and way behind countries such as Spain, Portugal and Norway. When he was running for the Tory leadership Boris Johnson described the broadband strategy of Theresa May's government as ""laughably unambitious"" and promised Â£5bn to hit what the broadband industry thinks is an extremely ambitious target. Now, Labour has come back with a plan that may be more realistic in timescale but is far more expensive in terms of state spending. What is not clear is what happens to the wider broadband market - from Virgin Media and Sky to the raft of fibre broadband firms that have sprung up in recent years. Labour is indicating that the companies ""may want to come on board"" with its scheme - but it is hard to believe that after years of complaining about BT stifling competition they will be enthusiastic about competing with a state-owned monopoly. The question for consumers may be who they should trust - broadband suppliers with patchy records on customer service or the state. By BBC journalist Phil Mercer Super fast, reliable and affordable - that was the broadband promise made to every Australian, who have been assured access to a new system by 2020. The National Broadband Network (NBN) is described as ""one of the largest and most complex infrastructure initiatives undertaken in Australia."" More than 6 million premises are already connected, but the quality of service is a lottery. Some customers to the state-owned company are delighted, while others complain the network is sluggish. There's a good reason for the disparity and it's down to the way that broadband is delivered.  Some methods are much quicker than others. In 2009, the former Labor government in Australia pledged an NBN with efficient optical fibre cables direct to most homes and businesses. The current centre-right administration opted for a cheaper option that would be finished sooner, and chose instead a mix of technologies including optical fibre, copper wires, Hybrid Fibre Coaxial (HFC), fixed wireless and satellite.

"Political parties are generally in agreement about one thing - that the NHS needs more money. But is money all it takes? To answer this, it's helpful to look at whether the NHS is getting the best out of its existing budget  - and how that compares with other countries. There's no single way of measuring the efficiency of a health service, though various bodies have tried. Bloomberg's annual healthcare efficiency index, for example, looks simply at spending on healthcare versus life expectancy. Its latest report ranked 56 wealthy countries, based on 2015 data. It put the UK 35th - down from 21st the year before, partly reflecting the slowing of growth in spending on the NHS particularly in England. Hong Kong and Singapore - mixed public and private systems with elements of both government funding and insurance - came top. They were followed by Italy and Spain - with national health services - which both have higher life expectancies than the UK and spend less per person to achieve this. The UK was also beaten by France which has a system of social insurance paid for by the government, individuals and employers. Compared with35 other OECD countries,external(Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) - a group of rich nations - the UK spends an average amount on healthcare (about 9.8% of GDP) and has a slightly higher than average life expectancy for the group (81.3 years). Life expectancy is a reasonable proxy for how good a healthcare system is, but it's not a perfect one. While higher healthcare spending is linked to higher life expectancy, it's affected by other complicated social factors including diet and smoking. In the US, for example, opioid deaths and gun crime have been linked to a fall in life expectancy. It's also a fairly crude measure - living longer isn't the only thing most people would want to achieve from a health system. As a 2018 report by three health think tanks and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, entitled""How good is the NHS?,external"", said, UK patients were more likely than average to report having had a good experience of the health system. The think tanks said this was ""a valuable goal of health care in its own right"". UK patients were also less likely to say they skipped a consultation or prescription medicine because of cost. And looking just at life expectancy doesn't capture how good a health system is at dealing with conditions that may require long-term care but don't cause death. The 2018 report concludes that the NHS across the UK is relatively efficient, performing well in managing long-term conditions with ""an unusually low level of staffing and, in at least some categories, equipment"" compared with other countries. This suggests the NHS is doing quite well with the money it has. But equally, life expectancy measures don't capture experiences like waiting for a long time on a trolley in A&E or waiting in pain for a routine operation, which aren't fatal but are also not good experiences for patients. These have worsened as funding increases have slowed. The NHS is below average among OECD countries at treating the illnesses that are the most common direct causes of death. For example, the UK mortality rate for cancer and heart disease is higher than the average among similar countries and that's a longer-term trend. Part of the reason the UK does worse on cancer survival is that British patients present late with cancer symptoms, and get diagnosed at a later stage. That's not necessarily a funding issue. Across the UK, waiting times for routine surgery like hip replacements are about average, and waiting times in A&E just below average, compared with other rich countries. As the growth in funding has slowed, though, the NHS has become worse at seeing people within four hours in A&E and getting cancer patients into treatment within two months. This is significant for patients and their experience of the system, but it hasn't dramatically effected outcomes - although this may take some time to show up. Those worse than average trends pre-dated recent funding cutbacks, again suggesting there's something other than just money going on. Improving outcomes in the health service often requires funding plus other action - for example training and retaining more staff or launching public information campaigns. Money alone is not enough to make those things happen. The NHS is devolved, meaning each nation runs its own health system and can set its own priorities. On waits in A&E, Scotland has fared comparatively better than other UK nations. US-based foundation the Commonwealth Fund published a comparison in 2017 whichput the UK top out of 11 countries,externalfor healthcare performance. It looked at five areas including equity and access, as well as health outcomes and the care process. The UK came top partly because of the ranking's heavy weighting towards universal systems - since equity and access formed two out of the five criteria. When it came to health outcomes, though, the UK scored tenth out of 11 countries which detracts from the overall score. Although, arguably, the UK's relative equality of access to healthcare for both the rich and poor is a significant when it comes to assessing how well the health service is spending its money. The IFS, Health Foundation, King's Fund and Nuffield Trust say the NHS ""does better than health systems in comparable countries at protecting people from heavy financial costs when they are ill"" and that overall, ""the NHS performs neither as well as its supporters sometimes claim nor as badly as its critics often allege.""

"The government is planning to spend Â£5bn on rolling out superfast full-fibre broadband to the most remote parts of the UK. But what is full-fibre broadband and how fast will it be? Chancellor Sajid Javid has said the Â£5bn investment would get full-fibre broadband to the hardest-to-reach 20% of the UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said full-fibre broadbandis needed to improve the UK's infrastructure and productivity.He wants full rollout by 2025. That target is eight years ahead of the government's original goal of 2033, a date Mr Johnson described as ""laughably unambitious"". Last year,a government report estimated,externalthe cost of covering the UK with full-fibre broadband by the old deadline of 2033 would be about Â£33bn. With more people using data-intensive streaming services, smart devices and video calls, we need more data. The average household used 240 gigabytes of data a month in 2018, up 26% on the previous year,telecoms industry regulator Ofcom,externalsaid. It also said there could beseveral other benefits to consumers and businesses,external: Creating jobs focused on infrastructure Increasing companies' productivity Reducing the need to commute by making remote working easier Faster connections make it quicker to download films, play online games or use streaming services. Broadband is a term for high-speed connections carrying internet data and other types of traffic. There are three main types of broadband connection that link the local telephone exchange to your house: ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) uses copper cables to a street-level cabinet or junction box and on to the house FTTC (fibre to the cabinet) uses a faster fibre optic cable to the cabinet, but then copper cable from there to the house FTTP (fibre to the premises) uses a fibre optic cable to connect to households without using any copper cable Copper has been the backbone of the internet infrastructure, as it's used in the telephone network across the UK and goes into most homes. But it's old and slower than fibre optic cable, which is made from glass or plastic and uses pulses of light to transmit data. On the other hand, digging up and replacing copper with fibre optic cable to reach into people's homes is expensive and involves a lot of work. So far, only about 7% of UK properties actually have access to the fastest full-fibre connection,external. Currently, the UK government definessuperfastbroadband as having speeds greater than 30 megabits per second (Mbps). A megabit is the standard measurement of internet speed. Ultrafastis defined as a speed greater than 100Mbps. A connection using both fibre and copper (FTTC) can reach speeds of up to about 66Mbps. But a full-fibre connection (FTTP)  - with no copper - can offer much faster average speeds of one gigabit per second (Gbps) - that's 1,000Mbps. It could potentially offer speeds in terabits per second in future. (One terabit equals 1,000 gigabits.) There are other types of very fast connection as well. Virgin Media uses a different type of cable for the last section that comes into your house,which in theory can offer speeds of up to 10Gbps. There is also a service called G.fast, which uses a special pod to boost the speed of the standard copper cable connection. The availability of the fastest broadband is still very limited. In February, Virgin Media began a small trial of broadband in Cambridgeshire using fibre optic cable to give households speeds of 8Gbps (gigabits per second). Last year, another company, Hyperoptic, tested speeds of up to 10Gbps in a home in east London. At the moment, the UK ranks well behind some other European nations including Latvia, Lithuania and Spain, where roughlyhalf of all homes have access to the fastest connections,external. One of the companies planning to launch the new faster 5G mobile services believes they will be so fast that many homes in the UK won't need a fixed broadband connection. Three UK told the BBC last year thatthere would be enough capacity on 5G to match the speeds of the fastest fibre cable connections.Ofcom suggests that in time5G could offer speeds of 20Gbps,external. One advantage of 5G is that it uses a wireless link for the connection to your house, instead of cabling. This could be particularly useful in rural areas which have lagged behind in the provision of faster broadband. But some experts caution this may also be a disadvantage as the wireless signal would not be as stable as a fixed-line connection and could drop out at times. Virgin Media ramps up speeds to millions of users 'Bad deal' for Brits from broadband giants LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Hospital performance in England is at its worst level on record, data shows. Key targets for cancer, hospital care and A&E have been missed for over three years - with delays for hospital care and in A&E hitting their highest levels since both targets were introduced. The monthly figures - the last before the election - prompted Labour and the Liberal Democrats to attack the Tories' record on the NHS. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""huge demand"" was to blame. He said only the Tories could be trusted to have a ""strong, dynamic economy"" to ensure the rises in the NHS budget being planned could be made. ""I'm afraid when I look at the rival proposals and the economic disaster that Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party would cause, that will make it impossible for us in the long term to fund the NHS."" But Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the performance figures were ""disgusting"" and a lack of staff and funding was to blame. And Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said the Tories had a ""shameful"" record. Is the NHS facing unprecedented demand? All the parties are proposing to increase the NHS budget. The government announced a five-year funding plan last year, which would see the front-line budget rise by 3.4% a year up to 2023. On Wednesday, Labour said it would spend more - 3.9% extra a year. The Lib Dems are proposing to use a penny rise in income tax to invest extra in social care, mental health and public health. Demand for all services is rising and the NHS is still managing to see the over-whelming majority in time. But performance has been deteriorating for a number of years - and is now well below what it should be. The figures show: 4.42 million patients on the waiting list at the end of September, the highest number ever 84.8% of them waiting under 18 weeks - below the 92% target and the worst performance since the target was introduced, in 2012 76.9% of cancer patients starting treatment within 62 days - below the 85% target 83.6% of A&E patients admitted or transferred within four hours in October - below the 95% target and the worst performance since the target started was introduced, in 2004 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also missing their targets, although health is devolved so NHS decisions are taken by the administrations in those parts of the UK. How well does the NHS spend its money? 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail Frances Reid, 55, is one of many patients to have faced a long wait. She said she was left in ""excruciating"" pain waiting for a hip replacement. Ms Reid, from South Cambridgeshire, was referred for surgery in January 2018, after struggling for the previous two years with hip pain. She should have been seen in April 2018, but waited until July for her surgery. The NHS ended up paying for her to be treated at a private unit because of the wait. ""The final weeks were really difficult,"" she says. ""I was waking up six, seven times a night and had to use walking sticks to get around. ""Daily tasks like shopping became very difficult."" Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society of Acute Medicine, said: ""These figures are truly worrying as we haven't even reached the 'traditional' winter period yet."" He said urgent action was needed, warning the system was ""imploding"". British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the NHS was facing a ""catastrophe"". ""This is completely unfair for patients and staff."" But Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, tweeted senior staff should be more careful with the language they used, criticising the use of imploding in particular. However, he admitted he was worried about the ""huge pressure"" on the system at this point before the full onset of winter. NHS England conceded hospitals were under pressure, seeing ""more older and sicker patients"". A spokesman said, with winter coming, hospitals would be opening extra beds.

"This video can not be played Jeane Freeman has said she did not make details of the child's death public due to patient confidentiality The health secretary says she knew in September a child had died after contracting an infection possibly linked to water at Glasgow's largest hospital, but did not make it public. Jeane Freeman learned in September that the patient had died after contracting an infection in a cancer ward in 2017. She told BBC Scotland she acted on the information but chose to maintain patient confidentiality. Labour MSP Anas Sarwar has described the situation as a ""cover-up"". Ms Freeman said she felt for the child's parents. She said: ""I deeply regret not only the death of their child. In any circumstance that has to cause a pain that I can't possibly imagine, but I also deeply regret that they feel they haven't been given the information that they have a perfect right to receive and are entitled to. ""They have my commitment to act to ensure that situation does not happen to parents in the future. ""I don't regret honouring patient confidentiality. But upholding patient confidentiality does not mean I don't act on the information I am given."" Mr Sarwar had raised the issue - which was brought to light by an NHS whistleblower - during First Minister's Questions on Thursday. The whistleblower raised concerns about the findings of a review into infections in child cancer patients. The MSP said he had seen information which showed that senior managers were repeatedly alerted to the fact a previous review failed to include cases of infection related to the water supply in 2017. He said the parents of the child had never been told the true cause of their child's death. Greater Glasgow Health Board say a link between the infection and the hospital cannot be proven because regulations at the time did not require water testing. Mr Sarwar said: ""This is a remarkable confession from the health secretary. ""There are now incredibly serious questions for the government and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to answer, and a huge challenge to rebuild trust."" Labour MSP Anas Sarwar described the allegations as a 'scandal' He added: ""This devastating death has been covered up since September. Jeane Freeman says she acted, but the most important act would be to inform the parents. ""At the centre of this scandal is a tragic loss of life, and the priority must be seeking answers for the parents who lost a child."" Last September, two wards at the Royal Hospital for Children were closed and patients moved to the adjoining Queen Elizabeth University Hospital as Health Protection Scotland (HPS) investigated water contamination incidents. AnHPS investigationfound 23 cases of blood stream infections with organisms potentially linked to water contamination were identified between 29 January and 26 September, 2018. The Daily Record,externalreported a clinician-led team at NHSGGC investigated further back than 2018. The whistleblower who contacted Mr Sarwar claimed this investigation found up to 26 cases of water supply infections in children in the cancer wards in 2017, and that one child with cancer died after contracting an infection. In Marcha report foundsome areas of the hospital could not be cleaned properly because they were awaiting repair work. The inspection was ordered by Ms Freeman afterpatients became infectedwith a fungus linked to pigeon faeces. Mr Sarwar said he has had difficult information shared with him before but this case ""felt different"". He added: ""I immediately imagined how I would feel if that was my child, if I was that parent. I would want to know - I would expect answers."" An NHSGGC spokesman said: ""When a patient dies in our care, our clinical teams discuss with family members the cause of death and the factors that have contributed to this, where they are known. ""Patients who are very sick are prone to infections and we closely monitor all infections to ensure patients are appropriately cared for. "" He said that two individual cases of Stenotrophomonas were investigated in 2017 which were not linked and those were reported to Health Protection Scotland and the NHSGGC Board. The cases were reviewed again in July 2019 when the clinical view was taken that no further action was required. He added: ""At the time of the initial investigation into these cases, national guidance did not include a requirement for health boards to test for Stenotrophomonas in the water supply. ""As no tests were carried out at the time, it is not possible to conclude that these infections were connected to the water supply.Â  It is extremely disappointing therefore that a whistleblower has made this claim causing additional distress to families and to other families of cancer patients.""

"The NHS faces a number of challenges and often tops the list of concerns voiced by the public, but what state is it actually in? Last year more than Â£156bn was spent on health across the UK - about 12 times the figure that was spent 70 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. It means today about 30p out of every Â£1 spent on public services goes on health. Ever since the early 1950s the budget has been increasing, but the scale of those rises has varied quite considerably. The average rise has been just over 4%. The biggest rises were seen under the Labour governments between 1997 and 2010 when the average annual rise was about 6%. This dropped to 1% under the post-financial crisis coalition government between 2010 and 2015 - a figure which then rose under the majority Conservative government of recent years. The Conservatives have said their five-year funding plan for the NHS will see the budget rise by an average of 3.4% a year above inflation. It means that by 2023-24 there would be Â£149bn of funding available. By comparison, during the 2019 General Election, Labour proposed increasing it by 3.9% - bringing the budget to Â£155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems were marginally behind this coming in at Â£154bn. Spot the difference on the NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? Labour often talk about the risk of privatisation of the NHS, accusing the Conservatives of wanting to do a deal with US President Donald Trump. Private firms are already involved in providing NHS care. Just over 7% of the budget goes on private providers, up from just over 5% in 2011-12. These can be deals to run a specific service or to take on some NHS patients for routine treatments like hip and knee replacements. But it still leaves the overwhelming majority of care provided by the state and state-employed staff. Actually, GPs are technically independent small businesses contracted to provide a service to the NHS - but they tend not to be considered as private providers. Reality Check: How much does the NHS spend on the private sector? NHS money also goes to the private sector to purchase drugs and equipment. Nearly all of this is bought centrally so the NHS can use its bargaining power to negotiate good deals. A recent example of this was the agreement reached with Vertex to fund its cystic fibrosis treatments. The NHS got a significant saving on the price the drug manufacturer originally wanted. Fears have been raised that US firms would want the NHS to agree more lucrative deals - they get more money for their drugs in their own country.  But given the cost to the NHS of such a concession many doubt this is likely. There are three key targets for hospitals: covering A&E, cancer care and routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements. All parts of the UK have been struggling to hit them. The way they are measured differs between the UK nations. The A&E target is the most directly comparable - in that each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours. Performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland than it is in England and Scotland. Scotland is the last nation to have hit the target - back in the summer of 2017. Meanwhile, in cancer care patients are meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral. But that too is being missed, while waiting lists for routine treatments are rising. In England it has topped 4.4 million - the highest on record. Some 15% have waited more than the target time of 18 weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor for the growing pressures - and it is one with which all health systems in the world are struggling. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacksdo not claim the lives of people earlyin the same numbers. Evencancer is not the death sentence it once was- half of peoplenow survive for a decade or more. 'I won't let my chronic illness trap me in loneliness' What do the people of the world die from? But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. That level of ill-health means the average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. A 90-year-old costs more than seven times as much. As the number of older people continues to rise so will the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by other factors, including the rising cost of new drugs and high levels of obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. Colluding drug firms 'cost NHS millions' UK most obese nation in Western Europe All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to receive more generous rises than other areas of government spending. But despite this the UK has been left trailing some other parts of Europe when it comes to spending as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. It is a gap that has widened since the previous Labour government was in power from 1997 to 2010. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders, which tend to tax people more. Germany, for example,has almost twice as many nurses per capita,externalthan the UK. But the lack of staff in the NHS is not just because of less spending, the health service cannot even fill the posts for which it has got funding. The NHS in Englandhas nearly 100,000 jobs unfilled at the moment,external. The total represents one in 12 of all the posts in the health service and would be enough to staff 10 large hospitals. It includes about 40,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies. Some of the gaps are filled using overtime and agency staff, but some simply go unfilled. There are various initiatives in place to recruit and retain staff. And the number of training places for doctors and nurses are increasing. While the government has been able to put more money into the NHS, one element of the budget that has been cut is the money set aside for capital projects. That covers the cost of infrastructure, such as building works and IT. In recent years that has resulted in a growing maintenance backlog with hospitals having to contend with leaky roofs, out-of-date equipment and crumbling buildings. NHS claims fact-checked Government plans billions for hospital projects The capital budget increased by Â£1bn for 2019-20, bringing the budget up to Â£7bn. The NHS is also under pressure because of the problems in the social care system. Social care includes day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. The system is means-tested in England, which means only the poorest receive help from councils towards the cost of care. But even then it is heavily rationed. The result is growing numbers of older people going without care. According to Age UK, 1.4 million people over the age of 65 are not getting the care they need. That represents one in seven of all older people and is a rise of nearly a fifth in two years. This lack of care in the community has been directly linked to the growing pressures on hospitals by the Care Quality Commission, the body responsible for regulating standards across health and social care. Where in England does care cost the most? The crisis in care Does free personal care solve the crisis? Hunt: Care cuts went 'too far' The regulator believes that without reform of the system, the extra money being put into the NHS could be swallowed up without a noticeable improvement in performance. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. Despite the challenges being faced by the NHS, the majority of the public say they are satisfied with services. The British Social Attitudes poll of nearly 3,000 people found 53% of people in England, Scotland and Wales were satisfied with services in 2018. But levels of satisfaction are falling. The latest score was athree percentage point drop since 2017and the lowest level since 2007. A peak of 70% was seen in 2010. Experts say waiting times and a lack of staff were major concerns as ratings for GPs dropped to an all-time low. Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn?

"Bringing high-speed broadband to remote areas will be challenging Three months ago, Boris Johnson set a hugely ambitious target - giving every home in the UK full-fibre broadband by 2025. Now, at the Conservative Party conference, the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, has promised the funds to make that happen. Or has he? In the press release previewing a speech promising as much as Â£50bn in new infrastructure spending, there is this section about broadband. ""We are setting out plans to invest Â£5bn to support the rollout of full-fibre, 5G and other gigabit-capable networks to the hardest-to-reach 20% of the country,"" it says. ""This doubles the previous commitment to support rollout to the hardest 10%."" Last year'sFuture Telecoms Infrastructure Review,external, commissioned by Theresa May's government, set an ""ambitious target"" of full fibre - a pure fibre-optic cable running directly into the building rather than to a roadside cabinet - reaching 15 million premises by 2025. The whole country -  including about 30 million homes as well as millions more businesses and public buildings - would be covered by 2033, it added. Full-fibre broadband: What is it and how does it work? And a government statement at the time said this would ""require require additional funding of around Â£3bn to Â£5bn to support commercial investment in the final 10% of areas"". But in June, as he stood for the leadership of the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson described that strategy as ""laughably unambitious"". Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, he said: ""We should commit now to delivering full fibre to every home in the land not in the mid-2030s - but in five years at the outside."" That 2025 target was reaffirmed - albeit somewhat less explicitly - in speeches after Mr Johnson won the Conservative leadership contest and as he entered No 10. There was talk of ""fantastic full-fibre broadband sprouting in every household"". 5G mobile technology is available in only a few UK cities Now, the chancellor is promising Â£5bn to make that sprouting happen - but fulfilling that pledge to move the target eight years earlier should mean the cost goes up. After all, this is a massive building project. Scarce workers will have to be recruited and trained and materials bought. Tell your builder your extension has to be built by Christmas, not next summer and you'll find the bill spirals. And it's not just about having a tighter deadline. The 2033 target envisaged the government providing funds to cover the 10% of the country that would not be reached by private-sector investment. Moving the goal forward means it now expects 20% of the UK won't have been covered by the commercial sector in time. So, the chancellor appears to be expecting to get a lot out of the Â£5bn, assuming he really is sticking to the promise of full-fibre for all - a much faster more extensive programme to bring the best possible broadband to everyone, without dipping deeper into public funds. Want full fibre? Head to the Hebrides UK's full-fibre broadband coverage rises to 8% Taller mast plans to boost rural mobile coverage I was givena glimpse of some of the issues last month, when I visitedthe remote island community on Grimsay, in the Hebrides, which had recently been given full-fibre broadband. It had proved pretty expensive, something like Â£4,000 to hook up each household, with much of the funding coming from the Scottish government. And while the inhabitants were naturally enthusiastic about the project, their neighbours on other islands had immediately begun asking: ""What about us?"" There is one more puzzling thing about the chancellor's speech - does it contain a watering down of the prime minister's full-fibre pledge? It talks of investment not just in fibre but in ""5G and other gigabit-capable networks"". Now, some in the telecoms industry have suggested laying a fibre connection up every remote farm track or mountainside may not be sensible when other technologies such as 5G or even low earth-orbit satellites could supply similar speeds. But fibre purists - and that seems to include the prime minister - insist it is the only reliable option if we are not to have a two-speed country with rural areas left in the slow lane. And Mr Javid's team is not providing much more clarity, except to say ""gigabit-capable"" broadband networks will be provided to everyone and further details will be set out later this year in the National Infrastructure Strategy.

"This video can not be played Jeane Freeman has said she did not make details of the child's death public due to patient confidentiality The health secretary says she knew in September a child had died after contracting an infection possibly linked to water at Glasgow's largest hospital, but did not make it public. Jeane Freeman learned in September that the patient had died after contracting an infection in a cancer ward in 2017. She told BBC Scotland she acted on the information but chose to maintain patient confidentiality. Labour MSP Anas Sarwar has described the situation as a ""cover-up"". Ms Freeman said she felt for the child's parents. She said: ""I deeply regret not only the death of their child. In any circumstance that has to cause a pain that I can't possibly imagine, but I also deeply regret that they feel they haven't been given the information that they have a perfect right to receive and are entitled to. ""They have my commitment to act to ensure that situation does not happen to parents in the future. ""I don't regret honouring patient confidentiality. But upholding patient confidentiality does not mean I don't act on the information I am given."" Mr Sarwar had raised the issue - which was brought to light by an NHS whistleblower - during First Minister's Questions on Thursday. The whistleblower raised concerns about the findings of a review into infections in child cancer patients. The MSP said he had seen information which showed that senior managers were repeatedly alerted to the fact a previous review failed to include cases of infection related to the water supply in 2017. He said the parents of the child had never been told the true cause of their child's death. Greater Glasgow Health Board say a link between the infection and the hospital cannot be proven because regulations at the time did not require water testing. Mr Sarwar said: ""This is a remarkable confession from the health secretary. ""There are now incredibly serious questions for the government and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to answer, and a huge challenge to rebuild trust."" Labour MSP Anas Sarwar described the allegations as a 'scandal' He added: ""This devastating death has been covered up since September. Jeane Freeman says she acted, but the most important act would be to inform the parents. ""At the centre of this scandal is a tragic loss of life, and the priority must be seeking answers for the parents who lost a child."" Last September, two wards at the Royal Hospital for Children were closed and patients moved to the adjoining Queen Elizabeth University Hospital as Health Protection Scotland (HPS) investigated water contamination incidents. AnHPS investigationfound 23 cases of blood stream infections with organisms potentially linked to water contamination were identified between 29 January and 26 September, 2018. The Daily Record,externalreported a clinician-led team at NHSGGC investigated further back than 2018. The whistleblower who contacted Mr Sarwar claimed this investigation found up to 26 cases of water supply infections in children in the cancer wards in 2017, and that one child with cancer died after contracting an infection. In Marcha report foundsome areas of the hospital could not be cleaned properly because they were awaiting repair work. The inspection was ordered by Ms Freeman afterpatients became infectedwith a fungus linked to pigeon faeces. Mr Sarwar said he has had difficult information shared with him before but this case ""felt different"". He added: ""I immediately imagined how I would feel if that was my child, if I was that parent. I would want to know - I would expect answers."" An NHSGGC spokesman said: ""When a patient dies in our care, our clinical teams discuss with family members the cause of death and the factors that have contributed to this, where they are known. ""Patients who are very sick are prone to infections and we closely monitor all infections to ensure patients are appropriately cared for. "" He said that two individual cases of Stenotrophomonas were investigated in 2017 which were not linked and those were reported to Health Protection Scotland and the NHSGGC Board. The cases were reviewed again in July 2019 when the clinical view was taken that no further action was required. He added: ""At the time of the initial investigation into these cases, national guidance did not include a requirement for health boards to test for Stenotrophomonas in the water supply. ""As no tests were carried out at the time, it is not possible to conclude that these infections were connected to the water supply.Â  It is extremely disappointing therefore that a whistleblower has made this claim causing additional distress to families and to other families of cancer patients.""

"This video can not be played A man who crushed a three-year-old boy to death with a car seat has been jailed. A man who crushed a three-year-old boy to death with a car seat has been jailed for more than seven years. Stephen Waterson, 26, inflicted irreversible brain injuries on Alfie Lamb, his girlfriend's son, who was in the footwell behind him in 2018. Waterson initially denied manslaughter but changed his plea to guilty before a retrial in September. Alfie had been at his mother Adrian Hoare's feet at the time. She was jailedfor child crueltyin May. Sentencing Waterson at the Old Bailey, Mr Justice Kerr described him as ""cunning, manipulative, threatening, and controlling"". Justice Kerr said: ""I do not find you were annoyed with Alfie and moved your seat back because of that annoyance."" But he said he was satisfied the nightclub worker from Croydon moved his car seat back twice ""for your own comfort"". The toddler crushed to death at his mother's feet Described by police as ""arrogant, selfish and deeply unpleasant"", Waterson lied to detectives about what happened and threatened his girlfriend and two friends who were in his Audi convertible - along with a second child - on 1 February 2018. Mr Justice Kerr sentenced him to five years and six months for the manslaughter. He was handed a further two years for witness intimidation and 18 months for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, which will run concurrently. Alfie's death was the first time anyone in the UK had died from crush asphyxiation as a result of an electronic car seat, police said. Three-year-old Alfie suffered irreversible brain injuries Hoare, 24, of Gravesend, Kent,watched as her son was crushedin front of her and then lied to protect her boyfriend. She was sentenced to two years and nine months but cleared of manslaughter. During her trial, prosecutors said Alfie was crying during the journey to Waterson's home after a shopping trip in Sutton, south London. When he continued to moan,Waterson, who was in the front passenger seat, reversed his chair twiceand said ""I won't be told what to do by a three-year-old"", Hoare told the jury. The maximum space in the footwell was 30cm, and, at the touch of a button, that could be reduced to just 9.5cm, the Old Bailey heard. Alfie collapsed in the car and died in hospital from his injuries three days later. At a trial in February, Mr Waterson told the court he only moved his seat back an inch, before moving forwards again Hoare eventually confessed to her half-sister Ashleigh Jeffrey in a taped conversation handed to police. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC read out a victim impact statement from Ms Jeffrey. She said: ""He [Alfie] was always smiling. His death has had such a profound effect on my life."" ""No sentence will be enough but today we finally gave Alfie a voice and justice has been done."" Barmaid Emilie Williams, 20, who had been in the car with Waterson and Hoare, admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice after being threatened and ""coerced"" into lying by Waterson. She was sentenced to five months imprisonment suspended for 18 months and 100 hours of unpaid work, to be completed after she gives birth. Jurors in the first trial heard Waterson was a controlling womaniser who had a violent temper and three previous convictions for attacking an ex-girlfriend and his sister's husband.

"This video can not be played Emotional reunions after the California school shooting Two students, aged 16 and 14, have been killed and three others injured by a gunman who opened fire at a secondary school in California, officials say. The victims died in a brief, 16-second gun attack shortly before classes began on Thursday at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles. The attack came on the 16th birthday of the suspect, named by US media as fellow student, Nathaniel Berhow. The suspect then shot himself in the head and died several hours later. America's gun culture in charts What do US Democrats want to do about guns? No motive has been established so far, with police saying the attacks ""still remains a mystery"". Students and teachers spoke of how they barricaded themselves in classrooms amid chaotic scenes, carrying out an active shooter drill that many schools have implemented in recent years following deadly attacks around the country. It was first reported at 07:38 local time (15:38 GMT) on Thursday, LA county sheriff Alex Villanueva said, adding that police were at the scene within two minutes. This video can not be played LA county sheriff: ""I hate to have Saugus added to Sandy Hook and Columbine"" The suspect was standing in the school courtyard when he took a .45-calibre semi-automatic pistol from his backpack and opened fire for about 16 seconds before turning the gun on himself, Sheriff's Captain Kent Wegener said. ""He just fires from where he is. He doesn't chase anybody. He doesn't move,"" Capt Wegener said. Students barricaded themselves in classrooms under an active shooter drill for more than an hour as police tried to determine if the gunman was still at large. Officers found six people suffering from gunshot wounds and transferred them to local hospitals. The suspect was later identified as one of those injured. The names of those who died have not yet been released. They were a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. The three injured, also as-yet unnamed, were two girls, aged 14 and 15, and a 14-year-old boy. They are all in a stable condition. All attended Saugus High School. The suspect had no known connection to the victims, Capt Wegener said. The attack came on the suspect's 16th birthday. The FBI said it appeared he had acted alone and was not affiliated with any particular group or ideology. The Associated Press quoted a fellow student, Brooke Risley, as saying the suspect was introverted but ""naturally smart"", adding that he had a girlfriend and was a boy scout. AP said the boy lived locally in a modest home, and that his father died two years ago. A neighbour told Reuters the boy had struggled with his father's death. Investigators have searched the home and interviewed the boy's mother and girlfriend. There were no initial indications that he had been bullied at school. There were reports of an Instagram posting saying ""Saugus have fun at school tomorrow"", but it was later revealed the account was not owned by the suspect.

"The badly-damaged cathedral is now covered in scaffolding The army general overseeing the reconstruction of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris has said the building's chief architect should ""shut his mouth"". General Jean-Louis Georgelin and architect Philippe Villeneuve disagree over whether the cathedral's new spire should look modern or medieval. Notre Dame caught fire in April, losing its spire, roof and many artefacts. French President Emmanuel Macron has set a five-year deadline for completing the huge restoration project. Some experts warn that this target may be too ambitious - and Mr Villeneuve has previously said the only way it can be met is if the spire is a replica of the one that burned down. How an underwater forest could help rebuild Notre Dame 'No sign of criminal cause' of fire, say officials Notre Dame's eight turbulent centuries of history But President Macron and General Georgelin both believe the new spire should be ""contemporary"". This video can not be played The moment Notre-Dameâs spire fell as the fire raged in April A public argument over the spire's design broke out at a meeting of the French National Assembly's cultural affairs committee late on Wednesday. ""As for the chief architect, I have already explained that he should shut his mouth,"" General Georgelin snapped, prompting gasps from those at the meeting, AFP news agency reported. He later said that all involved ought to ""move ahead in wisdom so that we can serenely make the best choice for Notre Dame, for Paris, for the world"". A final decision on the spire would be settled on in 2021, he added. The historic cathedral lost its spire and roof in the huge fire on 15 April On the same day, France 3 TV channel broadcast footage from inside Notre Dame - showing its missing spire and burned-out roof, as well as debris that has collected on the cathedral floor. Last month, Mr Villeneuve told the broadcaster RTL: ""Either I restore it identically... or they make a contemporary spire and it will be someone else [doing it].""

"Konstantin Ignatov has pleaded guilty Konstantin Ignatov, the brother of ""missing cryptoqueen"" Dr Ruja Ignatova, has admitted his role in the OneCoin crypto-currency fraud. Ignatov pleaded guilty to several charges, including money laundering and fraud. OneCoin and the disappearance of its co-founder, Dr Ruja Ignatova, have been the subject of aBBC Sounds podcast. Investigators believe as much as Â£4bn was raised globally in what is said to have amounted to a Ponzi scheme. The Bulgaria-based organisation behind OneCoin Ltd continues to operate and denies all wrongdoing. Ignatov was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport in March. He signed a plea deal document on 4 October - but it was made public, on 12 November, only after being obtained by Inner City Press journalistMatthew Russell Lee,external. By complying with the terms of the plea deal, Ignatov will not face further criminal charges for his role in OneCoin, other than any criminal tax violations that may emerge. Dr Ruja Ignatova is still missing The document says Ignatov's cooperation with the authorities may ""reveal activities of individuals who might use violence"" against him or his family. It suggests he could apply to the US witness protection scheme and be assigned a new identity. He has not yet been sentenced but faces up to 90 years in prison for his role in the fraud. Ignatov has also been testifying in the trial of a US lawyer accused of laundering some of the proceeds from OneCoin. Mark Scott is accused of routing approximately $400m (Â£310m) out of the US while trying to conceal the true ownership and source of the funds. He faces one charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering and another to commit bank fraud. He has pleaded not guilty. During that trial, Ignatov has revealed more details about the disappearance of his sister Dr Ruja Ignatova. According to his testimony, Dr Ignatova was living in Sofia, Bulgaria before she vanished, theInner City Press,externalreports. He confirmed that Dr Ignatova had told him critics of OneCoin were ""haters"", and that she was ""very tired"". She was afraid somebody close to her was going to give her up to the the FBI, he said. He claims she told him she had got hold of a ""big passport"" and asked him to get her plane tickets to Vienna, Austria and then Athens, Greece. Ignatov said he had not spoken to his sister since she had disappeared. He had hired a private investigator to find her but had been unsuccessful. The US government has said it expects Mr Scott's trial to conclude next week. Ignatov's plea deal will come as a great relief to OneCoin's critics. Those who were threatened with legal action for calling OneCoin a scam will now feel vindicated. Even though I have spent so long investigating this case, I was surprised to see the brother turn so dramatically against his sister. Ignatov seems to be implying even he was duped by her. There is nothing definitive about her whereabouts yet - but there are certainly some new leads to follow. Listen to The Missing Cryptoqueen on BBC Sounds The case will slow down the continuing promotion of OneCoin - but it might not stop it entirely. In the past, OneCoin promoters have dismissed all criticism and evidence as being politically motivated or coming from ""haters"". They may do that again. I believe the head office in Sofia remains open for business and I have already seen some supporters say they will continue to promote. For lower-level investors this might be a difficult time - as they will have to admit they have been duped and their money is gone. That won't be easy.

The victims died in a brief, 16-second gun attack shortly before classes began on Thursday at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, north of Los Angeles. The attack came on the 16th birthday of the suspect, named by US media as fellow student, Nathaniel Berhow. The suspect then shot himself in the head and died several hours later. America's gun culture in charts What do US Democrats want to do about guns? No motive has been established so far, with police saying the attacks ""still remains a mystery"". Students and teachers spoke of how they barricaded themselves in classrooms amid chaotic scenes, carrying out an active shooter drill that many schools have implemented in recent years following deadly attacks around the country. It was first reported at 07:38 local time (15:38 GMT) on Thursday, LA county sheriff Alex Villanueva said, adding that police were at the scene within two minutes. This video can not be played LA county sheriff: ""I hate to have Saugus added to Sandy Hook and Columbine"" The suspect was standing in the school courtyard when he took a .45-calibre semi-automatic pistol from his backpack and opened fire for about 16 seconds before turning the gun on himself, Sheriff's Captain Kent Wegener said. ""He just fires from where he is. He doesn't chase anybody. He doesn't move,"" Capt Wegener said. Students barricaded themselves in classrooms under an active shooter drill for more than an hour as police tried to determine if the gunman was still at large. Officers found six people suffering from gunshot wounds and transferred them to local hospitals. The suspect was later identified as one of those injured. The names of those who died have not yet been released. They were a 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy. The three injured, also as-yet unnamed, were two girls, aged 14 and 15, and a 14-year-old boy. They are all in a stable condition. All attended Saugus High School. The suspect had no known connection to the victims, Capt Wegener said. The attack came on the suspect's 16th birthday. The FBI said it appeared he had acted alone and was not affiliated with any particular group or ideology. The Associated Press quoted a fellow student, Brooke Risley, as saying the suspect was introverted but ""naturally smart"", adding that he had a girlfriend and was a boy scout. AP said the boy lived locally in a modest home, and that his father died two years ago. A neighbour told Reuters the boy had struggled with his father's death. Investigators have searched the home and interviewed the boy's mother and girlfriend. There were no initial indications that he had been bullied at school. There were reports of an Instagram posting saying ""Saugus have fun at school tomorrow"", but it was later revealed the account was not owned by the suspect. One student told NBC she was doing her homework when people started running. ""I was really, really scared. I was shaking,"" she said. This video can not be played Saugus High School students ""barricaded doors"" during shooting Another student, named as Azalea, told CBS she and her classmates had barricaded the classroom door with chairs. ""It was just really scary, having everybody panic and call their parents, saying they love you."" US marks a year since Parkland shooting 2018 'worst year for US school shootings' Teacher Katie Holt told NBC she was huddled in her office with 30 students when a girl ran in saying she had been shot. Ms Holt dressed the injuries as best she could her with her gunshot-wound kit, with a fellow student applying pressure. There were emotional reunions once the lockdown was lifted. Jeff Turner, 58, told the New York Times he found his daughter, Micah, upset and crying. ""She was saying, 'I feel guilty that I didn't stay and help the people who were shot,'"" he said. ""And that was the thing that made me break down in tears."" The school has an unarmed sheriff's deputy and nine ""campus supervisors"" with guard training, district administrator Collyn Nielson told Associated Press. There are a number of security cameras but no metal detectors, and lockdown drills are held three times a year. News of the attack emerged during a Senate debate on gun control legislation. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, was arguing for gun control when he was given a note with the news. ""We are complicit if we fail to act,"" he said. ""It is not just a political responsibility, it is a moral imperative."" Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement that his department took school shootings ""very seriously"" and would help the authorities ""develop trainings and resources to improve response capabilities and better protect soft targets"". Gun control, and the right to bear arms, is a divisive political issue in the US. About 40% of Americans say they own a gun or live in a household with one, according to a 2017 survey, and the rate of murder or manslaughter by firearm in the country is the highest in the developed world. According to the Washington Post, more than 230,000 young people in the US have experienced gun violence at school since the Columbine High School massacre in Colorado in 1999. The US journal Education Week has been listing school shootings since 2018. It saysthere have been 22 incidents that have resulted in death or injury so far in 2019,external. There were 24 such incidents last year, it says, but the casualty toll was higher, at 114. That includes the 17 people killed in the deadliest incident -at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine's Day. The Everytown gun control advocacy group,external, using separate methodology, said Saugus was the 85th incident of gunfire at a school this year, but that includes those where there were no casualties.

"Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are all social-media influencers The money made by social-media influencers has risen meteorically in the last few years, according to a new report. Marketing firm Izea found,externalthe average price of a sponsored photo on Instagram has jumped from $134 (Â£104) in 2014 to $1,642 (Â£1,276) in 2019. Brands appear willing to pay handsomely to sponsor posts, videos, stories and blogs, too,says Business Insider,external. But one expert insists it will not mean the end of traditional advertising. ""Digital marketing is the equivalent of word of mouth but there will always be a mix between that and traditional advertising,"" said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, chief executive of social media marketing platform Socialbakers. The report looked at sponsored content on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and blogs, examining negotiated rates from 2014 to 2019. From micro-influencers - people with fewer than 100,000 followers - to celebrities, it found that there was good money to be made. Among the findings were: The average cost for a sponsored Instagram photo has risen 44% from 2018 to 2019 alone For a sponsored blog post it has soared from $7.39 in 2006 to $1,442 in 2019 YouTube videos command the highest fees - four times that of the next highest-priced form of sponsored content - up from $420 in 2014 to $6,700 in 2019 A Facebook status update has risen from $8 in 2014 to $395 in 2019 A Twitter post has risen from $29 in 2014 to $422 in 2019 Blog posts have risen from $407 to $1,442 As more and more people join the rush to become social-media influencers, the industry has gained more scrutiny from regulators. Last month, three influencers had Instagram posts touting diet products banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, which dubbed them ""irresponsible"". And at the beginning of the year, the Competition and Markets Authority warned that some influencer posts could break consumer law if they did not make clear when posts endorsing products were ads. Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntingon-Whiteley were among16 influencers who agreed to change the way they posted content,external. Brands will continue to pour money into social-media advertising, according to data from Socialbakers. Its research suggests that influencer-sponsored posts grew by 150% in the last year, with the use of the hashtag #ad more than doubling. It predicts that brands will up their spend on influencer marketing in 2020, making it a $10bn industry. Instagram is currently experimenting with hiding ""likes"" on posts but Mr Ben-Itzhak does not think this will have an impact on the influencer industry. ""Influencers will still be able to see what engagement they have and it is common practice to grant permission to brands so that they can see that too,"" he said. ""The bigger question will be whether consumers will continue to engage when they can't see 'likes'."" Instagram influencers: Have we stopped believing?

"The Tories pledged to reduce ""immigration overall"" to the UK, claiming it would ""surge"" under Labour Labour promised to close the gender pay gap by 2030 as Jeremy Corbyn continued his two-day visit to Scotland Labour and the Liberal Democrats attacked the Tories' record on the NHS after A&E performance in England hit its worst level on record Lib Dems said they would make changing the gender recognition process a priority SNP pledged to oppose increase in retirement age and restore free TV licences for over-75s Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage was campaigning in north-east England Nomination papers for candidates wanting to run for Parliament closed at 16:00 GMT Hazel Shearing, Vanessa Barford, Paul Seddon and Lucy Webster That's all from us today. It's been another busy day on the election trail. If you're looking to catch up, here's a rundown of the main headlines this evening: Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent As immigration is debated on the election campaign trail, a new report seeks to estimate the number of illegal immigrants living in the UK. The attempt is in a fascinating paper on the European Union picture from the Pew Research Centre. The Washington-based think tank has a global reputation for interpreting the trends that shape the modern world - and so its findings will always make headlines. Pew's claim is simple: there may have been between 800,000 and 1.2 million unauthorised migrants living in the UK in 2017. But how did it get that figure, and how does it compare to other estimates? Read more from Dominic here. You can watch BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's full interview with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn here: This video can not be played In full: Corbyn challenged over Labour immigration policy Laura Kuenssberg's full interview with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn focusing on Labour's immigration policy. Earlier, before his interview with the BBC, Mr Corbyn told a heckler on a campaign visit to Scotland he didn't ""want another independence referendumâ. As the Labour leader addressed a crowd in the West Lothian town of Linlithgow, the woman stopped to
ask about reports he would work with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and help her secure the so-called indyref2. Mr Corbyn attempted to reassure the heckler by saying he would not want another
vote - contradicting a previous suggestion that he would consider one. Reality Check How did the Conservatives estimate how an open border
policy would increase net migration? First they assumed that Labour would open the UKâs borders
to everyone in the world in its first year of government. The evidence for this assumptionis very limited. Labour has not yet published its manifesto. A motion passed at Labour conference this year calls on the party to âextendâ free
movement, but doesnât say whether thatâs to extend existing rights to EU
countries after Brexit or to extend it to everyone in the world. In fact, in a BBC interview, leader Jeremy Corbyn hinted to the BBC that the plan to extend free movement would cover
family reunions and filling skill shortages. Even if you believe that the premise is fair, the Conservativesâ sums are still open to
challenge. They looked at what
happened with countries that joined the EU in 2004. For example, the Hungarian-born population in the UK
increased from 15,000 to 27,000 in the five
years after Hungary joined the EU - nearly doubling. So, the Conservative analysis goes, the non-EU born
population (currently six million) would also
roughly double in the next five years. After
that it would grow more slowly, in line with
current trends. Over 10 years that would be about 760,000 extra people a year on
average. Add unchanged EU migration of 80,000 a year â since thatâs
what free movement with the EU gives us currently - and you end up with
840,000. But itâs another big
assumption to say that what happened in a small number of European countries would be repeated with countries across the globe. Jeremy Corbyn has refused to
say if he wants the number of immigrants coming to the UK to rise or fall. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg,
the Labour leader said people should be ""realistic"" about filling the jobs needed for the UK economy. But he said: ""Putting
arbitrary figures on it as successive governments have done simply doesn't
work"". It comes as theTories pledged to reduce ""immigration overall""if
they win the 12 December election. Mark EastonHome editor The governmentâs immigration
strategy fell into the Parliamentary dustbin when the election was
called. We still await the party manifestos but today the home secretary
said in a press release: âWe will reduce immigration overall.â Asked to repeat
this for the TV cameras later in the afternoon, she repeatedly refused,
speaking only about âcontrollingâ immigration. The reason this is difficult
territory for the Conservatives is that in some part of the UK, migrant workers
are desperately needed to keep public services going. The prime minister
is known to favour a policy that works for the needs of the economy, even if
that means migration numbers remain broadly where they are. Immigration is not the electoral issue it once was â
pollsters say it is at its lowest level of concern for almost two
decades. But some communities remain concerned that foreign arrivals put
extra pressure on public services and jobs - and those voters are often in Labour seats that the Tories are looking to take. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent As part of the Conservative's immigration push today, this banner graphic has appeared on Priti Patel's Twitter account. It predicts that Labour's purported ""open borders"" policy - which the party says is not true - would lead to a ""huge strain on the NHS and schools"". So what's the evidence of the strain caused so far by open borders and freedom of movement with the rest of the EU? Ms Patel's expert advisers, the Migration Advisory Committee, say there is little or no evidence of strain. Migrant workers tend to be younger and fitter and less likely to go to hospital. Evidence from education research shows that the presence of children who speak English as a second language improves the results of other children in the schools (the reason being they are highly motivated - and that motivates other kids). It's all in ahigh-profile report commissioned by the Home Office,externallast year as part of the plans to devise a new post-Brexit immigration system. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has weighed in on the immigration debate after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""not every dot and comma from conference"" will be in its manifesto.

Ms Swinson pledged to revoke Article 50 on the first day of her leadership if she is elected to Number 10 during a visit to the Guru Nanak Sikh temple in Glasgow. She said remaining in the EU would free up money for the health service, childcare and tackling climate change. ""There's a huge amount of priorities we want to be getting on to dealing with and of course, Brexit makes all of those things harder,"" she said. She added she is opposed to a second referendum on Scottish independence for the same reason that she is opposed to Brexit, saying: ""We work better when we are [close] together with our nearest neighbours."" Speaking about the Lib Dems' decision to take take legal action against ITV over its exclusion of her from a televised leaders' debate, she said: ""It's not a debate if you just have Leave debating Leave."" The Brexit Party's prospective candidate in Dudley North, Rupert Lowe, has announced he will not contest the election. Mr Lowe's decision goes against the insistence by Nigel Farage, the party's leader, that it would contest every seat not held by the Conservatives. Mr Lowe says his candidacy could split the Leave-supporting vote and therefore facilitate a Labour victory in the constituency. The move could be significant as the Tories are aiming to take Leave seats in the Midlands and northern England, which have traditionally voted Labour. The constituency's previous MP, Ian Austin, quit the Labour Party over its handling of anti-Semitism and is not running again. Allow Twitter content?

The government is in the ""early stages"" of discussions with Australian authorities about using parts of their points-based immigration system as a blue-print for the UK, says Home Secretary Priti Patel. She says the election limits what she can say about the policy development, but claims an equivalent of Australia's points-based system will give ""control back"" to the government. ""We can ensure that the brightest and best people with the right skills and our economy and our Labour market needs are prioritised from the entire world, so we're not discriminating, and it's not about putting EU citizens first and closing off other parts of the world,"" she says. Ms Patel says Labour has ""serious questions to answer"" about its immigration plans after shadow home secretary Diane Abbott tweeted that the party ""is committed to maintaining [and] extending Freedom of Movement rights"". Earlier today, she said the Tories would reduce ""immigration overall"" to the UK after Brexit. You can read where the different parties stand on immigration and other issueshere. Nick EardleyBBC political correspondent This evening Jeremy
Corbyn will wrap up his trip to Scotland with a rally in Edinburgh. Labour are
expecting hundreds of supporters to turn up. Winning seats in Scotland
could be crucial to Mr Corbynâs hopes of getting into No 10. And long gone
are the days when Labour could rely on definitely returning a healthy number of
MPs from Scotland. Despite recent disasters
at the polls - including coming fifth in the European elections - a number of
candidates Iâve spoken to are upbeat and say theyâre getting decent a reception
from voters. But this trip has not
gone according to plan for Mr Corbyn. Mr Corbyn has - not for
the first time - been unclear about Labourâs position on a second independence
referendum. Yesterday, he said he wouldnât allow one for in his first term (five years). He then said not in the âformative yearsâ of a Labour government. This
morning he suggested not in the first two years. This might all sound a
bit like splitting hairs, but some candidates here are worried that not being
clear on independence is harming their chances of winning votes from unionists,
who helped the party do well in 2017. One candidate told me earlier that Mr Corbynâs
comments had been a âbloody disasterâ. The fear is those who oppose
independence will side with the Conservatives or the Lib Dems - while independence supporters will vote SNP. Thereâs another school of
thought though. The Labour leadership in Scotland doesnât think independence will be a
key issue on 12 December. Theyâre confident that - over the next month - their
focus on ending austerity, investing in the economy and tackling climate change will cut
through. Mr Corbyn said this
morning in Midlothian that voters make their decision based on a number of
issues. Some in Scottish Labour are desperately hoping independence isnât the
main one. BBC News Channel Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna says today's NHS figures are a ""damning indictment"" of the Conservatives' handling of the health service. It came after data showed hospital peformance in Englandwas at its worst level on record. Umunna says stopping Brexit would help NHS recruitment. ""Now is not the time to be ending free movement on the EU when we are so reliant,"" he says. He adds the Lib Dems want to add 1p on every Â£1 in income tax to fund improvements to care. ""It won't provide us with all the money that we need,"" he says, adding that anyone claiming that only money will make a difference to problems in the NHS is ""lying"". The Ulster Unionist Party will run in 16 constituencies across Northern Ireland, despite previous suggestions that it would put forward candidates in all 18. Leader Steve Aiken says the party will no longer run in North Belfast, after coming under pressure over standing against Democratic Unionist deputy leader Nigel Dodds, nor in West Belfast, a seat which has traditionally been dominated by Sinn Fein. ""The future direction of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland's place within it is at stake,"" he says. ""We want to offer pro-Union voters a choice. A choice between Ulster Unionist candidates who will offer a positive, progressive vision for unionism, protecting our place within the United Kingdom and the DUP who have dropped the ball, allowing a border to be put up the Irish Sea and dragged the reputation of unionism into the gutter."" All nomination papers for candidates wanting to run for Parliament close at 4pm today. This means they will also have submitted their Â£500 deposit, which they do get back if they secure more than 5% of the votes in their seat. This is designed to prevent people from running as a joke, but candidates from established parties have occasionally lost their deposits. Once nominations are closed, local authorities will publish lists of candidates running in their area. The Electoral Commission will also publish lists for all constituencies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's emergency response committee Cobra is to meet shortly to discuss the recent floods. Mr Johnson says in a tweet that 818 properties have been flooded and that troops are handing out over 20,000 sandbags to help protect more properties near the River Don, which crosses Yorkshire. The floods have been one of the unexpected events to hit the general election campaign, with more rain expected in affected areas today. Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says he does not think he will vote in the election. Speaking on a trip to Grimsby Seafood Village, where he was photographed eating cheesecake, Mr Farage says: ""I doubt I'll vote. I very much doubt I'll vote."" His party has stood down candidates in all 317 constituencies won by the Tories in 2017, including his own in Kent. On the notion of voting for the Tories, he says: ""It's this very narrow party interest, that's all they care about."" He adds that his last Conservative vote was in 1987, and that he spoiled his ballot paper in 1992 because he ""couldn't vote for John Major"". Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage showed ""leadership"" when he stood down candidates in constituencies won by the Tories in 2017, says Michelle Dewberry, winner of the second series of The Apprentice and the party's candidate for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle. ""Whether you agree or not, I think that it shows leadership and I think what we need to do now is unite around the party, and around the seats where we are standing to give us the best chance possible to get a decent number of seats in Westminster so that we can make a difference,"" she says.

It's been another busy day on the election trail. If you're looking to catch up, here's a rundown of the main headlines this evening: Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent As immigration is debated on the election campaign trail, a new report seeks to estimate the number of illegal immigrants living in the UK. The attempt is in a fascinating paper on the European Union picture from the Pew Research Centre. The Washington-based think tank has a global reputation for interpreting the trends that shape the modern world - and so its findings will always make headlines. Pew's claim is simple: there may have been between 800,000 and 1.2 million unauthorised migrants living in the UK in 2017. But how did it get that figure, and how does it compare to other estimates? Read more from Dominic here. You can watch BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg's full interview with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn here: This video can not be played In full: Corbyn challenged over Labour immigration policy Laura Kuenssberg's full interview with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn focusing on Labour's immigration policy. Earlier, before his interview with the BBC, Mr Corbyn told a heckler on a campaign visit to Scotland he didn't ""want another independence referendumâ. As the Labour leader addressed a crowd in the West Lothian town of Linlithgow, the woman stopped to
ask about reports he would work with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and help her secure the so-called indyref2. Mr Corbyn attempted to reassure the heckler by saying he would not want another
vote - contradicting a previous suggestion that he would consider one. Reality Check How did the Conservatives estimate how an open border
policy would increase net migration? First they assumed that Labour would open the UKâs borders
to everyone in the world in its first year of government. The evidence for this assumptionis very limited. Labour has not yet published its manifesto. A motion passed at Labour conference this year calls on the party to âextendâ free
movement, but doesnât say whether thatâs to extend existing rights to EU
countries after Brexit or to extend it to everyone in the world. In fact, in a BBC interview, leader Jeremy Corbyn hinted to the BBC that the plan to extend free movement would cover
family reunions and filling skill shortages. Even if you believe that the premise is fair, the Conservativesâ sums are still open to
challenge. They looked at what
happened with countries that joined the EU in 2004. For example, the Hungarian-born population in the UK
increased from 15,000 to 27,000 in the five
years after Hungary joined the EU - nearly doubling. So, the Conservative analysis goes, the non-EU born
population (currently six million) would also
roughly double in the next five years. After
that it would grow more slowly, in line with
current trends. Over 10 years that would be about 760,000 extra people a year on
average. Add unchanged EU migration of 80,000 a year â since thatâs
what free movement with the EU gives us currently - and you end up with
840,000. But itâs another big
assumption to say that what happened in a small number of European countries would be repeated with countries across the globe. Jeremy Corbyn has refused to
say if he wants the number of immigrants coming to the UK to rise or fall. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg,
the Labour leader said people should be ""realistic"" about filling the jobs needed for the UK economy. But he said: ""Putting
arbitrary figures on it as successive governments have done simply doesn't
work"". It comes as theTories pledged to reduce ""immigration overall""if
they win the 12 December election. Mark EastonHome editor The governmentâs immigration
strategy fell into the Parliamentary dustbin when the election was
called. We still await the party manifestos but today the home secretary
said in a press release: âWe will reduce immigration overall.â Asked to repeat
this for the TV cameras later in the afternoon, she repeatedly refused,
speaking only about âcontrollingâ immigration. The reason this is difficult
territory for the Conservatives is that in some part of the UK, migrant workers
are desperately needed to keep public services going. The prime minister
is known to favour a policy that works for the needs of the economy, even if
that means migration numbers remain broadly where they are. Immigration is not the electoral issue it once was â
pollsters say it is at its lowest level of concern for almost two
decades. But some communities remain concerned that foreign arrivals put
extra pressure on public services and jobs - and those voters are often in Labour seats that the Tories are looking to take. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent As part of the Conservative's immigration push today, this banner graphic has appeared on Priti Patel's Twitter account. It predicts that Labour's purported ""open borders"" policy - which the party says is not true - would lead to a ""huge strain on the NHS and schools"". So what's the evidence of the strain caused so far by open borders and freedom of movement with the rest of the EU? Ms Patel's expert advisers, the Migration Advisory Committee, say there is little or no evidence of strain. Migrant workers tend to be younger and fitter and less likely to go to hospital. Evidence from education research shows that the presence of children who speak English as a second language improves the results of other children in the schools (the reason being they are highly motivated - and that motivates other kids). It's all in ahigh-profile report commissioned by the Home Office,externallast year as part of the plans to devise a new post-Brexit immigration system. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has weighed in on the immigration debate after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""not every dot and comma from conference"" will be in its manifesto.

Ms Swinson pledged to revoke Article 50 on the first day of her leadership if she is elected to Number 10 during a visit to the Guru Nanak Sikh temple in Glasgow. She said remaining in the EU would free up money for the health service, childcare and tackling climate change. ""There's a huge amount of priorities we want to be getting on to dealing with and of course, Brexit makes all of those things harder,"" she said. She added she is opposed to a second referendum on Scottish independence for the same reason that she is opposed to Brexit, saying: ""We work better when we are [close] together with our nearest neighbours."" Speaking about the Lib Dems' decision to take take legal action against ITV over its exclusion of her from a televised leaders' debate, she said: ""It's not a debate if you just have Leave debating Leave."" The Brexit Party's prospective candidate in Dudley North, Rupert Lowe, has announced he will not contest the election. Mr Lowe's decision goes against the insistence by Nigel Farage, the party's leader, that it would contest every seat not held by the Conservatives. Mr Lowe says his candidacy could split the Leave-supporting vote and therefore facilitate a Labour victory in the constituency. The move could be significant as the Tories are aiming to take Leave seats in the Midlands and northern England, which have traditionally voted Labour. The constituency's previous MP, Ian Austin, quit the Labour Party over its handling of anti-Semitism and is not running again. Allow Twitter content?

The government is in the ""early stages"" of discussions with Australian authorities about using parts of their points-based immigration system as a blue-print for the UK, says Home Secretary Priti Patel. She says the election limits what she can say about the policy development, but claims an equivalent of Australia's points-based system will give ""control back"" to the government. ""We can ensure that the brightest and best people with the right skills and our economy and our Labour market needs are prioritised from the entire world, so we're not discriminating, and it's not about putting EU citizens first and closing off other parts of the world,"" she says. Ms Patel says Labour has ""serious questions to answer"" about its immigration plans after shadow home secretary Diane Abbott tweeted that the party ""is committed to maintaining [and] extending Freedom of Movement rights"". Earlier today, she said the Tories would reduce ""immigration overall"" to the UK after Brexit. You can read where the different parties stand on immigration and other issueshere. Nick EardleyBBC political correspondent This evening Jeremy
Corbyn will wrap up his trip to Scotland with a rally in Edinburgh. Labour are
expecting hundreds of supporters to turn up. Winning seats in Scotland
could be crucial to Mr Corbynâs hopes of getting into No 10. And long gone
are the days when Labour could rely on definitely returning a healthy number of
MPs from Scotland. Despite recent disasters
at the polls - including coming fifth in the European elections - a number of
candidates Iâve spoken to are upbeat and say theyâre getting decent a reception
from voters. But this trip has not
gone according to plan for Mr Corbyn. Mr Corbyn has - not for
the first time - been unclear about Labourâs position on a second independence
referendum. Yesterday, he said he wouldnât allow one for in his first term (five years). He then said not in the âformative yearsâ of a Labour government. This
morning he suggested not in the first two years. This might all sound a
bit like splitting hairs, but some candidates here are worried that not being
clear on independence is harming their chances of winning votes from unionists,
who helped the party do well in 2017. One candidate told me earlier that Mr Corbynâs
comments had been a âbloody disasterâ. The fear is those who oppose
independence will side with the Conservatives or the Lib Dems - while independence supporters will vote SNP. Thereâs another school of
thought though. The Labour leadership in Scotland doesnât think independence will be a
key issue on 12 December. Theyâre confident that - over the next month - their
focus on ending austerity, investing in the economy and tackling climate change will cut
through. Mr Corbyn said this
morning in Midlothian that voters make their decision based on a number of
issues. Some in Scottish Labour are desperately hoping independence isnât the
main one. BBC News Channel Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna says today's NHS figures are a ""damning indictment"" of the Conservatives' handling of the health service. It came after data showed hospital peformance in Englandwas at its worst level on record. Umunna says stopping Brexit would help NHS recruitment. ""Now is not the time to be ending free movement on the EU when we are so reliant,"" he says. He adds the Lib Dems want to add 1p on every Â£1 in income tax to fund improvements to care. ""It won't provide us with all the money that we need,"" he says, adding that anyone claiming that only money will make a difference to problems in the NHS is ""lying"". The Ulster Unionist Party will run in 16 constituencies across Northern Ireland, despite previous suggestions that it would put forward candidates in all 18. Leader Steve Aiken says the party will no longer run in North Belfast, after coming under pressure over standing against Democratic Unionist deputy leader Nigel Dodds, nor in West Belfast, a seat which has traditionally been dominated by Sinn Fein. ""The future direction of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland's place within it is at stake,"" he says. ""We want to offer pro-Union voters a choice. A choice between Ulster Unionist candidates who will offer a positive, progressive vision for unionism, protecting our place within the United Kingdom and the DUP who have dropped the ball, allowing a border to be put up the Irish Sea and dragged the reputation of unionism into the gutter."" All nomination papers for candidates wanting to run for Parliament close at 4pm today. This means they will also have submitted their Â£500 deposit, which they do get back if they secure more than 5% of the votes in their seat. This is designed to prevent people from running as a joke, but candidates from established parties have occasionally lost their deposits. Once nominations are closed, local authorities will publish lists of candidates running in their area. The Electoral Commission will also publish lists for all constituencies. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the government's emergency response committee Cobra is to meet shortly to discuss the recent floods. Mr Johnson says in a tweet that 818 properties have been flooded and that troops are handing out over 20,000 sandbags to help protect more properties near the River Don, which crosses Yorkshire. The floods have been one of the unexpected events to hit the general election campaign, with more rain expected in affected areas today. Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says he does not think he will vote in the election. Speaking on a trip to Grimsby Seafood Village, where he was photographed eating cheesecake, Mr Farage says: ""I doubt I'll vote. I very much doubt I'll vote."" His party has stood down candidates in all 317 constituencies won by the Tories in 2017, including his own in Kent. On the notion of voting for the Tories, he says: ""It's this very narrow party interest, that's all they care about."" He adds that his last Conservative vote was in 1987, and that he spoiled his ballot paper in 1992 because he ""couldn't vote for John Major"". Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage showed ""leadership"" when he stood down candidates in constituencies won by the Tories in 2017, says Michelle Dewberry, winner of the second series of The Apprentice and the party's candidate for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle. ""Whether you agree or not, I think that it shows leadership and I think what we need to do now is unite around the party, and around the seats where we are standing to give us the best chance possible to get a decent number of seats in Westminster so that we can make a difference,"" she says.

"Curiosity has been exploring Gale Crater, which once hosted a body of liquid water The oxygen in Martian air is changing in a way that can't currently be explained by known chemical processes. That's the claim of scientists working on the Curiosity rover mission, who have been taking measurements of the gas. They discovered that the amount of oxygen in Martian ""air"" rose by 30% in spring and summer. The pattern remains a mystery, but researchers are beginning to narrow the possibilities. While the changes are most likely to be geological in nature, planetary scientists can't completely rule out an explanation involving microbial life. The results come from nearly six Earth years' (three Martian years') worth of data from the Sample Analysis at Mars (Sam) instrument, a portable chemistry lab in the belly of the Curiosity rover. The scientists measured seasonal changes in gases that fill the air directly above the surface of Gale Crater on Mars, where Curiosity landed. They havepublished their findings in the journal JGR-Planets.,external The Martian atmosphere is overwhelmingly composed of carbon dioxide (CO2), with smaller amounts of other gases such as molecular nitrogen (N2), argon (Ar), molecular oxygen (O2) and methane (CH4). Curiosity rover senses methane spike So where did the Mars methane go? Can this box answer the biggest question on Mars? Agencies aim to bring back rocks from Mars Nitrogen and argon followed a predictable seasonal pattern, changing according to how much CO2 was in the air (which is in turn linked to changes in air pressure). They expected oxygen to follow this pattern too, but it didn't. Oxygen rose during each northern hemisphere spring and then fell in the autumn. They considered the possibility that CO2 or water (H2O) molecules released oxygen when they broke apart in the atmosphere, leading to a short-lived rise. But it would take five times more water than there actually is to produce the additional oxygen, and CO2 breaks up too slowly to generate it over such a short time. ""We know oxygen is created and destroyed on Mars through the energy provided by sunlight breaking down CO2 and H2O, both of which are observed in the atmosphere of Mars. The thing that doesn't make sense is the size of the variation - it doesn't match what we expect to see,"" Dr Manish Patel, from the Open University - who was not involved with the study, told BBC News. ""Given that Curiosity makes measurements at the surface of Mars, it is tempting to think that this is coming from the surface - but we have no evidence for that. Geologically-speaking, it seems unlikely - I can't think of a process that would fit."" The results may point to a reservoir of oxygen close to the Martian surface Dr Timothy McConnochie, from the University of Maryland in College Park, who is one of the authors on the JGR-Planets paper, told the BBC: ""You can measure the water vapour molecules in the Martian atmosphere and you can measure the change in oxygen... There just aren't enough water molecules. ""Mars in general has a pretty small amount of water vapour, and there's several times more oxygen atoms that mysteriously appear than there is in the water vapour on the entire planet."" They also considered why the oxygen dropped back to levels predicted by known chemistry in the autumn. One idea was that solar radiation could break up oxygen molecules into two atoms, which then escaped into space. But after running the numbers, scientists concluded it would take at least 10 years for the oxygen to disappear in this way. In addition, the seasonal rises aren't perfectly repeatable; the amount of oxygen varies between years. The results imply that something is producing the gas and then taking it away. Dr McConnochie thinks the evidence suggests a source of oxygen in the near-surface. ""I think it points to a reservoir (of oxygen) in the soil that interchanges with the atmosphere,"" he said. ""To exchange (with the atmosphere) fairly rapidly on a seasonal timescale it has to be close to the surface. If it's deeper, any process is going to be slower,"" he told BBC News. An experiment carried out by the Viking landers in the 1970s provides tantalising clues in the oxygen mystery Some supporting evidence for this comes fromNasa's Viking landers,external, which touched down on the Red Planet in the 1970s. Results from the Viking Gas Exchange Experiment (GEX) showed that when the humidity was increased in a chamber containing a sample of Martian soil, it led to a release of oxygen. However, says Dr McConnochie, the temperature in the Viking spacecraft chamber was much warmer than it would be outside, even during spring and summer. This complicates any attempt to apply the results to the Martian environment: ""It's a tantalising clue, but it's not helping us solve the problem directly,"" he explained. Mars does become more humid during spring and summer. Water-ice gets deposited on the poles during the winter. Then, throughout the summer, there is a release of water vapour in the polar regions. There could be a link between the humidification of the entire planet at this time and the release of oxygen. Intriguingly, the changes in oxygen are similar to those seen for methane, which increases in abundance by about 60% in summer for inexplicable reasons. It's unclear whether there's any connection though. The methane mystery has attracted much attention over the years because most of Earth's methane is produced by living organisms. Though there are several ways that methane could be released by geological processes on Mars, the production of this gas by microbes living deep beneath the surface remains a tantalising possibility. Oxygen, too, can be produced by microorganisms. The possibility that biology is behind the changing levels of the gas in the Martian atmosphere can't be ruled out. But the scientific bar on such claims is set very high indeed. It's a very remote possibility, but we still don't understand enough about the behaviour of oxygen to use it as an indicator for life. In addition, the near sub-surface of Mars is a very difficult place to live because of the high levels of radiation that leak through the Martian atmosphere, large variations in temperature and limited availability of water. ""With current instruments on Mars spacecraft, we have no way of knowing whether biology is producing the springtime rise in oxygen. Abiotic processes look very promising, so we'll need to firmly rule them out first before pursuing microbial contribution,"" Prof Sushil Atreya, from the University of Michigan, who is a co-author on the study, told BBC News. But he added that future missions would make interrelated measurements that could shed light on Martian habitability. Dr Manish Patel says that oxygen can last for years in the Martian atmosphere Dr Patel said: ""Whilst I believe biological activity in the Martian sub-surface at some point in Mars' history is a real possibility, there is no way to explain this through oxygen-producing microbes - we are missing the copious other indicators that would come along with that. ""Maybe it's all hidden, but as a scientist, I can only comment on what we observe - and an extraordinary claim requires an extraordinary observation."" The notion of oxygen being locked up in some chemical form in the Martian soil remains much more likely. ""One phenomenon that applies to most gas molecules is they stick to surfaces... especially anything with a lot of surface area. That sticking, that adsorption, changes on the basis of temperature,"" Tim McConnochie explained. ""Oxygen is a very active molecule, so it changes to some other form and then sticks and then changes back. The tricky thing is the forms of oxygen we know about in the Martian soil are the ones that are pretty stable."" One of these stable molecules is a compound called perchlorate, which is widespread in Martian soil. It doesn't give up its oxygen easily, but it's possible that exposure to high energy radiation - cosmic rays, for example - could make some of it break down, leaving by-products. One potential by-product is hypochlorite - found in bleach - which is less stable and thus more prone to releasing its oxygen. ""I feel we're closer to an idea of how to release it from the soil than we are to an idea of how to sequester it back into the soil,"" said Tim McConnochie. But he explained: ""Presumably there is some cycle that sequesters it."" Prof Atreya explained: ""There are at least three potential abiotic reservoirs of oxygen in the surface/subsurface of Mars - oxidant, in the form of perchlorates; oxidant in the form of hydrogen peroxide; and oxidised rocks or hydrated minerals. ""Water-rock reactions in the past, or even today if liquid water exists beneath the surface or as brines, were most likely responsible for the third reservoir."" Dr Patel believes it may not be possible to apply the result from Gale Crater to the whole of Mars. ""This has been highlighted by the recent methane measurement, where Curiosity measured a huge amount of methane, but it wasn't detectable by the NOMAD and ACS instruments on the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, which makes measurements of these things at a global-scale and at higher sensitivity."" The authors of the study in JGR-Planets say they are throwing out the problem to scientists in the field, in a bid to harness expertise from across the community. We've learned huge amounts about the Red Planet over the last few decades, but it's clear from this there are still lots of puzzles to crack.

"Michael Weir was found guilty of two counts of murder at the Old Bailey A jewel thief who beat two elderly people to death in their own homes has been convicted of their murders two decades on. Michael Weir fatally attacked 78-year-old Leonard Harris and Rose Seferian, 83, in 1998, the Old Bailey was told. The original investigation missed clues to link the killings but DNA testing connected Weir to both London attacks after 20 years, the court heard. Weir, 52, of Hackney, had denied two counts of murder. Prosecutor Tom Little QC told the jury the ""defenceless pensioners"" had been struck repeatedly and ""left for dead"". Weir was originally found guilty of murdering Mr Harris by an Old Bailey jury in July 1999, but his conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2000 on a technicality. He was retried under the so-called double jeopardy law when new forensic evidence came to light, and prosecutors believe Weir is ""the first convicted man to be convicted twice"". Trial judge Mrs Justice McGowan told the jury they had made ""legal history"". Gertrude Harris and her husband Leonard were attacked in January 1998 On 28 January 1998, Weir broke into Mr Harris's flat in East Finchley, north London, leaving him with serious head injuries. The pensioner was found by an estate agent while his wife, who suffered from dementia, was left badly injured on a bedroom floor. An 18-carat gold watch Mr Harris had taken from a German soldier during World War Two and his gold ring were missing. Three days after the attack, police found a palm print on the bedroom door but missed the match to the defendant at the time, the court heard. On 5 March, Weir violently attacked Ms Seferian in her bedroom when she was at home on her own. He stole jewellery including a gold wedding ring with her husband's initials and the date of their marriage engraved on it, a diamond solitaire gold ring, and a silver diamond ring, as well as cash. Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent In 2005, the 800-year-old ""double jeopardy"" law that prevented a defendant from being tried a second time for the same offence was scrapped. From that point the Court of Appeal was able to grant a retrial if ""new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence"" had emerged. Billy Dunlop became the first person to be convicted under the new law. He brutally murdered Julie Hogg in 1989 but, after two trials in which jurors could not reach a verdict, he was acquitted. In 2006 he was convicted at a fresh trial following the law change. However, until today the law had only been used to convict those acquitted at a first trial - making Michael Weir the first defendant ever to be found guilty of the same murder, twice. And as the trial judge Mrs Justice McGowan told the jury, that made ""legal history"". Jurors were told a palm print found inside her Kensington flat on a window frame where Weir broke in was not matched to him until 2017. The trial heard that by 2018 new DNA evidence had been obtained and palm prints from both murder scenes were matched to Weir. It is believed to be the first time a defendant has been found guilty of the same murder twice, and where a second murder charge has been added to a double jeopardy case. Det Ch Insp Shaun Fitzgerald, from the Met, said: ""Nothing can ever take away the pain of Leonard and Rose's families but we hope this conviction brings them some kind of closure. ""Weir literally thought he had got away with murder but he now faces a considerable custodial sentence where he will have significant time to reflect on his utterly callous actions towards two completely innocent victims.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he is ""pro-immigration for talented people"" but he is ""also in favour of control"" Boris Johnson says he will seek to reduce unskilled migration coming into the UK, if the Tories win the election. Home Secretary Priti Patel made a commitment on Wednesday to reduce ""overall"" immigration to the UK. Asked about it, she said the Tories would ""look to reduce the numbers"" through better immigration controls but would not set ""arbitrary"" targets. Mr Johnson was also asked whether immigration would go down under a future Tory government. The prime minister said: ""I certainly think that when it comes to people who don't have a job to go to and are coming in in an uncontrolled way, we certainly need to be reducing that."" But he he added that he was ""in favour of people of talent coming to this country"". So where do main parties stand on immigration? Corbyn rules out 'arbitrary' immigration target What we can read into the polls at this stage Mr Johnson claimed in the past 20 years, the UK had seen ""a lot of people coming without a job to go to"", who were ""putting pressure on public services"" and did not ""necessarily have the skills that the economy demands"". Both Mr Johnson and Mrs Patel reiterated the Conservatives' plan for a ""points-based"" immigration system, which would apply to EU and non-EU migrants. Labour has yet to announce its policy on immigration. But Jeremy Corbyn said he would commit to ""a fair immigration process that recognised the huge contribution made by migrant workers to this country"". ""We have got to be realistic about the needs of our economy for bringing workers in, skilled workers in to help us,"" he added. An SNP spokesman said cutting immigration would be ""hugely damaging"" for the Scottish economy and called the issue to be devolved to the Scottish government. And the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesperson Christine Jardine called the Conservatives' approach ""an insult to the millions who have come to the UK and made it their home"". Ms Patel said in a statement released by the party on Wednesday: ""We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors. ""This can only happen if people vote for a Conservative majority government so we can leave the EU with a deal."" However, in an interview on Thursday, Ms Patel stopped short of committing to reducing the overall numbers of people coming to the UK. She said her party's policy would be ""firm but fair while at the same time we can absolutely look to reduce the numbers in the system by having control over our immigration policy"". Asked if the Conservatives would set a target for reducing immigration, Ms Patel said targets were ""arbitrary"" adding ""clearly that is where public confidence has been eroded in the past"". The Conservatives had previously pledged to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country - to below 100,000. Security Minister Brandon Lewis acknowledged that, by not fulfilling the pledge, the Conservatives had ""let people down"". Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? Has immigration held down wages? How could a UK points-based immigration system work? Ms Patel said a future Conservative government would seek to control immigration numbers through a points-based system. Under a points-based system, immigration applicants are assigned points according to a number of professional and personal characteristics, with higher points awarded for certain traits such as proficiency in the English language. The Conservatives say they will end free movement from the EU on 1 January 2021, if they win the election and get their Brexit deal through by 31 January. The government's immigration strategy fell into the parliamentary dustbin when the election was called. We still await the party manifestos but today the home secretary said in a press release: ""We will reduce immigration overall."" Asked to repeat this for the TV cameras later in the afternoon, she repeatedly refused, speaking only about ""controlling"" immigration. The reason this is difficult territory for the Conservatives is that in some part of the UK, migrant workers are desperately needed to keep public services going. The prime minister is known to favour a policy that works for the needs of the economy, even if that means migration numbers remain broadly where they are. Immigration is not the electoral issue it once was - pollsters say it is at its lowest level of concern for almost two decades. But some communities remain concerned that foreign arrivals put extra pressure on public services and jobs and those voters are often in the Labour seats that the Tories are looking to take. Labour members backed a party conference motion in Septemberdefending the right of EU migrants to live and work in the UK, to reject any immigration system based on quotas, caps, targets or incomes, and to extend migrant rights. But there is a debate at the top of the party over whether to include such a commitment in the party's general election manifesto, which is set to be finalised at a weekend meeting of its national executive committee. Unite union leader Len McCluskey, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, said extending free movement would not be ""sensible"",telling the Guardian,externalthat the only beneficiaries of uncontrolled immigration were ""the bosses of unscrupulous companies"". ""It's wrong in my view to have any greater free movement of labour unless you get stricter labour market regulation,"" he said. He said Labour had to heed public concerns over levels of unskilled immigration, as it was used to undercut the pay and conditions of British workers. ""If you don't understand those concerns, you fail to grasp the divisions that exist,"" he said. ""If we don't deal with the issues and concerns, we will create a vacuum that will be filled by a far right seeking to become the voice of the white working class."" Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said a Labour government would ""extend freedom of movement rights to all those legally entitled to be here"". Priti Patel claimed there would be a ""surge"" in immigration under a Labour government Labour promised to end free movement from Europe -  which is a condition of EU membership - in its 2017 general election manifesto, but some of the party's senior figures want to remain in the EU. Labour have said, if they win power, they will tear up Boris Johnson's Brexit agreement with the EU and negotiate a better deal based on a much stronger relationship with the EU's single market. Some within the party see Norway, which is outside the EU's political institutions but remains part of the single market as a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), as a model for the UK's future relationship. But the Conservatives claimed that if the UK was to remain in the EEA, it would have to accept free movement rules and that would see levels of net migration to the UK of 260,000 each year over the next decade If free movement rights were extended to non-EU countries, the Conservatives estimated that this figure could rise to an average of 840,000 a year - a number it said was based on ""official figures and the government's own methodology"". This is based on the assumption that Labour would allow free movement with the rest of the world and that the economy would continue to grow at its current level. According to the latest official figures, net migration totalled 226,000 in the year to March 2019. Although numbers have remained ""broadly stable"" since the end of 2016, EU immigration to the UK is currently at its lowest level since 2013. Labour said the Tories were knowingly misleading the public on its conference motion, which has no mention of geographically extending freedom of movement to other countries. Asked whether maintaining and extending free movement from the EU would be in their manifesto, Mr Corbyn said what goes in the manifesto is ""not necessarily every last dot and comma of every resolution passed at conference"". On Conservative accusations that immigration would rise under Labour, he said: ""I've no idea where they get those figures from - I suspect they just, quite simply, make them up.""

"Michael Weir was found guilty of two counts of murder at the Old Bailey A jewel thief who beat two elderly people to death in their own homes has been convicted of their murders two decades on. Michael Weir fatally attacked 78-year-old Leonard Harris and Rose Seferian, 83, in 1998, the Old Bailey was told. The original investigation missed clues to link the killings but DNA testing connected Weir to both London attacks after 20 years, the court heard. Weir, 52, of Hackney, had denied two counts of murder. Prosecutor Tom Little QC told the jury the ""defenceless pensioners"" had been struck repeatedly and ""left for dead"". Weir was originally found guilty of murdering Mr Harris by an Old Bailey jury in July 1999, but his conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2000 on a technicality. He was retried under the so-called double jeopardy law when new forensic evidence came to light, and prosecutors believe Weir is ""the first convicted man to be convicted twice"". Trial judge Mrs Justice McGowan told the jury they had made ""legal history"". Gertrude Harris and her husband Leonard were attacked in January 1998 On 28 January 1998, Weir broke into Mr Harris's flat in East Finchley, north London, leaving him with serious head injuries. The pensioner was found by an estate agent while his wife, who suffered from dementia, was left badly injured on a bedroom floor. An 18-carat gold watch Mr Harris had taken from a German soldier during World War Two and his gold ring were missing. Three days after the attack, police found a palm print on the bedroom door but missed the match to the defendant at the time, the court heard. On 5 March, Weir violently attacked Ms Seferian in her bedroom when she was at home on her own. He stole jewellery including a gold wedding ring with her husband's initials and the date of their marriage engraved on it, a diamond solitaire gold ring, and a silver diamond ring, as well as cash. Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent In 2005, the 800-year-old ""double jeopardy"" law that prevented a defendant from being tried a second time for the same offence was scrapped. From that point the Court of Appeal was able to grant a retrial if ""new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence"" had emerged. Billy Dunlop became the first person to be convicted under the new law. He brutally murdered Julie Hogg in 1989 but, after two trials in which jurors could not reach a verdict, he was acquitted. In 2006 he was convicted at a fresh trial following the law change. However, until today the law had only been used to convict those acquitted at a first trial - making Michael Weir the first defendant ever to be found guilty of the same murder, twice. And as the trial judge Mrs Justice McGowan told the jury, that made ""legal history"". Jurors were told a palm print found inside her Kensington flat on a window frame where Weir broke in was not matched to him until 2017. The trial heard that by 2018 new DNA evidence had been obtained and palm prints from both murder scenes were matched to Weir. It is believed to be the first time a defendant has been found guilty of the same murder twice, and where a second murder charge has been added to a double jeopardy case. Det Ch Insp Shaun Fitzgerald, from the Met, said: ""Nothing can ever take away the pain of Leonard and Rose's families but we hope this conviction brings them some kind of closure. ""Weir literally thought he had got away with murder but he now faces a considerable custodial sentence where he will have significant time to reflect on his utterly callous actions towards two completely innocent victims.""

"Political parties are generally in agreement about one thing - that the NHS needs more money. But is money all it takes? To answer this, it's helpful to look at whether the NHS is getting the best out of its existing budget  - and how that compares with other countries. There's no single way of measuring the efficiency of a health service, though various bodies have tried. Bloomberg's annual healthcare efficiency index, for example, looks simply at spending on healthcare versus life expectancy. Its latest report ranked 56 wealthy countries, based on 2015 data. It put the UK 35th - down from 21st the year before, partly reflecting the slowing of growth in spending on the NHS particularly in England. Hong Kong and Singapore - mixed public and private systems with elements of both government funding and insurance - came top. They were followed by Italy and Spain - with national health services - which both have higher life expectancies than the UK and spend less per person to achieve this. The UK was also beaten by France which has a system of social insurance paid for by the government, individuals and employers. Compared with35 other OECD countries,external(Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) - a group of rich nations - the UK spends an average amount on healthcare (about 9.8% of GDP) and has a slightly higher than average life expectancy for the group (81.3 years). Life expectancy is a reasonable proxy for how good a healthcare system is, but it's not a perfect one. While higher healthcare spending is linked to higher life expectancy, it's affected by other complicated social factors including diet and smoking. In the US, for example, opioid deaths and gun crime have been linked to a fall in life expectancy. It's also a fairly crude measure - living longer isn't the only thing most people would want to achieve from a health system. As a 2018 report by three health think tanks and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, entitled""How good is the NHS?,external"", said, UK patients were more likely than average to report having had a good experience of the health system. The think tanks said this was ""a valuable goal of health care in its own right"". UK patients were also less likely to say they skipped a consultation or prescription medicine because of cost. And looking just at life expectancy doesn't capture how good a health system is at dealing with conditions that may require long-term care but don't cause death. The 2018 report concludes that the NHS across the UK is relatively efficient, performing well in managing long-term conditions with ""an unusually low level of staffing and, in at least some categories, equipment"" compared with other countries. This suggests the NHS is doing quite well with the money it has. But equally, life expectancy measures don't capture experiences like waiting for a long time on a trolley in A&E or waiting in pain for a routine operation, which aren't fatal but are also not good experiences for patients. These have worsened as funding increases have slowed. The NHS is below average among OECD countries at treating the illnesses that are the most common direct causes of death. For example, the UK mortality rate for cancer and heart disease is higher than the average among similar countries and that's a longer-term trend. Part of the reason the UK does worse on cancer survival is that British patients present late with cancer symptoms, and get diagnosed at a later stage. That's not necessarily a funding issue. Across the UK, waiting times for routine surgery like hip replacements are about average, and waiting times in A&E just below average, compared with other rich countries. As the growth in funding has slowed, though, the NHS has become worse at seeing people within four hours in A&E and getting cancer patients into treatment within two months. This is significant for patients and their experience of the system, but it hasn't dramatically effected outcomes - although this may take some time to show up. Those worse than average trends pre-dated recent funding cutbacks, again suggesting there's something other than just money going on. Improving outcomes in the health service often requires funding plus other action - for example training and retaining more staff or launching public information campaigns. Money alone is not enough to make those things happen. The NHS is devolved, meaning each nation runs its own health system and can set its own priorities. On waits in A&E, Scotland has fared comparatively better than other UK nations. US-based foundation the Commonwealth Fund published a comparison in 2017 whichput the UK top out of 11 countries,externalfor healthcare performance. It looked at five areas including equity and access, as well as health outcomes and the care process. The UK came top partly because of the ranking's heavy weighting towards universal systems - since equity and access formed two out of the five criteria. When it came to health outcomes, though, the UK scored tenth out of 11 countries which detracts from the overall score. Although, arguably, the UK's relative equality of access to healthcare for both the rich and poor is a significant when it comes to assessing how well the health service is spending its money. The IFS, Health Foundation, King's Fund and Nuffield Trust say the NHS ""does better than health systems in comparable countries at protecting people from heavy financial costs when they are ill"" and that overall, ""the NHS performs neither as well as its supporters sometimes claim nor as badly as its critics often allege.""

"Elderly patients often have complex health problems Accident-and-emergency units in England have recorded their worst performance since current records began. The latest performance statistics also show a raft of other targets are being missed - including for cancer operations and routine surgery. The Department of Health and Social Care says this is in part due to unprecedented demand for services. Is this a fair argument? Measuring attendances in A&E - the front-door to the NHS - is a good way to look at just how much patient demand there is and an indication about whether the rest of the NHS is coping. Hospitals 'imploding' as waits at worst-ever level 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Looking back, from 2006 to 2019 there has been an average 2.2% annual increase in patient attendances at A&E. In October this year, there were about 2.2 million attendances at A&E departments - an increase of 4.4% compared with October 2018 (although just short of the all-time record). Much of the rising demand is said by the government to be due to an increasingly elderly population. From 2006 to 2019, the whole UK population rose by about 1% per year - but theproportion of those aged 85 or over has risen more rapidly,external. Figures from the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) indicatetreating an 80-year-old is, on average, almost four times as expensive as treating a 30-year-old,external. Older people are more likely to be living with long-term conditions for which there are no cures, notably dementia. They often also have multiple health problems, which can add to the cost and complexity of their care. Separate IFS research suggests cuts in social-care spending on people aged 65 or above, in the six years to 2014, led to increased use of A&E services, both in terms of the average number of visits per resident and the number of individual patients. The NHS says there are also pressures from high levels of obesity - which is linked to a wide range of health problems - in the population. Richard Murray, from the Kings Fund, said the number of people arriving at hospital had risen relentlessly over time. ""The difference now is that they are often a lot older, have multiple conditions and are sicker. ""Yes, there is a changing demographic but it was not that long ago that the NHS was still hitting A&E targets - the deterioration has come after 2013. ""If you pinch the wrong part of the system problems can surface elsewhere and it's often in A&E - for example complications with diabetes or worsening mental health."" It is not possible to compare current NHS figures with what happened in the latter years of the 20th Century - because the data is not comparable. But it is true to say the NHS has faced tough challenges throughout its history. In its early years, diseases such as smallpox, tuberculosis, and scarlet fever posed a problem. In the 1950s, there were as many as 8,000 polio cases a year. Improved healthcare and immunisation have meant many of the conditions that once drained resources have been tamed. But medical advances also mean people are living with illnesses that would previously have killed them. The Conservatives are promising a 3.4% increase in NHS spending, to train and recruit 6,000 new GPs, and 40 major hospital-building projects. Labour has topped that spending, pledging a 3.9% increase to cut waiting times and boost mental health. It is also promising bursaries for nurse training. Between 1955 and 2019, the NHS has had average annual spending increases of 4%. The Liberal Democrats have promised a penny-in-the-pound rise on all income tax bands, to raise extra money for mental health, public health and social care.

"Women should have the right to know what their male colleagues are being paid if they suspect pay discrimination, a gender equality charity has said. The Fawcett Society is calling for a change in the law to try to cut down on instances of unequal pay. But men can help by simply telling female colleagues what they earn, the charity added. The call comes asLabour pledges to close the gender pay gap by 2030. Fawcett Society chief executive Sam Smethers said: ""Pay secrecy means women cannot know if they are being paid equally and fairly. ""Even if they do suspect a man is earning more it is almost impossible to do anything about it. This is why we are calling for a change in the law."" She said that women need an enforceable ""right to know"" what their colleagues earn so that they can challenge unequal pay. ""Men can help by simply telling their female colleagues what they earn.  It really is that simple,"" Ms Smethers added. Shanti Kelemen, investor director at Brown Shipley, told BBC Radio 4's Programme that it should be ""all or nothing"". ""I just think giving women the right isn't the answer. Why not minorities, old people, young people?"" ""If I was going to implement something like this, use a system like Sweden where anyone can look at anyone's tax return. The catch is that everyone will know you've looked."" Under UK law, men and women are supposed to be paid the same for doing comparable work. The call from the Fawcett Society comes after the Labour Party pledgedto close the gender pay gap by 2030 if it wins the election. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women.

"Prof Ponsati greeted supporters as she arrived at the police station in Edinburgh on Thursday Former Catalan government minister Clara Ponsati has been bailed at Edinburgh Sheriff Court after handing herself in to police. The St Andrews University professor is wanted in Spain over her role in the Catalan independence movement. The 62-year-old appeared in court and was granted bail and allowed to keep her passport. Prof Ponsati's next court appearance has been scheduled for 12 December in Edinburgh. The full hearing is likely to take place in Spring 2020. She arrived at St Leonard's Police Station in the capital with her solicitor Aamer Anwar on Thursday morning and was transferred to the court hearing. The two emerged from the court to cheers from supporters. Mr Anwar said: ""Clara Ponsati faces a single charge of 'sedition' which relates to the organising of the referendum in her role as the minister for education. ""The warrant is full of contradictions and mistakes, whilst it accuses Clara of everything, in reality the warrant provides no real examples of any alleged crime. ""Clara submits that she should not be extradited for a 'show trial' in the Supreme Court, where she believes the only verdict would be one of guilt. "" He added: ""Clara views these charges as a 'politically-motivated prosecution'. We will submit that Clara's human rights cannot be guaranteed in the Spanish Courts. "" Prof Ponsati was greeted and cheered by supporters Sedition is the illegal act of inciting people to resist or rebel against a government in power. The crime no longer exists in Scotland. Mr Anwar said his client now trusted her fate to the Scottish justice system which she believes ""to be impartial, robust and independent"". The charges relate to Catalonia's October 2017 independence referendum - which the Spanish state deemed illegal and refused to sanction. Prof Ponsati was education minister in the Catalan government at the time. If extradited and convicted, she could face a sentence of up to 15 years. Catalonia's bid for independence from Spain explained Catalonia crisis in 300 words On 6 November, Mr Anwar advised the academic not to report to police because of ""glaring contradictions"" in the arrest warrant. Mr Anwar said the warrant was translated by a senior judge, Pablo Llarena, and the UK authorities were seeking clarifications on the 59-page document. Following clarification from Judge Llarena, it was finally accepted by the UK authorities for execution. The latest European warrant was issued after a previous warrant was withdrawn last summer. The development comes after nine Catalan leaders were convicted of sedition over their role in the 2017 referendum. Riot police in Barcelona tried to disperse protesters who set up burning barricades last month Protestserupted in Barcelona last monthafter they were sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison by Spain's Supreme Court. Prosecutors argued that the unilateral declaration of independence was an attack on the Spanish state and accused some of those involved of a serious act of rebellion. They also said separatist leaders had misused public funds while organising the 2017 referendum.

"The elm is is named after creatures in JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings stories A tree known as the Last Ent of Affric is the ""symbolic leader"" of a campaign aiming to halt Dutch elm disease. The elm stands alone in Glen Affric, south of Inverness, and its location is credited with protecting it from the beetle that spreads the disease. Recently named Scotland's tree of the year, it has a face-like shape on its trunk and is named after creatures in JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. It has now been adopted for the ElmWatch campaign. 'Lord of the Rings' elm wins tree of the year Warm weather helped spread tree disease The campaign's organisers hope to raise awareness about Dutch elm disease and the measures people can take to help stop it spreading to disease-free areas. Alasdair Firth, of Woodland Trust Scotland, said: ""Dutch elm disease has swept round the north-east of Scotland to Inverness and is now making its way along the Great Glen towards the west coast. ""There are healthy elm populations on the west coast now under threat. ""The ElmWatch campaign launched today aims to stop the spread of the disease and carry out research to secure the future of the species."" The Last Ent of Affric stands alone in a Highlands glen Dr Euan Bowditch, of the Wooded Landscapes Research Group at Inverness College UHI, said diseased firewood is one way the infection can be spread. ""The beetles are hitchhiking their way across the Highlands, most likely through the transport of diseased wood that will infect and kill more trees,"" he said. ""If we can limit the movement of infected elm wood, we can give healthy elm populations, such as those in the west, a shot at survival."" Public agency Scottish Forestry is urging the public to avoid moving elm timber and firewood. John Risby, of Scottish Forestry, said: ""Major infection has spread around the Moray Firth in the last four years. ""The beetle cannot fly far and would be unlikely to make it to the west coast unaided.""

"Mavis Bran died six days after sustaining severe burns at the chip shop A man accused of murdering his wife in their chip shop described how hot oil fell on her chest ""like a waterfall"" after she accidentally slipped. Geoffrey Bran, 71, denies murdering his wife Mavis Bran, 69, in Hermon, Carmarthenshire, on 23 October 2018. Mrs Bran died in Morriston Hospital six days after suffering burns. Swansea Crown Court heard Mr Bran had told detectives he had not lost his temper following an argument about burnt fish. He has claimed Mrs Bran sustained the burns in an accident. ""At the corner of my eye I could see the fat fryer moving as if it was in slow motion,"" he told the court. ""The front legs slipped off the table, instantly the legs fell off the edge and the weight of the oil tipped the whole thing forward, the whole two tubs came out in one whoosh. ""One of the legs got to the edge and the weight of the oil must have moved things fast and it was like a waterfall and it landed on her chest."" The couple ran The Chipoteria in Carmarthenshire, one of a number of businesses they owned Mr Bran said he moved his wife and sat her up to take off her oil soaked clothes after the accident. ""I didn't know if I was doing the right thing to be honest,"" he added. ""I just grabbed the bottom of her jumper and pulled it over her head."" He told her to run to their house and ask their lodger Gareth to call an ambulance. The defendant said his wife had turned to drink that caused ""paranoic"" moments and she would ""blame him for everything"". He said she consumed two and a half bottles of wine a day and was drinking from 09:30 on the morning of the accident. Describing their relationship, he said: ""There was a few arguments. Nothing serious."" Geoffrey Bran denies murdering his wife He described how the couple met in 1980 and married four years later. Mr Bran told the jury Mavis was the ""business brain"" and he carried out renovations on a string of businesses they owned together including restaurants, pubs and cafes. The court heard when paramedics arrived at Bryn Tawel, the family home, Mrs Bran had a blood alcohol reading of 108 mg/dl. The current drink drive limit in England and Wales is 80mg/dl. When asked whether he threw oil over his wife at The Chipoteria in Hermon, Mr Bran told detectives: ""I would not throw oil over anybody."" He was asked why he did not follow Mrs Bran back to their house after she was injured, and replied: ""There was nothing I could do"", adding he did not call for an ambulance because he believed their lodger was doing so. Steven Jeffery, a consultant burns and plastic surgeon, agreed with the pathologist's report that Mrs Bran's eyes were closed when her face was burnt. ""The eyes were actually scrunched up,"" he said. Prof Jeffery was asked whether Mrs Bran's burns could have been sustained by her falling to the floor and pulling the fryer down over herself. ""This version of events is consistent with her injuries,"" he said. He also agreed her injuries may have been caused by oil being thrown at her in an assault. Prof Jeffrey said there were no cuts or bruises to suggest Mrs Bran had pulled the fryer on top of herself. Christopher Clee QC, defending Mr Bran, said:Â  ""If it's an act of throwing, he's more likely to have splashed himself with oil. There's no evidence of that?"" ""No,"" Prof Jeffery replied. He confirmed burns on Mr Bran's fingertips were consistent with his version of events. Mr Bran denies murder and the case continues.

"A total of 29 women aged 20 to 40 believed to be victims of trafficking were rescued in the operation by the Met Seventeen people have been arrested in early morning raids across east London in an international human trafficking investigation. A total of 29 women aged 20 to 40 were rescued in the operation by the Met, supported by officers from Romania. The potential victims were taken to a ""place of safety"", and the suspects, 14 men and three women, remain in custody. Sixteen warrants were executed at properties in Redbridge, Havering, Barking and Dagenham and Tower Hamlets. The suspects, who were aged between 17 and 50, were held on suspicion of modern slavery, controlling prostitution, Class A drug offences and firearm offences relating to a stun gun. They remain in custody in a central London police station. Four warrants were carried out in Romania at the same time, leading to the arrest of a man in Constanta. Det Ch Insp Richard McDonagh, said: ""The Met recognises the seriousness of modern slavery and the devastation it brings to people's lives. ""Today's synchronised operational activity [had] the aim of, in one fell swoop, dismantling an organised crime network and providing support to the victims."" A spokesman for Romanian police in the UK said: ""Romanian police officers working shoulder to shoulder with our British partners is a great achievement, a proof of our mutual permanent support and a great professional reward.""

"University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane died on the night before her 22nd birthday A man accused of murdering a British backpacker told police he struggled to put her body in a suitcase, a court has heard.

He denies murdering Ms Millane, who was from Wickford in Essex. Prosecutors have told Auckland High Court the 27-year-old defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, strangled Ms Millane on 1 December 2018 after a Tinder date. But his defence team claim the death was an accident during consensual sex.

""I was very scared and called out to her and tried to move her to see if she was awake,"" he said. After discovering she was not breathing, the defendant said he ""panicked"" and went out to buy a suitcase and cleaning products before trying to hide her body. ""I remember putting Grace in the suitcase, I was just in shock, I couldn't put her in it, it didn't seem right, it didn't seem right,"" he said. Grace Millane was found buried in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland The defendant said he left Ms Millane ""half in half out of the suitcase"" in his Auckland hotel room while he went to buy bleach and then again when he went on a Tinder date.

"Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are all social-media influencers The money made by social-media influencers has risen meteorically in the last few years, according to a new report. Marketing firm Izea found,externalthe average price of a sponsored photo on Instagram has jumped from $134 (Â£104) in 2014 to $1,642 (Â£1,276) in 2019. Brands appear willing to pay handsomely to sponsor posts, videos, stories and blogs, too,says Business Insider,external. But one expert insists it will not mean the end of traditional advertising. ""Digital marketing is the equivalent of word of mouth but there will always be a mix between that and traditional advertising,"" said Yuval Ben-Itzhak, chief executive of social media marketing platform Socialbakers. The report looked at sponsored content on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and blogs, examining negotiated rates from 2014 to 2019. From micro-influencers - people with fewer than 100,000 followers - to celebrities, it found that there was good money to be made. Among the findings were: The average cost for a sponsored Instagram photo has risen 44% from 2018 to 2019 alone For a sponsored blog post it has soared from $7.39 in 2006 to $1,442 in 2019 YouTube videos command the highest fees - four times that of the next highest-priced form of sponsored content - up from $420 in 2014 to $6,700 in 2019 A Facebook status update has risen from $8 in 2014 to $395 in 2019 A Twitter post has risen from $29 in 2014 to $422 in 2019 Blog posts have risen from $407 to $1,442 As more and more people join the rush to become social-media influencers, the industry has gained more scrutiny from regulators. Last month, three influencers had Instagram posts touting diet products banned by the Advertising Standards Authority, which dubbed them ""irresponsible"". And at the beginning of the year, the Competition and Markets Authority warned that some influencer posts could break consumer law if they did not make clear when posts endorsing products were ads. Zoe Sugg (Zoella), singer Rita Ora and model Rosie Huntingon-Whiteley were among16 influencers who agreed to change the way they posted content,external. Brands will continue to pour money into social-media advertising, according to data from Socialbakers. Its research suggests that influencer-sponsored posts grew by 150% in the last year, with the use of the hashtag #ad more than doubling. It predicts that brands will up their spend on influencer marketing in 2020, making it a $10bn industry. Instagram is currently experimenting with hiding ""likes"" on posts but Mr Ben-Itzhak does not think this will have an impact on the influencer industry. ""Influencers will still be able to see what engagement they have and it is common practice to grant permission to brands so that they can see that too,"" he said. ""The bigger question will be whether consumers will continue to engage when they can't see 'likes'."" Instagram influencers: Have we stopped believing?

"The new Razr is ever-so-slightly thicker when folded compared to the 2004 original Motorola has revived its slim Razr flip phone, some 15 years after the original âgame changingâ device hit the market. The new device features a 6.2in screen which folds together when closed, with another, smaller screen to display notifications on its outer shell. The device will be sold for $1,500, starting in the US on 26 December, with other markets coming later. Analysts told the BBC they did not expect the device to have much impact on the global smartphone sales. âThe question everyone will be asking is whether this foldable device will change Motorola fortunes, because their market share is extremely small,â said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst with IDC. ""Honestly, I donât think it will."" But the new Razr is, at the very least, being seen as an innovative statement piece from Motorola, which is now a unit of Chinese giant Lenovo, having being acquired - from previous owner Google - in 2014. The new Motorola Razr is all-screen on the inside rather than featuring the thin keypad of its predecessor âIn the current era of similar looking black rectangular phones with touch screens, the new Motorola Razr has the potential to bring some excitement back into the market,â said Ben Wood, from CCS Insight. ""I have little doubt that Lenovo will struggle to keep up with demand as soon as it is available to buy.â Reports prior to the deviceâs launch suggested only 200,000 units would be available - but the company would not confirm this. It will come to the UK in early 2020, and be exclusive to EE's network. Motorola is describing its new Razr as an âimpossibleâ feat of engineering, with a fold that closes flush against the other side. Samsungâs Galaxy Fold, by contrast, has a considerable gap between each screen when folded. âWith the new Razr we had to rethink how to engineer a phone,â said Glenn Schultz, the firmâs head of product development. âOur zero-gap hinge allowed us to bring to market a device that folds completely in half. Many didnât believe we could do it, but let me tell you, it's fun to work on something that everyone thinks is impossible.â The external screen displays notifications and allows basic functionality Motorolaâs intent to release its first foldable device became apparent at the beginning of this year when the firmâsapplication for a patent was discovered by mobile phone news blog 91 Mobiles,external. Reports had suggested the device would be released in the summer, but it suffered unspecified setbacks. That allowed other manufacturers, such as Samsung, to beat them to market. However, Samsungâs haste meant its Galaxy Folddevice was besieged with problems, and the company has warned about the $2,000 deviceâs durability. The firm said the new Razr was water resistant, though in an attempt to reassure consumers, Motorola said its screen could be replaced free of charge within 24 hours, while the product is still under warranty. The new Razr will become the first flip phone - or âclam shellâ - to make use of a foldable screen. When shut, the device has a thickness of 14mm. The original Razr was 13.9mm. The outer screen - which the company refers to as the Quick View display - can be used to view notifications, reply to messages (using either a fixed response or a voice reply), take calls and make contactless payments. At its developersâ conference in October, Samsung teased a similar vertically-folding phone on stage, but did not offer any specifics, saying it was simply âexploringâ the idea. The Razr will initially be released in the US, ahead of other markets in 2020 The slow emergence of foldable devices presents an opening for the more minor players in the sector to release a breakthrough device, just as Motorola did in 2004 with its original Razr, famed for its slim build and metallic aesthetic. It was unveiled to the world with the help of Paris Hilton and David Beckham, who were photographed extensively while holding up the device; side on so people could see how strikingly slim it was. Paris Hilton was on hand to promote the Razr phone when it first launched some 15 years ago By creating arguably the first mobile device to successfully cross the bridge from tech into fashion, Motorolaâs mobile devices business soared. By 2006, less than two years after Razrâs debut, Motorola was selling almost a quarter of the worldâs mobile phones, second only to Finnish giant Nokia. âThe Motorola Razr V3 was an extraordinary device,â recalled Mr Wood. âIt was a true fashion icon, initially in silver aircraft grade aluminium. Later there were a whole spectrum of colours, notably the highly successful pink Razr and also the memorable Dolce & Gabbana version - which at the time cost an eye-watering Â£400.â But then the iPhone arrived. Motorolaâs market share fell off a cliff - from 21.4% in 2007, to 13.9% just a year later. It has been mostly falling ever since, to around 2% today. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"We knew this was going to be a strange election. It's been a strange few years. But while the parties are eagerly trying to stick to their familiar scripts - the Tories on Brexit, the Labour Party on public services, something far less recognisable is going on too in this campaign. It started with Ian Austin last week, the former Labour MP who urged voters to choose Boris Johnson instead. You canread about it here. Another former Labour MP, John Woodcock, joined him, then today another former Labour minister, Tom Harris,wrote spikily today,externalalso urging people to back the Conservatives rather than his old party. All three of these have switched their support to another party and then overtly made the case for their old rivals. And it's fully breaking out on the other side too. David Gauke, who only resigned from the Cabinet a few months ago, has not just decided to stand as an independent candidate after losing the Conservative whip, but has publicly urged voters to take a good look at the Liberal Democrats, saying that a Boris Johnson majority would be bad for the country. This video can not be played Former Tory minister David Gauke: ""A Conservative majority... will take us in the direction of a very hard Brexit"" Mr Gauke is hot on the heels of the former Conservative MP, minister, and Boris Johnson's one time ally at London's City Hall, Nick Boles whoslammed Boris Johnson's character. Of course, in the last few weeks of the Parliament of 2019 there were a fair number of defections to the Liberal Democrats over Brexit. But it feels different now we are actually in a campaign to have politicians popping up to cheer for a party that is not their own. It's partly because both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are politicians who infuriate some members, and former members, of their own political parties. They both face regular questions about their character, not just their policies. But it's also because Brexit has created new faultlines in our politics. The line between Leavers and Remainers is a zigzag, not a reliable party division. All of the big parties have designed their strategies with this fragmentation in mind. Whether that is the Lib Dems trying to appeal to Labour voters who want to stay in the EU, or the Tories targeting Labour voters who wanted to leave. One of the big questions the results on Friday the 13th will answer is the extent to which the old allegiances actually apply.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he is ""pro-immigration for talented people"" but he is ""also in favour of control"" Boris Johnson says he will seek to reduce unskilled migration coming into the UK, if the Tories win the election. Home Secretary Priti Patel made a commitment on Wednesday to reduce ""overall"" immigration to the UK. Asked about it, she said the Tories would ""look to reduce the numbers"" through better immigration controls but would not set ""arbitrary"" targets. Mr Johnson was also asked whether immigration would go down under a future Tory government. The prime minister said: ""I certainly think that when it comes to people who don't have a job to go to and are coming in in an uncontrolled way, we certainly need to be reducing that."" But he he added that he was ""in favour of people of talent coming to this country"". So where do main parties stand on immigration? Corbyn rules out 'arbitrary' immigration target What we can read into the polls at this stage Mr Johnson claimed in the past 20 years, the UK had seen ""a lot of people coming without a job to go to"", who were ""putting pressure on public services"" and did not ""necessarily have the skills that the economy demands"". Both Mr Johnson and Mrs Patel reiterated the Conservatives' plan for a ""points-based"" immigration system, which would apply to EU and non-EU migrants. Labour has yet to announce its policy on immigration. But Jeremy Corbyn said he would commit to ""a fair immigration process that recognised the huge contribution made by migrant workers to this country"". ""We have got to be realistic about the needs of our economy for bringing workers in, skilled workers in to help us,"" he added. An SNP spokesman said cutting immigration would be ""hugely damaging"" for the Scottish economy and called the issue to be devolved to the Scottish government. And the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesperson Christine Jardine called the Conservatives' approach ""an insult to the millions who have come to the UK and made it their home"". Ms Patel said in a statement released by the party on Wednesday: ""We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors. ""This can only happen if people vote for a Conservative majority government so we can leave the EU with a deal."" However, in an interview on Thursday, Ms Patel stopped short of committing to reducing the overall numbers of people coming to the UK. She said her party's policy would be ""firm but fair while at the same time we can absolutely look to reduce the numbers in the system by having control over our immigration policy"". Asked if the Conservatives would set a target for reducing immigration, Ms Patel said targets were ""arbitrary"" adding ""clearly that is where public confidence has been eroded in the past"". The Conservatives had previously pledged to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country - to below 100,000. Security Minister Brandon Lewis acknowledged that, by not fulfilling the pledge, the Conservatives had ""let people down"". Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? Has immigration held down wages? How could a UK points-based immigration system work? Ms Patel said a future Conservative government would seek to control immigration numbers through a points-based system. Under a points-based system, immigration applicants are assigned points according to a number of professional and personal characteristics, with higher points awarded for certain traits such as proficiency in the English language. The Conservatives say they will end free movement from the EU on 1 January 2021, if they win the election and get their Brexit deal through by 31 January. The government's immigration strategy fell into the parliamentary dustbin when the election was called. We still await the party manifestos but today the home secretary said in a press release: ""We will reduce immigration overall."" Asked to repeat this for the TV cameras later in the afternoon, she repeatedly refused, speaking only about ""controlling"" immigration. The reason this is difficult territory for the Conservatives is that in some part of the UK, migrant workers are desperately needed to keep public services going. The prime minister is known to favour a policy that works for the needs of the economy, even if that means migration numbers remain broadly where they are. Immigration is not the electoral issue it once was - pollsters say it is at its lowest level of concern for almost two decades. But some communities remain concerned that foreign arrivals put extra pressure on public services and jobs and those voters are often in the Labour seats that the Tories are looking to take. Labour members backed a party conference motion in Septemberdefending the right of EU migrants to live and work in the UK, to reject any immigration system based on quotas, caps, targets or incomes, and to extend migrant rights. But there is a debate at the top of the party over whether to include such a commitment in the party's general election manifesto, which is set to be finalised at a weekend meeting of its national executive committee. Unite union leader Len McCluskey, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, said extending free movement would not be ""sensible"",telling the Guardian,externalthat the only beneficiaries of uncontrolled immigration were ""the bosses of unscrupulous companies"". ""It's wrong in my view to have any greater free movement of labour unless you get stricter labour market regulation,"" he said. He said Labour had to heed public concerns over levels of unskilled immigration, as it was used to undercut the pay and conditions of British workers. ""If you don't understand those concerns, you fail to grasp the divisions that exist,"" he said. ""If we don't deal with the issues and concerns, we will create a vacuum that will be filled by a far right seeking to become the voice of the white working class."" Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said a Labour government would ""extend freedom of movement rights to all those legally entitled to be here"". Priti Patel claimed there would be a ""surge"" in immigration under a Labour government Labour promised to end free movement from Europe -  which is a condition of EU membership - in its 2017 general election manifesto, but some of the party's senior figures want to remain in the EU. Labour have said, if they win power, they will tear up Boris Johnson's Brexit agreement with the EU and negotiate a better deal based on a much stronger relationship with the EU's single market. Some within the party see Norway, which is outside the EU's political institutions but remains part of the single market as a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), as a model for the UK's future relationship. But the Conservatives claimed that if the UK was to remain in the EEA, it would have to accept free movement rules and that would see levels of net migration to the UK of 260,000 each year over the next decade If free movement rights were extended to non-EU countries, the Conservatives estimated that this figure could rise to an average of 840,000 a year - a number it said was based on ""official figures and the government's own methodology"". This is based on the assumption that Labour would allow free movement with the rest of the world and that the economy would continue to grow at its current level. According to the latest official figures, net migration totalled 226,000 in the year to March 2019. Although numbers have remained ""broadly stable"" since the end of 2016, EU immigration to the UK is currently at its lowest level since 2013. Labour said the Tories were knowingly misleading the public on its conference motion, which has no mention of geographically extending freedom of movement to other countries. Asked whether maintaining and extending free movement from the EU would be in their manifesto, Mr Corbyn said what goes in the manifesto is ""not necessarily every last dot and comma of every resolution passed at conference"". On Conservative accusations that immigration would rise under Labour, he said: ""I've no idea where they get those figures from - I suspect they just, quite simply, make them up.""

Heavy rain has forced a major route into Hull to close in both directions between South Cave and Melton, in East Yorkshire, causing travel disruption. The A63 is the only link between the M62 motorway and the city. Highways England said the closure was ""due to increased flooding from water running off the surrounding fields"". 'Increased flooding' in East Yorkshire has forced the closure of a major route into Hull Northern Rail warned commuters not to travel between Sheffield, Gainsborough and Lincoln until further notice. East Midlands Railway (EMR) said Network Rail was working to lower the water level at the flooded track in Draycott and disruptions would continue through Friday. Wet weather over the next 48 hours could bring heavy flooding to areas already affected by rising waters, the Environment Agency (EA) said.

"Mavis Bran died six days after sustaining severe burns at the chip shop A man accused of murdering his wife in their chip shop described how hot oil fell on her chest ""like a waterfall"" after she accidentally slipped. Geoffrey Bran, 71, denies murdering his wife Mavis Bran, 69, in Hermon, Carmarthenshire, on 23 October 2018. Mrs Bran died in Morriston Hospital six days after suffering burns. Swansea Crown Court heard Mr Bran had told detectives he had not lost his temper following an argument about burnt fish. He has claimed Mrs Bran sustained the burns in an accident. ""At the corner of my eye I could see the fat fryer moving as if it was in slow motion,"" he told the court. ""The front legs slipped off the table, instantly the legs fell off the edge and the weight of the oil tipped the whole thing forward, the whole two tubs came out in one whoosh. ""One of the legs got to the edge and the weight of the oil must have moved things fast and it was like a waterfall and it landed on her chest."" The couple ran The Chipoteria in Carmarthenshire, one of a number of businesses they owned Mr Bran said he moved his wife and sat her up to take off her oil soaked clothes after the accident. ""I didn't know if I was doing the right thing to be honest,"" he added. ""I just grabbed the bottom of her jumper and pulled it over her head."" He told her to run to their house and ask their lodger Gareth to call an ambulance. The defendant said his wife had turned to drink that caused ""paranoic"" moments and she would ""blame him for everything"". He said she consumed two and a half bottles of wine a day and was drinking from 09:30 on the morning of the accident. Describing their relationship, he said: ""There was a few arguments. Nothing serious."" Geoffrey Bran denies murdering his wife He described how the couple met in 1980 and married four years later. Mr Bran told the jury Mavis was the ""business brain"" and he carried out renovations on a string of businesses they owned together including restaurants, pubs and cafes. The court heard when paramedics arrived at Bryn Tawel, the family home, Mrs Bran had a blood alcohol reading of 108 mg/dl. The current drink drive limit in England and Wales is 80mg/dl. When asked whether he threw oil over his wife at The Chipoteria in Hermon, Mr Bran told detectives: ""I would not throw oil over anybody."" He was asked why he did not follow Mrs Bran back to their house after she was injured, and replied: ""There was nothing I could do"", adding he did not call for an ambulance because he believed their lodger was doing so. Steven Jeffery, a consultant burns and plastic surgeon, agreed with the pathologist's report that Mrs Bran's eyes were closed when her face was burnt. ""The eyes were actually scrunched up,"" he said. Prof Jeffery was asked whether Mrs Bran's burns could have been sustained by her falling to the floor and pulling the fryer down over herself. ""This version of events is consistent with her injuries,"" he said. He also agreed her injuries may have been caused by oil being thrown at her in an assault. Prof Jeffrey said there were no cuts or bruises to suggest Mrs Bran had pulled the fryer on top of herself. Christopher Clee QC, defending Mr Bran, said:Â  ""If it's an act of throwing, he's more likely to have splashed himself with oil. There's no evidence of that?"" ""No,"" Prof Jeffery replied. He confirmed burns on Mr Bran's fingertips were consistent with his version of events. Mr Bran denies murder and the case continues.

"Disability benefits assessments were beset by ""poor decision-making"" and ""obvious inaccuracies"", charities said Four in five appeals processed in Wales against UK government decisions to deny people disability benefits succeeded, new data shows. Success of appeals in Cardiff, covering Wales and south-west England, rose from 51% in 2013-14, to 80% between April and December 2018. A terminally ill man who helps people through the appeals process said he was ""dreading"" his upcoming assessment. Government officials said appeals made up a small share of all claims. Charities said the success rate of appeals showed benefits assessments were beset by ""poor decision-making"" and ""obvious inaccuracies"". Cardiff is one of seven administrative centres in the UK for appeals against government decisions on whether to award people benefits - it also covers the south-west of England, stretching as far as Hampshire, Dorset and the Isle of Wight. The Welsh capital's HM Courts and Tribunals Service (HMCTS) centre processed 145,616 appeals against decisions related to disability benefits between 2013 and 2018. Of these, almost 94,000 - 65% - were successful. Benefits assessments are carried out on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly Atos) and Maximus. Simon Green is terminally ill and worried about an upcoming assessment by Capita A man with a brain tumour who was told he would not live to see last Christmas said he was ""scared"" of an upcoming assessment due to be carried out by Capita. Simon Green, 43, chairman of the Bridgend Coalition of Disabled People, uses a wheelchair as a result of living with neurofibromatosis, a degenerative condition which he was diagnosed with when he was 12. He had a successful operation which has extended his life, but he still has the tumour, which he said is currently ""behaving"". ""I had my letter from Capita and I'm dreading it - I'm scared,"" he said. ""I've helped people who have been through the appeals process and it just so frustrating. I've read the letters and thought 'that's not what was said'. ""I believe they are turning people down, hoping they don't appeal."" The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed figures from Freedom of Information responses from HMCTS and Northern Ireland's Department for Communities (DfC). Across the UK, more than 550,000 people won an appeal over their disability benefits decisionbetween 2013 and 2018. Half of disability benefits appeals won in court 8,000 win appeals over benefit cuts across Wales 'I had to sell my belongings to live' Most of the appeals concerned Employment Support Allowance (ESA), which is paid to people unable to work because of illness or disability, the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which is paid to people with extra care or mobility needs, and Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which was introduced to replace DLA. Since 2013, people seeking to overturn a benefits ruling must complete a written challenge within a month, known as a mandatory reconsideration. If unsuccessful, people can appeal against the decision at tribunal. The DWP said mandatory reconsiderations were introduced to ensure claimants received the right decision without having to go to court. Critics say the process is confusing, stressful and does not give claimants enough time to gather evidence to support their appeal. The increasing success rate comes despite a 55% drop in the overall number of appeals heard by tribunals in Wales and south-west England. Charities said the introduction of the mandatory reconsideration andcuts to legal aidhad put people off appealing. The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (LASPO) withdrew aid from areas of law including family, welfare, housing and debt. ""I think it's highly likely it [LASPO] had a negative effect. LASPO took away much of the funding for specialist advisers at advice centres meaning there was less support available,"" said Daphne Hall, of the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers. Ms Hall called the mandatory reconsideration an ""extra layer"" in the appeals process which made it more difficult to reach the hearing stage in court. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""pure speculation"" to suggest a decline in the number of benefit appeals was down to legal aid changes. Alexandra Devlin, pictured with her husband Michael, found out she had MS about 20 years ago Alexandra Devlin, a former financial adviser from Cardiff, found out she had multiple sclerosis (MS) almost 20 years ago. Earlier this year she was visited by an assessor who was ""typing all the time"" and ""did not ask her relevant questions"" about the challenges resulting from her condition. She said she was denied the higher rate of the daily living element of PIP - about Â£100 a month - based on assumptions about how well she could use her hands. ""The letter came back and said 'she's fine from the waist up' and 'she can dress herself'. She never asked these things and they weren't true,"" Mrs Devlin said. With the help of MS Society, she appealed and provided the court with documents describing her entire medical history. ""When I arrived at the tribunal, someone came out and said 'you will be pleased to know we have read through you notes and we will be awarding you the higher level of PIP'. ""I thought 'that's lovely, but what about the people who would have struggled to get here'. It all felt so unnecessary."" A DWP spokesman said: ""We are committed to ensuring people get the support they are entitled to and spend Â£55bn a year supporting disabled people and those with health conditions. ""We have been improving the assessment process and just 4% of all ESA decisions and 5% of all PIP decisions are overturned at appeal."" Capita and Maximus said the majority of people were satisfied with the process and they worked with charities and disabled people's organisations to improve their services further.

"This video can not be played What do these visitors to St Fagans museum know about Welsh history? ""Must-have"" historical topics should be taught so Welsh school pupils know ""our national story"", a report has said. A Welsh assembly committee heard there could be inconsistency unless there was more specific guidanceunder the new curriculum, which begins in 2022. In particular, they warned there was a risk the history of ethnic minorities could be overlooked. The Welsh Government said there would be guidance and resources on key historical events and topics. The culture committee said the new curriculum could allow for greater scope to teach Welsh history, but there should be clear guidance on what should be included. Rise of towers and fall of Tiger Bay Q&A: Draft school curriculum for Wales It also said a review of current Welsh history teaching was needed in order to understand how it should be delivered when the curriculum changes. During an inquiry, the committee heard Welsh history teaching was ""patchy"" and varied between schools. During the Rebecca Riots in the 1830s and 40s, men dressed as women to attack toll gates in protest against high taxes Under the new system, it will be taught within humanities - one of six broad ""areas of learning"" replacing narrow subjects. The draft curriculum, due to be finalised in January, emphasises the importance of the Welsh dimension and said children should develop a sense of identity as well as ""an understanding of Wales and its place in the wider world"". However, it does not list specific topics, reflecting the overall approach in the curriculum which sets out a framework and purpose, giving flexibility for teachers to decide the detailed content. The new curriculum will be introduced in primary schools and Year 7 in 2022 and rolled out as these pupils move up. Children currently in Year 4 or below will be taught under the new system. Campaigners think the history of Cardiff docks and immigration should be taught across Wales Uzo Iwobi, from Race Council Cymru, told the committee black history in Wales must not be optional. She said leaving this decision to teachers and schools was ""not good enough"". The historical group Owain Glyndwr Society said pupils might end up learning about their area but not about significant historical developments in other parts of Wales. ""The new curriculum should have a list of must-haves, i.e. topics that all the pupils in the country need to be taught,"" it said. Among those who gave evidence was Dyfodol i'r Iaith, a campaign organisation set up in 2012 to promote the Welsh language by influencing policy content and exploring new ideas. It said a balance could be struck between prescribing the most significant events all pupils should know and teachers' professional freedom. Representatives of teaching unions agreed that, although it might go against the spirit of the new curriculum, ""guidelines need to be given"". A report in 2013 made recommendations to boost the Welsh aspect in history teaching, but its authorDr Elin Jones told the committee she had ""no confidence""the new curriculum would lead to improvements without clear guidance and examples of good practice. She said there were ""certain key periods in Welsh history that are central to the formation of an individual identity in Wales"". Owain Glyndwr was the last native Welsh person to hold the title Prince of Wales Assembly members said: ""If the new curriculum is being described as a vision for Wales, then it is necessary for all pupils to learn a common set of topics and events which have shaped the nation in which they grew up."" They called for suitable teaching materials and the right training for teachers to include the history of Wales' racial and religious diversity. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Learning about the history of our nation will be central to the curriculum's areas of learning and experience, so that young people are engaged in rich learning experiences about the histories, geography and cultures of Wales."" He added the flexibility of new curriculum would allow teachers to deliver these lessons ""in more creative ways better suited to the learners they teach"".

"Villagers sort through plastic in Bangun for the better-quality material they can sell The burning of plastic waste in Indonesia, much of which has been sent there by the West, is poisoning the food chain, the BBC has learned. Environmental group IPEN found, in one East Java village, toxic dioxins in chicken eggs 70 times the level allowed by European safety standards. Long-term exposure to the chemicals is linked to cancer, damage to the immune system and developmental issues. Indonesia's government says it is sending the waste back to countries. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme also spoke to people with respiratory issues caused by the fumes from the burning of plastics, and filmed the open burning of plastics supposedly sent to Indonesia to be recycled. At one tofu factory, plastic is burned as fuel Researchers from IPEN (the International Pollutants Elimination Network) collected free-range chicken eggs at two sites near Surabaya, in East Java. Testing eggs, the researchers said, was the easiest way to check whether the chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins had made it into the food chain. The most serious reading was taken near a group of tofu factories that burn plastics for fuel, in the village of Tropodo. The tests found eating one egg would exceed the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) tolerable daily intake for chlorinated dioxins 70 times over. Researchers said this was the second-highest level of dioxins in eggs ever measured in Asia - only behind an area of Vietnam contaminated by the chemical weapon Agent Orange. The eggs also contained toxic flame-retardant chemicals, SCCPs and PBDEs, used in plastics. One resident in Tropodo said it was known as the ""city of smoke"". ""We don't need to tell the doctor what our symptoms are... we just tell them that we are from Tropodo and they know right away."" Researcher Yuyun Ismawati found recyclable plastics among the waste set to be burned Experts believe eating a few contaminated eggs would not impact health - but long-term exposure could lead to serious problems. ""The results of our research are some of the most shocking we have ever had. In Indonesia, we've never had these results before,"" explained Yuyun Ismawati, a leading Indonesian environmentalist behind the tests. Dr Agus Haryono, from the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, said the country's government needed to implement ""a proper infrastructure for testing and monitoring POPs [Persistent Organic Pollutants]"" to combat the ""uncontrolled cross-border plastic trade"". In the first six months of this year, the UK sent 18,000 tonnes of plastic and 55,000 tonnes of paper to Indonesia The researchers focused on the area around a paper factory in East Java, where around 40% of its paper is imported. But the paper is arriving contaminated with low quality plastic. The plastic is then sold to local villagers, many of whom rely on the plastic for their livelihoods. One so-called ""plastic farmer"" in the village of Bangun, Supiyati, told the BBC she made a living by searching through plastic waste to sell the better-quality material to plastic factories. Supiyati makes a living as a ""plastic farmer"" ""I used the money to buy this land and to send my children to school,"" she said, sitting among large mounds of plastic bought by the lorry-load by residents and divided up. Imports of plastic waste rose 141% last year to 283,000 tonnes - primarily from countries such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, the UK and the US - according to Indonesia's statistics agency. China imposed a ban on waste imports to the mainland at the start of 2017, leading to a huge influx of waste being sent to other countries. The small town with a dirty secret Who's sending back plastic waste? The band born on a rubbish dump Prof Peter Dobson, from the University of Oxford, believes Western countries exporting their plastic waste must also be held accountable. ""A ban would encourage the development of technologies to recycle or re-use waste plastic, or to discourage the wide use of plastic,"" he said. Experts say Western waste is one part of the problem when it comes to tackling plastic in Indonesia. They cite a lack of infrastructure and funding for waste collection, which means large amounts are fly-tipped in rivers or burned. Masrur is the local chief in Sindang Jaya In Sindang Jaya, on the other side of Java, local chief Masrur claimed he had seen numerous people have respiratory problems due to the fumes created when plastics are burned. One resident, Mila Damila, said her granddaughter had been hospitalised four times. ""The doctor said her illness was caused by the smoke,"" she said. ""It looks like fog, but it's smoke. It's black in the afternoon."" Another local, Eli Prima, said his daughter was taken into the emergency unit and placed on an oxygen tube because she had difficulty breathing. Mila Damila says her granddaughters' health has been badly affected Much of the larger-scale, open burning of plastic in the area has now been stopped after ""tense"" discussions with plastic traders. And there is evidence that suggests government policy is having an impact. Individuals are still burning waste, but the flow of new imported waste in Sindang Jaya is beginning to dry up. The BBC saw lorries that had been seized by Indonesian customs The BBC also saw lorries with containers parked up outside plastic factories in Sindang Jaya that had been seized by Indonesian customs, suggesting they might contain contaminated waste. But while there may be less waste entering Indonesia, there is concern about where it is ending up. Recent research by the environmental group Basel Action Network found many containers that were intended to be sent back to the West ended up in other South-East Asian countries.

"Michael Weir was found guilty of two counts of murder at the Old Bailey A jewel thief who beat two elderly people to death in their own homes has been convicted of their murders two decades on. Michael Weir fatally attacked 78-year-old Leonard Harris and Rose Seferian, 83, in 1998, the Old Bailey was told. The original investigation missed clues to link the killings but DNA testing connected Weir to both London attacks after 20 years, the court heard. Weir, 52, of Hackney, had denied two counts of murder. Prosecutor Tom Little QC told the jury the ""defenceless pensioners"" had been struck repeatedly and ""left for dead"". Weir was originally found guilty of murdering Mr Harris by an Old Bailey jury in July 1999, but his conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2000 on a technicality. He was retried under the so-called double jeopardy law when new forensic evidence came to light, and prosecutors believe Weir is ""the first convicted man to be convicted twice"". Trial judge Mrs Justice McGowan told the jury they had made ""legal history"". Gertrude Harris and her husband Leonard were attacked in January 1998 On 28 January 1998, Weir broke into Mr Harris's flat in East Finchley, north London, leaving him with serious head injuries. The pensioner was found by an estate agent while his wife, who suffered from dementia, was left badly injured on a bedroom floor. An 18-carat gold watch Mr Harris had taken from a German soldier during World War Two and his gold ring were missing. Three days after the attack, police found a palm print on the bedroom door but missed the match to the defendant at the time, the court heard. On 5 March, Weir violently attacked Ms Seferian in her bedroom when she was at home on her own. He stole jewellery including a gold wedding ring with her husband's initials and the date of their marriage engraved on it, a diamond solitaire gold ring, and a silver diamond ring, as well as cash. Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent In 2005, the 800-year-old ""double jeopardy"" law that prevented a defendant from being tried a second time for the same offence was scrapped. From that point the Court of Appeal was able to grant a retrial if ""new, compelling, reliable and substantial evidence"" had emerged. Billy Dunlop became the first person to be convicted under the new law. He brutally murdered Julie Hogg in 1989 but, after two trials in which jurors could not reach a verdict, he was acquitted. In 2006 he was convicted at a fresh trial following the law change. However, until today the law had only been used to convict those acquitted at a first trial - making Michael Weir the first defendant ever to be found guilty of the same murder, twice. And as the trial judge Mrs Justice McGowan told the jury, that made ""legal history"". Jurors were told a palm print found inside her Kensington flat on a window frame where Weir broke in was not matched to him until 2017. The trial heard that by 2018 new DNA evidence had been obtained and palm prints from both murder scenes were matched to Weir. It is believed to be the first time a defendant has been found guilty of the same murder twice, and where a second murder charge has been added to a double jeopardy case. Det Ch Insp Shaun Fitzgerald, from the Met, said: ""Nothing can ever take away the pain of Leonard and Rose's families but we hope this conviction brings them some kind of closure. ""Weir literally thought he had got away with murder but he now faces a considerable custodial sentence where he will have significant time to reflect on his utterly callous actions towards two completely innocent victims.""

"This video can not be played Key moments from Trump impeachment hearing President Donald Trump directly asked about a Ukrainian investigation into his Democratic rival Joe Biden, a top US diplomat has unveiled. Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, told an impeachment inquiry that a member of his staff was told Mr Trump was keen to push for the probe. Mr Trump says he does not recall making the remark. He denies any wrongdoing. Mr Biden hopes to run against Mr Trump next year. It is illegal to ask foreign entities for help to win an election. He is accused of withholding US military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country's new president to publicly announce a corruption inquiry into Mr Biden. Mr Trump has called the inquiry a ""witch-hunt"". During a detailed opening statement, Mr Taylor said a member of his staff had overheard a telephone call in which the president inquired about ""the investigations"" into Mr Biden. The call was with Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, who reportedly told the president over the phone from a restaurant in Kyiv that ""the Ukrainians were ready to move forward"". After the call, the staff member ""asked ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine"", Mr Taylor said. Mr Taylor said: ""Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden."" Meanwhile observers and former officials have drawn attention to the security implications of making the call from a restaurant, potentially exposing the conversation to eavesdropping by Russian intelligence. When asked about Mr Sondland earlier this month, the president had said: ""I hardly know the gentleman."" This video can not be played President Trump: ""The witch-hunt? I hear it's a joke... I haven't watched for one minute"" Responding to queries from reporters after the hearing, Mr Trump said: ""I know nothing about that, first time I've heard it."" He said he recalled Mr Sondland's testimony, in which the diplomat said he spoke to the president ""for a brief moment"" and Mr Trump had ""said no quid pro quo under any circumstances"". He did not recall the phone call Mr Taylor described, ""not even a little bit"", and ""in any event it's more second hand information"", he said. How an overheard phone call could damage Trump A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story Who's who in Trump-Ukraine story? The impeachment inquiry has been going on for more than a month - but all previous hearings were private, with reports based on leaks and sources speaking to the media. Wednesday's public hearings were the first time the public heard from witnesses directly and a chance for Democrats and Republicans to win over voters. This has the potential to be a major twist. Although there have been reports of Mr Sondland's direct line to the president, there has yet to be evidence tying Mr Trump directly to the alleged quid pro quo. The phone call Mr Taylor described could change all that. In the middle of Wednesday's hearing, the House Intelligence Committee announced a new witness scheduled to give a closed-door deposition on Friday, an aide named David Holmes - reportedly the aide Mr Taylor mentioned. Next week, Mr Sondland himself is scheduled to testify during public hearings. If either of these two men supports Mr Taylor's account, it could undercut the president's defenders who have suggested that Mr Trump was not closely involved in the activities of the ""unofficial"" channel of Ukraine policy, as Mr Taylor called it, which was pressuring Ukraine to open up investigations into the Bidens. Democrats have reason to be pleased, while the president's team has a new set of headaches. Read more from Anthony Wednesday's hearing began with testimony from George Kent, a top US diplomat charged with overseeing European affairs. He told the committee that President Trump's private lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, ran a ""campaign to smear"" the US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, before she was recalled from her post. Meanwhile, much of Mr Taylor's other testimony repeated evidence he gave to private Congressional impeachment hearings, but he added new detail to the accounts in the public domain. The career diplomat, who has served under Republican and Democratic presidents, reiterated his understanding that the Trump administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless the Ukrainian president agreed to publicly announce an investigation into Mr Biden. He testified that he told Mr Sondland and Kurt Volker, previously the US special envoy to Ukraine, that it would be ""crazy"" to withhold security assistance for the sake of domestic politics. This video can not be played A Democrat and a Republican react to the first public impeachment hearing Adam Schiff, the Democratic Chairman of the Intelligence Committee overseeing the impeachment inquiry, said the purpose of the inquiry was to establish whether Mr Trump ""abused his power and invited foreign interference in our elections"". ""If this is not impeachable conduct, what is?"" he added. The senior Republican on the Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, who is a staunch ally of the president, denounced the inquiry as ""a televised theatrical performance staged by the Democrats"". Republicans have been demanding the anonymous whistleblower, who filed a report that eventually triggered the impeachment proceedings, be compelled to give closed-door testimony to the committee. However, Mr Schiff said he would ""do everything necessary to protect the whistleblower's identity"". Mr Trump said he was ""too busy to watch"" the impeachment hearing, although he also tweeted and retweeted several posts about the inquiry on Wednesday. ""I want to find out who's the whistleblower,"" he told reporters after the hearing. SIMPLE GUIDE:A basic take on what's going on GO DEEPER:Here's a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT'S IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Hear from residents of a Virginia town ON THE DOORSTEP:A Democrat sells impeachment to voters The US House of Representatives is trying to establish whether Mr Trump abused the power of his office for personal gain. In a phone call in July, the Republican president asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Democratic White House contender Joe Biden. His son, Hunter Biden, worked for a Ukrainian gas firm while his father was US vice-president. The US congressional inquiry has already heard that Mr Trump dangled nearly $400m (Â£327m) in military aid and a White House invitation in order to prod Ukraine's leader to announce a corruption inquiry that might have caused political embarrassment to Mr Biden. It is illegal to ask foreign entities for help in winning a US election. Mr Trump has denied the allegations and branded the impeachment hearings a ""phony showtrial"". Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

"Prof Ponsati greeted supporters as she arrived at the police station in Edinburgh on Thursday Former Catalan government minister Clara Ponsati has been bailed at Edinburgh Sheriff Court after handing herself in to police. The St Andrews University professor is wanted in Spain over her role in the Catalan independence movement. The 62-year-old appeared in court and was granted bail and allowed to keep her passport. Prof Ponsati's next court appearance has been scheduled for 12 December in Edinburgh. The full hearing is likely to take place in Spring 2020. She arrived at St Leonard's Police Station in the capital with her solicitor Aamer Anwar on Thursday morning and was transferred to the court hearing. The two emerged from the court to cheers from supporters. Mr Anwar said: ""Clara Ponsati faces a single charge of 'sedition' which relates to the organising of the referendum in her role as the minister for education. ""The warrant is full of contradictions and mistakes, whilst it accuses Clara of everything, in reality the warrant provides no real examples of any alleged crime.

"Five rockets were launched from Gaza hours after the ceasefire A ceasefire between Israel and militants in Gaza appears to be holding, despite the launch of several rockets hours after it took effect. The truce ended two days of intense fighting in which militants fired some 450 rockets towards Israel and Israeli aircraft carried out waves of strikes. Early on Thursday, a family of eight were killed in an air strike in Gaza. The fighting left 34 Palestinians dead and 111 injured in total, while 63 Israelis needed medical treatment. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 25 of the Palestinian fatalities were militants. The escalation began on Tuesday when a senior commander of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Baha Abu al-Ata, and his wife were killed in an Israeli air strike. The Israeli prime minister said Abu al-Ata was ""responsible for most of the terror attacks in the last year from the Gaza Strip"" and called him a ""ticking bomb"". This video can not be played Gaza militants retaliated with rocket fire - then Israel responded with further air strikes PIJ spokesman Musab al-Buraim said early on Thursday that it had agreed to a ceasefire brokered by Egypt after Israel was ""forced to accept the conditions set by the Palestinian resistance"". Those conditions were to stop ""assassination operations"" and the use of live fire against protesters near the Gaza border fence, and to start implementing steps to end the blockade of Gaza, he added. Life in the Gaza Strip Is peace between Israel and Palestinians out of reach? Israel did not publicly confirm the ceasefire, but Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Army Radio that ""quiet will be answered with quiet"". He also said he considered it a ""matter of success"" that the dominant militant group in Gaza, Hamas, had not been involved in the hostilities. Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan denied any concessions had been made to PIJ, tweeting that the group ""wanted a ceasefire and it received no commitments in exchange"". Palestinian Islamic Jihad said it had forced Israeli to accept conditions for the ceasefire IDF Spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said its operation in Gaza, dubbed ""Black Belt"", had achieved all of its objectives. ""With a combination of military personnel from a variety of units who specialize in SIGINT [signals intelligence], HUMINT [human intelligence], we were able to attack cells and close the circle against targets very quickly. That's what killed 25 terrorists who were in the midst of carrying out hostile activity,"" he added. UN Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov said both the UN and Egypt had ""worked hard to prevent the most dangerous escalation in and around Gaza from leading to war"" and called on all sides to ""show maximum restraint"".

However, five rockets were launched from Gaza about five hours after the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF said. Two were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system. There were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage. In the late afternoon, rocket alert sirens sounded in Israeli communities near the Gaza border and the IDF said another rocket was shot down. Meanwhile, Gaza's health ministry said eight members of the Abu Malhous family, including five children and two women, were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, before dawn on Thursday. The Israeli military said the deadly air strike in Deir al-Balah had targeted a militant commander The ministry said the dead were all civilians. But the IDF insisted that the head of the family, Rasmi Abu Malhous, was a commander of a PIJ rocket-launching unit. ""He was an Islamic Jihad commander and he, like many others, had the tactic of hiding ammunition and military infrastructure in their own residence,"" spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus told AFP news agency. ""Of course we try always to minimise the amount of non-combatants killed or injured."" A neighbour, Mohammed Mazro, disputed the IDF's account. ""They were children, civilians, not militants and they have nothing to do with politics,"" he told AFP. ""They were innocent people, asleep.

"Prof Ponsati greeted supporters as she arrived at the police station in Edinburgh on Thursday Former Catalan government minister Clara Ponsati has been bailed at Edinburgh Sheriff Court after handing herself in to police. The St Andrews University professor is wanted in Spain over her role in the Catalan independence movement. The 62-year-old appeared in court and was granted bail and allowed to keep her passport. Prof Ponsati's next court appearance has been scheduled for 12 December in Edinburgh. The full hearing is likely to take place in Spring 2020. She arrived at St Leonard's Police Station in the capital with her solicitor Aamer Anwar on Thursday morning and was transferred to the court hearing. The two emerged from the court to cheers from supporters. Mr Anwar said: ""Clara Ponsati faces a single charge of 'sedition' which relates to the organising of the referendum in her role as the minister for education. ""The warrant is full of contradictions and mistakes, whilst it accuses Clara of everything, in reality the warrant provides no real examples of any alleged crime. ""Clara submits that she should not be extradited for a 'show trial' in the Supreme Court, where she believes the only verdict would be one of guilt.

"Health boards across Scotland are having to reschedule flu vaccine sessions Thousands of children across Scotland are facing delays in receiving theirflu vaccination,externalat primary school. Scottish health boards confirmed flu programmes have been disrupted with a number of sessions being rescheduled. Priority is being given to at-risk and younger children, with P4-7 pupils facing the most disruption. A UK-wide shortage of the nasal spray Fluenz Tetra has meant health boards are receiving fewer vaccines than needed. Programmes started in Scotland in October to vaccinate against flu, which typically circulates in December, January and February. All Scottish primary schoolchildren are currently entitled to the vaccine, however some will see it pushed back. It is difficult to tell how many children have been affected, but 12 out of 14 health boards in Scotland have reported delays so far. The health boards are following advice from the Scottish government to prioritise younger children aged two to five as well as five to 18-year-olds who have underlying health conditions. NHS Grampian estimated 163 schools had been affected by the delays, meaning approximately 27,000 pupils in the region could face disruption. Flu vaccine delay for some schoolchildren NHS Lothian, NHS Dumfries & Galloway and NHS Shetland all confirmed they had faced some disruption to their flu programmes. NHS Highland said deliveries UK-wide were between two and four weeks behind schedule, meaning primary school vaccination sessions due to start on 11 and 18 November had been postponed. Pupils in P3-7 from 28 schools in the NHS Borders region will also face similar delays of about two to four weeks, according to the health board. NHS Fife and NHS Forth Valley both said the schedule for children in P4-7 had been delayed due to the shortages. Some vaccine sessions at primary schools in Ayrshire and Arran due to begin on 18 November will be postponed, according to the health board. NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde also confirmed there were supply issues, again leading to a delay in the school flu roll-out. There has been minor disruption to the flu programme in Orkney schools, however some P6-7 sessions may be rescheduled to December. The efficiency of the nasal spray has not been affected NHS Lanarkshire said it had not had to reschedule any school sessions, however a small number of pupils who miss their school vaccines will need to wait longer to see a GP. This is because GP appointments are being prioritised for younger children or those with additional risks until supply levels of Fluenz are back to normal. NHS Tayside has not been affected by the UK-wide shortage and confirmed their flu programme was being carried out as normal. The adult flu programme has also not been affected. Public Health England (PHE) said the UK-wide delay would affect about a quarter of the overall vaccinations ordered. PHE buys and orders vaccine stock for all the devolved nations, so delays had been expected in Scotland and Northern Ireland. AstraZeneca, which supplies the vaccine to the NHS, said it needed ""to repeat some tests before a portion of our [Fluenz Tetra] vaccine supply can be released and delivered"". Delay of the vaccine is related to ""routine testing"" by the manufacturer and ""is not related to the safety or the efficacy of the vaccine,"" according to the Scottish government. A government spokesman said: ""Once the vaccine manufacturer has completed the testing, then it will be possible to determine the number of schools potentially affected and the likely timescale for the vaccine becoming available."" This video can not be played Reality Check takes a look at the flu vaccine Parents and carers of those in high-risk groups are urged to make an appointment with their GP. Health boards affected by the delays have ensured their flu programmes will be completed as soon as supplies are available. Gregor Smith, deputy chief medical officer, said: ""I would like to reassure parents and families that we are doing everything possible to minimise any disruption caused by the UK-wide delay in supply of Fluenz Tetra. ""We are working with Public Health England, Health Protection Scotland, NHS boards and other relevant partners to ensure that all eligible children get their flu vaccine as soon as possible. ""Those most at risk and children aged two to five-years-old will be prioritised initially, with boards working to ensure all other eligible children, such as those at primary school, receive their vaccine in due course."" The flu vaccine is free and offered to: All children aged two to five (who are not yet in school) at their GP practice All primary children at school Children of all ages with a long-term health condition, from six months of age Source:NHS Scotland,external * NHS Western Isles could not be reached for a comment Flu vaccine delay for some schoolchildren LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Hospital performance in England is at its worst level on record, data shows. Key targets for cancer, hospital care and A&E have been missed for over three years - with delays for hospital care and in A&E hitting their highest levels since both targets were introduced. The monthly figures - the last before the election - prompted Labour and the Liberal Democrats to attack the Tories' record on the NHS. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""huge demand"" was to blame. He said only the Tories could be trusted to have a ""strong, dynamic economy"" to ensure the rises in the NHS budget being planned could be made. ""I'm afraid when I look at the rival proposals and the economic disaster that Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party would cause, that will make it impossible for us in the long term to fund the NHS."" But Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the performance figures were ""disgusting"" and a lack of staff and funding was to blame. And Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said the Tories had a ""shameful"" record. Is the NHS facing unprecedented demand? All the parties are proposing to increase the NHS budget. The government announced a five-year funding plan last year, which would see the front-line budget rise by 3.4% a year up to 2023. On Wednesday, Labour said it would spend more - 3.9% extra a year. The Lib Dems are proposing to use a penny rise in income tax to invest extra in social care, mental health and public health. Demand for all services is rising and the NHS is still managing to see the over-whelming majority in time. But performance has been deteriorating for a number of years - and is now well below what it should be. The figures show: 4.42 million patients on the waiting list at the end of September, the highest number ever 84.8% of them waiting under 18 weeks - below the 92% target and the worst performance since the target was introduced, in 2012 76.9% of cancer patients starting treatment within 62 days - below the 85% target 83.6% of A&E patients admitted or transferred within four hours in October - below the 95% target and the worst performance since the target started was introduced, in 2004 Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also missing their targets, although health is devolved so NHS decisions are taken by the administrations in those parts of the UK. How well does the NHS spend its money? 11 charts on what's happened to the NHS LIVE: Latest from the campaign trail Frances Reid, 55, is one of many patients to have faced a long wait. She said she was left in ""excruciating"" pain waiting for a hip replacement. Ms Reid, from South Cambridgeshire, was referred for surgery in January 2018, after struggling for the previous two years with hip pain. She should have been seen in April 2018, but waited until July for her surgery. The NHS ended up paying for her to be treated at a private unit because of the wait. ""The final weeks were really difficult,"" she says. ""I was waking up six, seven times a night and had to use walking sticks to get around. ""Daily tasks like shopping became very difficult."" Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society of Acute Medicine, said: ""These figures are truly worrying as we haven't even reached the 'traditional' winter period yet."" He said urgent action was needed, warning the system was ""imploding"". British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the NHS was facing a ""catastrophe"". ""This is completely unfair for patients and staff."" But Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, tweeted senior staff should be more careful with the language they used, criticising the use of imploding in particular. However, he admitted he was worried about the ""huge pressure"" on the system at this point before the full onset of winter. NHS England conceded hospitals were under pressure, seeing ""more older and sicker patients"". A spokesman said, with winter coming, hospitals would be opening extra beds. But he urged the public to play their part by getting the flu jab and using the 111 phone line and NHS online services ""as first port of call for non-emergencies"".

"Political parties are generally in agreement about one thing - that the NHS needs more money. But is money all it takes? To answer this, it's helpful to look at whether the NHS is getting the best out of its existing budget  - and how that compares with other countries. There's no single way of measuring the efficiency of a health service, though various bodies have tried. Bloomberg's annual healthcare efficiency index, for example, looks simply at spending on healthcare versus life expectancy. Its latest report ranked 56 wealthy countries, based on 2015 data. It put the UK 35th - down from 21st the year before, partly reflecting the slowing of growth in spending on the NHS particularly in England. Hong Kong and Singapore - mixed public and private systems with elements of both government funding and insurance - came top. They were followed by Italy and Spain - with national health services - which both have higher life expectancies than the UK and spend less per person to achieve this. The UK was also beaten by France which has a system of social insurance paid for by the government, individuals and employers. Compared with35 other OECD countries,external(Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) - a group of rich nations - the UK spends an average amount on healthcare (about 9.8% of GDP) and has a slightly higher than average life expectancy for the group (81.3 years). Life expectancy is a reasonable proxy for how good a healthcare system is, but it's not a perfect one. While higher healthcare spending is linked to higher life expectancy, it's affected by other complicated social factors including diet and smoking. In the US, for example, opioid deaths and gun crime have been linked to a fall in life expectancy. It's also a fairly crude measure - living longer isn't the only thing most people would want to achieve from a health system. As a 2018 report by three health think tanks and the Institute for Fiscal Studies, entitled""How good is the NHS?,external"", said, UK patients were more likely than average to report having had a good experience of the health system. The think tanks said this was ""a valuable goal of health care in its own right"". UK patients were also less likely to say they skipped a consultation or prescription medicine because of cost. And looking just at life expectancy doesn't capture how good a health system is at dealing with conditions that may require long-term care but don't cause death. The 2018 report concludes that the NHS across the UK is relatively efficient, performing well in managing long-term conditions with ""an unusually low level of staffing and, in at least some categories, equipment"" compared with other countries. This suggests the NHS is doing quite well with the money it has. But equally, life expectancy measures don't capture experiences like waiting for a long time on a trolley in A&E or waiting in pain for a routine operation, which aren't fatal but are also not good experiences for patients. These have worsened as funding increases have slowed. The NHS is below average among OECD countries at treating the illnesses that are the most common direct causes of death. For example, the UK mortality rate for cancer and heart disease is higher than the average among similar countries and that's a longer-term trend. Part of the reason the UK does worse on cancer survival is that British patients present late with cancer symptoms, and get diagnosed at a later stage. That's not necessarily a funding issue. Across the UK, waiting times for routine surgery like hip replacements are about average, and waiting times in A&E just below average, compared with other rich countries. As the growth in funding has slowed, though, the NHS has become worse at seeing people within four hours in A&E and getting cancer patients into treatment within two months. This is significant for patients and their experience of the system, but it hasn't dramatically effected outcomes - although this may take some time to show up. Those worse than average trends pre-dated recent funding cutbacks, again suggesting there's something other than just money going on. Improving outcomes in the health service often requires funding plus other action - for example training and retaining more staff or launching public information campaigns. Money alone is not enough to make those things happen. The NHS is devolved, meaning each nation runs its own health system and can set its own priorities. On waits in A&E, Scotland has fared comparatively better than other UK nations. US-based foundation the Commonwealth Fund published a comparison in 2017 whichput the UK top out of 11 countries,externalfor healthcare performance. It looked at five areas including equity and access, as well as health outcomes and the care process. The UK came top partly because of the ranking's heavy weighting towards universal systems - since equity and access formed two out of the five criteria. When it came to health outcomes, though, the UK scored tenth out of 11 countries which detracts from the overall score. Although, arguably, the UK's relative equality of access to healthcare for both the rich and poor is a significant when it comes to assessing how well the health service is spending its money. The IFS, Health Foundation, King's Fund and Nuffield Trust say the NHS ""does better than health systems in comparable countries at protecting people from heavy financial costs when they are ill"" and that overall, ""the NHS performs neither as well as its supporters sometimes claim nor as badly as its critics often allege.""

Ms Reid, from South Cambridgeshire, was referred for surgery in January 2018, after struggling for the previous two years with hip pain. She should have been seen in April 2018, but waited until July for her surgery. The NHS ended up paying for her to be treated at a private unit because of the wait. ""The final weeks were really difficult,"" she says. ""I was waking up six, seven times a night and had to use walking sticks to get around. ""Daily tasks like shopping became very difficult."" Dr Nick Scriven, of the Society of Acute Medicine, said: ""These figures are truly worrying as we haven't even reached the 'traditional' winter period yet."" He said urgent action was needed, warning the system was ""imploding"". British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the NHS was facing a ""catastrophe"". ""This is completely unfair for patients and staff."" But Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents health managers, tweeted senior staff should be more careful with the language they used, criticising the use of imploding in particular. However, he admitted he was worried about the ""huge pressure"" on the system at this point before the full onset of winter. NHS England conceded hospitals were under pressure, seeing ""more older and sicker patients"". A spokesman said, with winter coming, hospitals would be opening extra beds. But he urged the public to play their part by getting the flu jab and using the 111 phone line and NHS online services ""as first port of call for non-emergencies"".

"Labour's annual conference has urged Jeremy Corbyn to include a commitment to the free movement of people in the party's next election manifesto. Labour's 2017 manifesto vowed to end free movement when the UK leaves the European Union. But delegates in Brighton have voted overwhelmingly to reject that - and to extend migrant rights in other areas. Mr Corbyn had to miss the final day of conference to head back to Westminster for the resumption of Parliament. But delegates have continued to debate and vote on policies - and cheered as the motion on extending migrant rights was carried unanimously in a show of hands. The motion urges Labour to: Defend the right of EU migrants to live and work in the EU under free movement rules Give the vote to all migrants in the UK Reject any immigration system based on quotas, caps, targets or incomes Close all migrant detention centres Guarantee the unconditional right to family reunion visas for migrants from outside the EU End ""no recourse to public funds"" policies, which prevent some immigrants from claiming benefits Scrap so-called ""hostile environment"" polices, which restrict access to accommodation and the NHS Ana Oppenheim, from the Labour Campaign for Free Movement, which put forward the motion, said: ""In 2017, it was a source of shame for many activists that our manifesto included ending free movement. ""Now we can move forward not only committed to defending free movement, but to giving migrants the vote."" Vijay Jackson, a delegate from Edinburgh Central, who seconded the motion, said: ""This set of policies is nothing less than what every migrant worker deserves and it is Labour's class duty as socialists and internationalists to implement our demands in full.""

"More than 7,000 unborn children are recorded as ""in need"" Almost one in 50 of those officially classified as ""children in need"" in England have not yet been born. More than 7,000 of such vulnerable children have been put into this category before their birth, an analysis of government figures shows. The number of ""unborn"" recorded in the total of vulnerable children has almost trebled in the last eight years. The most common concerns were neglect or abuse - and that children were being born into ""dysfunctional families"". The Department for Education recently published annual figures showing there were 400,000 so-called ""children in need"". These are children about whom there are concerns about their health or development, and who are at risk of being ""significantly impaired"" without extra support. Domestic violence, parents with mental health problems, and drug and alcohol abuse are among the biggest factors. This could lead to child protection plans or other interventions by social services or local authorities. Domestic violence is the biggest threat for child protection Domestic violence killings reach five-year high Children hidden victims of domestic abuse But a further analysis of the figures shows a continuing rise in the numbers of pre-birth children who are designated as being of concern. The figures for 2018-19, show a new high of 7,360 children considered vulnerable before their birth. This figure has risen steadily over recent years from 2,630 in 2010-11. While the odds might be stacked against some children from an early age, these figures show a sharp rise in those being officially monitored even before their birth. The Department for Education says unborn children are put on this list because of concerns over their ""safety or welfare"", or because of the problems already facing their parents. The most recent figures for unborn children in need show ""abuse or neglect"" to be the biggest concerns, along with ""family dysfunction"", ""family in acute stress"", ""parents' disability or illness"" and ""low income"". ""It is absolutely vital that councils are able to support families and help children who are at risk of significant harm, but it is also important that help is available before problems escalate to that point,"" said the Local Government Association. More than 50% of children in need cases, over 200,000 incidents, involved domestic violence. The Local Government Association also raised concerns about children in need for reasons ""linked to faith or belief"", which had risen by 320 to 1,950 cases, representing 0.4% of children in need. The councils' group says that some cases could include beliefs in witchcraft or ""spirit possession"", but there was no breakdown to show how many.

"The Labour Party has vowed to close the gender pay gap by 2030 if it wins the election. The difference between men's and women's average pay would take another 60 years to close under a Conservative government, the party said. But the Conservative Party said that Labour was ""over-promising"". The Tories said the pay gap was at a record low and that there had been ""huge progress since 2010"" in terms of the number of women in work. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. The Fawcett Society said it would take until almost 2080 for the gender pay gap to close at the current rate. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) puts that at about 35 years. General election 2019: Labour promises year of maternity pay Millennial men demand better parental leave As well as the new 2030 pay gap target, Labour also restated some policies that will become manifesto commitments. These included introducing a ""real living wage"" of Â£10 per hour and creating a Worker's Protection Agency with HMRC with powers to fine organisations that fail to report gender pay. Labour said the new agency would check firms with more than 250 employees were meeting gender equality criteria on recruitment, career progression, pay and work-life balance. Those that did would become certified. Labour would then lower that threshold by the end of 2020 to workplaces with 50 employees. It will also extend maternity pay from nine to 12 months and introduce free childcare for two to four-year-olds. Dawn Butler, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, said: ""Labour's real living wage, robust gender pay auditing - including fining organisations that fail to take action - will help us deliver real change and meet this ambitious target."" But Liz Truss, who was the Conservative Women and Equalities Minister, said: ""Yet again (Jeremy) Corbyn's Labour are overpromising something they cannot deliver. She said Mr Corbyn's focus would not be on opportunities for women. The Tories said the pay gap was ""at a record low"" having fallen from 27.5% in 1997 to 17.3% in 2019 for all employees. The party added that female employment was at 71.8% according to the latest figures, close to a record high, and that it had launched a ""roadmap for gender equality"". Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said firms shared the Labour Party's goal but: ""Creating inclusive workplaces where everyone can thrive is the only way to tackle gender inequality at work."" He said the gender pay gap was caused by a wide range of factors - such as the availability of childcare, career progression and improved careers advice - which required business and government to work in partnership to bring change. But he said that Labour's gender equality certification plan would add ""bureaucracy"" for businesses. The causes of the gap aren't simple. Women are far more likely than men to take substantial parental leave, which can hamper career progression. Studies have shown that the more kids you have, the less likely you are as a woman to enjoy the same pay as men of the same age; and affordability of childcare is crucial to woman returning to work. But closing the gender pay gap is a knotty problem. The CBI, for example, says it shares the Labour Party's ambition to close the gender pay gap as quickly as possible. But it doubts whether a system of fines and government certification will do the job. All of the measures Labour laid out to achieve it have already been announced; no new money is being promised.

"New South Wales has faced catastrophic conditions The bushfires ravaging Australia this week have brought warnings of ""catastrophic"" danger. Fortunately, no lives were lost on Tuesday - when conditions were at their worst. But experts warned that events looked set to trigger the most dangerous type of bushfire - pyrocumulonimbus, often referred to as a firestorm. These are giant, fast-moving blazes so powerful they create their own weather systems akin to thunderstorms. And due to their ferocity, they are largely impossible to fight. With certain ground and atmospheric conditions, bushfires can rip through a large area with so much energy that they generate storms above them. This is a pyrocumulonimbus. Ordinarily, bushfires are driven along by the wind but a massive blaze can carry so much power that its smoke is not pushed to the side. Instead, it forms a plume that rises up to 15km (nine miles) into the sky. A large pyrocumulus cloud above the Carr fire in California in 2018 Because the plume contains heat and moisture, when it hits the stratosphere it can condense and form clouds. ""A pyrocumulonimbus is basically a thunderstorm within the plume of the fire,"" says Associate Prof Jason Sharples, an expert in extreme fires based at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). When the storm is formed, it means the fire below will be big, fast and very dangerous. ""That means it's big enough to overcome any other conditions,"" says UNSW climate scientist Prof Jason Evans. Worst of Australia's blazes 'still ahead' Latest images of the bushfire emergency Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? The fire grows in danger because it will carry along the characteristics of a storm - turbulent winds that can send embers shooting off in all directions. Sometimes it can also create its own lightning, which can spark more fires. Despite being a thunderstorm there is no rain. Instead the storm sucks in more embers and flings them far ahead of the fire front ""so the fire advances in big jumps"", says Prof Evans. This video can not be played ""It's like fireballs exploding in the air"": One town's mayor describes the Australia bushfires This makes the fire unpredictable and hard to fight, and multiple fronts emerge. ""When you get a decent thunderstorm the rain comes from all directions,"" says Associate Prof Sharples. ""Now imagine the same for embers."" Fire officials in New South Wales reported that embers were landing 30km (18 miles) ahead of the front on Tuesday - three times more than the usual distance. ""They are basically uncontrollable at that stage. The only option is to get out of the way,"" says Prof Evans. With emergency crews able to do little, these fires can die down naturally if they move out of rugged terrain or are deprived of other fuels. Pyrocumulus clouds from bushfires in Victoria in 2014 ""The only real way you can stop them is five years before they start,"" said Associate Prof Sharples. ""Once you get up into the catastrophic level, your fires tend to not obey the usual rules,"" he said. When the New South Wales bushfires intensified on Friday, some were reported to have produced pyrocumulus clouds. Officials feared one fire on Tuesday was escalating to this level and sent out an alert. Luckily it did not occur. While once seen as fairly rare events, firestorms have become much more common in recent years. They were present in Australia's Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 which killed 173 people. The day Australia saw 'the gates of hell' Australian experts have tallied close to 60 such events since 2001. A record 18 were recorded in March this year when fires burned in the state of Victoria. They were also seen during fires in Canberra in 2003, when a fire tornado was recorded. ""There's been a crazy increase in the frequency of these events,"" says Prof Evans. They are more likely when there are extremely dangerous conditions such as high temperatures, strong winds and little moisture. The likelihood is also increased by the effects of drought. Scientists have predicted that climate change is likely to increase the chances of such events. Worst of Australia's fire season 'still ahead' Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires?

"Mr Walker's death has sparked protests around Australia, such as this one in Melbourne An Australian policeman has been charged with murder over the shooting death of an Aboriginal teenager in a case that has drawn national attention. Kumanjayi Walker, 19, died after being arrested at a house in the Northern Territory (NT) on Saturday. His death has sparked community anger and protests across the country. Constable Zachary Rolfe, 28, was arrested on Wednesday, NT Police said. He will plead not guilty to murder, a police union said. Mr Rolfe was granted bail following a court hearing and has been suspended with pay. Police said they would also conduct an internal investigation into the shooting in Yuendumu, a remote community 300km (190 miles) north-west of Alice Springs. Hotel 'segregated Aboriginal Australians' Australia fails indigenous equality targets The territory government has called for calm amid rising community tensions that have seen crowds converge on the police station in Yuendumu. NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner said he acknowledged the Yuendemu community - 85% of whom identify as indigenous - was ""hurting and grieving"". Mr Walker was shot sometime after two police officers went to arrest him for breaches of his suspended sentence, local media reported. He died in the police station at Yuendumu. There was no medical care in the town at the time - medical staff from another town arrived after he had died. NT health officials said the medical clinic in Yuendumu had been unstaffed due to safety concerns about break-ins. A protest outside a state parliament in South Australia The Royal Flying Doctor Service said it had also delayed travelling to the site because of safety concerns. Mr Walker's family was notified of his death hours after he died, Australian media reported. Officials have classified his death as a ""death in custody"". He is the second Aboriginal person to have died in the past two months after being shot by police. Joyce Clarke, 29, was fatally wounded in Western Australia in September. Australia conducted a royal commission inquiry in 1991 into Aboriginal deaths in custody, but critics say recent reviews have been misleading and not enough is being done to address the issue. .

"Prof Ponsati greeted supporters as she arrived at the police station in Edinburgh on Thursday Former Catalan government minister Clara Ponsati has been bailed at Edinburgh Sheriff Court after handing herself in to police. The St Andrews University professor is wanted in Spain over her role in the Catalan independence movement. The 62-year-old appeared in court and was granted bail and allowed to keep her passport. Prof Ponsati's next court appearance has been scheduled for 12 December in Edinburgh. The full hearing is likely to take place in Spring 2020. She arrived at St Leonard's Police Station in the capital with her solicitor Aamer Anwar on Thursday morning and was transferred to the court hearing. The two emerged from the court to cheers from supporters. Mr Anwar said: ""Clara Ponsati faces a single charge of 'sedition' which relates to the organising of the referendum in her role as the minister for education. ""The warrant is full of contradictions and mistakes, whilst it accuses Clara of everything, in reality the warrant provides no real examples of any alleged crime. ""Clara submits that she should not be extradited for a 'show trial' in the Supreme Court, where she believes the only verdict would be one of guilt. "" He added: ""Clara views these charges as a 'politically-motivated prosecution'. We will submit that Clara's human rights cannot be guaranteed in the Spanish Courts. "" Prof Ponsati was greeted and cheered by supporters Sedition is the illegal act of inciting people to resist or rebel against a government in power. The crime no longer exists in Scotland. Mr Anwar said his client now trusted her fate to the Scottish justice system which she believes ""to be impartial, robust and independent"". The charges relate to Catalonia's October 2017 independence referendum - which the Spanish state deemed illegal and refused to sanction. Prof Ponsati was education minister in the Catalan government at the time. If extradited and convicted, she could face a sentence of up to 15 years. Catalonia's bid for independence from Spain explained Catalonia crisis in 300 words On 6 November, Mr Anwar advised the academic not to report to police because of ""glaring contradictions"" in the arrest warrant. Mr Anwar said the warrant was translated by a senior judge, Pablo Llarena, and the UK authorities were seeking clarifications on the 59-page document. Following clarification from Judge Llarena, it was finally accepted by the UK authorities for execution. The latest European warrant was issued after a previous warrant was withdrawn last summer. The development comes after nine Catalan leaders were convicted of sedition over their role in the 2017 referendum. Riot police in Barcelona tried to disperse protesters who set up burning barricades last month Protestserupted in Barcelona last monthafter they were sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison by Spain's Supreme Court. Prosecutors argued that the unilateral declaration of independence was an attack on the Spanish state and accused some of those involved of a serious act of rebellion. They also said separatist leaders had misused public funds while organising the 2017 referendum.

"Five rockets were launched from Gaza hours after the ceasefire A ceasefire between Israel and militants in Gaza appears to be holding, despite the launch of several rockets hours after it took effect. The truce ended two days of intense fighting in which militants fired some 450 rockets towards Israel and Israeli aircraft carried out waves of strikes. Early on Thursday, a family of eight were killed in an air strike in Gaza. The fighting left 34 Palestinians dead and 111 injured in total, while 63 Israelis needed medical treatment. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said 25 of the Palestinian fatalities were militants. The escalation began on Tuesday when a senior commander of Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Baha Abu al-Ata, and his wife were killed in an Israeli air strike. The Israeli prime minister said Abu al-Ata was ""responsible for most of the terror attacks in the last year from the Gaza Strip"" and called him a ""ticking bomb"". This video can not be played Gaza militants retaliated with rocket fire - then Israel responded with further air strikes PIJ spokesman Musab al-Buraim said early on Thursday that it had agreed to a ceasefire brokered by Egypt after Israel was ""forced to accept the conditions set by the Palestinian resistance"". Those conditions were to stop ""assassination operations"" and the use of live fire against protesters near the Gaza border fence, and to start implementing steps to end the blockade of Gaza, he added. Life in the Gaza Strip Is peace between Israel and Palestinians out of reach? Israel did not publicly confirm the ceasefire, but Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Army Radio that ""quiet will be answered with quiet"". He also said he considered it a ""matter of success"" that the dominant militant group in Gaza, Hamas, had not been involved in the hostilities. Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan denied any concessions had been made to PIJ, tweeting that the group ""wanted a ceasefire and it received no commitments in exchange"". Palestinian Islamic Jihad said it had forced Israeli to accept conditions for the ceasefire IDF Spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman said its operation in Gaza, dubbed ""Black Belt"", had achieved all of its objectives. ""With a combination of military personnel from a variety of units who specialize in SIGINT [signals intelligence], HUMINT [human intelligence], we were able to attack cells and close the circle against targets very quickly. That's what killed 25 terrorists who were in the midst of carrying out hostile activity,"" he added. UN Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov said both the UN and Egypt had ""worked hard to prevent the most dangerous escalation in and around Gaza from leading to war"" and called on all sides to ""show maximum restraint"".

However, five rockets were launched from Gaza about five hours after the ceasefire came into effect, the IDF said. Two were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system. There were no immediate reports of any injuries or damage. In the late afternoon, rocket alert sirens sounded in Israeli communities near the Gaza border and the IDF said another rocket was shot down. Meanwhile, Gaza's health ministry said eight members of the Abu Malhous family, including five children and two women, were killed in an Israeli air strike on a house in Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza, before dawn on Thursday. The Israeli military said the deadly air strike in Deir al-Balah had targeted a militant commander The ministry said the dead were all civilians. But the IDF insisted that the head of the family, Rasmi Abu Malhous, was a commander of a PIJ rocket-launching unit. ""He was an Islamic Jihad commander and he, like many others, had the tactic of hiding ammunition and military infrastructure in their own residence,"" spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus told AFP news agency. ""Of course we try always to minimise the amount of non-combatants killed or injured."" A neighbour, Mohammed Mazro, disputed the IDF's account. ""They were children, civilians, not militants and they have nothing to do with politics,"" he told AFP. ""They were innocent people, asleep. We were shocked by four rockets landing on the tin house, this is not normal."" Is Palestinian-Israeli peace out of reach? Video, 00:03:53Is Palestinian-Israeli peace out of reach?

"The claim:Immigration has held down wages in the UK. Reality Check verdict:Current research suggests there was a small, negative impact on the wages of low-skilled workers, which was outweighed by other factors such as the impact of the financial crisis and rises in the minimum wage. In a Brexit speech, Leave campaigner and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said some big corporations had held wages down because they had access to so many workers from other countries. He said the UK needed to think ""about how we control immigration"". So, has it affected wages? We'll start by looking at European migrants, because migration from other countries is already restricted, whereas workers from other European countries benefit from freedom of movement. The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), an independent body that advises the government,published a report in September 2018,externalabout the impact of migration from the European Economic Area (EEA), which is the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Remember that this sort of research is difficult to do - comparing what actually happened with what might have happened is complex and there is considerable uncertainty about the conclusions. The MAC found there was some evidence that immigration depressed the wages of lower-skilled workers while inflating those of higher-skilled workers, but added that the impact was generally small. When it talks about a small impact, it looked at the period from 1993 to 2017, over which time average earnings for the lowest-paid rose by 55%. Using economic modelling, they estimated that - if there hadn't been European migration into the UK - that rise would have been around 5% higher. It added that more research was needed to find out if there had been any impact on self-employed workers. The MAC concluded that other factors had a greater impact on wages, with all workers having done badly since the financial crisis. Real wages are still struggling to rise above where they were in 2008, but lower-skilled workers have done marginally better due to the minimum wage rising faster than average earnings. The assertion that immigration put a small amount of pressure on wages for lower-skilled workers is supported bya paper from the Bank of England,external, which also looked at non-EU workers. It found there was no difference in the impact of EU and non-EU workers. The Bank of England said that the biggest impact had been for semi-skilled and unskilled workers in the services sector, where they estimated that a 10 percentage point increase in the proportion of immigrants working in the sector would have been associated with a 1.88% reduction in pay. A 10 percentage point increase in immigrants working in a sector is a lot. The Office for National Statistics estimates,externalthat between 1997 and 2018, the proportion of non-UK nationals working in the UK rose from 3.7% to 10.7%, an increase of seven percentage points over 21 years. But, of course, that is an overall figure, and the impact on some individual sectors and regions will have been considerably bigger. For example, the MAC said that about a quarter ofworkers in food and drink manufacturingin 2016 were EU nationals. The National Farmers' Union estimates that in 2017 there was a 9% increase in wages compared with 2016, reflecting a shortage of seasonal workers. It is by definition hard to find figures on the extent of the hidden economy and how much it uses migrant workers. Research by the Salvation Army quoted by the MAC found that EEA victims of labour exploitation were most likely to work in a carwash, but a significant proportion were also involved in factory work, construction and cleaning. It did not give any figures for this impact. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Herbal compounds such as garlic, ginger and ginseng can delay the healing of skin wounds Cancer patients should tell their doctors if they are taking herbal products because some of the ingredients could stop their treatment working, a cancer conference has heard. Garlic, ginger and ginkgo pills, for example, can delay the healing of skin wounds when breast cancer spreads. Surgeon Prof Maria Joao Cardoso, said there was no evidence that herbal therapies or creams worked. If in doubt, it was best not to take anything, she said. ""Doctors need to be more proactive about asking their patients what else they are taking when they are being treated for cancer,"" Prof Cardoso, head breast surgeon at the Champalimaud Cancer Centre in Lisbon, Portugal, told the BBC. She said it was particularly important that patients always checked with their doctors first before trying complementary therapies for cancer that had spread to the skin. This happens in one in five cases of breast cancer - and less in other cancers. The danger is that many products can interfere with hormone therapy or chemotherapy treatments, and certain ones prolong the blood clotting process - which can lead to wounds taking longer to heal and more scarring. She highlighted the following herbal products as examples of those which slow down clotting: green chiretta feverfew garlic ginkgo ginseng hawthorn horse chestnut turmeric Prof Cardoso said it was not surprising that patients and their carers went searching for complementary or alternative treatments that might make a difference. But she said people should know ""they could end up doing more harm than good"". ""The highest goal in medicine is important to remember: do no harm,"" she said. Grapefruit and its juice is known to affect enzymes which break down cancer drugs in the body On its website, Cancer Research UK says some complementary therapies might stop conventional treatments working as well as they should. It also says it is important toavoid some food and drinks such as grapefruit and oranges during cancer treatment,external, because they can affect how well cancer drugs are broken down in the body. The charity says: ""Talk to your doctor about any complementary therapies you're thinking of using. Tell them before you start having complementary therapy, especially if you're in the middle of a course of cancer treatment."" Grete Brauten-Smith, clinical nurse specialist at charity Breast Cancer Now said: ""With a lot of unproven information available online and little reliable research into these products, a discussion with a healthcare professional can ensure a patient has the accurate information they need to make an informed choice."" Speaking at the Advanced Breast Cancer Fifth International Consensus Conference, Prof Cardoso said therapies like yoga, mindfulness, reiki and acupuncture could have a positive impact on patients' quality of life.

"This video can not be played Ann Barker says claiming mental health benefits is ""hideous"" One in two people who appealed in court against a decision to deny them disability benefits was successful, analysis of five years of data shows. In total, more than 550,000 people won an appeal over their benefits at tribunal between 2013 and 2018. Ann Barker, who has bipolar disorder, said she was tempted to give up, but had twice fought a decision at tribunal and won. The government said only around 5% of disability decisions were overturned. Benefits assessments are carried out on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos) and Maximus. The success rates showed benefits assessments were beset by ""poor decision-making"" and ""obvious inaccuracies"", charities said. In 2018, the Commons Work and Pensions Committee saidfailings in disability benefits assessmentshad led to a ""pervasive lack of trust"" in the system. It said ministers should consider taking the process back in-house. Daphne Hall, the vice chair of the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers, said: ""The reason for the high success rates [at tribunals] is because of the poor assessments carried out by health professionals. ""The DWP tend to base their decision purely on these assessments and disregard other evidence sent in by the claimant. ""However, tribunals will weigh up all the available evidence and talk to the claimant further, which enables them to make much more reasoned and balanced decisions."" The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed figures from Freedom of Information responses from HM Courts and Tribunals Service and Northern Ireland's Department for Communities (DfC). Most of the appeals concerned Employment Support Allowance (ESA), which is paid to people unable to work because of illness or disability; the Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which is paid to people with extra care or mobility needs; and Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which was introduced to replace DLA It found: About 553,000 successful appeals were heard at tribunal about disability, sickness and incapacity benefits out of 981,000 from 2013 to 2018 Last year, around two thirds of cases heard in Great Britain found in favour of the claimant. In Northern Ireland, the figure was around 54% in 2018-19 Since 2013, people seeking to overturn a benefits ruling must complete a written challenge within a month, known as a mandatory reconsideration. If unsuccessful, people can appeal against the decision at tribunal. The DWP said mandatory reconsiderations were introduced to ensure claimants received the right decision without having to go to court. Critics say the process is confusing, stressful and does not give claimants enough time to gather evidence to support their appeal. Judges heard Stephen Naish was unable to pick up a Â£1 coin with either hand Stephen Naish, 60, from Poole in Dorset, was a sheet metal worker for 16 years but was forced to quit work following a motorcycle accident that left him paralysed in his right arm. He now has curvature of the spine, a frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, and damaged tendons in his left arm. Last year, his Employment Support Allowance was removed following a health assessment. ""My income was something like Â£30 to Â£40 a month less than my outgoings, without my travel and food,"" Mr Naish said. ""I was literally down to my last tin of potatoes. ""I had to go to a food bank and I was very lucky as I borrowed money from my wonderful mother and a good friend. It was stressful."" The government declined to overturn the decision following his written appeal, but he won at tribunal in May. Judges heard he was unable to pick up a Â£1 coin with either hand. Ann Barker said: 'I kept wanting to give up, saying to myself I don't want the money, I will manage.' Ann Barker, from Norwich, who has bipolar disorder, psoriasis, arthritis and lower back pain, has twice taken the government to tribunal and won. In 2013, she appealed against a decision to refuse her the mobility and care components of Disability Living Allowance. Then she challenged a second time when she was refused an application for a Personal Independence Payment. Ms Barker said: ""I kept wanting to give up, saying to myself I don't want the money, I will manage. ""They were asking me if I could find a place of work and I was saying on a bad day [when she is depressed], I can't leave my bedroom. ""They have a protocol but it's all geared towards physical health disabilities. The last tribunal obviously heard me, they knew I had hidden disabilities."" Emma Carrington, advice and information manager at Rethink Mental Illness, said: ""We've heard from countless people living with mental illness that challenging welfare decisions is long and extremely bureaucratic. ""This process can be stressful and often demeaning, and many people don't have the energy to challenge the decision. ""Many assessors don't understand the fluctuating nature of mental illness."" The DWP said the health assessments were carried out by professionals with the ""right clinical experience"". The rise in the percentage of successful appeals came despite a drop in the overall number of cases being heard at court. Charities said the introduction of mandatory reconsiderations andcuts to legal aidhad deterred people from appealing. ""If someone is already struggling to navigate the labyrinthine benefits system, then they are probably going to struggle to navigate the courts system without help,"" said Polly Neate, chief executive at anti-homelessness charity Shelter. Kamran Mallick, the chief executive of the Disability Rights UK charity, said he had not been able to walk since the age of three but was asked to try and stand up at his own PIP assessment. He said: ""I was asked if I could try standing up. That's just crazy, because I can't.  And yet despite that, I was asked to try harder. ""It's kind of dehumanising, degrading. It feels like you are being told that you are not telling the truth. "" Four in five win court disability benefits appeals DWP criticised over dying man's benefits refusal Benefits firm aims to curb 'reputational damage' The Ministry of Justice said it was ""pure speculation"" to suggest a decline in the number of benefit appeals was down to legal aid changes. A spokesman said it would pilot a scheme next year offering early legal advice to people with social welfare problems. The DWP said it had been improving the assessment process. It said of 3.3 million PIP decisions taken from 2013 to 2019, only 5% were overturned at appeal, while of 4.4 million ESA decisions made between 2014 and 2019, only 4% were overturned at appeal. A spokesman said: ""We are committed to ensuring people get the support they are entitled to and spend Â£55bn a year supporting disabled people and those with health conditions."" The Department for Communities in Northern Ireland said about 10% of all of the PIP decisions it handled were appealed, with about 2.5% of the overall number of cases successful. Capita and Maximus said the majority of people were satisfied with the process and they were working with charities and disability organisations to improve their services further.

" by Iain Watson Jeremy Corbyn was speaking to me just before going on stage to deliver his 87th speech of the 2015 Labour leadership campaign. His credo didn’t sound like that of a Stalinist or Trotskyist - terms used in much of the tabloid press to describe, or indeed denounce, him. But this wasn’t a speech to a local Labour Party, or an anti-war rally, or the Durham Miners’ Gala. The venue was deep inside what many would have assumed to be “enemy” territory - a theatre in Chelmsford (Conservative majority at the time: 18,250) and it was filled to capacity. Jeremy Corbyn had acquired Essex appeal. He didn’t have style. He wasn’t a great orator. He didn’t - on stage at least - demonstrate humour. But he had something. Possibly it was political conviction, combined with a lack of slickness that had attracted both converts and the curious. Perhaps he’d caught the zeitgeist - in an era of political disillusionment, lack of experience was seen as a positive asset. He had never been a government minister, he had never been a shadow minister. Corbyn was someone barely known outside left-wing politics. The journey from relative obscurity to Corbynmania had been as swift as it was unexpected. Under recently changed party rules, contenders required the support of 35 MPs to get on the Labour leadership ballot. Corbyn had cleared this threshold just one minute and 45 seconds before nominations closed at midday on 15 June. Fewer than half of the MPs backing him were actual supporters from Labour’s left. The rest were MPs who - following Labour’s unexpectedly bad election defeat - wanted the fullest possible debate on the party’s future and “lent” support. Not much thought had been put into which MP should be the left’s leadership candidate, according to Corbyn. “We decided somebody should put their hat in the ring. And, unfortunately, it’s my hat in the ring,”he told the Guardian. “Well, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell have done it before, so it was my turn.” Although he had stumbled into the contest, the subsequent campaign was professionally organised. As a result of reforms by the previous leader Ed Miliband, voting was open not just to party members but also registered supporters. Those to the left of Labour were encouraged through social media campaigns to sign up. Some who had abandoned the party during the Blair years returned. Members and former members of the Green Party seemed to be particularly enthused. And some people who simply hadn’t been involved in politics were engaged by Corbyn’s distinctive anti-austerity message.

The extent of Corbyn’s appeal may have surprised many of his fellow Labour MPs, but the potential reservoir of support had been built up over many years of activism. While still at grammar school in Shropshire, Corbyn had founded the Wrekin Young Socialists, and had produced a magazine and organised protests against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War. It was an ideal pedigree for someone who would go on to form the Stop the War coalition in 2001. This was set up to oppose intervention in Afghanistan after 9/11, but it came into its own in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. One protest in central London attracted as many as 750,000 people, according to police estimates (the organisers said it was even bigger), with demonstrators drawn from many political parties. Stop the War’s website in 2015 rather astutely publicised a link to register as a Labour supporter and vote for Corbyn. It accompanied this with a helpful guide entitled “How to vote for Jeremy as leader” and called for his “strong alternative voice to war and austerity” to get a hearing. He paid them back when he apologised, as party leader, for the previous Labour government’s support for the Iraq war.

A former official for the National Union of Tailors and Garment Workers, and then the public service union NUPE (now Unison) in the 70s, Corbyn was perfectly content to accept trade union funding for his campaign - though mostly from Unite, under the left-wing leadership of Len McCluskey, who was to be an important ally in the years to come. On 12 September 2015, Corbyn was elected as Labour’s leader, gaining more votes than his three rivals - ex-ministers Burnham and Yvette Cooper, and former shadow minister Liz Kendall - put together.  This piece was first published 14 November 2019 and has been amended since. Jeremy Corbyn was speaking to me just before going on stage to deliver his 87th speech of the 2015 Labour leadership campaign. His credo didn’t sound like that of a Stalinist or Trotskyist - the terms used in much of the tabloid press to describe, or indeed denounce him. But this wasn’t a speech to a local Labour Party, or an anti-war rally, or the Durham Miners’ Gala. The venue was deep inside what many would have assumed to be “enemy” territory - a theatre in Chelmsford (Conservative majority at the time: 18,250) and it was filled to capacity. Jeremy Corbyn had acquired Essex appeal.  Jeremy Corbyn addressing a rally in Chelmsord, September 2015 Jeremy Corbyn addressing a rally in Chelmsord, September 2015 He didn’t have style. He wasn’t a great orator. He didn’t - on stage at least - demonstrate humour. But he had something. Possibly it was political conviction, combined with a lack of slickness that had attracted both converts and the curious. Perhaps he’d caught the zeitgeist - in an era of political disillusionment, lack of experience was seen as a positive asset. He had never been a government minister, he had never been a shadow minister. Corbyn was someone barely known outside left-wing politics.

Corbyn’s trade union background also stood him in good stead.

On 12 September 2015, Corbyn was elected as Labour’s leader, gaining more votes than his three rivals - ex-ministers Burnham and Yvette Cooper, and former shadow minister Liz Kendall - put together. The 1980s may be remembered as the Thatcher era, but for much of the decade, London was run by radical left-wing politicians intent on confronting the Conservative government wherever they could. Ken Livingstone ran the GLC from 1981 until its abolition in 1986, and in Islington the red flag flew over the town hall. Jeremy Corbyn was very much part of this era. He was elected as a Labour councillor in the London borough of Haringey in 1974, where he chaired the council’s planning committee. The former council leader Toby (now Lord) Harris says, “I have known him for more than 40 years and his political position has hardly shifted.” 1975: Jeremy Corbyn (left), then a Haringey borough councillor, with colleague Les Silverstone 1975: Jeremy Corbyn (left), then a Haringey borough councillor, with colleague Les Silverstone Corbyn takes issue with those who say that he is still in some ways the local councillor and campaigner who is immersed in politics at the expense of all else. His first wife Jane Chapman - who was also a Labour councillor - seemed to think that he spent more time in meetings than he spent with her. The couple broke up in 1979. Afterwards,she told the Daily Mail: “We didn’t do things that I liked such as going to the cinema or to clubs. I wanted a different work-life balance.” Leader profiles: Boris Johnson Jo Swinson Nicola Sturgeon Nigel Farage He had already become a vegetarian. Chapman commented that “he showed little interest in food” and would happily eat baked beans straight from the can. In other words, this anti-austerity campaigner led a life which was, well, austere. He himself describes his lifestyle as “frugal”. “He was very passionate in opposing public sector cuts,” says Harris (at that time, cuts by the 1974-79 Labour government). But Corbyn’s political interests were always global as well as local.  He adds: “He feels passionate about national liberation struggles.” In this, he was following the Corbyn family pattern. His parents Naomi and David met at a gathering in London in the 30s to oppose Franco’s attempt to seize power in Spain. 1984: The newly-elected member for Islington North 1984: The newly-elected member for Islington North Before standing for elected office, the young Corbyn undertook voluntary work overseas, spending two years as a youth worker in Jamaica in the late 60s. He has also travelled extensively in Latin America. “I have got very few qualifications,” he once told me (he dropped out of North London Polytechnic), “but I have a fascination of reading, and read a lot.” He became an MP for Islington North, a seat which borders Haringey, in the general election of 1983. He was the beneficiary of a Labour Party split - the sitting MP had defected to the newly formed SDP, creating a vacancy. Although he won the seat, the party went down to a disastrous defeat nationally on a manifesto that championed some of Corbyn’s thencauses celebres- among them, withdrawal from the EU and the abolition of nuclear weapons. For the next three decades, he tended to come to prominence usually for campaigning on issues close to his heart - opposing the apartheid regime in South Africa, and the authoritarian regime of Augusto Pinochet, the military leader who ruled Chile between 1973 and 1990. Corbyn’s second wife Claudia Bracchitta had fled Chile, aged 11, with her parents, following the brutal coup that ousted the democratically elected left-wing government of Salvador Allende. Support for Pinochet from elements in the US administration fuelled Corbyn's distrust of American intervention around the world - a distrust that has never been dispelled. While some of Corbyn’s campaigns endeared him to sections of the left, they also helped keep him on the backbenches. And some causes he supported were far more controversial within Labour’s ranks, never mind with the wider public. While he gained respect - after initial scepticism - for championing the cause of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six, wrongly convicted of terrorist offences, Corbyn’s wider support for Irish unity was more problematic. He fell foul of the then Labour leader Neil Kinnock when he invited two Irish Republican former prisoners - who had not been wrongfully convicted - to the House of Commons in 1984. This was just weeks after the IRA had bombed Brighton’s Grand Hotel during the Conservative conference - coming close to killing Margaret Thatcher. Then, as now, he portrayed himself as a pioneer of the peace process. Kinnock was not the only Labour leader that Corbyn would displease. He rebelled against Tony Blair’s government 533 times – and even voted against his party quite frequently under Ed Miliband’s more left-wing leadership. In 2009 at a Palestine Solidarity meeting he referred to “our friends from Hezbollah” and “our friends from Hamas”. His defence, when criticised, was similar to his stated reasons for meeting Irish republicans. He told Channel 4 News that “to bring about a peace process, you have to talk to people with whom you profoundly disagree”. Initially, that also appeared to be his approach to leading Labour. In 2015, the newly elected Labour leader found himself in a strange position. He was popular among new party members and supporters, but not among most of his fellow MPs. To many of them, Jeremy Corbyn looked both too weak and too radical for the electorate. The party was behind in the polls and a defeat worse than that suffered by Michael Foot in 1983, appeared to beckon. Some wouldn’t serve in his shadow cabinet, but Corbyn did try to reach out at first. Leadership challenger Andy Burnham became shadow home secretary. Angela Eagle, who would later launch an abortive attempt to oust him, served initially at his top table. Hilary Benn (left) was removed as shadow foreign secretary following a public disagreement over Syrian air strikes Hilary Benn (left) was removed as shadow foreign secretary following a public disagreement over Syrian air strikes Tensions were not long in arising. Three months after Corbyn became leader, the government decided to extend bombing raids to Syria. The Labour leader was furious when the shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn publicly sided with the Conservatives in backing air strikes. It symbolised a gap - soon to become a chasm - between the party in Parliament and the wider membership which backed Corbyn. Matters came to a head in the wake of the 2016 European referendum. Labour MPs said the leader’s lack of enthusiasm for the Remain campaign had contributed to its defeat. A plot to oust Corbyn - not, as it turned out, a very well-developed one - had been discussed before the referendum and was put into action soon after. Eight out of 10 of Corbyn’s parliamentary colleagues voted no confidence in him and leading figures in his shadow cabinet resigned. I am told Corbyn himself was close to resignation at one point but, according to his former chief of staff Katy Clark, he felt he would be letting down the members who had placed their trust in him. His trade union ally Len McCluskey declined to broker a deal that would have seen Corbyn agree to stand down ahead of the next scheduled election in 2020. June 2016: Momentum holds a ""Keep Corbyn"" rally outside Parliament, following calls for the Labour leader's resignation June 2016: Momentum holds a ""Keep Corbyn"" rally outside Parliament, following calls for the Labour leader's resignation It was about this time that the grassroots movement Momentum started to flourish. Set up by veteran left winger Jon Lansman, and Corbyn’s closest political ally, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell, it aimed to harness the spirit of the leadership campaign in order to prepare for, and defend, a future left-wing government. “From the beginning we expected people to resist, and when they did we were prepared,” says Lansman. Momentum’s membership rose from about 2,000 before what he terms “the coup”, to 20,000. It has since doubled its membership again. And while Corbyn was seen as - at best - a mundane parliamentary performer by some long-standing MPs, the challenge to his leadership gave him back his mojo. He did what he did best - addressing rallies of supporters, and campaigning around the country. Research from the ESRC party members projectshowed that most of those who had joined Labour before 2015 backed the leadership challenger Owen Smith - but most newer members, attracted by Corbyn’s message, remained steadfastly loyal. Corbyn’s second leadership victory was won comfortably, and led to a shadow cabinet not exactly in his image, but much closer to his own politics. Grassroots members, outraged at the leadership challenge, also voted for a ruling national executive that shared Corbyn’s outlook. When Theresa May called a general election in 2017, many (though not all) pollsters underestimated Labour’s position (including the company employed by the party’s head office). Poor local election results seemed to presage a disaster. So much so that not one but two putative leadership campaigns began to form. His well-attended rallies in marginal seats were initially dismissed as displacement activity and preaching to the converted. But May often proved awkward and stilted on the campaign trail, while Corbyn revelled in his appearances on the stump. He astounded many on his own side by taking Labour to a 40% vote share in the 2017 election. Standing outside Labour’s HQ, reporting on the result, I spoke to one of the strategists who emerged smiling from the anonymous building. “How did you do that?” I asked. “No idea,” he said. “We did a lot on social media in the closing stages but I had no clue if it was being effective.” Corbyn had gained the highest number of votes for Labour since 1997 (although Tony Blair had won a landslide, while Corbyn went down to defeat) and the party’s biggest increase in vote share since the post-war landslide. Corbyn believes this relative success of the 2017 campaign had much to do with a  manifesto that was distinctly different not just from the Conservatives, but from New Labour, whose brave new dawn ended in the twilight of the 2008 financial crash. It had at its heart higher taxation for the better-off and a plan to bring the railways - along with the water industry in England - back into public ownership. The 2017 election result also had much to do with keeping both longstanding and newer, more left-wing supporters, on board - a task made easier by a poor Conservative campaign and a weak Lib Dem alternative. The sometimes dismissive tone towards Corbyn in the press was revised and far fewer people laughed at the idea that he could one day be prime minister. In the immediate aftermath of the election his personal ratings - which have since slumped - were far more positive than May’s He was lauded by festival goers at Glastonbury where he delivered a speech from the main Pyramid Stage - once the preserve of rock royalty. “The commentariat got it wrong,” he told the crowd. “The elite got it wrong. Politics is about the lives of all of us, and the wonderful campaign that I was involved with, that I was so proud to lead, brought people back into politics because they believed there was something on offer for them.” At Glastonbury, and throughout the summer of 2017, the chant of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” (to the tune of the White Stripes hit, “Seven Nation Army”) seemed ubiquitous. Indeed later that year his deputy Tom Watson - a regular Glastonbury attendee, with whom Corbyn has had a strained relationship - led a chorus from the stage at Labour’s annual conference. But the price of apparent popularity is scrutiny. Corbyn’s second period of leadership has not been entirely sure-footed.  One of Jeremy Corbyn’s close colleagues puts it like this: “You have to understand that Jeremy does move on issues, but he moves very slowly.” In an era of fast-moving media, some question whether Corbyn is flexible enough to change his position - especially when it becomes all but untenable - or whether he has the judgement to inoculate himself against issues that have become toxic. Corbyn has made it clear on many occasions that he opposes “anti-Semitism and all forms of racism”. Yet he remains accused by some in his own party of doing too little, too late when it comes to tackling anti-Semitism. His leadership victory brought in some activists who had been in parties to the left of Labour, as well as some former activists that had left over Iraq. Corbyn takes the same line as his mentor, the late Tony Benn, that “there are no enemies on the left”. He opposed Neil Kinnock’s expulsion of Militant activists in the 80s, along with many on Labour’s left who termed it a “witch hunt”. However, Militant wasn’t just a grouping of left-wing Labour supporters. It was a front for the Revolutionary Socialist League - a Trotskyite group that sought to infiltrate a non-revolutionary, democratic socialist party. So it could be argued that in Labour’s broad church, Corbyn has always been happy to keep an open door to its left. And the recent arrival, or re-entry, of some on the left who had been critical of Israeli governments and Western policy in the Middle East, seems to have coincided with an increase in allegations of anti-Semitism. Although the overall number of cases is still relatively small, the political impact has been big. Following the attempt to oust him in 2016, Some of Corbyn’s supporters became more raucous on social media. Insiders say these self-styled cheerleaders did him no favours by claiming that the issue was essentially anti-Corbyn propaganda, when party officials had uncovered examples of anti-Semitism among some of his self-declared supporters. One poll, by YouGov for the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, suggested more than eight  out of 10 Jewish voters believed that Labour was too tolerant of anti-Semitism, and tainting the brand of an anti-racist party, in the view of many of its MPs. Whether this perception is fair, the anti-Semitism row raised questions about Corbyn’s own leadership abilities. July 2018: Jewish community groups protest outside Parliament against the Labour Party's response to anti-Semitism allegations July 2018: Jewish community groups protest outside Parliament against the Labour Party's response to anti-Semitism allegations His support for attempts to add caveats to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism, insisting that free speech on Israel should be protected when deciding whether party members would be disciplined, caused friction even within the left of the party. Corbyn’s judgement was also called into question when it was revealed that in 2012, he had defended a mural depicting bankers playing what appeared to be Monopoly on the backs of the poor. Many saw it as a classic anti-Semitic trope, including the then Labour (now Lib Dem) MP Luciana Berger, who brought it to wider attention. Corbyn was forced on the defensive, saying he should have looked more closely at the image. Party processes in dealing with complaints of anti-Semitism have been speeded up. His supporters point out that he didn’t halt the expulsion of long-standing ally Ken Livingstone, or try to prevent another close colleague, the Derby MP Chris Williamson, from being disciplined for saying that Labour had “given too much ground” on the issue. But Labour is now being investigated by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The well-publicised allegations have already hit Corbyn hard politically - gnawing away at trust, advertising internal divisions, and making his claim to the moral high ground less firm. Lord Harris may consider that Corbyn’s views have remained rigid, but his position on other matters has certainly become more flexible - for instance, unilateral nuclear disarmament, an issue on which he campaigned in 1983. Many of Corbyn’s trade union backers had wanted him to maintain and renew the deterrent, and the party’s policy of multilateral not unilateral nuclear disarmament has remained the same. However, that doesn’t mean he has accepted the concept of deterrence. At his first party conference as leader in 2015, he made it clear that he would never press the nuclear button. On the issue of Brexit, Corbyn has also shown flexibility. There is a good reason for this. During the failed 2016 leadership challenge, the members were on his side against the parliamentarians. On Brexit, the grass roots were more in step with MPs - pro-Remain, and in favour of a second referendum. Corbyn’s own views seem to have evolved - accommodating, if not embracing, the aspirations of some of the newer, younger pro-EU members. But his critics say that he should have led from the front. He opposed membership of the then-EEC at the 1975 referendum and happily stood on the 1983 Labour manifesto calling for withdrawal. Like Benn, he has been suspicious of an organisation where he believes unelected Brussels bureaucrats have huge influence - including initiating legislation. Corbyn's views on Europe are thought to echo those of his political ally, the late Tony Benn (pictured here in 2009) Corbyn's views on Europe are thought to echo those of his political ally, the late Tony Benn (pictured here in 2009) In the 2016 referendum, he addressed plenty of meetings for the Remain cause, but pro-EU MPs sensed a lack of gusto. As one MP said to me at the time, “He is far more interested in food banks than euro federalism”. A prominent Momentum member said he believed Corbyn hoped initially to “get Brexit out of the way, and move on to issues that really mattered”. Interviewed on a Channel 4 show during the referendum campaign, he himself put his enthusiasm for EU membership at “the top half of the five-10 range; seven, maybe seven-and-a-half out of 10”. He was then swift - some thought a little too swift - to say he would respect the result of the referendum. He tried to negotiate a Leave deal in the dying days of the May premiership, but this was subsequently abandoned - apparently amid fears that she could not deliver enough of her own MPs in support of it. But he changed position again - offering a new referendum with Remain on the ballot paper if there had been a Labour government. He wanted to negotiate what he called a “credible Leave option” to give voters a choice. But what is interesting is that he shifted not because of pressure applied by those who almost always criticise him. Key voices on the left grew louder in calling for a clearer Remain stance, especially after disastrous European election results in May 2019. These included John McDonnell, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, and shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis. But for some on the left, he was too stubborn. He wouldn't make Labour an avowedly Remain party. I was told that was a red line he would not cross. Others think that while he has shown flexibility, he hasn’t shown agility. Even some of his own inner circle feel he should have displayed more clarity during the European election campaign. Corbyn wouldn't say if he would adopt a neutral stance between Leave and Remain in a Labour-instigated referendum, if he had made it to 10 Downing St. That would have been decided in due course at a special conference. Crueller critics say he was sitting on the fence over whether he’ll sit on the fence. So doubts remained over whether he would have been nimble enough to react to the public and the party’s mood in No 10.

So doubts remained over whether he would have been nimble enough to react to the public and the party’s mood in No 10. Pre-arrange an interview with Jeremy Corbyn, and he is far more engaging, disarming - even charming - than you might imagine. He’ll sometimes tell you about a book he has been reading. He will occasionally poke gentle fun at his internal opponents. He once told me his 2016 leadership challenger Owen Smith offered him the post of party president if he’d stand aside. He then said in hushed tones, with a glint in his eye: “Of course I found out this post didn’t actually exist.” He once took me through the history of a building society advertised in a hoarding behind him, as he warmed up for an interview on the campaign trail. And recently, he gave a colleague his top holiday tips for a visit to Mexico (his third wife, Laura Alvarez – whom he married in 2012 – is Mexican). But often he is more thin-skinned, resenting in particular those who try to get an unauthorised word from him outside his front door. He is fiercely protective of his privacy and that of his family. He would say he is open to scrutiny, but that he draws the line at intrusion. In his acceptance speech as party leader in 2015, Corbyn denounced the “appalling levels of abuse” that members of his family suffered during the campaign and he appealed to reporters to “leave them alone in all circumstances”. And there are circumstances where Corbyn himself would like to be left alone. He once chided Channel 4’s Cathy Newman and myself for talking over each other as we fired off questions to him. Martyn Sloman - a member of Islington Labour in the 1980s - told me Corbyn behaved much the same way to party members as to the press. He was never rude or aggressive, says Sloman, but he didn’t like being challenged: “That was his weakness. He didn’t like criticism at all. He bridled at it.” And some said his thin skin would need to transform into a rhino hide if he were to go from opposition leader to prime minister. But did he really want the job? Or was he - as some critics suggest - more interested in moving Labour permanently to the left? Lansman said that the Corbyn leadership had changed Labour irrevocably. “We are never going back to neo-liberalism,” he says. “That’s been decided forever - well, for a generation. The party is a fundamentally different party and there is no going back.” And it’s certainly true that the party has changed rapidly under Corbyn’s leadership. Before the election, the levers of power in the party were controlled by his supporters. If he was willing to be as ruthless, and as determined in the face of adversity, his backers believed he could lead a radical government. But before becoming Labour leader, his appetite for power seemed to be rather limited. In his Guardian interview in 2015 – when he got on the leadership ballot but before he won the contest – he said: “At my age I’m not likely to be a long-term contender, am I?” He often sidestepped the direct question. Soon after becoming Labour leader, Corbyn chose to answer the question in this way: “The best type of leader is a reluctant leader.” He certainly reflected long and hard when most of his MPs wanted to oust him in 2016, but he didn’t resign. He has resilience. And he has made it clear that despite speculation he would have served a full term as prime minister if elected. Some detractors questioned how far he would have been in charge if elected. They pointed to the influence wielded by advisers, such as former political commentator turned strategist Seumas Milne,  and Andrew Murray, a veteran of the Stop the War coalition. But this was dismissed by one insider, who said there is a myth of “the good king and the bad advisers” - they insist that Jeremy Corbyn knows his own mind and his staff reflect rather than mould his views. There is a belief in his inner circle that “dark forces in the Establishment” would do whatever they could to stop him entering Downing Street. There was a call for an investigation when the Times, in June, alleged that senior civil servants had questioned his physical fitness for office. McDonnell, however, claimed that Labour’s leader was the “fittest person I know”. But some opponents may have been closer to home. Momentum has supported his leadership but has at times also shown its independence. I’m told that its founder, Jon Lansman, hopes that John McDonnell will become the next party leader. ButMcDonnell himself recently told GQ magazinethat the next leader should be a woman. What is remarkable is that, on the brink of an election, in the bars, cafes and corridors at Labour’s recent conference, there was widespread speculation over who should be Corbyn’s replacement. I was even told of aputschthat never really quite came to shove. In July this year, leading Labour peers took out a newspaper advert arguing that Jeremy Corbyn “had failed the test of leadership”. It was dismissed at the time as the predictable opposition of those ennobled by Corbyn’s predecessors. But the initiative didn’t come out of the blue. It was designed to give impetus to some on the left who were trying to sound out shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey as a replacement. Any potential plot quickly evaporated, but those mulling over whether or how to proceed  wanted to clear out some of the key figures in the leader’s office too - and that part of the plan now seems to have come to fruition. Corbyn’s robust gatekeeper Karie Murphy - a close friend and ally of Unite’s Len McCluskey - was moved aside to a role in the party’s head office. Some of the Labour leader’s supporters believed that a move to drain his authority was under way. Corbyn’s position has also been weakened by the announced departure of Andrew Fisher - his policy guru who managed to be close both to the Labour leader and the shadow chancellor. In a letter to friends -seen initially by the Sunday Timesand subsequently by the BBC -  he denounces “a lack of professionalism and competence” in the backroom operation. He says that, while he hopes he is proved wrong, “I no longer have faith that we can succeed”. But there is no full frontal assault and it’s still likely Corbyn himself will choose when and how to go - though McDonnell has said this would only happen in the event of another election defeat. But his continuing supporters insist Jeremy Corbyn is here for the long haul. He is both fit and willing to take Labour to power. His pitch at his annual conference was that he could  bring a “different type of leadership” to politics. And his supporters would insist that after the divisions of the Brexit debate, it’s this serial rebel who is best placed to unite the country. His current catchphrase is “trust the people”. We won’t have to wait long to find out if they are willing to trust him. Pre-arrange an interview with Jeremy Corbyn, and he is far more engaging, disarming - even charming - than you might imagine. He’ll sometimes tell you about a book he has been reading. He will occasionally poke gentle fun at his internal opponents. He once told me his 2016 leadership challenger Owen Smith offered him the post of party president if he’d stand aside. He then said in hushed tones, with a glint in his eye: “Of course I found out this post didn’t actually exist”. He once took me through the history of a building society advertised in a hoarding behind him, as he warmed up for an interview on the campaign trail.

"University of Lincoln graduate Grace Millane died on the night before her 22nd birthday A man accused of murdering a British backpacker told police he struggled to put her body in a suitcase, a court has heard. Grace Millane was travelling in New Zealand when she died on the night before her 22nd birthday. The defendant claimed he panicked after finding her not breathing and put her body in a suitcase which he buried in a shallow grave in woods near Auckland. He denies murdering Ms Millane, who was from Wickford in Essex. Prosecutors have told Auckland High Court the 27-year-old defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, strangled Ms Millane on 1 December 2018 after a Tinder date. But his defence team claim the death was an accident during consensual sex. This video can not be played The court has been shown CCTV of the suspect taking a suitcase out of his hotel In a police interview played to the jury, the defendant said the pair engaged in rough sex which he claimed was initiated by Ms Millane. The man told police he had a shower and fell asleep before waking up the next day to find Ms Millane with ""blood coming from her nose"". ""I was very scared and called out to her and tried to move her to see if she was awake,"" he said. After discovering she was not breathing, the defendant said he ""panicked"" and went out to buy a suitcase and cleaning products before trying to hide her body. ""I remember putting Grace in the suitcase, I was just in shock, I couldn't put her in it, it didn't seem right, it didn't seem right,"" he said. Grace Millane was found buried in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland The defendant said he left Ms Millane ""half in half out of the suitcase"" in his Auckland hotel room while he went to buy bleach and then again when he went on a Tinder date. He said: ""Then I put her in the bag and was I was saying 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry' and then I went downstairs and got the porter thing (trolley) and I put the suitcase on top of it with another suitcase and I took it downstairs and put it in the hire car."" The man told officers he went out early on 3 December and buried the suitcase in a shallow grave in woodland outside the city. He claimed he had attempted to take his own life by taking an overdose after discovering Ms Millane's body and again when he buried her. ""I was in shock, I didn't know what to do,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""I could have been fired for saying this"" Outgoing European Council President Donald Tusk has urged British voters not to ""give up"" on stopping Brexit. As campaigning ramps up ahead of next month's general election, he warned that leaving the EU would leave the UK a ""second-rate player"". In a speech, he also said Brexit would likely mark the ""real end of the British Empire"". He is due to step down from his role next month, having held the post for five years. Mr Tusk's intervention comes as Conservative leader Boris Johnson said the UK Parliament was ""paralysed"" and had refused ""time and again to honour the mandate of the people and to deliver Brexit"". Former head of the UK diplomatic service Sir Simon Fraser said he believed Mr Tusk was a friend of the UK but argued making the comments was ""not the right thing to do"". ""I think the principle that politicians don't comment on the electoral affairs of other countries is a wise principle,"" he added. Brexit's fate in British hands, says Tusk PM vows to close 'opportunity gap' after Brexit Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Meanwhile, the UK has continued to refuse to put forward a candidate for the next European Commission, which is due to take office next month if approved by MEPs. The BBC understands the UK's EU ambassador has written to the Commission saying that a candidate will not be put forward due to the election. In the letter, Sir Tim Barrow is understood to say pre-election rules prevented ministers from putting forward nominees for jobs at EU institutions until after polling day. However, he is understood to have insisted the UK does not want to stop the Commission being formed as soon as possible. Mr Johnson is hoping to win a majority in 12 December's election so that he can take the UK out of the EU on 31 January with the deal he negotiated with Brussels. But Labour is promising to renegotiate that deal and put it to a referendum, with the option of remaining in the EU, if it wins the election - and smaller opposition parties are campaigning to Remain. Speaking at the College of Europe in Bruges, Mr Tusk said: ""Brexit may happen at the beginning of next year. ""I did everything in my power to avoid the confrontational no-deal scenario and extend the time for reflection and a possible British change of heart"". ""The UK election takes place in one month. Can things still be turned around? ""The only words that come to my mind today are simply: Don't give up. ""In this match, we had added time, we are already in extra time, perhaps it will even go to penalties?"" Donald Tusk's term of office ends in a few weeks' time. Which means he's prepared to brave accusations that he's interfering in the general election. And that he feels free to challenge the sense developing among the rest of the EU, that it would be better if the UK left as soon as possible. Speaking at the College of Europe in Bruges tonight, he quoted the philosopher Hannah Arendt to encourage those campaigning for Britain to remain. His message was simply not to give up. The EU has accepted an extension to the Brexit deadline, meaning the UK is now due to leave at the end of January 2020. Mr Tusk has repeatedly hinted he would like to see the UK stay in the bloc - but his comments, in the midst of an election campaign - are likely to be controversial. He acknowledged this in his speech, adding his remarks were ""something I wouldn't have dared to say a few months ago, as I could be fired for being too frank"". He added that a ""longing for the Empire"" could be heard in the voices of Brexiteers who strive to make the UK ""global again"" through leaving the EU. ""But the reality is exactly the opposite. Only as part of a united Europe can the UK play a global role,"" he added. ""One of my English friends is probably right when he says with melancholy that Brexit is the real end of the British Empire."" Mr Tusk is due to stand down from his role on 1 December, when he will be replaced by former Belgian PM Charles Michel.

"This video can not be played Key moments from Trump impeachment hearing Going into the first day of public impeachment hearings, it seemed as though details of the proceedings would be relatively familiar for those who have followed the last month of coverage of closed-door testimony from a parade of current and former government officials. Toward the end of his opening statement, however, acting US Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor changed the script. He revealed that one of his aides had been with US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland as he carried out a phone conversation with Donald Trump following a meeting with Ukrainians on 26 July, the day after the now-famous Trump-Zelensky phone call. According to Taylor, his aide heard Trump ask about ""the investigations"" - and Sondland replied that Ukraine was ready to move forward. Sondland then told Taylor's aide that the president cared more about the investigation of the Bidens than anything else involving Ukraine. This has the potential to be a major twist. There's been considerable testimony about Sondland's interaction with the Ukrainians, and the ambassador himself has testified that he told Ukrainian officials on 1 September that he presumed US military aid was probably being withheld until they opened investigations. This video can not be played A Democrat and a Republican react to the first public impeachment hearing During his Wednesday appearance, Taylor spoke of how Sondland told him that the president, as a businessman, wanted what was ""owed him"" before he ""signed the cheque"" and that there would be a ""stalemate"" if Ukraine didn't act - which Taylor interpreted as meaning military aid would not resume without investigations. Although there have also been reports of Sondland's direct line to the president, there has yet to be evidence tying Mr Trump directly to the alleged quid pro quo. The phone call Taylor described could change all that. In the middle of Wednesday's hearing, the House Intelligence Committee announced a new witness scheduled to give a closed-door deposition on Friday, an aide to Taylor named David Holmes - reportedly the aide Taylor mentioned. SIMPLE GUIDE:A basic take on what's going on GO DEEPER:Here's a 100, 300 and 800-word summary of the story WHAT'S IMPEACHMENT?A political process to remove a president VIEW FROM TRUMP COUNTRY:Hear from residents of a Virginia town ON THE DOORSTEP:A Democrat sells impeachment to voters Next week, Sondland himself is scheduled to testify during public hearings. Although the ambassador did not mention the phone call with the president in his original closed-door testimony, he's already had to update that testimony to reflect a new recollection of his discussions with Ukrainian officials about military aid. Democrats may be hoping he does so again. If either Sondland or Holmes supports Taylor's account, it could undercut the president's defenders who have suggested that Mr Trump was not closely involved in the activities of the ""unofficial"" channel of Ukraine policy, as Taylor called it, which was pressuring Ukraine to open up investigations into the Bidens. Just last week, when asked about his relationship with Sondland, Mr Trump said, ""I hardly know the gentleman"". If the president was taking direct calls from the ambassador after Ukrainian meetings, however, that assertion seems less believable. Later on Wednesday, during a joint press conference with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, the president went on record saying he didn't recall the call - ""not even a little bit"". ""I know nothing about that,"" he said. ""First time I've heard it."" That sets up the possibility that Holmes or Sondland may offer testimony that contradicts the president in the days ahead. In the meantime - either by happenstance or planning - the first day of open public impeachment hearings has its catchy headline and created a new avenue for investigation - and political speculation. A timeline of Trump-Ukraine story Who's who - meet the cast of characters Trumpâs man in Brussels in eye of the storm ""Democrats land damning new evidence in impeachment inquiry,"" heralded the website Politico. ""William Taylor's big impeachment reveal,"" read The Atlantic. ""Bill Taylor dropped a bombshell,"" echoed Vox.

And then all of a sudden, voila, he gets this miraculous intervention from one of his staffers that reminds him of something?"" Republican Congressman Mark Meadows told reporters outside the committee hearing room. ""When we start to look at the facts, everybody has their impression of what truth is."" After the day's biggest revelation, Democrats have reason to be pleased, while the president's team has a new set of headaches.

"A destroyed house in Khan Younis, where Israel said it had hit a Palestinian Islamic Jihad HQ Cross-border violence between Israel and militants in Gaza is continuing after an Israeli air strike killed a Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander. After an overnight lull, rocket fire towards Israel resumed and Israeli aircraft conducted retaliatory strikes on Wednesday. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said 32 Palestinians, including children, have been killed by Israeli fire. In Israel, 63 people have been treated for injuries and stress symptoms. Life in the Gaza Strip Is peace between Israel and Palestinians out of reach? Late on Wednesday, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) offered terms for a ceasefire, which included an end to Israel's targeted killings of militants and Gaza border protesters and well as steps to ease the blockade of the Palestinian enclave. Israel has so far made no public comments on the truce offer. After a six-hour pause, PIJ militants resumed firing rockets at around 06:30 (04:30 GMT) on Wednesday, triggering air-raid sirens in southern and central Israel. Most of the rockets fired by Palestinian militants have been intercepted by Israeli air defences At least 360 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza since Tuesday, the Israeli army says. It adds that 90% of the missiles were intercepted. An elderly woman was slightly wounded by broken glass after a rocket hit a house in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon, Israeli media reported. Another rocket hit a factory in the southern town of Sderot. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had bombed more PIJ targets in Gaza on Wednesday in response, including a military headquarters in Khan Younis and a factory manufacturing warheads for long-range rockets in the south of the strip. The IDF said ""20 terrorists"" were killed, most of them from Islamic Jihad. The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas militants, said 32 people had been killed in Israeli strikes, at least a third of them civilians. It said six Palestinians from a single family were killed in a strike in the early hours of Thursday morning at their home in Deir al-Balah town, central Gaza Strip. It was the deadliest incident reported since the beginning of the current fighting. The Israeli military has not yet commented on the incident. The rocket fire triggered air-raid sirens in southern and central Israel PIJ said the dead included members of its military wing, the al-Quds Brigades. Khaled Faraj, a field commander, was killed in a strike in central Gaza. UN Middle East peace envoy Nickolay Mladenov warned that the continuing escalation was ""very dangerous"". ""The indiscriminate launching of rockets and mortars against population centres is absolutely unacceptable and must stop immediately,"" he said. ""There can be no justification for any attacks against civilians."" In a statement,Save the Children charity said it was ""deeply concerned by the recently escalated hostilities"",,externalcalling for an immediate ceasefire. ""For the second day, hundreds of thousands of children are impacted by school closures  across Gaza and southern Israel, with parents terrified of the impact of further retaliation. ""Our teams in Gaza have been unable to go to work and our programmes have been suspended,"" the charity said. A pre-dawn Israeli air strike on a residential building in eastern Gaza City killed Baha Abu al-Ata, a senior PIJ military commander, and his wife. At about the same time, the home of another leader of the Iran-backed group was struck by an Israeli missile in Damascus, killing two people, Syrian state media said. Israel did not comment on the incident. This video can not be played Gaza militants retaliated with rocket fire - then Israel responded with further air strikes Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, described Abu al-Ata as an ""arch-terrorist"" and a ""ticking bomb"" who posed an imminent threat to the country. Abu al-Ata was thought to be behind recent rocket fire from Gaza, including an attack 10 days ago on Sderot, and to have acted increasingly outside of the control of the dominant militant faction Hamas. Militants in Gaza said Israel had crossed a ""red line"" and fired more than 200 rockets in response. About 90% of the rockets were intercepted by Iron Dome air defence systems, the IDF said, but one exploded on a main road close to passing cars, and elsewhere two people were lightly injured by shrapnel. An eight-year-old girl also suffered a heart attack in a bomb shelter and remains in a serious condition. The IDF said it carried out air strikes in Gaza targeting PIJ rocket-launching units and infrastructure. Gaza's health ministry said eight people were killed, in addition to Abu al-Ata and his wife. PIJ spokesman Musab al-Buraim told the Hamas-linked Shehab news agency that it was not ""appropriate"" to discuss Egyptian efforts to end the flare-up when the group was still retaliating for Abu al-Ata's death. Palestinian Islamic Jihad has vowed to avenge the death of Baha Abu al-Ata ""When we complete the response, it is possible to discuss calm,"" he said. At the start of a special cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu warned PIJ that if it did not halt the rocket fire Israel would continue to hit Gaza. ""They have but one choice: either stop these attacks or absorb more and more blows,"" he said. Earlier, IDF spokesman Brig Gen Hidai Zilberman told Israeli media that additional Iron Dome batteries had been deployed to central Israel as a precaution, and that commando units had been sent to communities near the Gaza border to defend them in case of infiltration attacks by militants. Israel's military said it had moved reinforcements to communities near the Gaza border There has been no sign yet that Hamas, which controls Gaza, intends to join the fight. If it does, the conflict would escalate sharply, says the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Jerusalem. In order to prevent that, Israeli officials have signalled they are targeting only PIJ, and not Hamas. Gen Zilberman said the IDF was ""walking on a tight-rope"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he is ""pro-immigration for talented people"" but he is ""also in favour of control"" Boris Johnson says he will seek to reduce unskilled migration coming into the UK, if the Tories win the election. Home Secretary Priti Patel made a commitment on Wednesday to reduce ""overall"" immigration to the UK. Asked about it, she said the Tories would ""look to reduce the numbers"" through better immigration controls but would not set ""arbitrary"" targets. Mr Johnson was also asked whether immigration would go down under a future Tory government. The prime minister said: ""I certainly think that when it comes to people who don't have a job to go to and are coming in in an uncontrolled way, we certainly need to be reducing that."" But he he added that he was ""in favour of people of talent coming to this country"". So where do main parties stand on immigration? Corbyn rules out 'arbitrary' immigration target What we can read into the polls at this stage Mr Johnson claimed in the past 20 years, the UK had seen ""a lot of people coming without a job to go to"", who were ""putting pressure on public services"" and did not ""necessarily have the skills that the economy demands"". Both Mr Johnson and Mrs Patel reiterated the Conservatives' plan for a ""points-based"" immigration system, which would apply to EU and non-EU migrants. Labour has yet to announce its policy on immigration. But Jeremy Corbyn said he would commit to ""a fair immigration process that recognised the huge contribution made by migrant workers to this country"". ""We have got to be realistic about the needs of our economy for bringing workers in, skilled workers in to help us,"" he added. An SNP spokesman said cutting immigration would be ""hugely damaging"" for the Scottish economy and called the issue to be devolved to the Scottish government. And the Lib Dems' home affairs spokesperson Christine Jardine called the Conservatives' approach ""an insult to the millions who have come to the UK and made it their home"". Ms Patel said in a statement released by the party on Wednesday: ""We will reduce immigration overall while being more open and flexible to the highly skilled people we need, such as scientists and doctors. ""This can only happen if people vote for a Conservative majority government so we can leave the EU with a deal."" However, in an interview on Thursday, Ms Patel stopped short of committing to reducing the overall numbers of people coming to the UK. She said her party's policy would be ""firm but fair while at the same time we can absolutely look to reduce the numbers in the system by having control over our immigration policy"". Asked if the Conservatives would set a target for reducing immigration, Ms Patel said targets were ""arbitrary"" adding ""clearly that is where public confidence has been eroded in the past"". The Conservatives had previously pledged to cut net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving the country - to below 100,000. Security Minister Brandon Lewis acknowledged that, by not fulfilling the pledge, the Conservatives had ""let people down"". Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? Has immigration held down wages? How could a UK points-based immigration system work? Ms Patel said a future Conservative government would seek to control immigration numbers through a points-based system. Under a points-based system, immigration applicants are assigned points according to a number of professional and personal characteristics, with higher points awarded for certain traits such as proficiency in the English language. The Conservatives say they will end free movement from the EU on 1 January 2021, if they win the election and get their Brexit deal through by 31 January. The government's immigration strategy fell into the parliamentary dustbin when the election was called. We still await the party manifestos but today the home secretary said in a press release: ""We will reduce immigration overall."" Asked to repeat this for the TV cameras later in the afternoon, she repeatedly refused, speaking only about ""controlling"" immigration. The reason this is difficult territory for the Conservatives is that in some part of the UK, migrant workers are desperately needed to keep public services going. The prime minister is known to favour a policy that works for the needs of the economy, even if that means migration numbers remain broadly where they are. Immigration is not the electoral issue it once was - pollsters say it is at its lowest level of concern for almost two decades. But some communities remain concerned that foreign arrivals put extra pressure on public services and jobs and those voters are often in the Labour seats that the Tories are looking to take. Labour members backed a party conference motion in Septemberdefending the right of EU migrants to live and work in the UK, to reject any immigration system based on quotas, caps, targets or incomes, and to extend migrant rights. But there is a debate at the top of the party over whether to include such a commitment in the party's general election manifesto, which is set to be finalised at a weekend meeting of its national executive committee. Unite union leader Len McCluskey, a key ally of Jeremy Corbyn, said extending free movement would not be ""sensible"",telling the Guardian,externalthat the only beneficiaries of uncontrolled immigration were ""the bosses of unscrupulous companies"". ""It's wrong in my view to have any greater free movement of labour unless you get stricter labour market regulation,"" he said. He said Labour had to heed public concerns over levels of unskilled immigration, as it was used to undercut the pay and conditions of British workers. ""If you don't understand those concerns, you fail to grasp the divisions that exist,"" he said. ""If we don't deal with the issues and concerns, we will create a vacuum that will be filled by a far right seeking to become the voice of the white working class."" Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said a Labour government would ""extend freedom of movement rights to all those legally entitled to be here"". Priti Patel claimed there would be a ""surge"" in immigration under a Labour government Labour promised to end free movement from Europe -  which is a condition of EU membership - in its 2017 general election manifesto, but some of the party's senior figures want to remain in the EU. Labour have said, if they win power, they will tear up Boris Johnson's Brexit agreement with the EU and negotiate a better deal based on a much stronger relationship with the EU's single market. Some within the party see Norway, which is outside the EU's political institutions but remains part of the single market as a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), as a model for the UK's future relationship. But the Conservatives claimed that if the UK was to remain in the EEA, it would have to accept free movement rules and that would see levels of net migration to the UK of 260,000 each year over the next decade If free movement rights were extended to non-EU countries, the Conservatives estimated that this figure could rise to an average of 840,000 a year - a number it said was based on ""official figures and the government's own methodology"". This is based on the assumption that Labour would allow free movement with the rest of the world and that the economy would continue to grow at its current level. According to the latest official figures, net migration totalled 226,000 in the year to March 2019. Although numbers have remained ""broadly stable"" since the end of 2016, EU immigration to the UK is currently at its lowest level since 2013. Labour said the Tories were knowingly misleading the public on its conference motion, which has no mention of geographically extending freedom of movement to other countries. Asked whether maintaining and extending free movement from the EU would be in their manifesto, Mr Corbyn said what goes in the manifesto is ""not necessarily every last dot and comma of every resolution passed at conference"". On Conservative accusations that immigration would rise under Labour, he said: ""I've no idea where they get those figures from - I suspect they just, quite simply, make them up.""

"New South Wales has faced catastrophic conditions The bushfires ravaging Australia this week have brought warnings of ""catastrophic"" danger. Fortunately, no lives were lost on Tuesday - when conditions were at their worst. But experts warned that events looked set to trigger the most dangerous type of bushfire - pyrocumulonimbus, often referred to as a firestorm. These are giant, fast-moving blazes so powerful they create their own weather systems akin to thunderstorms. And due to their ferocity, they are largely impossible to fight. With certain ground and atmospheric conditions, bushfires can rip through a large area with so much energy that they generate storms above them. This is a pyrocumulonimbus. Ordinarily, bushfires are driven along by the wind but a massive blaze can carry so much power that its smoke is not pushed to the side. Instead, it forms a plume that rises up to 15km (nine miles) into the sky. A large pyrocumulus cloud above the Carr fire in California in 2018 Because the plume contains heat and moisture, when it hits the stratosphere it can condense and form clouds. ""A pyrocumulonimbus is basically a thunderstorm within the plume of the fire,"" says Associate Prof Jason Sharples, an expert in extreme fires based at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). When the storm is formed, it means the fire below will be big, fast and very dangerous. ""That means it's big enough to overcome any other conditions,"" says UNSW climate scientist Prof Jason Evans. Worst of Australia's blazes 'still ahead' Latest images of the bushfire emergency Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? The fire grows in danger because it will carry along the characteristics of a storm - turbulent winds that can send embers shooting off in all directions. Sometimes it can also create its own lightning, which can spark more fires. Despite being a thunderstorm there is no rain. Instead the storm sucks in more embers and flings them far ahead of the fire front ""so the fire advances in big jumps"", says Prof Evans. This video can not be played ""It's like fireballs exploding in the air"": One town's mayor describes the Australia bushfires This makes the fire unpredictable and hard to fight, and multiple fronts emerge. ""When you get a decent thunderstorm the rain comes from all directions,"" says Associate Prof Sharples. ""Now imagine the same for embers."" Fire officials in New South Wales reported that embers were landing 30km (18 miles) ahead of the front on Tuesday - three times more than the usual distance. ""They are basically uncontrollable at that stage. The only option is to get out of the way,"" says Prof Evans. With emergency crews able to do little, these fires can die down naturally if they move out of rugged terrain or are deprived of other fuels. Pyrocumulus clouds from bushfires in Victoria in 2014 ""The only real way you can stop them is five years before they start,"" said Associate Prof Sharples. ""Once you get up into the catastrophic level, your fires tend to not obey the usual rules,"" he said. When the New South Wales bushfires intensified on Friday, some were reported to have produced pyrocumulus clouds. Officials feared one fire on Tuesday was escalating to this level and sent out an alert. Luckily it did not occur. While once seen as fairly rare events, firestorms have become much more common in recent years. They were present in Australia's Black Saturday bushfires in 2009 which killed 173 people. The day Australia saw 'the gates of hell' Australian experts have tallied close to 60 such events since 2001. A record 18 were recorded in March this year when fires burned in the state of Victoria. They were also seen during fires in Canberra in 2003, when a fire tornado was recorded. ""There's been a crazy increase in the frequency of these events,"" says Prof Evans. They are more likely when there are extremely dangerous conditions such as high temperatures, strong winds and little moisture. The likelihood is also increased by the effects of drought. Scientists have predicted that climate change is likely to increase the chances of such events. Worst of Australia's fire season 'still ahead' Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Our ambition is unlock the whole nation's potential"" Delivering Brexit would help the UK close the ""opportunity gap between rich and poor"", Boris Johnson has said. In his first big speech of the election campaign, he promised to boost regional industry and drive a ""clean energy revolution"" after the UK leaves the EU. He said a future Tory government would double investment in high-tech research and development to Â£18bn. But earlier former Tory David Gauke said Mr Johnson's plan will lead to a ""bad outcome for the country"". And Labour said Mr Johnson's Brexit deal was flawed and another referendum was needed. In other election developments: Boris Johnson is heckled on a visit to flood-hit Stainforthto see the emergency response Jeremy Corbyn rows back on comments that he would not back a Scottish independence referendumin the ""first term"" of a new government Labour ispromising to outspend the Conservatives on the NHSin England The Lib Dems ruleout any electoral pacts with Labour after two of its candidates stand down Former Tory rebelDavid Gauke, who is standing as an independent candidate, says an outright Tory would be a ""bad outcome"" for the UK The SNP is to take legal actionover its exclusion from the ITV head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn The Green Party says it would appointa Carbon Chancellorto oversee its Green New Deal and policy Speaking during a visit to an electric taxi manufacturer near Coventry, the PM set out his vision for post-Brexit Britain, saying his goal was to unite the country and ""level up"" economic performance by boosting the regions. He said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"", harnessing the power of science, innovation and technology to tackle climate change and create high-skilled, high wage jobs. A Tory victory on 12 December would see the UK leave the EU in January, he said, and that would be good for the country's ""politics, economy and psychological health"" after months of paralysis. ""We must get Brexit done because we are democrats,"" he said, saying while Leave voters wanted the result of the 2016 referendum result to be respected, Remain voters also accepted the ""wrangling had to end"". What does 'Get Brexit done,' mean? Will delaying Brexit cost Â£1bn a month? Donald Tusk: Don't give up on stopping Brexit But he departed from excerpts of the speech briefed to the media on Tuesday, leaving out references to Brexit ""groundhoggery"" and claims that calls for another Brexit referendum and a further vote on Scottish independence were a form of ""onanism"", or masturbation. Asked about this at a press conference after the speech, he blamed it on a ""stray draft"" of the speech released to the media. The Tory leader said the UK's economic fundamentals were sound, but he compared the country to a ""cup-winning horse trying to run on three legs"" with huge untapped potential and often ""vastly different"" educational outcomes. ""If every child had the same start and the same encouragement, think of the all untapped talent in this country,"" he said. ""Yet the solution to that inequality is within our grasp... not just to close the opportunity gap between rich and poor but also between the regions of this country."" He promised to make the ""small improvements in life that people are craving"" by addressing transport bottlenecks, improving rural bus services and broadband connections. He also said British apprentices must be employed on all ""big new public sector"" contracts after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the UK must be at the heart of the world's ""green revolution"" To demonstrate his party's support for enterprise, he said a future Tory government would double funding for research and development to Â£18bn in the next Parliament, which would amount to the ""biggest ever increase in support for R&D"". ""We proudly back businesses across this country because they are creating the wealth that actually pays for the NHS and everything else."" A Labour victory, he claimed, would lead to a ""Technicolor coalition"" with the SNP, prolonging the uncertainty for business over Brexit and the future of the UK. The PM is facing claims from a former cabinet colleague that his electionwould lead to a ""very hard Brexit""after Mr Gauke attacked the policy of the Conservatives to not extend the implementation period for Brexit past December 2020. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Labour has clear and simple Brexit plan - Corbyn The Tories plan to negotiate a free trade agreement with the European Union during that time, but have pledged to leave without one if no deal is reached by the deadline. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage cited the pledge as one of the reasons for his decision not to stand candidates in the 317 seats won by the Tories at the last general election, in 2017. This video can not be played David Gauke says a Conservative majority will move the UK towards ""a very hard Brexit"" Mr Gauke said ""one simply cannot renegotiate a trade deal in that time period"", and leaving without a deal would be ""disastrous for the prosperity of our countryâ¦ [making] whole sectors unviable"". But Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, said his former colleague was ""wrong"". Tories in fresh attack on Labour spending plans Flooding an absolute tragedy, says PM 'Stop Brexit' megaphone man to stand for Lib Dems He defended the progress the prime minister has made on Brexit, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""People throughout the summer said that Boris Johnson would not be able to secure a deal with the EU. ""The withdrawal agreement will never be reopened, they said. The backstop is unviable, you won't get it changed. ""They are people who have been left with oeuf on their faces because he succeeded in securing that deal in defiance of the sceptics and the cynics, and we can secure a free trade agreement by the end of 2020."" MPs backed Mr Johnson's Brexit deal in principle before Parliament was dissolved. But they refused to endorse his timetable to rush it through in days, meaning the PM had to abandon his ""do or die"" pledge to take the UK out by the 31 October deadline.
