"Cruise has won Golden Globes for Jerry Maguire, Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July Tom Cruise has handed back his three Golden Globes in protest at a lack of diversity among the body that runs the glittering annual Hollywood awards. He is the latest star to join a growing chorus of criticism. NBC, which has aired the event since 1996, has said it won't broadcast the ceremony next year. NBC said it wanted to see ""meaningful reform"" from the organisers, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The Golden Globes are second only to the Oscars in terms of profile. Time's Up, a leading advocate for industry reform, described NBC's move as a ""defining moment for Hollywood"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It added that it was committed ""to achieving these goals with extreme urgency"". The plans will widen the HFPA's membership, with an emphasis on recruiting black members and the hiring of diversity advisers. It has pledged to increase its membership by 50% over the next 18 months. The association also indicated it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules by publishing its membership list and accepting foreign entertainment journalists who are based across the US, not just in California. Diversity, equity and inclusion training will be given to all members, as well as sexual harassment awareness training. And members will be barred from accepting promotional items from film and TV studios. Scarlett Johansson claimed she had been asked sexist questions by HFPA members Time's Up described the proposals as ""window-dressing platitudes"". ""Any organisation or sponsors that set themselves up to pass judgement on our vibrant community of creators and talent must do better,"" said Time's Up president Tina Tchen.

The main issues appears to be that the implementation of changes isn't fast enough. According to Variety,external, organisations will continue to boycott the Globes and other HFPA events until the reforms are actually enacted. The timeline published by the HFPA,externalstates that a new board and new members will be in place by the first week of August. In a statement on Monday, NBC said: ""Change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes. ""Assuming the organisation executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023."" The TV network's decision also follows a steep drop inviewing figures for the Globes,external, which hit a 13-year low this year. That is a trend for film award shows in general - particularly during the pandemic, with many ceremonies eschewing the red carpet and conducting their events virtually. Sam Asi, who works for BBC Arabic and is a member of the HFPA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he found it ""bizarre"" that Hollywood was ""suddenly shocked"" about the lack of black members of the HFPA ""when this has been the case for 20 years"". ""HFPA members are seen every day by Hollywood talent, executives and publicistsâ¦ why the sudden shock?"" He added: ""Once the tide turned against the HFPA, everyone wanted to jump on the wagon and benefit from it. It's a political game.""

"The damage caused to a vehicle whose driver was innocently caught up in a collision An estimated 170,000 car insurance claims in 15 months are suspected to have been linked to ""crash for cash"" gangs, investigations suggest. Crash for cash is the name given to a fraud when criminals deliberately cause a road collision to claim compensation. The Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), which shares intelligence within the sector, said that parts of Birmingham were the centre of these cases. Insurers said the fraud cost meant premiums increased for all motorists. Men jailed for crash-for-cash scam Â£2m crash for cash convictions top 150 Facebook posts nail crash for cash gang The IFB said there were 2.7 million motor insurance claims across the UK from October 2019 to the end of last year, of which 170,000 could be linked to suspected crash for cash networks. It said the main hotspots were the B25, B34 and B8 postcode areas of Birmingham, and the BD7 and BD3 areas of Bradford. It hoped that by pinpointing crash for cash hotspots, people would be encouraged to be vigilant as more drivers start to take to the roads. Many innocent drivers are caught up in these collisions. IFB investigations have found single gangs can be behind thousands of orchestrated collisions in some areas, with the combined value of their fraudulent claims running into the millions. James Dalton, director of general insurance policy at the Association of British Insurers (ABI), said: ""These criminal gangs are often highly organised and put lives at risk. ""The amounts that they fraudulently claim can be huge, and can impact on the motor premiums paid by honest motorists."" Between 2011 to 2018, more than 150 people were convicted in south Wales for submitting bogus claims, as part of a Â£2m car insurance scam. The Yandell family's ""crash for cash"" swindlewent undetected for years due to the sheer number of people they roped into the scam. It centred around using vehicles in staged accidents so the fraudsters could submit bogus and exaggerated insurance claims.

"A cyber-criminal gang that took a major US fuel pipeline offline over the weekend has acknowledged the incident in a public statement. ""Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,"" DarkSide wrote on its website. The US issued emergency legislation on Sunday after Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware cyber-attack. The pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day - 45% of the East Coast's supply of diesel, petrol and jet fuel. The operator took itself offline on Friday after the cyber-attack. Work to restore service is continuing. How did cyber-attackers shut off a US pipeline? The ransomware surge ruining lives Travelex being held to ransom by hackers On Monday, the FBI officially confirmed that DarkSide was responsible for compromising Colonial Pipeline's networks, saying that it was continuing to work with the firm and other government agencies on the investigation. During a speech about the economy at the White House on Monday, US President Joe Biden said that he was being ""personally briefed"" on the situation with the pipeline each day. US President Joe Biden answers questions about the fuel pipeline cyber-attack during a speech about the economy at the White House ""The agencies across the government have acted quickly to mitigate any impact on our fuel supply,"" he said. ""We're prepared to take additional steps depending on how quickly the company is able to bring its pipeline back up to capacity."" A number of cyber-security researchers, including firms contacted by the BBC, have speculated that the cyber-criminal gang could be Russian, as their software avoids encrypting any computer systems where the language is set as Russian. Mr Biden said that the US government was concerned about this aspect of the cyber-attack. ""I'm gonna be meeting with President Putin and so far there is no evidence, based on our intelligence people, that Russia is involved,"" he said. ""Although, there's evidence that the actors' ransomware is in Russia - they have some responsibility to deal with this."" DarkSide posted a statement on its website on Monday, describing itself as ""apolitical"". The Colonial Pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day ""We do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for... our motives,"" the group said. The group also indicated it had not been aware that Colonial was being targeted by one of its affiliates, saying: ""From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future."" US fuel prices at the pump rose six cents per gallon on the week to $2.967 per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, the American Automobile Association (AAA) said on Monday, while Wall Street shares in US energy firms were up 1.5%. The AAA said prices were heading towards their highest level since 2014. On Sunday, the US governmentrelaxed rules on fuel being transported by road,externalto minimise disruption to supply. This allowed drivers in 18 states to work extra or more flexible hours when transporting refined petroleum products. However, there are fears that this could change if the shutdown is prolonged. Independent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC a lot of fuel was now stranded at refineries in Texas. ""Unless they sort it out by Tuesday, they're in big trouble,"" said Mr Sharma. ""The first areas to be hit would be Atlanta and Tennessee, then the domino effect goes up to New York."" He said oil futures traders were now ""scrambling"" to meet demand, at a time when US inventories are declining. Demand - especially for fuel for cars - is on the rise as consumers return to the roads and the economy recovers. The temporary waiver issued by the Department of Transportation enables oil products to be shipped in tankers up to New York, but this would not be anywhere near enough to match the pipeline's capacity, Mr Sharma warned. Sources said the ransomware attack was likely to have been caused by a cyber-criminal gang called DarkSide, who infiltrated Colonial's network and locked the data on some computers and servers, demanding a ransom on Friday. The gang stole almost 100 gigabytes of data hostage, threatening to leak it onto the internet. The FBI and other government agencies worked with private companies to respond - the cloud computing system the hackers used to collect the stolen data was taken offline on Saturday, Reuters reported. On Sunday, Colonial said that although its four main pipelines remained offline, some smaller lines between terminals and delivery points were now operational. ""Quickly after learning of the attack, Colonial proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat. These actions temporarily halted all pipeline operations and affected some of our IT systems, which we are actively in the process of restoring,""the firm said,external. It added it would bring its full system back online ""only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations"". An example of a DarkSide ransomware notice that appears on victims' computer screens The incident highlightsthe risk ransomware can pose to critical national industrial infrastructure,external, not just businesses. In addition to a notice on their computer screens, victims of a DarkSide attack receive an information pack informing them that their computers and servers are encrypted. The gang lists all the types of data it has stolen, and sends victims the URL of a ""personal leak page"" where the data is already loaded, waiting to be automatically published, should the company or organisation not pay before the deadline is up. DarkSide also tells victims it will provide proof of the data it has obtained, and is prepared to delete all of it from the victim's network. According to Digital Shadows, a London-based cyber-security firm,DarkSide operates like a business,external. A redacted screenshot of DarkSide's website on the dark web details its success in attacking a large US manufacturer The gang develops the software used to encrypt and steal data from companies. It then provides ransomware to ""affiliates"" who pay DarkSide a percentage of their earnings from any successful attacks. When it released new software in March that could encrypt data faster than before, the gang issued a press release and invited journalists to interview it. It even has a website on the dark web where it lists all the companies it has hacked and what was stolen, and an ""ethics"" page where it says which organisations it will not attack. DarkSide also works with ""access brokers"" - nefarious hackers who work to harvest the login details for as many working user accounts on various services as they can find. Rather than break into these accounts and alert users or the service providers, these brokers sit on the usernames and passwords and sell them off to the highest bidders - cyber-criminal gangs who want to use them to carry out much larger crimes. Digital Shadows thinks the Colonial attack was helped by the coronavirus pandemic, with more engineers remotely accessing control systems for the pipeline from home. James Chappell, co-founder of Digital Shadows, believes DarkSide could have bought account login details for remote desktop software such as TeamViewer and Microsoft Remote Desktop. DarkSide's website on the dark web details its achievements and sets out ""ethics"" of sorts He says it is possible for anyone to look up the login portals for computers connected to the internet on search engines like Shodan, and then ""have-a-go"" hackers just keep trying usernames and passwords until they get some to work. ""We're seeing a lot of victims now, this is seriously a big problem,"" said Mr Chappell. ""The amount of small businesses that are falling victim to this... It's becoming a big problem for the economy globally."" Digital Shadows' research shows the cyber-criminal gang is likely to be based in a Russian-speaking country, as it avoids attacking companies in post-Soviet states including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

"The Pfizer jab was already being given to people as young as 16 in the US The US has authorised the Pfizer vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds amid a push to get the shot into more Americans' arms. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it was ""a significant step in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic"". FDA Commissioner Dr Janet Woodcock said the move was aimed at ""bringing us close to returning to a sense of normalcy and to ending the pandemic"". About 250 million doses have been given in the US, but demand has been falling. Ms Woodcock added in her statement: ""Parents and guardians can rest assured that the agency undertook a rigorous and thorough review of all available data, as we have with all of our Covid-19 vaccine emergency use authorisations."" Monday's announcement expands an emergency use authorisation that already allowed the Pfizer jab to be administered to people as young as 16 in the US. What is the risk of schools spreading coronavirus? The decision follows a clinical trial by Pfizer and BioNTech involving 2,260 children aged 12-15. The participants received either two doses of the vaccine, or a placebo. There were 18 cases of symptomatic coronavirus infection in the placebo group and none among the children who received the vaccine, found the trial. The FDA's seal of approval is not the final regulatory hurdle. An advisory panel of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will review the data soon. Immunisations could begin straight away if, as expected, the CDC committee approves the vaccine's use in adolescents. Some of New York and Oregon's biggest universities have meanwhile joined aÂ growing number of higher education institutions requiring students and staff to have Covid-19 vaccinations before they can return to classes this autumn. The rules were announced on Monday by State University of New York, the City University of New York, the University of Oregon and Western Oregon University.Â Last week, US President Joe Biden announced a plan to get at least one dose of vaccine administered to 70% of the nation's population by 4 July. Mask mandates are being loosened across the country, and most states have reopened their economies, or are doing so within the next month. But dwindling demand for the shot has been prompting states across the country to refuse their full allocation of doses from the federal government. Wisconsin, Iowa, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina and Washington are all among states that reduced their requests. The risk of children becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny, health data shows. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), as of this month 3.85 million US children have tested positive for Covid-19 since the onset of the pandemic, just over 10% of total cases nationwide. Between 0.1%-1.9% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in the patient being admitted to hospital,found the organisation's report,external. No more than 0.03% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in death, according to the AAP. The risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared with Covid-19,according to the CDC,external. Pfizer has been one of a number of vaccine manufacturers testing jabs on children. The aim of vaccinating them - particularly older children - would be to keep schools open, reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and protect vulnerable children with conditions which put them at increased risk. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are currently testing their vaccines on those aged 12-18, with Moderna's data expected soon. Moderna and Pfizer are also testing their jabs on younger children between six months and 11 years old. This video can not be played AstraZeneca's clinical trial on volunteers between six and 17 begin In the UK, AstraZeneca is testing its vaccine on 300 child volunteers. Researchers will assesswhether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17. Last week President Biden said he planned to back a World Trade Organization waiver that would take away intellectual property rights from vaccine manufacturers. If approved, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthy countries. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described Mr Biden's backing as a""monumental moment in the fight against Covid"".,external Percent of people fully vaccinated Please upgrade your browser to see the full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals or vaccines administered for each location. Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place.

"Counting was held across Scotland for two days after Thursday's election As the dust settles after a marathon two-day count and the winners prepare for life at Holyrood, we look at the facts and figures behind the story of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. The SNP has been handed a fresh five-year term in government at Holyrood, theirfourthin a row. By the time it is up in 2026, the party will have been in government for19 years- and Nicola Sturgeon may be asking for votes from people who were born after she first entered government. The proportional representation system used for Holyrood elections essentially did its job of producing a parliament which roughly mirrors the way people voted as a whole across Scotland. The SNP took just underhalf of the vote, and won just underhalf of the seatsin parliament. Nicola Sturgeon has been handed a fresh five-year term in government at Holyrood The Conservatives took23.5%of the ""peach party vote"" they based much of their campaigning on, and were rewarded with24%of the seats. Labour meanwhile had19%of the regional list vote and17%of the seats, while the Greens got8%of the vote and6%of the seats. The Lib Dems took all four of their seats from constituency contests, but still based on list tallies across Scotland ended up with3%of the seats from5%of the vote. This has been an election where not much has changed - onlythreeof the 73 constituencies changed hands, compared to 18 in 2016. Ranking the results by how narrow the winning margin was, there were16seats with a single-digit majority - generally considered a ""marginal"" seat. This is the same number as there were before the election, and indeed 10 of them are the very same seats. We may spend election night in 2026 talking about Eastwood, Aberdeenshire West and Dumbarton all over again. The difference is that after 2016, nine of the 10 most marginal seats were SNP targets. Now, onlythreeare - and they are defending the other seven. It may seem an obvious point given they now hold the lion's share of constituencies, but there are fewer easy targets for Nicola Sturgeon's party in future - and far more wobbly seats to defend, including the country's most marginal in Ayr which they won by just170votes. As previously, these close contests are mostly SNP-Conservative affairs. Labour was not in second place in a single constituency with a single-digit majority before the election, and they only have one now - East Lothian, the seat they lost to the SNP. This means there is little in the way of obvious target seats for Anas Sarwar to start building towards challenging in 2026. One striking change between the 2016 and 2021 results was that in Shetland - which has gone from the safest seat in Scotland, with a 44.3% majority to the ninth most marginal, with a cushion of just6.8%. These figures exclude the fact there wasa by-election midway throughthe term, but it is still a big shift in a Lib Dem stronghold. The safest seat now belongs to Shona Robison in Dundee City East with a41.4%majority - with her Dundee City West neighbour Joe Fitzpatrick in second spot on40.2%. Anas Sarwar now has few obvious target seats for Labour at the next election Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has also constructed something of a fortress in Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, with the biggest majority in terms of raw votes -15,861of them. Perhaps the rise of tactical voting in this election means we need a new way to talk about ""safe"" seats, though. Contests have increasingly become a race between the SNP and whichever other party is best placed locally to challenge them. On that front, there were29seats where the SNP won more than 50% of the vote - so much that even if the opposition clubbed together and backed one candidate, they would still not win. The Conservatives only hadoneseat with a margin this wide - Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire - and Labour had none. Oddly though, the smallest party, the Lib Dems, hadthree. And their fourth seat was not far behind, on 48.6%. They seem to have become the party of extremes, because they also lost their deposit in50of the 73 constituencies, by polling under 5% of the vote. Kate Forbes' seat in Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch had the biggest majority in terms of raw votes While nothing much has changed in the makeup of the parliament, the existing parties rather entrenched their positions. There was a lot of talk of smaller parties during the campaign, with Alex Salmond launching the Alba Party to great fanfare, but ultimately they barely made a dent in the figures with1.7%of the regional ballot. George Galloway's All for Unity group similarly flopped, managing0.9%of the vote. And UKIP - now dedicated to shutting down Holyrood - secured just 3,848 list votes,0.1%of the 2.7m cast around Scotland - and behind the rather more bluntly-titled Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party on0.3%. With turnout high and social distancing in place, some Scots - including Patrick Harvie - had to queue outside polling stations One of the big stories across Scotland was how many people came out to vote. Turnout hit a record high for a Holyrood election, at63.2%. It was up in every single constituency, and indeed at least half of the registered electorate took part in every seat. It was over 60% in54of the 73 constituencies, and over 70% in four. The overall figure is ten points up on the average of the five previous Holyrood elections, and well in advance of the previous high of 59% in 1999. However it still lags behind the levels recorded in recent general elections north of the border - turnout was 68.1% for the Westminster election in December 2019 - and a good way off the massive engagement in the 2014 referendum, which was 84.6%.

"The only way for there to be a successful referendum on Scottish independence is if both sides agree. That's how they did it in 2014 with the Edinburgh agreement and the alternatives are messy and risky for both sides. If the current stand-off between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson cannot be resolved, the first minister intends - at some point - to pass a referendum bill at Holyrood. She dares the UK government to challenge the legislation in court which it may feel obliged to do because it considers such a vote to be beyond devolved powers. The UK constitution - including the union between Scotland and England - is a matter reserved to Westminster by law. However, it could be argued that reservation does not explicitly prevent Holyrood from consulting the public on independence. Then again, a ""yes"" vote in any referendum would create an expectation that major constitutional change would follow, as it did in the advisory vote on Brexit. These are the arguments the UK Supreme Court would have to work through. At the weekend, both the UK cabinet minister Michael Gove and the first minister downplayed the prospect of a legal battle but that is what would inevitably happen unless the two sides make a deal. Nicola Sturgeon would prefer to see support for independence running higher UK government sources have made clear that just because they are not seeking to take legal action does not mean they would not go to court if a specific referendum proposal emerged. Even if the UK government did not challenge, somebody surely would. The whisky industry tied up minimum alcohol pricing legislation in court for five years. If the court ruled in Nicola Sturgeon's favour, that might enable a referendum but it could still face a unionist boycott which would de-legitimise the outcome. If the court ruled in Boris Johnson's favour, that would thwart a referendum because Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would not hold an illegal vote. However, Nicola Sturgeon could argue in those circumstances that the union was being held together by force of law rather than consent which would be a rotten look for the UK. That might lead to a rise in support for independence. Could the Supreme Court rule on a referendum? Nicola Sturgeon tells PM referendum is case of 'when - not if' The UK government could pass legislation to explicitly prevent Holyrood from having a referendum or to organise its own vote - options that carry similar risks. The UK strategy for the moment seems to be to play for time by arguing that there can be another referendum at some unspecified point in the future but not now. Boris Johnson's UK government is playing for time They make the case that it would be irresponsible to have a referendum while we are still in a pandemic. On that point, Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon agree and appear to be in tune with Scottish public opinion. There are other reasons the first minister is not in a rush. She wants to win a referendum and so would prefer to see support for independence running higher. Polls suggested there was a sustained majority for a ""yes"" vote throughout much of last year but that has dipped in recent months. The country appears split down the middle. It also became clear during the election that the Scottish government needs time to work out detailed plans for what independence would mean for trade and borders in the aftermath of Brexit. In short, they are not ready to fight a referendum however desperate some in the independence movement are for it to happen. Nicola Sturgeon has told Boris Johnson she considers indyref2 a matter of ""when - not if"". Officially she still favours having the vote by the end of 2023. There is unlikely to be any immediate effort by the Scottish government to begin preparations. The SNP is likely to start working on refreshing the independence case before civil servants are given instructions. As Holyrood returns to business, expect to see the SNP and Greens demonstrate the majority they now have for indyref2 in a symbolic way at an early stage. With 64 SNP votes and eight from the Greens, support for independence is as high as it has ever been in the 129-seat parliament, matching the ""yes"" majority after the 2011 election. The two parties made explicit commitments to hold a referendum in their election manifestos. The two parties have more votes and seats than before. That is their mandate for indyref2. By contrast, pro-UK parties got 51% of the constituency vote in this election which they take as a mandate to oppose it. Any referendum legislation would need to be certified as within Holyrood's powers by Scotland's top law officer, the lord advocate, and parliament's presiding officer who is elected on Thursday.

"Ashley Westwood scored his seventh Premier League goal since joining Burnley in 2017 Fulham were relegated from the Premier League after a defeat by Burnley that saw the Clarets secure their top-flight status for another season. For the first time in the Premier League era all the relegation places have been confirmed with three games to go, with the Cottagers joining Sheffield United and West Bromwich Albion as the clubs to drop into the Championship. The damage was done before the break as Burnley struck twice in the final 10 minutes of the first half at Craven Cottage. First the Clarets hit their hosts on the counter-attack as Matej Vydra showed neat footwork before picking out Ashley Westwood to roll the ball into an empty net. Chris Wood then lashed in a second from the edge of the area to score his 50th goal for Burnley and consign Fulham to the drop. It leaves Scott Parker's side 10 points from safety with three games remaining and heading back to the Championship at the first time of asking. Burnley, who will play Premier League football for the sixth successive season, climb to 14th in the table. Reaction as Fulham are relegated in Burnley loss Can Fulham bounce back to Premier League? This video can not be played Fulham 0-2 Burnley: Relegated Cottagers fell short, says Parker Fulham still have three games to play as a Premier League team but the Cottagers will already have to start thinking about how they plot a return to the top flight of English football. In Parker they have a manager who has already achieved the feat, guiding his side to promotion via the play-offs last season after they were relegated the previous year. The problem for Parker and Fulham is that some of his top performers this season, those that would certainly stand out in the Championship, are only at the club on loan. In fact, four loan players started against Burnley, with another two coming off the bench. Ademola Lookman was one and the former Everton winger looked the most likely to make something happen for the hosts while another, goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, made several fine saves before Burnley's opener. Parker has been praised for his side's style of play and, of the three sides to go down, the Cottagers may feel the most unfortunate after a number of narrow defeats and impressive victories away at Liverpool, Everton and Leicester City. But they have lacked both consistency and especially a serious goal threat, scoring just 25 times in 35 games - with only Sheffield United hitting the target fewer times this season. Parker sought to fix that on Monday by turning to Aleksandar Mitrovic - who scored 26 goals in Fulham's promotion campaign - but the forward was unable to add to his three goals this season in what was only his fifth league start since the turn of the year. The hosts did show fight in the second half and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa was unfortunate to see his effort bounce on the goalline and away after rattling the crossbar. But Parker's side were unable to break down Burnley as they drew another blank, having scored just nine times at home in the league this season. Having clawed their way back to a position where they were level with 17th-placed Brighton after that win at Anfield, Fulham's relegation comes after taking just one point in the seven games since then. Chris Wood has scored 18 more goals for Burnley than any other player since his debut in August 2017 Every season spent in the top flight is an achievement for Burnley given they always have one of the league's lowest budgets and the club can now look forward to their sixth successive campaign among the biggest names in English football. This was Dyche's 350th league game in charge of the Clarets and the fact he has spent the majority of those in the highest division is testament to his ability to extract the best from his players despite operating on a lower budget than clubs his side finishes above. But, after a 10th-placed finish last term, the 49-year-old will be relieved his side are no longer in the relegation conversation this campaign. The visitors did well to fend off a lively Fulham start, with James Tarkowski making a goal-saving tackle on Lookman, before imposing themselves on the game. Burnley's goal had been coming and Wood was denied twice in quick succession. First, his header was deflected agonisingly wide by Tosin Adarabioyo before Areola made an excellent save from the New Zealand forward at the subsequent corner. Moments later, a direct ball behind the Fulham defence found Vydra and he skipped beyond Joachim Andersen before picking out Westwood for a simple finish with Areola stranded, before Wood fired a second beyond the on-loan Paris St-Germain goalkeeper. With Ben Mee, who was making his 350th appearance for the club, alongside Tarkowski in central defence the Clarets then stood firm as Fulham applied some pressure in the second half as they sought to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Dyche can now look forward to a summer transfer window under new owners and the prospect of some, albeit not huge, investment in his squad. ""I'm pleased for a lot of people at the club,"" said Dyche. ""It is important for the club, it is important for the town. It's been a real challenging season with the sale of the club. ""There was not a lot of investment from the outgoing owners and we've had a lot of injury problems."" Fulham boss Scott Parker speaking to BBC Sport:""It has been looming but it doesn't hide the disappointment, hurt and sadness I feel tonight. I am gutted. ""This year at times, while we have had some big improvements and pushed on in certain elements, the facts are we have fallen short. We have not been quite good enough. ""At this moment in time I have nothing but sadness. Now and in the coming days we will have a long, hard think and regroup. My job is to make sure these games end in the right way. ""The club needs to make big decisions. We've had a relegation, a promotion and a relegation. The rollercoaster of that and the highs and lows is not something you want. ""As a football club we need to make good decisions and work out where we want to go."" This video can not be played Fulham 0-2 Burnley: Dyche 'really pleased' as Clarets seal Premier League status Burnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to BBC Sport:""Fulham changed their style, putting the ball forward a lot quicker than they have been doing. ""We dealt with that well and scored two good goals. The second half became a dogfight and we are good at that."" Burnley have won on five of their last eight Premier League trips to London (lost three) after enjoying just three victories on their previous 30. Fulham have failed to score in 11 home league games in a season for just the second time in their history (also 11 in the third tier in 93-94). They are the first side to do so in the top flight since Manchester City in 2006-07 (13 in total). Burnley named an unchanged starting XI for the seventh time in the Premier League this season, with only Leeds (10) and Aston Villa (8) doing so more often. Six of Ashley Westwood's seven Premier League goals for Burnley have come away from Turf Moor. The midfielder scored in consecutive away appearances for the second time with the Clarets in the top flight. Matej Vydra registered his 10th Premier League goal involvement for Burnley (6 goals, 4 assists in 57 apps) with five of those in his last nine games (3 goals, 2 assists). Fulham visit Southampton on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Burnley host Leeds United on the same day (12:15).

"A cyber-criminal gang that took a major US fuel pipeline offline over the weekend has acknowledged the incident in a public statement. ""Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,"" DarkSide wrote on its website. The US issued emergency legislation on Sunday after Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware cyber-attack. The pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day - 45% of the East Coast's supply of diesel, petrol and jet fuel. The operator took itself offline on Friday after the cyber-attack. Work to restore service is continuing. How did cyber-attackers shut off a US pipeline? The ransomware surge ruining lives Travelex being held to ransom by hackers On Monday, the FBI officially confirmed that DarkSide was responsible for compromising Colonial Pipeline's networks, saying that it was continuing to work with the firm and other government agencies on the investigation. During a speech about the economy at the White House on Monday, US President Joe Biden said that he was being ""personally briefed"" on the situation with the pipeline each day. US President Joe Biden answers questions about the fuel pipeline cyber-attack during a speech about the economy at the White House ""The agencies across the government have acted quickly to mitigate any impact on our fuel supply,"" he said. ""We're prepared to take additional steps depending on how quickly the company is able to bring its pipeline back up to capacity."" A number of cyber-security researchers, including firms contacted by the BBC, have speculated that the cyber-criminal gang could be Russian, as their software avoids encrypting any computer systems where the language is set as Russian. Mr Biden said that the US government was concerned about this aspect of the cyber-attack. ""I'm gonna be meeting with President Putin and so far there is no evidence, based on our intelligence people, that Russia is involved,"" he said. ""Although, there's evidence that the actors' ransomware is in Russia - they have some responsibility to deal with this."" DarkSide posted a statement on its website on Monday, describing itself as ""apolitical"". The Colonial Pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day ""We do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for... our motives,"" the group said. The group also indicated it had not been aware that Colonial was being targeted by one of its affiliates, saying: ""From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future."" US fuel prices at the pump rose six cents per gallon on the week to $2.967 per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, the American Automobile Association (AAA) said on Monday, while Wall Street shares in US energy firms were up 1.5%. The AAA said prices were heading towards their highest level since 2014. On Sunday, the US governmentrelaxed rules on fuel being transported by road,externalto minimise disruption to supply. This allowed drivers in 18 states to work extra or more flexible hours when transporting refined petroleum products. However, there are fears that this could change if the shutdown is prolonged. Independent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC a lot of fuel was now stranded at refineries in Texas. ""Unless they sort it out by Tuesday, they're in big trouble,"" said Mr Sharma. ""The first areas to be hit would be Atlanta and Tennessee, then the domino effect goes up to New York."" He said oil futures traders were now ""scrambling"" to meet demand, at a time when US inventories are declining. Demand - especially for fuel for cars - is on the rise as consumers return to the roads and the economy recovers. The temporary waiver issued by the Department of Transportation enables oil products to be shipped in tankers up to New York, but this would not be anywhere near enough to match the pipeline's capacity, Mr Sharma warned. Sources said the ransomware attack was likely to have been caused by a cyber-criminal gang called DarkSide, who infiltrated Colonial's network and locked the data on some computers and servers, demanding a ransom on Friday. The gang stole almost 100 gigabytes of data hostage, threatening to leak it onto the internet. The FBI and other government agencies worked with private companies to respond - the cloud computing system the hackers used to collect the stolen data was taken offline on Saturday, Reuters reported. On Sunday, Colonial said that although its four main pipelines remained offline, some smaller lines between terminals and delivery points were now operational. ""Quickly after learning of the attack, Colonial proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat. These actions temporarily halted all pipeline operations and affected some of our IT systems, which we are actively in the process of restoring,""the firm said,external. It added it would bring its full system back online ""only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations"". An example of a DarkSide ransomware notice that appears on victims' computer screens The incident highlightsthe risk ransomware can pose to critical national industrial infrastructure,external, not just businesses. In addition to a notice on their computer screens, victims of a DarkSide attack receive an information pack informing them that their computers and servers are encrypted. The gang lists all the types of data it has stolen, and sends victims the URL of a ""personal leak page"" where the data is already loaded, waiting to be automatically published, should the company or organisation not pay before the deadline is up. DarkSide also tells victims it will provide proof of the data it has obtained, and is prepared to delete all of it from the victim's network. According to Digital Shadows, a London-based cyber-security firm,DarkSide operates like a business,external. A redacted screenshot of DarkSide's website on the dark web details its success in attacking a large US manufacturer The gang develops the software used to encrypt and steal data from companies. It then provides ransomware to ""affiliates"" who pay DarkSide a percentage of their earnings from any successful attacks. When it released new software in March that could encrypt data faster than before, the gang issued a press release and invited journalists to interview it. It even has a website on the dark web where it lists all the companies it has hacked and what was stolen, and an ""ethics"" page where it says which organisations it will not attack. DarkSide also works with ""access brokers"" - nefarious hackers who work to harvest the login details for as many working user accounts on various services as they can find. Rather than break into these accounts and alert users or the service providers, these brokers sit on the usernames and passwords and sell them off to the highest bidders - cyber-criminal gangs who want to use them to carry out much larger crimes. Digital Shadows thinks the Colonial attack was helped by the coronavirus pandemic, with more engineers remotely accessing control systems for the pipeline from home. James Chappell, co-founder of Digital Shadows, believes DarkSide could have bought account login details for remote desktop software such as TeamViewer and Microsoft Remote Desktop. DarkSide's website on the dark web details its achievements and sets out ""ethics"" of sorts He says it is possible for anyone to look up the login portals for computers connected to the internet on search engines like Shodan, and then ""have-a-go"" hackers just keep trying usernames and passwords until they get some to work. ""We're seeing a lot of victims now, this is seriously a big problem,"" said Mr Chappell. ""The amount of small businesses that are falling victim to this... It's becoming a big problem for the economy globally."" Digital Shadows' research shows the cyber-criminal gang is likely to be based in a Russian-speaking country, as it avoids attacking companies in post-Soviet states including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

"From 17 May, hospitality businesses in Wales are expecting to be able to reopen outdoors A pub and restaurant group is calling for all significant restrictions on trading to be lifted before July. Mark Drakeford's cabinet discussed which Covid restrictions to lift next when it met for the first time since Labour's Welsh election win. Allowing pubs and restaurants to serve customers indoorsfrom 17 Mayis the next Covid rule set to be relaxed. But a group representing the hospitality sector says social distancing rules should be scrapped. The outcome of Monday's cabinet meeting will not be known until later in the week, with the latest plans for lockdown restrictions due to be announced in the Welsh government's next three-week review on Friday. Mr Drakeford is tolead a Labour-only Welsh governmentafter the party won half of the Welsh Parliament's 60 seats. He is to be formally sworn in as Wales' first minister when the Senedd returns on Wednesday. PM calls Covid recovery summit after Labour Senedd win Drakeford says Covid response kept Wales Labour Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Wales' Covid infection rate of 8.6 cases for every 100,000 people is the lowest since August. Patients inWelsh hospitals with coronavirus are at record lowsand more than a quarter of the Welsh population have now hadboth doses of a Covid vaccine. Under current plans and providing rates remain low, on 17 May indoor attractions, cinemas and theatres will open alongside pubs and restaurants serving customers inside. In an open letter to ministers, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective (WIRC) renewed its call for Covid restrictions to be eased on the hospitality sector and for financial support at least matching that available in England and Scotland. The group, representing more than 400 cafes, pubs, restaurants and hotels, urged the Welsh government to allow any six people to sit together indoors and to scrap the 2m social distancing rule. The letter said it was ""not a case of following England for its own sake, but a recognition that the science is the same there as it is here"". ""The closer we align our rules across the UK, the easier it is to communicate those rules to an increasingly confused public,"" it added. Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants are calling for clarity on who they can serve and where The letter also said there should be ""an immediate announcement to signal a restart grant at least as generous as those in Scotland and England"". ""That support needs to acknowledge that in Wales we have been under the heaviest trading restrictions of any of the UK nations and that the gap in funding that has persisted since March 31 needs to be filled,"" the letter added. Ministers were expected on Monday to decide what to ease next from Wales' lockdown rules. Local Government Minister Julie James said discussing restrictions around foreign holidays was also ""very much part of the package of discussion for Monday"". The UK government has announced plans in England to allow tourists to visita green list of 12 destinations, including Portugal, Israel and Gibraltar. The Welsh government is yet to confirm if they will align with the plans or take a different approach. Wales' chief medical officer Frank Atherton toldGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Walesthe risks he saw around international travel centred on ""too rapid a relaxation of the social distancing rules, and possibly around waning in immunity"". He added: ""We can do things about these, but some of them, we just have to be cautious, bide our time, keep to our low rates, and that will keep Wales safe."" This video can not be played Health minister Vaughan Gething said the Welsh NHS's recovery from Covid was ""going to be a huge task"" Meanwhile, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the recovery of the NHS from Covid was ""going to be a huge task"" that he thought would ""take a full Senedd term"". Speaking at a distribution centre in Newport that waspreparing to send life-saving equipment to India, he said the pandemic was ""not quite over yet"", with ongoing pressure from long Covid, for example. The NHS was also facing a huge backlog of treatment and operations that had been delayed because of coronavirus, he said. Mr Gething said: ""You simply can't recover in a matter of months - and that's the level of honesty I think we need with the public and with our staff."" He warned the recovery of the NHS would take time ""partly because of capacity but importantly because our staff need to be cared for as well"".

Mr Drakeford said on Saturday that Wales' response to the Covid pandemic had been a major part in Labour's election win as they were returned as the largest party for the sixth successive time since devolution in 1999. ""A government I lead will continue to follow the science to do what our medical advisers tells us we should do, and that does mean doing things in a way that continues to keep Wales safe,"" he said. The Welsh government controls Wales' Covid response and the relaxing of restrictions - such as meeting inside pubs and restaurants and travel rules - has tended to have been more cautious in Wales. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced that people from different householdswould be able to meet up and hug from 17 May in England. It is up to individuals whether they socially distance with close family and friends from that date in England. The UK government said it wanted to let people in England exercise personal judgement as more of life returns to normal, but people are still urged to remain cautious and remember some people are more vulnerable to Covid than others. Addressing the issue of hugging in Wales, Dr Atherton said: ""Prevalence rates are really quite low at the moment, and being close to a member of your family is less risk now - but with strangers, I would be very cautious still. ""I think there are other ways to greet people than to give everybody a hug, so there are ways to do that and to do it safely - don't spend too long making face-to-face contact, make it a brief hug. ""But to be honest, I think it is quite right - I understand that grandparents want to hug their grandkids, of course they do, and that's only natural. ""But we have learned over the last year that there are other ways to interact socially, and perhapsâ¦ hug cautiously."" Labour returns to power with one more seat than the previous term despite losing the key Vale of Clwyd seat to the Conservatives.

Adam Price called Plaid's performance ""disappointing"" but they returned more seats with 13.

"Ashley Westwood scored his seventh Premier League goal since joining Burnley in 2017 Fulham were relegated from the Premier League after a defeat by Burnley that saw the Clarets secure their top-flight status for another season. For the first time in the Premier League era all the relegation places have been confirmed with three games to go, with the Cottagers joining Sheffield United and West Bromwich Albion as the clubs to drop into the Championship. The damage was done before the break as Burnley struck twice in the final 10 minutes of the first half at Craven Cottage. First the Clarets hit their hosts on the counter-attack as Matej Vydra showed neat footwork before picking out Ashley Westwood to roll the ball into an empty net. Chris Wood then lashed in a second from the edge of the area to score his 50th goal for Burnley and consign Fulham to the drop. It leaves Scott Parker's side 10 points from safety with three games remaining and heading back to the Championship at the first time of asking. Burnley, who will play Premier League football for the sixth successive season, climb to 14th in the table. Reaction as Fulham are relegated in Burnley loss Can Fulham bounce back to Premier League? This video can not be played Fulham 0-2 Burnley: Relegated Cottagers fell short, says Parker Fulham still have three games to play as a Premier League team but the Cottagers will already have to start thinking about how they plot a return to the top flight of English football. In Parker they have a manager who has already achieved the feat, guiding his side to promotion via the play-offs last season after they were relegated the previous year. The problem for Parker and Fulham is that some of his top performers this season, those that would certainly stand out in the Championship, are only at the club on loan. In fact, four loan players started against Burnley, with another two coming off the bench. Ademola Lookman was one and the former Everton winger looked the most likely to make something happen for the hosts while another, goalkeeper Alphonse Areola, made several fine saves before Burnley's opener. Parker has been praised for his side's style of play and, of the three sides to go down, the Cottagers may feel the most unfortunate after a number of narrow defeats and impressive victories away at Liverpool, Everton and Leicester City. But they have lacked both consistency and especially a serious goal threat, scoring just 25 times in 35 games - with only Sheffield United hitting the target fewer times this season. Parker sought to fix that on Monday by turning to Aleksandar Mitrovic - who scored 26 goals in Fulham's promotion campaign - but the forward was unable to add to his three goals this season in what was only his fifth league start since the turn of the year. The hosts did show fight in the second half and Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa was unfortunate to see his effort bounce on the goalline and away after rattling the crossbar. But Parker's side were unable to break down Burnley as they drew another blank, having scored just nine times at home in the league this season. Having clawed their way back to a position where they were level with 17th-placed Brighton after that win at Anfield, Fulham's relegation comes after taking just one point in the seven games since then. Chris Wood has scored 18 more goals for Burnley than any other player since his debut in August 2017 Every season spent in the top flight is an achievement for Burnley given they always have one of the league's lowest budgets and the club can now look forward to their sixth successive campaign among the biggest names in English football. This was Dyche's 350th league game in charge of the Clarets and the fact he has spent the majority of those in the highest division is testament to his ability to extract the best from his players despite operating on a lower budget than clubs his side finishes above. But, after a 10th-placed finish last term, the 49-year-old will be relieved his side are no longer in the relegation conversation this campaign. The visitors did well to fend off a lively Fulham start, with James Tarkowski making a goal-saving tackle on Lookman, before imposing themselves on the game. Burnley's goal had been coming and Wood was denied twice in quick succession. First, his header was deflected agonisingly wide by Tosin Adarabioyo before Areola made an excellent save from the New Zealand forward at the subsequent corner. Moments later, a direct ball behind the Fulham defence found Vydra and he skipped beyond Joachim Andersen before picking out Westwood for a simple finish with Areola stranded, before Wood fired a second beyond the on-loan Paris St-Germain goalkeeper. With Ben Mee, who was making his 350th appearance for the club, alongside Tarkowski in central defence the Clarets then stood firm as Fulham applied some pressure in the second half as they sought to keep their slim survival hopes alive. Dyche can now look forward to a summer transfer window under new owners and the prospect of some, albeit not huge, investment in his squad. ""I'm pleased for a lot of people at the club,"" said Dyche. ""It is important for the club, it is important for the town. It's been a real challenging season with the sale of the club. ""There was not a lot of investment from the outgoing owners and we've had a lot of injury problems."" Fulham boss Scott Parker speaking to BBC Sport:""It has been looming but it doesn't hide the disappointment, hurt and sadness I feel tonight. I am gutted. ""This year at times, while we have had some big improvements and pushed on in certain elements, the facts are we have fallen short. We have not been quite good enough. ""At this moment in time I have nothing but sadness. Now and in the coming days we will have a long, hard think and regroup. My job is to make sure these games end in the right way. ""The club needs to make big decisions. We've had a relegation, a promotion and a relegation. The rollercoaster of that and the highs and lows is not something you want. ""As a football club we need to make good decisions and work out where we want to go."" This video can not be played Fulham 0-2 Burnley: Dyche 'really pleased' as Clarets seal Premier League status Burnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to BBC Sport:""Fulham changed their style, putting the ball forward a lot quicker than they have been doing. ""We dealt with that well and scored two good goals. The second half became a dogfight and we are good at that."" Burnley have won on five of their last eight Premier League trips to London (lost three) after enjoying just three victories on their previous 30. Fulham have failed to score in 11 home league games in a season for just the second time in their history (also 11 in the third tier in 93-94). They are the first side to do so in the top flight since Manchester City in 2006-07 (13 in total). Burnley named an unchanged starting XI for the seventh time in the Premier League this season, with only Leeds (10) and Aston Villa (8) doing so more often. Six of Ashley Westwood's seven Premier League goals for Burnley have come away from Turf Moor. The midfielder scored in consecutive away appearances for the second time with the Clarets in the top flight. Matej Vydra registered his 10th Premier League goal involvement for Burnley (6 goals, 4 assists in 57 apps) with five of those in his last nine games (3 goals, 2 assists). Fulham visit Southampton on Saturday (15:00 BST), while Burnley host Leeds United on the same day (12:15).

"Boris Johnson took the holiday in Mustique with his partner Carrie Symonds Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of a Caribbean holiday in 2019. Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone has confirmed she is looking into whether the prime minister correctly declared how the trip was paid for. Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross. Downing Street said the prime minister had acted correctly and transparently. But Labour said there were ""questions"" over Mr Ross's ""generosity"". The commissioner normally investigates whether MPs have failed to declare a financial interest, not declared it correctly, or declared it late. Labour calls for probe into Johnson's Â£15,000 holiday What are the rules for MPs on financial interests? Mr Ross initially said he had not paid ""any monies"" for the trip Mr Johnson took with his partner Carrie Symonds to the private island of Mustique - part of St Vincent and the Grenadines - between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister. Mr Ross added that Mr Johnson'sdeclaration of a ""benefit in kind"",externalin the February 2020 MPs' register of MPs' interests had been ""correct"". But Labour asked for the standards commissioner to investigate, saying Mr Johnson's entry appeared ""to be incorrect"". On Monday, Ms Stone confirmed that the prime minister was among nine MPscurrently being investigated,externalfor potential breaches of the MPs' code of conduct. She is examining whether Mr Johnson followed Commons rules on declaring financial interests relating to trips outside the UK. These state,externalthat MPs have to register visits costing more than Â£300, where these have not been wholly covered by MPs themselves or the taxpayer. Ms Stone will report her findings to the Commons Standards Committee, which can order MPs to apologise or pay back money if they are found in breach of the code. In extreme cases it can recommend MPs are suspended, although this requires approval from the whole Commons and has only happened a handful of times. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""The public have a right to know who paid for Boris Johnson's luxury Caribbean holiday and the renovation of his flat. Most importantly, we need to know what these donors were promised or expected in return for their generosity."" But a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" He added: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Labour has alsoasked Ms Stone to investigatethe prime minister over how a renovation of his official Downing Street flat was initially paid for. In April 2019, Mr Johnson was rebuked by the parliamentary commissioner for standards for failing to register a share of a Somerset property within 28 days of acquiring it.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson warns the public not to ""throw caution to the wind"" People in England will be allowed to hug loved ones and enjoy indoor hospitality from next Monday, the PM has said - whilst urging people to ""exercise caution and common sense"". Boris Johnson said this was the ""single biggest step"" to unlocking society but that people should remain vigilant. Indoor mixing and overnight stays in groups of up to six people or two households will also resume. Leisure venues such as cinemas, museums and children's play areas will reopen. Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said the further relaxation of England's lockdown would go ahead on 17 May as the government had met its four tests for easing restrictions. These tests relied on the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence that the jabs were reducing serious illness and death, infection rates remaining under control and the risks from new Covid variants not changing. Zero Covid deaths for England, Scotland and NI HSBC to pilot Zoom-free Friday afternoons Face masks no longer required in classrooms People can meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors Six people or two households can meet indoors Overnight stays will be allowed in groups of up to six people or two households Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues can reopen indoors Adult indoor group sports and exercise classes can restart Indoor entertainment such as museums, theatres, cinemas, bingo halls, sports stadia and children's play areas can reopen Performances and large events can restart, with limits on audience numbers Remaining outdoor entertainment, such as outdoor theatres and cinemas can open Hotels, hostels and B&Bs can reopen Holidays abroad togreen list countries will be allowed Up to 30 people can attend weddings (although dancing will still not be allowed) and more than 30 can attend funerals The prime minister said the latest data showed deaths and hospitalisations had dropped to their lowest level since last July. Zero coronavirus deathswere announced in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday, while Wales recorded four deaths. More than two-thirds of adults across the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine,  with almost 18 million people having had their second dose. The UK's four chief medical officers said earlier that the UK'sCovid alert level should be lowered from level four to three. It means that although coronavirus is in general circulation, transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced. Mr Johnson said that all the data supported the latest easing of restrictions, which he said amounted to ""a considerable step on the road back to normality"". ""And today we're taking a step toward that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid, when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts and make our own decisions based on the best scientific advice about how best to protect our families and those around us."" He added that, as part of the latest lockdown easing, the government would update its guidance on close contact between close family and friends shortly. The advice would explain the risks involved so people could make informed choices, he said. ""This doesn't mean that we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. We all know that close contacts such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease,"" he said. ""So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones."" Mr Johnson said social distancing should still be followed when people are not with their friends and family in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? He also confirmed that the wearing of face masks in secondary school classrooms in England will not be required after 17 May. Care home residents will be able to have up to five named visitors, he said, and greater freedoms to enjoy low- risk visits outside their home without having to isolate on their return. This next unlocking is - as the prime minister and his scientists stressed - the most significant step yet. Indoors is, after all, where transmission is most likely to take place, which explains why quite a sober tone accompanied the confirmation that restrictions would lift. It means vaccines are going to have to do most of the work in terms of controlling infection levels - during the winter it has been lockdown and social distancing that has played a key role in getting cases down. The good news is that all the evidence is pointing to the vaccines being incredibly effective. It means the threat of the NHS being overwhelmed and lockdowns reimposed has gone - unless a new variant comes along that can evade the vaccines in a significant way (considered unlikely by most experts). But cases could still creep up and there could be local outbreaks that need intervening on. It's why the key message is proceed with caution. The devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions. Under current plans inWales, indoor attractions, cinemas and theatres will open alongside pubs and restaurants serving customers inside on 17 May. InScotland, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart. More restrictions might be lifted inNorthern Irelandon 24 May, including the reopening of indoor hospitality, B&Bs and hotels. The prime minister said subject to the impact of the latest easing on the data, England was still on track to progress to step four of the government's roadmap from 21 June - when it is hoped that all legal limits on social contact will be removed. Asked by BBC Health editor Hugh Pym if the final stage of unlocking would be brought forward, Mr Johnson said every time restrictions are relaxed, ""we give ourselves breathing space"" to make sure that cases are not rising too much due to more social contact being allowed. The easing of measures next week is the most significant step, he added, saying that businesses want to get ready for the next planned relaxation on 21 June with the ""biggest certainty"" they can have. In order to give businesses time to prepare, further details will be released later this month ""about what the world will look like and what role there could be, if any, for certification and social distancing"", Mr Johnson said. Meanwhile, new data published by Public Health England shows that a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab reduces the risk of death with Covid by 80% compared with unvaccinated individuals. Researchers also found the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine reduced the risk of death by 97%.

Take care. FT: Fulham 0-2 Burnley Alex BysouthBBC Sport Burnley celebrate Fulham wererelegated from the Premier Leagueafter a defeat by Burnley that saw the Clarets secure their top-flight status for another season. All the relegation spots have now been confirmed, with the Cottagers joining Sheffield United and West Bromwich Albion as the three clubs to drop into the Championship. The damage was done before the break as Burnley struck twice in the final 10 minutes of the first half at Craven Cottage. First the Clarets hit their hosts on the counter-attack as Matej Vydra showed neat footwork before picking out Ashley Westwood to roll the ball into an empty net. Chris Wood then lashed in a second from the edge of the area to score his 50th goal for Burnley and consign Fulham to the drop. It leaves Scott Parker's side 10 points from safety with three games remaining and heading back to the Championship at the first time of asking. Burnley, who will play Premier League football for the sixth successive season, climb to 14th in the table. #bbcfootball or text us on 81111 (UK Only) Keith:I've supported Scott and the boys all season and like any other fan will continue to do so if we go down. But one thing that has disappointed me is not going two up top at the start of this game. It's a must win and you need goals. This second half change up I think shows where we should have started in the first. Chris, a depressed but long standing and philosophical Fulham supporter:""Fulham have had much more of the ball but not done much with it"" (53 mins).  This, sadly, is the story of our season.  All style, no substance.  And no end product. ah well, Mitrovic is better in the Championship! FT: Fulham 0-2 Burnley Karen CarneyFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live The parachute money does count - two of the teams that got relegated kept their squad and that's propelled them back into thre Premier League. Money is a big issue and it does matter. Money and buying a centre forward keeps you up - I'm thinking about Callum Wilson at Newcastle. We want other people challenging and that's why the parachute money matters. Fulham 0-2 Burnley Fulham Fulham boss Scott Parker speaking to BBC Sport:""It has been looming but it doesn't hide the disappointment, hurt and sadness I feel tonight. It's inevitable now. I am gutted. ""This year at times, while we have had some big improvements and pushed on in certain elements the facts are that we have fallen short. We have not been quite good enough. ""Tonight is how the season has gone at times. Between the two boxes we did very well. The difference was defensively the two goals we conceded were poor and in the final moment when you need to score and make good decisions we did not have that. ""Probably when I look back over the season that has been the big difference. We have lacked quality in certain moments. The players need to understand what you need to bring at this level. There's an effort and endeavour but you need to more to survive at this level. This level is brutal. The tiny details are key. ""At this moment in time I have nothing but sadness. Now and in the coming days we will have a long hard think and regroup. My job is to make sure these games end in the right way. ""The club needs to make big decisions. We've had a relegation, a promotion and a relegation. The rollercoaster of that and the highs and lows is not something you want. ""As a football club we need to make good decisions and work out where we want to go.""  Fulham 0-2 Burnley Fulham Fulham forward Aleksandar Mitrovic speaking to Sky Sports:""It is a tough time but we have failed today. We have failed this season. It is hard to find the words. It was not good enough. We did not deserve to stay up. ""It was good at times but overall we have finished where we deserve to be. We are really sad for the fans. For the people in the club it is really tough. ""We felt tonight we did not show the big character, big mentality and we cracked under the pressure a little bit. We were not good enough. We tried, we fought, we worked hard but we needed more quality on the ball. ""In a league like this you get punished. We got punished today and this season."" FT: Fulham 0-2 Burnley Karen CarneyFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live I'm not so sure - it's how dejected is he from this? You have to have the belief and energy to go 'right I can go again'. I'm looking at him tonight and he's lost a battle to stay up and I'm not sure. There will be people looking at him and thinking with better invesment could he do a better job elsewhere? Even if no other teams come in, has he got the energy to keep going?

Fulham 0-2 Burnley Burnley Burnley boss Sean Dyche speaking to BBC Sport:""I'm pleased for a lot of people at the club. It is important for the club, it is important for the town. It's been a real challenging season with the sale of the club. ""There was not a lot of investment from the outgoing owners and we've had a lot of injury problems. ""They changed their style putting the ball forward a lot quicker than they have been doing. We dealt with that well and scored two good goals. The second half became a dogfight and we are good at that."" On Fulham manager Scott Parker:""He has worked very hard here to get where they got to. These are the challenges I've had it myself. You learn in this game all the time and he will pick up plenty of pointers from this season. On striker Chris Wood: ""I've been pleased for Chris Wood. There was a lot of noise about our strikers not scoring goals but he has shown what he is about as the season has gone on.  It's been a big shift from the players. We had two points from seven games."" Here's the confirmation of the league table and Fulham, West Brom and Sheffield United fans will be watching Championship action next season. Fulham 0-2 Burnley Burnley Burnley forward Chris Wood says:""It was a long time coming. It's nice to get over the line tonight and we can now go and enjoy the last three games. ""The last six games we've been fantastic and it has shown in our results. Premier League survival is done and dusted which is nice. ""He [Sean Dyche] has been a great servant to Burnley and I am sure he is appreciated in Premier League. It's not often you get a manager at one club for that long."" FT: Fulham 0-2 Burnley Karen CarneyFormer England winger on BBC Radio 5 Live Looking at Scott Parker and the players, they're dejected. They've given everything, pushed forward, changed shape and sometimes you're just not good enough. I feel for Fulham and it's not about today's game that's relegated them, it's acros the season. You can't afford to have those games where you're not good enough, momentum hits and you can't get it back. They've won five - that's why they're relegated. They have to build again and go again. You can see the difference with Burnley who have players who know how to do it and Fulham just don't. FT: Fulham 0-2 Burnley  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson warns the public not to ""throw caution to the wind"" People in England will be allowed to hug loved ones and enjoy indoor hospitality from next Monday, the PM has said - whilst urging people to ""exercise caution and common sense"". Boris Johnson said this was the ""single biggest step"" to unlocking society but that people should remain vigilant. Indoor mixing and overnight stays in groups of up to six people or two households will also resume. Leisure venues such as cinemas, museums and children's play areas will reopen. Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said the further relaxation of England's lockdown would go ahead on 17 May as the government had met its four tests for easing restrictions. These tests relied on the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence that the jabs were reducing serious illness and death, infection rates remaining under control and the risks from new Covid variants not changing. Zero Covid deaths for England, Scotland and NI HSBC to pilot Zoom-free Friday afternoons Face masks no longer required in classrooms People can meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors Six people or two households can meet indoors Overnight stays will be allowed in groups of up to six people or two households Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues can reopen indoors Adult indoor group sports and exercise classes can restart Indoor entertainment such as museums, theatres, cinemas, bingo halls, sports stadia and children's play areas can reopen Performances and large events can restart, with limits on audience numbers Remaining outdoor entertainment, such as outdoor theatres and cinemas can open Hotels, hostels and B&Bs can reopen Holidays abroad togreen list countries will be allowed Up to 30 people can attend weddings (although dancing will still not be allowed) and more than 30 can attend funerals The prime minister said the latest data showed deaths and hospitalisations had dropped to their lowest level since last July. Zero coronavirus deathswere announced in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday, while Wales recorded four deaths. More than two-thirds of adults across the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine,  with almost 18 million people having had their second dose. The UK's four chief medical officers said earlier that the UK'sCovid alert level should be lowered from level four to three. It means that although coronavirus is in general circulation, transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced. Mr Johnson said that all the data supported the latest easing of restrictions, which he said amounted to ""a considerable step on the road back to normality"". ""And today we're taking a step toward that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid, when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts and make our own decisions based on the best scientific advice about how best to protect our families and those around us."" He added that, as part of the latest lockdown easing, the government would update its guidance on close contact between close family and friends shortly. The advice would explain the risks involved so people could make informed choices, he said. ""This doesn't mean that we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. We all know that close contacts such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease,"" he said. ""So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones."" Mr Johnson said social distancing should still be followed when people are not with their friends and family in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? He also confirmed that the wearing of face masks in secondary school classrooms in England will not be required after 17 May. Care home residents will be able to have up to five named visitors, he said, and greater freedoms to enjoy low- risk visits outside their home without having to isolate on their return. This next unlocking is - as the prime minister and his scientists stressed - the most significant step yet. Indoors is, after all, where transmission is most likely to take place, which explains why quite a sober tone accompanied the confirmation that restrictions would lift. It means vaccines are going to have to do most of the work in terms of controlling infection levels - during the winter it has been lockdown and social distancing that has played a key role in getting cases down. The good news is that all the evidence is pointing to the vaccines being incredibly effective. It means the threat of the NHS being overwhelmed and lockdowns reimposed has gone - unless a new variant comes along that can evade the vaccines in a significant way (considered unlikely by most experts). But cases could still creep up and there could be local outbreaks that need intervening on. It's why the key message is proceed with caution. The devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions. Under current plans inWales, indoor attractions, cinemas and theatres will open alongside pubs and restaurants serving customers inside on 17 May. InScotland, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart. More restrictions might be lifted inNorthern Irelandon 24 May, including the reopening of indoor hospitality, B&Bs and hotels. The prime minister said subject to the impact of the latest easing on the data, England was still on track to progress to step four of the government's roadmap from 21 June - when it is hoped that all legal limits on social contact will be removed. Asked by BBC Health editor Hugh Pym if the final stage of unlocking would be brought forward, Mr Johnson said every time restrictions are relaxed, ""we give ourselves breathing space"" to make sure that cases are not rising too much due to more social contact being allowed. The easing of measures next week is the most significant step, he added, saying that businesses want to get ready for the next planned relaxation on 21 June with the ""biggest certainty"" they can have. In order to give businesses time to prepare, further details will be released later this month ""about what the world will look like and what role there could be, if any, for certification and social distancing"", Mr Johnson said. Meanwhile, new data published by Public Health England shows that a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab reduces the risk of death with Covid by 80% compared with unvaccinated individuals. Researchers also found the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine reduced the risk of death by 97%.

"Philippa Day (pictured left with her sister Imogen) took a fatal overdose and died in October 2019 The family of a woman who took a fatal overdose after her benefit payments were cut say they have begun a legal claim against the government. Philippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home beside a letter rejecting her request for an at-home benefits assessment in August 2019. It comes amid calls for a wider inquiry into the Department for Work & Pensions' handling of cases. The DWP said: ""When, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously."" Cases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm have led to more than 150 government reviews since 2012, a BBC investigation found. Internal reviews are held by the DWP when it is alleged its actions had a negative impact, or when it is named at an inquest. Calling for an inquiry, Labour MP Debbie Abrahams said: ""It needs to be taken out of the hands of the DWP."" Ms Abrahams, who previouslyread out in the Commons the names of 29 people who have died,,externalsaid: ""There needs to be an independent inquiry investigating why these deaths are happening and the scale of the deaths needs to be properly understood."" The DWP said it had established a new Serious Case Panel in 2019 to consider themes identified from serious cases, which included independent members. Ms Day's family are one of three hoping to take the DWP to court in separate cases within weeks. Ms Day, 27, who had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder, had previously said her benefit claim left her feeling ""inhuman"", her sister told the BBC. An inquest concluded in January that authoritiesmade 28 errors in managing her case. The assistant coroner issued a so-called Prevention of Future Death (PFD) report to the DWP and private contractor Capita, requiring them to explain what action they might take to improve. That was the fourth PFD sent to the DWP by coroners since 2013. In response, the department said it would give all of its call handlers training in mental health and introduce a tracking system to identify vulnerable people across its systems.Earlier internal reviews had established the inability to identify a vulnerable claimant,externalas a problem. Philippa's sister Imogen told the BBC her family had now begun a legal claim against the DWP and Capita including a claim under the Human Rights Act for violation of the right to life over their handling of the case. Imogen said: ""We were incredibly close. In her eulogy at her funeral I described her as my soulmate. I spoke to her [Philippa] almost daily about it [her benefit claim]. ""She talked about how it disempowered her and made her feel inhuman. ""It was like watching a car crash in slow motion... we helped her emotionally, financially and practically and we could see the tragedy in front of us but couldn't do anything more to stop it."" Errol Graham's family said his mental health problems were exacerbated by the withdrawal of his benefits Errol Graham starved to death in 2018 while seriously mentally ill. His benefits were stopped when he failed to attend a work capability assessment and did not respond to calls, letters or home visits from the DWP. When his body was found, Mr Graham weighed four-and-a-half stone (30kg) and his family said he had used pliers to pull out his teeth. His family submitted an application for permission to go to the Court of Appeal in April, afterlosing a judicial review against the DWP's safeguarding policy,external. Leigh Day, the family's solicitors, had argued the government guidance failed to impose a duty of care on decision-makers to investigate when mentally-ill claimants did not engage with the system. Alison Turner, fiancÃ©e of Mr Graham's son, said: ""I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. It's got to stop. They are not just damaging one person, there's a ripple effect on families."" Jodey Whiting suffered multiple physical and mental health issues Jodey Whiting, 42, took her own life after her benefits were stopped. Her family are due to attend the High Court on 22 June to argue she should have a second inquest to consider the DWP's role in her 2017 death. Ms Whiting's mother, Joy Dove, of Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, won permission to request the new inquest.  New evidence was submitted includingan independent inquiry's conclusions that mistakes were made by the DWP. The family received a letter endorsing the decision Ms Whiting's benefits should be stopped and saying she was fit to work while she was in a mortuary ahead of her burial, her mother said. Following her death, one of Jodey Whiting's twins Cory Bell died at the age of 19 from a drug overdose. ""We've had that second death in the family and I blame the DWP too,"" Ms Dove said, describing him as a ""lost soul"". The DWP said its condolences were with the families. It's been 11 years since the government was first made aware there was a problem with the tests it used to assess benefit claims after acoroner wrote to the DWP following the suicide of a man,external. During all that time, the government has simply marked its own homework, doing internal reviews. In a clear sign that these assessments are of limited use, in Scotland from next year, claimants for the main disability benefit will only have to undergo a test if any doubts remain about their claim following a review of their medical records. For the vast majority of people, the expectation is that they won't have to undergo a test - removing from the process what has long been a source of extreme stress for many people. Photo credits: BBC, JPI Media, SWNS 'Tip of the iceberg' In 2012, internal reviews by the DWP took the form of so-called ""peer reviews"" and the DWP carried out 49 of them into deaths and 11 into further serious incidents between February 2012 and November 2014,according to the Disability News Service,external. Since 2015, the DWP has held so-called ""internal process reviews"" instead. In July 2019 Justin Tomlinson MP, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work said there had been 84 held since 2015 and a further six would be ""conducted shortly"". Separately,the BBC has collated press reports,externalnaming 82 individuals to have died after some alleged DWP activity such as termination of benefits. Mental health vulnerabilities were a contributing factor in 35 of those people's deaths. The reviews are not routinely published and bereaved families are not routinely informed when they begin. Ms Abrahams, the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said she thought the known cases were ""the tip of the iceberg"". She said: ""That there has been such a lack of openness and transparency to enable us to properly examine reports on all deaths is a disgrace."" Ken Butler, welfare rights adviser at the charity Disability Rights UK, said people had their benefits cut and suffered ""fear and anxiety"" due to ""poor and inaccurate medical assessments"" carried out on behalf of the DWP by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos) and Maximus. The DWP maintains its disability assessors are ""all trained and qualified health professionals... with significant experience"" and their work is ""subject to stringent ongoing quality monitoring"". 'Devastating consequences' Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffeytold the Work and Pensions Committee in February,externalthe DWP ""did not have a duty of care or statutory safeguarding duty"". Tessa Gregory, partner at Leigh Day solicitors, said there was a ""dissonance"" between the DWP's legal stance and its role in providing the sole income for vulnerable people. ""There seems to be a real issue with the DWP failing to make reasonable adjustments for claimants who due to their mental health issues struggle with responding to official letters or participating in assessments,"" she said. ""When DWP decision making goes wrong it can, as we have seen in far too many cases, have devastating and sometimes fatal consequences... the case for reform is clear."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has meanwhile backtracked on assurances it previously gave to Ms Abrahams' MP it would conduct an inquiry into the WCA process and Personal Independence Payment (PIP) benefit for disabled claimants. As yet it has also ruled out reviewing deaths allegedly linked to some DWP activity such as termination of benefits or following DWP sanctions, which Ms Abrahams said was ""very disappointing"". In a statement, the commission said the ""landscape had changed considerably in the past year"". ""We and others have undertaken relevant work in this area and it is too early to say whether an inquiry would be the best approach on this issue,"" it added. The DWP said: ""We support millions of people a year and our priority is they get the benefits to which they are entitled promptly and receive a supportive and compassionate service. ""In the vast majority of cases, this happens, but when, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously. ""In those circumstances, it's absolutely right we carry out an internal review to check if the correct processes were followed and identify any lessons learned to inform future policy and service.""

"Boris Johnson took the holiday in Mustique with his partner Carrie Symonds Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of a Caribbean holiday in 2019. Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone has confirmed she is looking into whether the prime minister correctly declared how the trip was paid for. Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross. Downing Street said the prime minister had acted correctly and transparently. But Labour said there were ""questions"" over Mr Ross's ""generosity"". The commissioner normally investigates whether MPs have failed to declare a financial interest, not declared it correctly, or declared it late. Labour calls for probe into Johnson's Â£15,000 holiday What are the rules for MPs on financial interests? Mr Ross initially said he had not paid ""any monies"" for the trip Mr Johnson took with his partner Carrie Symonds to the private island of Mustique - part of St Vincent and the Grenadines - between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister. Mr Ross added that Mr Johnson'sdeclaration of a ""benefit in kind"",externalin the February 2020 MPs' register of MPs' interests had been ""correct"". But Labour asked for the standards commissioner to investigate, saying Mr Johnson's entry appeared ""to be incorrect"". On Monday, Ms Stone confirmed that the prime minister was among nine MPscurrently being investigated,externalfor potential breaches of the MPs' code of conduct. She is examining whether Mr Johnson followed Commons rules on declaring financial interests relating to trips outside the UK. These state,externalthat MPs have to register visits costing more than Â£300, where these have not been wholly covered by MPs themselves or the taxpayer. Ms Stone will report her findings to the Commons Standards Committee, which can order MPs to apologise or pay back money if they are found in breach of the code. In extreme cases it can recommend MPs are suspended, although this requires approval from the whole Commons and has only happened a handful of times. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""The public have a right to know who paid for Boris Johnson's luxury Caribbean holiday and the renovation of his flat. Most importantly, we need to know what these donors were promised or expected in return for their generosity."" But a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" He added: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Labour has alsoasked Ms Stone to investigatethe prime minister over how a renovation of his official Downing Street flat was initially paid for. In April 2019, Mr Johnson was rebuked by the parliamentary commissioner for standards for failing to register a share of a Somerset property within 28 days of acquiring it.

"Philippa Day (pictured left with her sister Imogen) took a fatal overdose and died in October 2019 The family of a woman who took a fatal overdose after her benefit payments were cut say they have begun a legal claim against the government. Philippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home beside a letter rejecting her request for an at-home benefits assessment in August 2019. It comes amid calls for a wider inquiry into the Department for Work & Pensions' handling of cases. The DWP said: ""When, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously."" Cases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm have led to more than 150 government reviews since 2012, a BBC investigation found. Internal reviews are held by the DWP when it is alleged its actions had a negative impact, or when it is named at an inquest. Calling for an inquiry, Labour MP Debbie Abrahams said: ""It needs to be taken out of the hands of the DWP."" Ms Abrahams, who previouslyread out in the Commons the names of 29 people who have died,,externalsaid: ""There needs to be an independent inquiry investigating why these deaths are happening and the scale of the deaths needs to be properly understood."" The DWP said it had established a new Serious Case Panel in 2019 to consider themes identified from serious cases, which included independent members. Ms Day's family are one of three hoping to take the DWP to court in separate cases within weeks. Ms Day, 27, who had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder, had previously said her benefit claim left her feeling ""inhuman"", her sister told the BBC. An inquest concluded in January that authoritiesmade 28 errors in managing her case. The assistant coroner issued a so-called Prevention of Future Death (PFD) report to the DWP and private contractor Capita, requiring them to explain what action they might take to improve. That was the fourth PFD sent to the DWP by coroners since 2013. In response, the department said it would give all of its call handlers training in mental health and introduce a tracking system to identify vulnerable people across its systems.Earlier internal reviews had established the inability to identify a vulnerable claimant,externalas a problem. Philippa's sister Imogen told the BBC her family had now begun a legal claim against the DWP and Capita including a claim under the Human Rights Act for violation of the right to life over their handling of the case. Imogen said: ""We were incredibly close. In her eulogy at her funeral I described her as my soulmate. I spoke to her [Philippa] almost daily about it [her benefit claim]. ""She talked about how it disempowered her and made her feel inhuman. ""It was like watching a car crash in slow motion... we helped her emotionally, financially and practically and we could see the tragedy in front of us but couldn't do anything more to stop it."" Errol Graham's family said his mental health problems were exacerbated by the withdrawal of his benefits Errol Graham starved to death in 2018 while seriously mentally ill. His benefits were stopped when he failed to attend a work capability assessment and did not respond to calls, letters or home visits from the DWP. When his body was found, Mr Graham weighed four-and-a-half stone (30kg) and his family said he had used pliers to pull out his teeth. His family submitted an application for permission to go to the Court of Appeal in April, afterlosing a judicial review against the DWP's safeguarding policy,external. Leigh Day, the family's solicitors, had argued the government guidance failed to impose a duty of care on decision-makers to investigate when mentally-ill claimants did not engage with the system. Alison Turner, fiancÃ©e of Mr Graham's son, said: ""I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. It's got to stop. They are not just damaging one person, there's a ripple effect on families."" Jodey Whiting suffered multiple physical and mental health issues Jodey Whiting, 42, took her own life after her benefits were stopped. Her family are due to attend the High Court on 22 June to argue she should have a second inquest to consider the DWP's role in her 2017 death. Ms Whiting's mother, Joy Dove, of Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, won permission to request the new inquest.  New evidence was submitted includingan independent inquiry's conclusions that mistakes were made by the DWP. The family received a letter endorsing the decision Ms Whiting's benefits should be stopped and saying she was fit to work while she was in a mortuary ahead of her burial, her mother said. Following her death, one of Jodey Whiting's twins Cory Bell died at the age of 19 from a drug overdose. ""We've had that second death in the family and I blame the DWP too,"" Ms Dove said, describing him as a ""lost soul"". The DWP said its condolences were with the families. It's been 11 years since the government was first made aware there was a problem with the tests it used to assess benefit claims after acoroner wrote to the DWP following the suicide of a man,external. During all that time, the government has simply marked its own homework, doing internal reviews. In a clear sign that these assessments are of limited use, in Scotland from next year, claimants for the main disability benefit will only have to undergo a test if any doubts remain about their claim following a review of their medical records. For the vast majority of people, the expectation is that they won't have to undergo a test - removing from the process what has long been a source of extreme stress for many people. Photo credits: BBC, JPI Media, SWNS 'Tip of the iceberg' In 2012, internal reviews by the DWP took the form of so-called ""peer reviews"" and the DWP carried out 49 of them into deaths and 11 into further serious incidents between February 2012 and November 2014,according to the Disability News Service,external. Since 2015, the DWP has held so-called ""internal process reviews"" instead. In July 2019 Justin Tomlinson MP, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work said there had been 84 held since 2015 and a further six would be ""conducted shortly"". Separately,the BBC has collated press reports,externalnaming 82 individuals to have died after some alleged DWP activity such as termination of benefits. Mental health vulnerabilities were a contributing factor in 35 of those people's deaths. The reviews are not routinely published and bereaved families are not routinely informed when they begin.

"Labour's new shadow cabinet met earlier today for the first time following Kier Starmer's shake-up of his top team Anneliese Dodds is now the Labour Party's chair, with Rachel Reeves taking her old position Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott says she does not want a leadership challenge but calls on Sir Keir to develop a ""winning strategy"" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she could introduce legislation for an independence referendum by next spring But the Scottish Conservatives say Ms Sturgeon is acting beyond her powers PM Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of his Caribbean holiday in late 2019 Richard Morris, Lucy Webster and Emma Owen Nearly there. It's been quite the marathon. At this point, we're just awaiting results from a handful of Police and Crime Commissioner elections. There are nine more announcements to go, which we're expecting by the end of the day. They're from:  So at this point, we're going to wrap up this live page. Of course, do keep following the BBC News website as these last results are declared - you will find them allhere, along with a breakdown of the results from all the mayoral, council, Scottish and Welsh elections. And any further developments, and analysis of what it all means, can be found onour politics pages. Thank you for joining us. With most of the results from Thursday's polls now in, we can assess what we've learned about the political landscape. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, there is a firm majority for independence in the Scottish Parliament. With the UK government strongly against allowing another referendum, this debate is likely to rumble on - and perhaps become increasingly fractious. Meanwhile, south of the border, the Conservatives are doing well in areas which were once Labour strongholds. The party, which has been in power for 11 years, won the Hartlepool by-election and gained control of 13 councils. The results also indicated that governments across the UK's nations are being rewarded for their handling of the Covid crisis, and that the Leave-Remain divide is still crucial, five years on from the Brexit vote. Read more on these elections' key lessons. We're nearing the end of our live coverage of the election results, so here's a simple catch-up, in pictures, of  the long weekend of counting. The Utilita Arena in Birmingham was given over to counting votes Waiting for results can be a hungry business Count Binface failed in his bid to become London's mayor And in Wales, Captain Beany (left) didn't manage to take Mark Drakeford's seat in the Welsh Parliament SNP candidate for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, Karen Adam was more successful. As was Sadiq Khan, seen here at the signing in ceremony at the Globe Theatre Boris Johnson returned to Hartlepool to celebrate his party's victory in the by-election Despite briefings that Keir Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, had fallen out after he removed her as Labour Party chair, they've been spotted together in Parliament's Portcullis House.

Because MPs are elected, they cannot technically resign. Instead, in one of Parliament's many quirks,they must be appointed to a historical crown office.,external So, as Labour's Tracy Brabin can no longer be MP for Batley and Spen, having been elected as mayor of West Yorkshire, there will now be a by-election to fill her seat. She says it's an ""enormous privilege"" to be the first holder of the newly-created mayoralty.  The message from the UK government today has been clear - the focus needs to be rebuilding from the virus. Now is not the time to talk about Scottish independence. One minister, tasked with the morning interview round, said another referendum ""simply isn't on our radar"". Nadine Dorries said it would be both a divisive and expensive distraction. But the SNP is not giving up. It's deputy leader in the House of Commons said it was ""simply nonsense"" to say the party does not have a mandate to hold another referendum. Kirsten Oswald said the party has a ""significant and overwhelming"" case to press ahead when the time is right. Meanwhile Gordon Brown has been setting out his plan to keep the UK intact. He attacked Boris Johnson's ""muscular unionism"" which he said was ""at odds with mainstream Scottish opinion"". Could all this end up in the courts? Find out,here. Downing Street has insisted that Boris Johnson ""transparently declared"" his 2019 holiday to Mustique, amidan investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The prime minister's spokesman told journalists: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" Asked if the government believes the public think the rules matter, the spokesman said: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by businessman David Ross. Mr Ross, a co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, initially said he did not ""pay any monies"" for the trip to the private island of Mustique, in the Caribbean. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister, and Mr Johnson's declaration of a ""benefit in kind"" was ""correct"". Sir Keir is said to have told the meeting: ""To be clear, I take responsibility. Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me."" Labour's new look shadow cabinet has met for the first time after a weekend of recriminations following the election results and the reshuffle. But there was no radical change to the top table other than Rachel Reeves replacing Anneliese Dodds in the shadow chancellor role. Angela Rayner - who's removal from certain jobs in the party has caused outrage on the Labour Left - is back with a beefed up role. And there has been no shortage of advice for Keir Starmer on what Labour needs to do next to stem the tide of losses. The newly re-elected mayor for Great Manchester, Andy Burnham, has urged him to ditch the ""cautious"" approach to policy and back what is right. Addressing party staff this morning, Starmer admitted the results in England were ""profoundly disappointing"". He said he would soon be spelling out his approach to rebuilding the economy and changing a culture that  sets people ""against each other"".   We've had a few more results in for those police and crime commissioners elections. No changes so far today with both Kent and Cumbria sticking with the Conservative candidate while South Yorkshire is held by Labour. Counting is under way in Sussex whereBBC reporter Ben Weisz says,externalone voter apparently rejected all the candidates and instead wrote âJackie Weaverâ -of Handforth council fame- on their ballot. As Labour licks its wounds from last week's election results and the reshuffle upheaval, the Conservatives are keen to demonstrate that they are getting on with the business of government. At 17:00 BST today, the prime minister will hold a press conference in Downing Street, setting out next stage of lifting coronavirus restrictions in England. He's hoping to build on his party's feelgood factor from its election successes by announcing that the lockdown roadmap is on track and people will be able to hug each other from next week. He'll try to bind in the support of the devolved nations with a message that everyone needs to focus on rebuilding from the pandemic - with a message in particular for the SNP that the focus now has to be recovery and not independence. We'll bring you a updates from that Downing Street briefing here, but you can also follow it in more detailin our dedicated Covid live page. The Queen and Prince Charles at the 2019 State Opening of Parliament The Queen's Speech is happening in Parliament tomorrow. It's an opportunity for the government to set out its agenda for the year ahead. Although delivered by the monarch, the speech is written by the government. So what can we expect from this year's speech? Reports have suggested it will contain more than 25 bills, or proposed pieces of legislation, including the much-delayedEnvironment Billon post-Brexit rules for protecting nature, and the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, whichsparked protestsearlier this year. A much-talked about reform of social care could also make an appearance, but it's thought there won't be a specific bill on this yet. There'll also be new plans for England's planning regime, which could yet prove controversial with Conservative backbenchers. Read more about what could be in the speechhere. Former PM Gordon Brown  says Sir Keir Starmer has âgot to be given time and the power and the resourcesâ to âget on with bringing forward new policiesâ.

Jill Mortimer defeated Paul Williams in Hartlepool The defeated Labour candidate in the Hartlepool by-election, Paul Williams, is speaking to Radio 4's The World at One about what went wrong. He says he lost ""with great humility"" because even though it is ""hard to take a defeat like this"" the reality is that ""voters are never wrong"". Labour lost in Hartlepool for two reasons, he says. He believes Labour had a ""credibility gap"" and ""an identity gap"". People expected when they voted Labour in the past that things would improve for then, he adds, but things did not get better and so people blamed the party. He says voters in Hartlepool and across the country do not know who Labour is or what it stands for and the challenge for Sir Keir Starmer is to come up with a policy offer to fill that vision. It's been a busy start to the week, with the fall-out from elections across Britain continuing. If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the day's top political stories: Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The newly, moderately reshuffled shadow cabinet gathered
at midday today in the Boothroyd room of Portcullis House in Parliament after a tumultuous weekend
for the party in the wake of poor election results. Face-to-face meetings are
still relatively rare at Westminster but this was hardly a happy reunion. One
senior frontbencher managed a smile on the way in but wearily said they were just
glad the elections were over. Before the meeting, another described the
situation the party faced as âcatastrophicâ and frustratedly suggested the following infighting had made things worse, giving
voters more reasons not to vote Labour. Sir Keir Starmer welcomed new members of his top team and said his
deputy Angela Rayner had a big new role taking the fight to the Tories, which
an ally of hers said would enable her to perform more to her strengths. But Sir
Keir added that he and nobody else had responsibility for Labourâs results. After some difficult days and public disagreements about the future for Labour, itâs likely there will be more to
come. The SNP's deputy leader in the House of Commons, Kirsten Oswald, is also on the BBC's Politics Live programme. She says that, despite the lack of an overall majority in Holyrood, it is ""simply nonsense"" for the UK government to say that the SNP does not have a mandate to hold another independence referendum. The SNP has won the election with a landslide, she says, giving an ""amazing and strong mandate"" to Nicola Sturgeon. ""There is no way really that you can look at this and say that there isn't a significant and overwhelming mandate for the SNP to go forward and deliver what people voted for us to do,"" she adds. ""That's what democracy is all about. That's what democracy dictates that we should do."" Over the weekend Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said the party had been taken over by ""woke warriors"". Responding to the article, Richard Burgon says woke refers to ""people who are against discrimination"", adding: ""We need to be proud of that and we need to communicate that in a way that doesn't alienate people."" Asked about the Batley and Spen by-election, Burgon warns that: ""If Labour doesn't win in Batley and Spen, Keir will have real problems."" Former home secretary David Blunkett says young people are ""thoughtful and believe in equality"" but says there are people ""who carry things to extremes and start talking about pulling down statues"". ""We've got to disavow those things we think are silly while reaching out to those who want a radical progressive agenda,"" he says. The former shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has been tweeting about her new job. She  says she's determined the party will ""seize every opportunity"" deliver change. Allow Twitter content?

He also suggests the leadership is more interested in ""taking the fight to left activists instead of the government"". Former home secretary David Blunkett accuses Burgon of ""going out of his way to be divisive"" He says the party needs to ""reshape how we address the world of tomorrow, rather than the 70s and 80s"".

Calling for an inquiry, Labour MP Debbie Abrahams said: ""It needs to be taken out of the hands of the DWP."" Ms Abrahams, who previouslyread out in the Commons the names of 29 people who have died,,externalsaid: ""There needs to be an independent inquiry investigating why these deaths are happening and the scale of the deaths needs to be properly understood."" The DWP said it had established a new Serious Case Panel in 2019 to consider themes identified from serious cases, which included independent members. Ms Day's family are one of three hoping to take the DWP to court in separate cases within weeks. Ms Day, 27, who had been diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder, had previously said her benefit claim left her feeling ""inhuman"", her sister told the BBC. An inquest concluded in January that authoritiesmade 28 errors in managing her case. The assistant coroner issued a so-called Prevention of Future Death (PFD) report to the DWP and private contractor Capita, requiring them to explain what action they might take to improve. That was the fourth PFD sent to the DWP by coroners since 2013. In response, the department said it would give all of its call handlers training in mental health and introduce a tracking system to identify vulnerable people across its systems.Earlier internal reviews had established the inability to identify a vulnerable claimant,externalas a problem. Philippa's sister Imogen told the BBC her family had now begun a legal claim against the DWP and Capita including a claim under the Human Rights Act for violation of the right to life over their handling of the case. Imogen said: ""We were incredibly close. In her eulogy at her funeral I described her as my soulmate. I spoke to her [Philippa] almost daily about it [her benefit claim]. ""She talked about how it disempowered her and made her feel inhuman. ""It was like watching a car crash in slow motion... we helped her emotionally, financially and practically and we could see the tragedy in front of us but couldn't do anything more to stop it."" Errol Graham's family said his mental health problems were exacerbated by the withdrawal of his benefits Errol Graham starved to death in 2018 while seriously mentally ill. His benefits were stopped when he failed to attend a work capability assessment and did not respond to calls, letters or home visits from the DWP. When his body was found, Mr Graham weighed four-and-a-half stone (30kg) and his family said he had used pliers to pull out his teeth. His family submitted an application for permission to go to the Court of Appeal in April, afterlosing a judicial review against the DWP's safeguarding policy,external. Leigh Day, the family's solicitors, had argued the government guidance failed to impose a duty of care on decision-makers to investigate when mentally-ill claimants did not engage with the system. Alison Turner, fiancÃ©e of Mr Graham's son, said: ""I want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else. It's got to stop. They are not just damaging one person, there's a ripple effect on families."" Jodey Whiting suffered multiple physical and mental health issues Jodey Whiting, 42, took her own life after her benefits were stopped. Her family are due to attend the High Court on 22 June to argue she should have a second inquest to consider the DWP's role in her 2017 death. Ms Whiting's mother, Joy Dove, of Norton, Stockton-on-Tees, won permission to request the new inquest.  New evidence was submitted includingan independent inquiry's conclusions that mistakes were made by the DWP. The family received a letter endorsing the decision Ms Whiting's benefits should be stopped and saying she was fit to work while she was in a mortuary ahead of her burial, her mother said. Following her death, one of Jodey Whiting's twins Cory Bell died at the age of 19 from a drug overdose. ""We've had that second death in the family and I blame the DWP too,"" Ms Dove said, describing him as a ""lost soul"". The DWP said its condolences were with the families. It's been 11 years since the government was first made aware there was a problem with the tests it used to assess benefit claims after acoroner wrote to the DWP following the suicide of a man,external. During all that time, the government has simply marked its own homework, doing internal reviews. In a clear sign that these assessments are of limited use, in Scotland from next year, claimants for the main disability benefit will only have to undergo a test if any doubts remain about their claim following a review of their medical records. For the vast majority of people, the expectation is that they won't have to undergo a test - removing from the process what has long been a source of extreme stress for many people. Photo credits: BBC, JPI Media, SWNS 'Tip of the iceberg' In 2012, internal reviews by the DWP took the form of so-called ""peer reviews"" and the DWP carried out 49 of them into deaths and 11 into further serious incidents between February 2012 and November 2014,according to the Disability News Service,external. Since 2015, the DWP has held so-called ""internal process reviews"" instead. In July 2019 Justin Tomlinson MP, Minister for Disabled People, Health and Work said there had been 84 held since 2015 and a further six would be ""conducted shortly"". Separately,the BBC has collated press reports,externalnaming 82 individuals to have died after some alleged DWP activity such as termination of benefits. Mental health vulnerabilities were a contributing factor in 35 of those people's deaths. The reviews are not routinely published and bereaved families are not routinely informed when they begin. Ms Abrahams, the MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said she thought the known cases were ""the tip of the iceberg"". She said: ""That there has been such a lack of openness and transparency to enable us to properly examine reports on all deaths is a disgrace."" Ken Butler, welfare rights adviser at the charity Disability Rights UK, said people had their benefits cut and suffered ""fear and anxiety"" due to ""poor and inaccurate medical assessments"" carried out on behalf of the DWP by the private contractors Capita, the Independent Assessment Services (formerly called Atos) and Maximus. The DWP maintains its disability assessors are ""all trained and qualified health professionals... with significant experience"" and their work is ""subject to stringent ongoing quality monitoring"". 'Devastating consequences' Secretary of State for Work and Pensions ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffeytold the Work and Pensions Committee in February,externalthe DWP ""did not have a duty of care or statutory safeguarding duty"". Tessa Gregory, partner at Leigh Day solicitors, said there was a ""dissonance"" between the DWP's legal stance and its role in providing the sole income for vulnerable people. ""There seems to be a real issue with the DWP failing to make reasonable adjustments for claimants who due to their mental health issues struggle with responding to official letters or participating in assessments,"" she said. ""When DWP decision making goes wrong it can, as we have seen in far too many cases, have devastating and sometimes fatal consequences... the case for reform is clear."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has meanwhile backtracked on assurances it previously gave to Ms Abrahams' MP it would conduct an inquiry into the WCA process and Personal Independence Payment (PIP) benefit for disabled claimants. As yet it has also ruled out reviewing deaths allegedly linked to some DWP activity such as termination of benefits or following DWP sanctions, which Ms Abrahams said was ""very disappointing"". In a statement, the commission said the ""landscape had changed considerably in the past year"". ""We and others have undertaken relevant work in this area and it is too early to say whether an inquiry would be the best approach on this issue,"" it added. The DWP said: ""We support millions of people a year and our priority is they get the benefits to which they are entitled promptly and receive a supportive and compassionate service. ""In the vast majority of cases, this happens, but when, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously. ""In those circumstances, it's absolutely right we carry out an internal review to check if the correct processes were followed and identify any lessons learned to inform future policy and service.""

"Some of the fake endorsement scams the NCSC has taken down Martin Lewis and Sir Richard Branson are the celebrities whose names are used most in fake endorsement scams, a report has found. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) removed more than 730,000 websites running the tricks in 2020. Mr Lewis, founder of the website Money Saving Expert, said the whole issue sickened him. Experts at the cyber-agency, which is part of intelligence agency GCHQ, say it's a growing problem. Criminals create fake news articles claiming that celebrities are backing new investment schemes. The articles are spread through mass email campaigns, SMS texts, or adverts on social media. They come with a link to websites which encourage victims to invest in the unscrupulous programmes. Although the theme of these attacks is often cryptocurrency, the template can be used to promote any type of fake investment opportunity. Mr Lewis said: 'It's the worst flattery I've ever had. These thieves and con artists leach off the reputation for trust I've built up by trying to help and protect consumers, in order to try and steal money off vulnerable people. 'The concept makes me feel nauseous. We must step up our fight to stop these scams which destroy millions of people's finances and mental health.' The news comes from the NCSC's annual Active Cyber Defence report which outlines the actions the agency took to prevent fraud, scams and cyber-attacks. Why can't Google get a grip on rip-off ads? 'I lost Â£400,000 to fake Elon Musk giveaway scam' Martin Lewis gets Facebook pledge over fake ads The NCSC says it began taking action against the websites in April 2020, and by the end of the calendar year it had taken down 286,322 separate campaigns across 731,080 URLs. The cyber-agency says the relatively new scams are a global issue. UK victims see curated content with recognisable British figures, but if you were to view the same article from France, the content served would probably appear as an article in a fake French newspaper featuring a celebrity from the country. Ian Levy, the NCSC's technical director, said Mr Lewis and Mr Branson made up ""a decent chunk"" of all the celebrity endorsement scams they discovered. ""They're really convincing and it's no surprise that people fall for them. Criminals use both newspaper brands and celebrities combined to make these articles look really good,"" he said. ""Martin Lewis and Sir Richard Branson are used because they are famous and because they are related to money. It must be horrible for them."" Mr Lewis is urging the government to reverse its decision not to include scams in the future Online Safety Bill, which is expected to be in the Queen's Speech this week. The NCSC says it took down more than 139,000 scam online shops In 2019 Mr Lewisagreed to drop legal actionagainst Facebook for allowing his name and photo to be used in fake adverts on the platform. In return, Facebook agreed to donate Â£3m to set up an anti-scam programme. Elsewhere in the NCSC's report, it says it carried out a 15-fold increase in campaign takedowns in total. The agency it took action against nearly 1.5 million web addresses from fake shops to phishing sites pretending to be government services. Why can't Google get a grip on rip-off ads?

"Average house prices have climbed about Â£20,000 in the last year, the Halifax says, as the buying frenzy prompted by the stamp duty holiday continues. Prices are up 8.2% in the last 12 months, the highest annual growth rate for five years, it said. Altura mortgage broker Rob Gill said ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO) was driving the surge. ""There's a fear among buyers that they could miss out if they don't hurry up and buy before prices spiral,"" he said. The Halifax said that prices rose sharply in April, up by 1.4% compared with March. The average price of a UK home hit Â£258,204, a record high. At the Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunakextended the stamp duty holidayto June. The property purchase tax has been suspended on the first Â£500,000 of all sales in England and Northern Ireland since July to support the market. When does the stamp duty holiday end? ""The stamp duty holiday continues to add impetus to an extremely active market, magnifying the current shortage of available homes as buyers aim to take advantage of the Government scheme,"" said Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax. He predicted that the influence of the stamp duty holiday will fade gradually over the coming months as it is tapered out but that low stock levels, low interest rates and continued demand is likely to continue to underpin prices in the market. Kirsty Kirby is a first-time buyer in South Yorkshire who has been planning to move house since 2018. But the 37-year-old pharmaceutical worker says even getting a viewing for a property is a challenge. ""I ring for many properties,"" she says. ""I'm like a hawk on Rightmove, I must refresh it several times an hour, just to see what's on."" Kirsty says most homes she enquires about already have multiple viewing bookings within minutes of appearing online and estate agents warn her the house will be going to 'best and final' offers. Best and final is a system where buyers put in one offer for the seller to choose from, in order to avoid a bidding war between prospective home-owners. Kirsty says, in her experience, anytime a property goes to best and final ""it goes way above the asking price because people get crazy"".

""The feeding frenzy for property was already feeling pretty ferocious but then along comes another big leap in the annual rate of [house price] growth.""

""In a blazing hot seller's market like this, most buyers don't even compare prices locally to make their offer, they work out what they can afford and they go for it."" Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country, said: ""Buyers need to be incredibly determined to succeed in a market like this."" She predicted that the market rally will continue with optimism being complemented by improving weather, the imminent loosening of Covid restrictions, low interest rates, a yearning for more space and the fact that many homeowners have saved thousands of pounds not being able to go anywhere.

"Boris Johnson took the holiday in Mustique with his partner Carrie Symonds Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of a Caribbean holiday in 2019. Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone has confirmed she is looking into whether the prime minister correctly declared how the trip was paid for. Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross. Downing Street said the prime minister had acted correctly and transparently. But Labour said there were ""questions"" over Mr Ross's ""generosity"". The commissioner normally investigates whether MPs have failed to declare a financial interest, not declared it correctly, or declared it late. Labour calls for probe into Johnson's Â£15,000 holiday What are the rules for MPs on financial interests? Mr Ross initially said he had not paid ""any monies"" for the trip Mr Johnson took with his partner Carrie Symonds to the private island of Mustique - part of St Vincent and the Grenadines - between Boxing Day 2019 and 5 January 2020. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister. Mr Ross added that Mr Johnson'sdeclaration of a ""benefit in kind"",externalin the February 2020 MPs' register of MPs' interests had been ""correct"". But Labour asked for the standards commissioner to investigate, saying Mr Johnson's entry appeared ""to be incorrect"". On Monday, Ms Stone confirmed that the prime minister was among nine MPscurrently being investigated,externalfor potential breaches of the MPs' code of conduct. She is examining whether Mr Johnson followed Commons rules on declaring financial interests relating to trips outside the UK. These state,externalthat MPs have to register visits costing more than Â£300, where these have not been wholly covered by MPs themselves or the taxpayer. Ms Stone will report her findings to the Commons Standards Committee, which can order MPs to apologise or pay back money if they are found in breach of the code. In extreme cases it can recommend MPs are suspended, although this requires approval from the whole Commons and has only happened a handful of times. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""The public have a right to know who paid for Boris Johnson's luxury Caribbean holiday and the renovation of his flat. Most importantly, we need to know what these donors were promised or expected in return for their generosity."" But a Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" He added: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Labour has alsoasked Ms Stone to investigatethe prime minister over how a renovation of his official Downing Street flat was initially paid for. In April 2019, Mr Johnson was rebuked by the parliamentary commissioner for standards for failing to register a share of a Somerset property within 28 days of acquiring it.

"The next stage of lockdown easing is likely to see the reopening of indoor hospitality Indoor hospitality and household mixing are set to return from next Monday, as the PM is due to confirm the next stage of lockdown easing in England. Boris Johnson is expected to say the data supports a further relaxation of measures at a 17:00 BST Downing Street news conference later. It could also include guidance that it is now safe to hug friends and family. Health Minister Nadine Dorries said she was ""hopeful"" hugging could be allowed but urged people to act ""cautiously"". Ahead of the Downing Street briefing, the UKreduced its Covid alert level from level four to three, meaning the virus is in general circulation but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced. Under the next stage of thegovernment's road map for lifting England's lockdown, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors. People are also likely to be allowed to stay overnight with those not in their household or bubble. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues such as cinemas and soft play areas are set to be permitted to reopen indoors. When can we have a 'cautious' hug? What changes are coming on 17 May? The science of hugs: Why do we miss them so much? A government science adviser said that if the guidance does allow hugs, they should be selective, brief, and should avoid face-to-face contact to minimise the risk of spreading the virus. But Ms Dorries said ""the data is looking extremely positive"" when she was asked if the guidance would be relaxed to allow hugging between friends and family. ""We've all missed the hugs, we've all missed the close and intimate contact we've had with friends and family and so I'm hopeful that we will be hugging and kissing again indoors,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She stressed that people should take this step ""a little bit cautiously"" to protect people who may be vulnerable and avoid a resurgence of the virus, however. It is a sign of how successful the country has been in getting infection rates down that there is no doubt that the next unlocking will take place. Allowing indoor mixing was always the step that concerned experts the most in the roadmap - given how much easier the virus spreads indoors compared to outdoors. Modelling earlier this year warned there could be a deadly summer surge - but that now looks overly pessimistic. Lockdown and social distancing has done most of the hard work in getting infection levels low, but now the vaccines are going to take the load. From the evidence gathered so far, they are more than up to the job in combating the dominant virus in the UK. Early signs are also promising for the variants. Some scientists are even suggesting the UK could be on brink of reaching herd immunity. As always with this virus, it would be foolish to get too far ahead of ourselves. But the signs look very promising. As part of other measures set to be relaxed, the rest of the accommodation sector is to reopen, along with indoor group sports and exercise classes. And up to 30 people are to be allowed to attend weddings, receptions and wakes, as well as funerals. Foreign holidays will also return. On Friday, the government announced that12 destinations would be placed on England's travel green list, meaning anyone returning from those areas will not need to quarantine from 17 May. Monday's announcement of lockdown easing will be stage three of the road map announced by the government in February, with the final stage scheduled for 21 June, when the government hopes to remove all legal restrictions on social contact. Millions of people in England have not been able to sit indoors in a pub since last October 4 monthssince the nationwide shutdown of pubs Longerfor all the people who were living under the toughest tier rules last December Last Octoberfor people in many areas like Greater Manchester, because of tier rules Drink onlyAnd in many areas where indoor drinks were allowed, they had to be drunk with food Each stage has been separated by a gap of several weeks to allow scientists to assess the impact of previous changes, which in stage two included the reopening of non-essential shops and outdoor service in pubs and restaurants. The government has to be satisfied thatits four tests,externalhave been met before progressing to the next stage. These tests rest on the successful rollout of vaccines; evidence that jabs are reducing serious illness and death; infection rates being under control and the risk from coronavirus variants not changing. This video can not be played Catherine Noakes, from the University of Leeds, says we should hug safely The government said the latest data suggested that easing restrictions from 17 May was unlikely to risk a resurgence in infections. It said infection rates were at the lowest level since September 2020 and hospital admissions were continuing to decrease. On Sunday, the UK recorded another two deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and a further 1,770 cases. Mr Johnson said: ""The data reflects what we already knew - we are not going to let this virus beat us. ""The roadmap remains on track, our successful vaccination programme continues - more than two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had the first vaccine - and we can now look forward to unlocking, cautiously but irreversibly."" More than 35.3 million people have received one Covid vaccine dose and 17.6 million people have had both doses. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Prof Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee that advises the government, told the BBC on Sunday that if people hugged their friends every time they see them, it would ""perpetuate an awful lot of additional close contact that could spread the virus"". But she said the risk from grandparents who are fully vaccinated hugging their grandchildren was likely to be low in most cases.

"The only way for there to be a successful referendum on Scottish independence is if both sides agree. That's how they did it in 2014 with the Edinburgh agreement and the alternatives are messy and risky for both sides. If the current stand-off between Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson cannot be resolved, the first minister intends - at some point - to pass a referendum bill at Holyrood. She dares the UK government to challenge the legislation in court which it may feel obliged to do because it considers such a vote to be beyond devolved powers. The UK constitution - including the union between Scotland and England - is a matter reserved to Westminster by law. However, it could be argued that reservation does not explicitly prevent Holyrood from consulting the public on independence. Then again, a ""yes"" vote in any referendum would create an expectation that major constitutional change would follow, as it did in the advisory vote on Brexit. These are the arguments the UK Supreme Court would have to work through. At the weekend, both the UK cabinet minister Michael Gove and the first minister downplayed the prospect of a legal battle but that is what would inevitably happen unless the two sides make a deal. Nicola Sturgeon would prefer to see support for independence running higher UK government sources have made clear that just because they are not seeking to take legal action does not mean they would not go to court if a specific referendum proposal emerged. Even if the UK government did not challenge, somebody surely would. The whisky industry tied up minimum alcohol pricing legislation in court for five years. If the court ruled in Nicola Sturgeon's favour, that might enable a referendum but it could still face a unionist boycott which would de-legitimise the outcome. If the court ruled in Boris Johnson's favour, that would thwart a referendum because Ms Sturgeon has made clear she would not hold an illegal vote. However, Nicola Sturgeon could argue in those circumstances that the union was being held together by force of law rather than consent which would be a rotten look for the UK. That might lead to a rise in support for independence. Could the Supreme Court rule on a referendum? Nicola Sturgeon tells PM referendum is case of 'when - not if' The UK government could pass legislation to explicitly prevent Holyrood from having a referendum or to organise its own vote - options that carry similar risks. The UK strategy for the moment seems to be to play for time by arguing that there can be another referendum at some unspecified point in the future but not now. Boris Johnson's UK government is playing for time They make the case that it would be irresponsible to have a referendum while we are still in a pandemic. On that point, Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon agree and appear to be in tune with Scottish public opinion. There are other reasons the first minister is not in a rush. She wants to win a referendum and so would prefer to see support for independence running higher. Polls suggested there was a sustained majority for a ""yes"" vote throughout much of last year but that has dipped in recent months. The country appears split down the middle. It also became clear during the election that the Scottish government needs time to work out detailed plans for what independence would mean for trade and borders in the aftermath of Brexit. In short, they are not ready to fight a referendum however desperate some in the independence movement are for it to happen. Nicola Sturgeon has told Boris Johnson she considers indyref2 a matter of ""when - not if"". Officially she still favours having the vote by the end of 2023. There is unlikely to be any immediate effort by the Scottish government to begin preparations. The SNP is likely to start working on refreshing the independence case before civil servants are given instructions. As Holyrood returns to business, expect to see the SNP and Greens demonstrate the majority they now have for indyref2 in a symbolic way at an early stage. With 64 SNP votes and eight from the Greens, support for independence is as high as it has ever been in the 129-seat parliament, matching the ""yes"" majority after the 2011 election. The two parties made explicit commitments to hold a referendum in their election manifestos. The two parties have more votes and seats than before. That is their mandate for indyref2. By contrast, pro-UK parties got 51% of the constituency vote in this election which they take as a mandate to oppose it. Any referendum legislation would need to be certified as within Holyrood's powers by Scotland's top law officer, the lord advocate, and parliament's presiding officer who is elected on Thursday.

"Labour's new shadow cabinet met earlier today for the first time following Kier Starmer's shake-up of his top team Anneliese Dodds is now the Labour Party's chair, with Rachel Reeves taking her old position Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott says she does not want a leadership challenge but calls on Sir Keir to develop a ""winning strategy"" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she could introduce legislation for an independence referendum by next spring But the Scottish Conservatives say Ms Sturgeon is acting beyond her powers PM Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of his Caribbean holiday in late 2019 Richard Morris, Lucy Webster and Emma Owen Nearly there. It's been quite the marathon. At this point, we're just awaiting results from a handful of Police and Crime Commissioner elections. There are nine more announcements to go, which we're expecting by the end of the day. They're from:  So at this point, we're going to wrap up this live page. Of course, do keep following the BBC News website as these last results are declared - you will find them allhere, along with a breakdown of the results from all the mayoral, council, Scottish and Welsh elections. And any further developments, and analysis of what it all means, can be found onour politics pages. Thank you for joining us. With most of the results from Thursday's polls now in, we can assess what we've learned about the political landscape. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, there is a firm majority for independence in the Scottish Parliament. With the UK government strongly against allowing another referendum, this debate is likely to rumble on - and perhaps become increasingly fractious. Meanwhile, south of the border, the Conservatives are doing well in areas which were once Labour strongholds. The party, which has been in power for 11 years, won the Hartlepool by-election and gained control of 13 councils. The results also indicated that governments across the UK's nations are being rewarded for their handling of the Covid crisis, and that the Leave-Remain divide is still crucial, five years on from the Brexit vote. Read more on these elections' key lessons. We're nearing the end of our live coverage of the election results, so here's a simple catch-up, in pictures, of  the long weekend of counting. The Utilita Arena in Birmingham was given over to counting votes Waiting for results can be a hungry business Count Binface failed in his bid to become London's mayor And in Wales, Captain Beany (left) didn't manage to take Mark Drakeford's seat in the Welsh Parliament SNP candidate for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, Karen Adam was more successful. As was Sadiq Khan, seen here at the signing in ceremony at the Globe Theatre Boris Johnson returned to Hartlepool to celebrate his party's victory in the by-election Despite briefings that Keir Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, had fallen out after he removed her as Labour Party chair, they've been spotted together in Parliament's Portcullis House.

Because MPs are elected, they cannot technically resign. Instead, in one of Parliament's many quirks,they must be appointed to a historical crown office.,external So, as Labour's Tracy Brabin can no longer be MP for Batley and Spen, having been elected as mayor of West Yorkshire, there will now be a by-election to fill her seat. She says it's an ""enormous privilege"" to be the first holder of the newly-created mayoralty.  The message from the UK government today has been clear - the focus needs to be rebuilding from the virus. Now is not the time to talk about Scottish independence. One minister, tasked with the morning interview round, said another referendum ""simply isn't on our radar"". Nadine Dorries said it would be both a divisive and expensive distraction. But the SNP is not giving up. It's deputy leader in the House of Commons said it was ""simply nonsense"" to say the party does not have a mandate to hold another referendum. Kirsten Oswald said the party has a ""significant and overwhelming"" case to press ahead when the time is right. Meanwhile Gordon Brown has been setting out his plan to keep the UK intact. He attacked Boris Johnson's ""muscular unionism"" which he said was ""at odds with mainstream Scottish opinion"". Could all this end up in the courts? Find out,here. Downing Street has insisted that Boris Johnson ""transparently declared"" his 2019 holiday to Mustique, amidan investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The prime minister's spokesman told journalists: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" Asked if the government believes the public think the rules matter, the spokesman said: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by businessman David Ross. Mr Ross, a co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, initially said he did not ""pay any monies"" for the trip to the private island of Mustique, in the Caribbean. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister, and Mr Johnson's declaration of a ""benefit in kind"" was ""correct"". Sir Keir is said to have told the meeting: ""To be clear, I take responsibility. Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me."" Labour's new look shadow cabinet has met for the first time after a weekend of recriminations following the election results and the reshuffle. But there was no radical change to the top table other than Rachel Reeves replacing Anneliese Dodds in the shadow chancellor role. Angela Rayner - who's removal from certain jobs in the party has caused outrage on the Labour Left - is back with a beefed up role. And there has been no shortage of advice for Keir Starmer on what Labour needs to do next to stem the tide of losses. The newly re-elected mayor for Great Manchester, Andy Burnham, has urged him to ditch the ""cautious"" approach to policy and back what is right. Addressing party staff this morning, Starmer admitted the results in England were ""profoundly disappointing"". He said he would soon be spelling out his approach to rebuilding the economy and changing a culture that  sets people ""against each other"".   We've had a few more results in for those police and crime commissioners elections. No changes so far today with both Kent and Cumbria sticking with the Conservative candidate while South Yorkshire is held by Labour. Counting is under way in Sussex whereBBC reporter Ben Weisz says,externalone voter apparently rejected all the candidates and instead wrote âJackie Weaverâ -of Handforth council fame- on their ballot. As Labour licks its wounds from last week's election results and the reshuffle upheaval, the Conservatives are keen to demonstrate that they are getting on with the business of government. At 17:00 BST today, the prime minister will hold a press conference in Downing Street, setting out next stage of lifting coronavirus restrictions in England. He's hoping to build on his party's feelgood factor from its election successes by announcing that the lockdown roadmap is on track and people will be able to hug each other from next week. He'll try to bind in the support of the devolved nations with a message that everyone needs to focus on rebuilding from the pandemic - with a message in particular for the SNP that the focus now has to be recovery and not independence. We'll bring you a updates from that Downing Street briefing here, but you can also follow it in more detailin our dedicated Covid live page. The Queen and Prince Charles at the 2019 State Opening of Parliament The Queen's Speech is happening in Parliament tomorrow. It's an opportunity for the government to set out its agenda for the year ahead. Although delivered by the monarch, the speech is written by the government. So what can we expect from this year's speech? Reports have suggested it will contain more than 25 bills, or proposed pieces of legislation, including the much-delayedEnvironment Billon post-Brexit rules for protecting nature, and the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, whichsparked protestsearlier this year. A much-talked about reform of social care could also make an appearance, but it's thought there won't be a specific bill on this yet. There'll also be new plans for England's planning regime, which could yet prove controversial with Conservative backbenchers. Read more about what could be in the speechhere. Former PM Gordon Brown  says Sir Keir Starmer has âgot to be given time and the power and the resourcesâ to âget on with bringing forward new policiesâ. He told BBC Scotland editor Sarah Smith the leader has âgot to get out there, as he wants to do it, and listen to the peopleâ.

It was the only contest to be held in the county in last week's bumper crop of elections. His responsibilities include setting Cumbria Constabulary's priorities, overseeing its budget and hiring its chief constable. The election was delayed from last year due to the pandemic. You can read the full story here. Jill Mortimer defeated Paul Williams in Hartlepool The defeated Labour candidate in the Hartlepool by-election, Paul Williams, is speaking to Radio 4's The World at One about what went wrong. He says he lost ""with great humility"" because even though it is ""hard to take a defeat like this"" the reality is that ""voters are never wrong"". Labour lost in Hartlepool for two reasons, he says. He believes Labour had a ""credibility gap"" and ""an identity gap"". People expected when they voted Labour in the past that things would improve for then, he adds, but things did not get better and so people blamed the party. He says voters in Hartlepool and across the country do not know who Labour is or what it stands for and the challenge for Sir Keir Starmer is to come up with a policy offer to fill that vision. It's been a busy start to the week, with the fall-out from elections across Britain continuing. If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the day's top political stories: Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The newly, moderately reshuffled shadow cabinet gathered
at midday today in the Boothroyd room of Portcullis House in Parliament after a tumultuous weekend
for the party in the wake of poor election results. Face-to-face meetings are
still relatively rare at Westminster but this was hardly a happy reunion. One
senior frontbencher managed a smile on the way in but wearily said they were just
glad the elections were over. Before the meeting, another described the
situation the party faced as âcatastrophicâ and frustratedly suggested the following infighting had made things worse, giving
voters more reasons not to vote Labour. Sir Keir Starmer welcomed new members of his top team and said his
deputy Angela Rayner had a big new role taking the fight to the Tories, which
an ally of hers said would enable her to perform more to her strengths. But Sir
Keir added that he and nobody else had responsibility for Labourâs results. After some difficult days and public disagreements about the future for Labour, itâs likely there will be more to
come. The SNP's deputy leader in the House of Commons, Kirsten Oswald, is also on the BBC's Politics Live programme. She says that, despite the lack of an overall majority in Holyrood, it is ""simply nonsense"" for the UK government to say that the SNP does not have a mandate to hold another independence referendum. The SNP has won the election with a landslide, she says, giving an ""amazing and strong mandate"" to Nicola Sturgeon. ""There is no way really that you can look at this and say that there isn't a significant and overwhelming mandate for the SNP to go forward and deliver what people voted for us to do,"" she adds. ""That's what democracy is all about. That's what democracy dictates that we should do."" Over the weekend Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said the party had been taken over by ""woke warriors"". Responding to the article, Richard Burgon says woke refers to ""people who are against discrimination"", adding: ""We need to be proud of that and we need to communicate that in a way that doesn't alienate people."" Asked about the Batley and Spen by-election, Burgon warns that: ""If Labour doesn't win in Batley and Spen, Keir will have real problems."" Former home secretary David Blunkett says young people are ""thoughtful and believe in equality"" but says there are people ""who carry things to extremes and start talking about pulling down statues"". ""We've got to disavow those things we think are silly while reaching out to those who want a radical progressive agenda,"" he says. The former shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has been tweeting about her new job. She  says she's determined the party will ""seize every opportunity"" deliver change. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC's Politics Live, former shadow minister Richard Burgon says the election results are ""very upsetting"" and that it is ""unfair"" to place responsibility for the defeats on Angela Rayner. He says the party leader needs to ""change direction"" instead of ""rearranging the deck chairs"". He also suggests the leadership is more interested in ""taking the fight to left activists instead of the government"". Former home secretary David Blunkett accuses Burgon of ""going out of his way to be divisive"" He says the party needs to ""reshape how we address the world of tomorrow, rather than the 70s and 80s"".

"Boris Johnson has set out the next stage of lockdown easing for England Pubs and restaurants can serve people inside from next Monday Galleries, theatres, cinemas and soft play centres can also reopen Guidance on hugging will change but people should consider the vulnerabilities of their loved ones, he says People will be able to meet inside in groups of six, or two households Up to 30 people will be allowed to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes The UK chief medical officers earlier lowered the Covid-19 alert level from four to three Zero coronavirus deaths were announced in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday Restrictions are also being eased across Europe, including in Ireland and Spain Edited by Emma Owen Thatâs all from us
today, thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Weâll
be back tomorrow morning with more updates. In the meantime, you can read more detail on all of today's stories by going to ourhome page. Todayâs coverage
was brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Alexandra Fouche, Jack Hunter, Alex
Kleiderman, Jennifer Meierhans, Richard Morris, Ashitha Nagesh, Emma Owen, Lauren
Turner and Katie Wright. We are going to be bringing our live coverage to a close soon so here's a recap on the main news from the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The governmentâs science advisers â the body known as Sage â
have painted a far more optimistic picture of the months to come than just a
few weeks ago. The crucial shift comes from evidence that vaccines are
significantly cutting the chances of immunised people passing the virus on if
they become ill. The weeks and months to come look far more promising once
that is factored into the equation. A third wave is still anticipated and even the reopening
next Monday is likely to lead to cases starting to rise again. However, Sage â the scientific advisory group for
emergencies â says the next stage of rule relaxing is highly unlikely to put
intense pressure on hospitals. And, while there is uncertainty, any future peaks could be
substantially smaller than the first wave in March last year. There are still key questions that could change the
forecasts, such as: Will immunity wane? What about variants? How much will the summer
weather suppress the virus? How will we behave when the rules are relaxed? Will
we go back to normal or will some of us keep working from home and wear facemasks
even if the rules are relaxed? So these projections will be scrutinised for months to come. Reality Check Earlier the prime minister announced that from Monday we can have our friends over or catch up for a drinkinsidea pub - it's the end of layering up to meet up. But if you'd warmed to the idea of an outdoor gathering, you can open it up to 30 people - the same amount of guests that will soon be allowed to weddings, receptions and other celebrations. Here's what else you'll be able to do from next week and what there is to look forward to after that. There's also been a lot of talk today about the return of hugging. From Monday, it's your choice whether or not to be socially distanced with close family and friends - so if you want to hug each other, you can. ButProf Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee advising the government says it would personally worry her ""if we were advocating we could hug all of our friends every time we meet them again"". Hugging risks spreading coronavirus and there are safer ways of doing it apparently, sohere's some reading up to help you decide whether to hug or not to hug. Pubs, restaurants and cafes in England, Scotland and Wales, will soon be able to serve customers inside again. But things won't quite be back to normal, these are the rules that will still be in place:  Here's a look at the rules in more detail. Earlier we brought you the UK's latest coronavirus data which showed that another four deaths had been reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Looking closer at those reported figures, four of them were recorded in Wales, meaning there wereno coronavirus deaths announced in England, Scotland and Northern Irelandtoday. Take a look at the UK's latest figures in the charts below. The World Health Organization briefing also heard that the world is seeing a levelling off in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths. Numbers are declining in most areas, including the Americas and Europe, the worst-hit regions. ""But itâs an unacceptably high plateau, with more than 5.4 million reported COVID-19 cases and almost 90,000 deaths last week,"" the WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the briefing. He said a global disparity in who can access vaccines remains one of the biggest obstacles to ending the pandemic. The new coronavirus variant known as B.1.617, first detected in India, is a variant of global concern, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, told a briefing that it may have increased transmissibility. The variant continues to tear through India,where infections and deaths came  close to record daily highs on Monday. The variant has three lineages, of which B.1.617.2 is the fastest growing. At the UK government's Covid briefing today, England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said that variant was a concern and officials were keeping a close eye on it. ""Our view is that this is a highly transmissible variant... [but] at this point in time, our view is it is less likely to be
able to escape vaccination than some of the other variants,"" he
said. Here's what we know about the India Covid variant. Wembley last hosted the Champions League final in 2013 Portugal has emerged asa strong candidate to host this season's Champions League final later this monthafter Uefa did not gain guarantees of the coronavirus exemptions it wants to move the game to Wembley. Uefa, UK government officials and the Football Association met earlier today to discuss moving the game between Chelsea and Manchester City from Istanbul. Uefa has decided it will be moved after Turkey was put on England'sred travel listwhich the government says means fans cannot travel. Portugal is on the green list so fans from England would be allowed to attend on 29 May. Travellers from England to green-list countries will be required to take Covid tests before and after travel but do not have to quarantine on their return. The match could still be played at Wembley but it would require a major shift from the government, who have so far failed to reach an agreement with Uefa. European football's governing body feels in Portugal it is going to be easier to gain access for sponsors and broadcasters, who would need to be compensated if they were unable to attend the game. Porto has been mentioned as a potential venue but it is understood Lisbon, which hosted last year's final, is also a possibility. We've got more on Scotland's foreign travel traffic light system which is expected to come into effect on 24 May. Earlier, the BBC was told that people in Scotland will be able to travel to some foreign destinations without the need to quarantine on their return. Countries are to be classified as green, amber and red and a review will take place every four weeks, the BBC understands. The Scottish government says a Covid briefing will take place on Tuesday and it would not comment on reports. But if it's similar to England's traffic light system, here's how it could work. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring Russia is aiming to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 by September, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko has said. When asked on about the country's vaccine rollout, Murashko said it was progressing ""as planned"" and insisted that Russia's target for collective immunity will be met,the Interfax news agency reported.,external This comes despite Russia's slow start to its vaccination campaign with official figures showing that by 6 May only 13.4 million people had received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 9.4 million had received both. Russia's vaccine rollout has been affected by some public scepticism, polls suggest This is some way off the target of vaccinating 70% of the
adult population by the end of the summer,initially given by President Vladimir Putin in March.,external Russia's rollout has been affected by some public scepticism
of vaccines as independent pollster Levada Centre suggested that in February only
30% of Russians were willing to receive the Sputnik V vaccine - the country's
most widely used jab. The coronavirus
data supports the decision to continue to ease lockdown restrictions in England,
according to the new shadow leader of the House of Commons. Responding to the announcements unveiled at the Downing Street news conference, Thangam Debbonaire says she is looking forward to the prospect of hugging loved ones again and visiting people
in their homes. However she adds that people still âneed to exercise cautionâ. Being able to reopen indoors from next week is âgreat
newsâ for the hospitality industry which has âgone through such a lotâ, she
adds. Asked whether the country should open up
sooner than the government's roadmap, she says we need to wait to see the data once restrictions have eased further
to find out whether there has been an impact. âThereâs no denying
that everybody must be looking forward to things getting better and opening up
this summer,"" she says. This video can not be played Boris Johnson warns not to 'throw caution to the wind' Despite confirming that hugging relatives and friends from different households will be allowed from Monday, the Prime Minister urged people to remain cautious. Speaking at the Covid briefing, Boris Johnson warned that ""this does not mean we should throw caution to the wind"", and hugging is still a main way that the virus can spread. Meeting outdoors is still safer, he added, and encouraged opening windows while meeting indoors. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmedthe third stage of England's roadmap out of lockdownwill go ahead on 17 May - next Monday. In a significant step towards normality after off-and-on restrictions for more than a year:  Read morehere. Helen CattPolitical correspondent So Step three is going ahead; that's been expected for a while now. The updating of guidance to say we can have physical contact with friends and family again - even if caution was very much the word - also means life should feel a bit more normal from next week. There were several hints in this news conference that seemed to suggest the Prime Minister is reasonably confident that Step four is also likely to happen from 21 June too, although once again he resisted any temptation to suggest that date could be brought forward. He did promise though more information this month to help businesses prepare and there is the start of a shift in tone to letting people make up their own mind about how best to protect themselves. However, both he and the scientists stressed that next week marks a particularly big step. The discussion of the India variant and situations which ""can come out of a blue sky"" mean that there is still a heavy dose of caution to all this. The ""stay in the UK"" restriction will lift from Monday and people will be able to travel to
green-list countries, the PM confirmed during the Downing Street press conference. But he urged caution
and stresses that we must remain vigilant to unexpected changes in the data, and
the spread of new variants. To ensure our progress through the roadmap continues to be irreversible, he says people must continue to follow the rules, remember ""hands, face, space, fresh
air"", and come forward to get the vaccine when called. Before the PM was able to announce the lifting of further coronavirus restrictions had had to get approval from his cabinet. MPs reviewed the latest data which shows infection rates are at their lowest level since last September, and deaths and hospitalisations are at their lowest level since last July. They were also told that more than two thirds of all adults across the UK have been vaccinated, with more than 18 million people having received their second dose. And in light of the most recent data, the four UK chief medical officers had confirmed that the UK Covid-19 alert level should move from level four to level three. The changes to lockdown restrictions were approved by Cabinet at a meeting earlier today. The prime minister answered questions from the public and journalists at the briefing Now the prime
minister is asked whether it would be irresponsible for Scotland to hold a
second referendum during this stage of the pandemic. Boris Johnson says
he had good conversations with the heads of the devolved nations and everyoneâs
number one priority was to come out of the pandemic and ""build back better"". Prof Chris Whitty
is asked about the threat of one of the Indian variants in the UK. He says cases
of it have gone up sharply and thatâs a ""reason to be very careful about it"". ""What we know with all the variants is that
things can come out of the blue sky - youâre not expecting it and then it can happen."" He adds that at
this point in time âour view is that this is a highly transmissible variantâ
but it is less likely to be able to escape vaccination, although the data is
incomplete. Sir Patrick Vallance joined the PM at the briefing Jason Groves from the Daily Mail asks if this is potentially the last lockdown we see, bar any new ""terrible variant"" because of the vaccination programme. He asks if people should expect to continue working from home in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""this is a big step forward"" and there will be ""many many more people vaccinated"" this time around, but it is important that ""we don't get ahead of ourselves"". ""Everything is pointing in the direction"" that the vaccines are reducing infection rates. Boris Johnson says the more people can communicate remotely, the more reasons they find to meet face to face. He says he is ""pretty certain that eventually our town centres are going to be full of bustle, full of people who want to interact again"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"The next stage of lockdown easing is likely to see the reopening of indoor hospitality Indoor hospitality and household mixing are set to return from next Monday, as the PM is due to confirm the next stage of lockdown easing in England. Boris Johnson is expected to say the data supports a further relaxation of measures at a 17:00 BST Downing Street news conference later. It could also include guidance that it is now safe to hug friends and family. Health Minister Nadine Dorries said she was ""hopeful"" hugging could be allowed but urged people to act ""cautiously"". Ahead of the Downing Street briefing, the UKreduced its Covid alert level from level four to three, meaning the virus is in general circulation but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced. Under the next stage of thegovernment's road map for lifting England's lockdown, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors. People are also likely to be allowed to stay overnight with those not in their household or bubble. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues such as cinemas and soft play areas are set to be permitted to reopen indoors. When can we have a 'cautious' hug? What changes are coming on 17 May? The science of hugs: Why do we miss them so much? A government science adviser said that if the guidance does allow hugs, they should be selective, brief, and should avoid face-to-face contact to minimise the risk of spreading the virus. But Ms Dorries said ""the data is looking extremely positive"" when she was asked if the guidance would be relaxed to allow hugging between friends and family. ""We've all missed the hugs, we've all missed the close and intimate contact we've had with friends and family and so I'm hopeful that we will be hugging and kissing again indoors,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She stressed that people should take this step ""a little bit cautiously"" to protect people who may be vulnerable and avoid a resurgence of the virus, however. It is a sign of how successful the country has been in getting infection rates down that there is no doubt that the next unlocking will take place. Allowing indoor mixing was always the step that concerned experts the most in the roadmap - given how much easier the virus spreads indoors compared to outdoors. Modelling earlier this year warned there could be a deadly summer surge - but that now looks overly pessimistic. Lockdown and social distancing has done most of the hard work in getting infection levels low, but now the vaccines are going to take the load. From the evidence gathered so far, they are more than up to the job in combating the dominant virus in the UK. Early signs are also promising for the variants. Some scientists are even suggesting the UK could be on brink of reaching herd immunity. As always with this virus, it would be foolish to get too far ahead of ourselves. But the signs look very promising. As part of other measures set to be relaxed, the rest of the accommodation sector is to reopen, along with indoor group sports and exercise classes. And up to 30 people are to be allowed to attend weddings, receptions and wakes, as well as funerals. Foreign holidays will also return. On Friday, the government announced that12 destinations would be placed on England's travel green list, meaning anyone returning from those areas will not need to quarantine from 17 May. Monday's announcement of lockdown easing will be stage three of the road map announced by the government in February, with the final stage scheduled for 21 June, when the government hopes to remove all legal restrictions on social contact. Millions of people in England have not been able to sit indoors in a pub since last October 4 monthssince the nationwide shutdown of pubs Longerfor all the people who were living under the toughest tier rules last December Last Octoberfor people in many areas like Greater Manchester, because of tier rules Drink onlyAnd in many areas where indoor drinks were allowed, they had to be drunk with food Each stage has been separated by a gap of several weeks to allow scientists to assess the impact of previous changes, which in stage two included the reopening of non-essential shops and outdoor service in pubs and restaurants. The government has to be satisfied thatits four tests,externalhave been met before progressing to the next stage. These tests rest on the successful rollout of vaccines; evidence that jabs are reducing serious illness and death; infection rates being under control and the risk from coronavirus variants not changing. This video can not be played Catherine Noakes, from the University of Leeds, says we should hug safely The government said the latest data suggested that easing restrictions from 17 May was unlikely to risk a resurgence in infections. It said infection rates were at the lowest level since September 2020 and hospital admissions were continuing to decrease. On Sunday, the UK recorded another two deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and a further 1,770 cases. Mr Johnson said: ""The data reflects what we already knew - we are not going to let this virus beat us. ""The roadmap remains on track, our successful vaccination programme continues - more than two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had the first vaccine - and we can now look forward to unlocking, cautiously but irreversibly."" More than 35.3 million people have received one Covid vaccine dose and 17.6 million people have had both doses. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Prof Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee that advises the government, told the BBC on Sunday that if people hugged their friends every time they see them, it would ""perpetuate an awful lot of additional close contact that could spread the virus"". But she said the risk from grandparents who are fully vaccinated hugging their grandchildren was likely to be low in most cases. The devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions. In Wales, indoor hospitality such as pubs, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums are expected to reopen from 17 May. All tourist accommodation is due to reopen and wedding receptions can have up to 30 people indoors and 50 outdoors. In Scotland from 17 May, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart. More restrictions may be lifted in Northern Ireland on 24 May, including the reopening of indoor hospitality, B&Bs and hotels. Indoor group exercise could resume and wedding receptions and funeral wakes restart. What are your plans for the next stage of lockdown easing on 17 May?

today, thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Weâll
be back tomorrow morning with more updates. In the meantime, you can read more detail on all of today's stories by going to ourhome page. Todayâs coverage
was brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Alexandra Fouche, Jack Hunter, Alex
Kleiderman, Jennifer Meierhans, Richard Morris, Ashitha Nagesh, Emma Owen, Lauren
Turner and Katie Wright. We are going to be bringing our live coverage to a close soon so here's a recap on the main news from the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The governmentâs science advisers â the body known as Sage â
have painted a far more optimistic picture of the months to come than just a
few weeks ago. The crucial shift comes from evidence that vaccines are
significantly cutting the chances of immunised people passing the virus on if
they become ill. The weeks and months to come look far more promising once
that is factored into the equation. A third wave is still anticipated and even the reopening
next Monday is likely to lead to cases starting to rise again. However, Sage â the scientific advisory group for
emergencies â says the next stage of rule relaxing is highly unlikely to put
intense pressure on hospitals. And, while there is uncertainty, any future peaks could be
substantially smaller than the first wave in March last year. There are still key questions that could change the
forecasts, such as: Will immunity wane? What about variants? How much will the summer
weather suppress the virus? How will we behave when the rules are relaxed? Will
we go back to normal or will some of us keep working from home and wear facemasks
even if the rules are relaxed? So these projections will be scrutinised for months to come. Reality Check Earlier the prime minister announced that from Monday we can have our friends over or catch up for a drinkinsidea pub - it's the end of layering up to meet up. But if you'd warmed to the idea of an outdoor gathering, you can open it up to 30 people - the same amount of guests that will soon be allowed to weddings, receptions and other celebrations. Here's what else you'll be able to do from next week and what there is to look forward to after that. There's also been a lot of talk today about the return of hugging. From Monday, it's your choice whether or not to be socially distanced with close family and friends - so if you want to hug each other, you can. ButProf Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee advising the government says it would personally worry her ""if we were advocating we could hug all of our friends every time we meet them again"". Hugging risks spreading coronavirus and there are safer ways of doing it apparently, sohere's some reading up to help you decide whether to hug or not to hug. Pubs, restaurants and cafes in England, Scotland and Wales, will soon be able to serve customers inside again. But things won't quite be back to normal, these are the rules that will still be in place:  Here's a look at the rules in more detail.

It's been quite the marathon. At this point, we're just awaiting results from a handful of Police and Crime Commissioner elections. There are nine more announcements to go, which we're expecting by the end of the day. They're from:  So at this point, we're going to wrap up this live page. Of course, do keep following the BBC News website as these last results are declared - you will find them allhere, along with a breakdown of the results from all the mayoral, council, Scottish and Welsh elections. And any further developments, and analysis of what it all means, can be found onour politics pages. Thank you for joining us. With most of the results from Thursday's polls now in, we can assess what we've learned about the political landscape. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, there is a firm majority for independence in the Scottish Parliament. With the UK government strongly against allowing another referendum, this debate is likely to rumble on - and perhaps become increasingly fractious. Meanwhile, south of the border, the Conservatives are doing well in areas which were once Labour strongholds. The party, which has been in power for 11 years, won the Hartlepool by-election and gained control of 13 councils. The results also indicated that governments across the UK's nations are being rewarded for their handling of the Covid crisis, and that the Leave-Remain divide is still crucial, five years on from the Brexit vote.

Because MPs are elected, they cannot technically resign. Instead, in one of Parliament's many quirks,they must be appointed to a historical crown office.,external So, as Labour's Tracy Brabin can no longer be MP for Batley and Spen, having been elected as mayor of West Yorkshire, there will now be a by-election to fill her seat. She says it's an ""enormous privilege"" to be the first holder of the newly-created mayoralty.  The message from the UK government today has been clear - the focus needs to be rebuilding from the virus. Now is not the time to talk about Scottish independence. One minister, tasked with the morning interview round, said another referendum ""simply isn't on our radar"". Nadine Dorries said it would be both a divisive and expensive distraction. But the SNP is not giving up. It's deputy leader in the House of Commons said it was ""simply nonsense"" to say the party does not have a mandate to hold another referendum. Kirsten Oswald said the party has a ""significant and overwhelming"" case to press ahead when the time is right. Meanwhile Gordon Brown has been setting out his plan to keep the UK intact. He attacked Boris Johnson's ""muscular unionism"" which he said was ""at odds with mainstream Scottish opinion"". Could all this end up in the courts? Find out,here. Downing Street has insisted that Boris Johnson ""transparently declared"" his 2019 holiday to Mustique, amidan investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The prime minister's spokesman told journalists: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" Asked if the government believes the public think the rules matter, the spokesman said: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by businessman David Ross. Mr Ross, a co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, initially said he did not ""pay any monies"" for the trip to the private island of Mustique, in the Caribbean. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister, and Mr Johnson's declaration of a ""benefit in kind"" was ""correct"". Sir Keir is said to have told the meeting: ""To be clear, I take responsibility. Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me."" Labour's new look shadow cabinet has met for the first time after a weekend of recriminations following the election results and the reshuffle. But there was no radical change to the top table other than Rachel Reeves replacing Anneliese Dodds in the shadow chancellor role. Angela Rayner - who's removal from certain jobs in the party has caused outrage on the Labour Left - is back with a beefed up role. And there has been no shortage of advice for Keir Starmer on what Labour needs to do next to stem the tide of losses. The newly re-elected mayor for Great Manchester, Andy Burnham, has urged him to ditch the ""cautious"" approach to policy and back what is right. Addressing party staff this morning, Starmer admitted the results in England were ""profoundly disappointing"". He said he would soon be spelling out his approach to rebuilding the economy and changing a culture that  sets people ""against each other"".   We've had a few more results in for those police and crime commissioners elections. No changes so far today with both Kent and Cumbria sticking with the Conservative candidate while South Yorkshire is held by Labour. Counting is under way in Sussex whereBBC reporter Ben Weisz says,externalone voter apparently rejected all the candidates and instead wrote âJackie Weaverâ -of Handforth council fame- on their ballot. As Labour licks its wounds from last week's election results and the reshuffle upheaval, the Conservatives are keen to demonstrate that they are getting on with the business of government. At 17:00 BST today, the prime minister will hold a press conference in Downing Street, setting out next stage of lifting coronavirus restrictions in England. He's hoping to build on his party's feelgood factor from its election successes by announcing that the lockdown roadmap is on track and people will be able to hug each other from next week. He'll try to bind in the support of the devolved nations with a message that everyone needs to focus on rebuilding from the pandemic - with a message in particular for the SNP that the focus now has to be recovery and not independence. We'll bring you a updates from that Downing Street briefing here, but you can also follow it in more detailin our dedicated Covid live page. The Queen and Prince Charles at the 2019 State Opening of Parliament The Queen's Speech is happening in Parliament tomorrow. It's an opportunity for the government to set out its agenda for the year ahead. Although delivered by the monarch, the speech is written by the government. So what can we expect from this year's speech? Reports have suggested it will contain more than 25 bills, or proposed pieces of legislation, including the much-delayedEnvironment Billon post-Brexit rules for protecting nature, and the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, whichsparked protestsearlier this year. A much-talked about reform of social care could also make an appearance, but it's thought there won't be a specific bill on this yet. There'll also be new plans for England's planning regime, which could yet prove controversial with Conservative backbenchers. Read more about what could be in the speechhere. Former PM Gordon Brown  says Sir Keir Starmer has âgot to be given time and the power and the resourcesâ to âget on with bringing forward new policiesâ.

His responsibilities include setting Cumbria Constabulary's priorities, overseeing its budget and hiring its chief constable. The election was delayed from last year due to the pandemic. You can read the full story here. Jill Mortimer defeated Paul Williams in Hartlepool The defeated Labour candidate in the Hartlepool by-election, Paul Williams, is speaking to Radio 4's The World at One about what went wrong. He says he lost ""with great humility"" because even though it is ""hard to take a defeat like this"" the reality is that ""voters are never wrong"". Labour lost in Hartlepool for two reasons, he says. He believes Labour had a ""credibility gap"" and ""an identity gap"". People expected when they voted Labour in the past that things would improve for then, he adds, but things did not get better and so people blamed the party. He says voters in Hartlepool and across the country do not know who Labour is or what it stands for and the challenge for Sir Keir Starmer is to come up with a policy offer to fill that vision. It's been a busy start to the week, with the fall-out from elections across Britain continuing. If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the day's top political stories: Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The newly, moderately reshuffled shadow cabinet gathered
at midday today in the Boothroyd room of Portcullis House in Parliament after a tumultuous weekend
for the party in the wake of poor election results. Face-to-face meetings are
still relatively rare at Westminster but this was hardly a happy reunion. One
senior frontbencher managed a smile on the way in but wearily said they were just
glad the elections were over. Before the meeting, another described the
situation the party faced as âcatastrophicâ and frustratedly suggested the following infighting had made things worse, giving
voters more reasons not to vote Labour. Sir Keir Starmer welcomed new members of his top team and said his
deputy Angela Rayner had a big new role taking the fight to the Tories, which
an ally of hers said would enable her to perform more to her strengths. But Sir
Keir added that he and nobody else had responsibility for Labourâs results. After some difficult days and public disagreements about the future for Labour, itâs likely there will be more to
come. The SNP's deputy leader in the House of Commons, Kirsten Oswald, is also on the BBC's Politics Live programme. She says that, despite the lack of an overall majority in Holyrood, it is ""simply nonsense"" for the UK government to say that the SNP does not have a mandate to hold another independence referendum. The SNP has won the election with a landslide, she says, giving an ""amazing and strong mandate"" to Nicola Sturgeon. ""There is no way really that you can look at this and say that there isn't a significant and overwhelming mandate for the SNP to go forward and deliver what people voted for us to do,"" she adds. ""That's what democracy is all about. That's what democracy dictates that we should do."" Over the weekend Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said the party had been taken over by ""woke warriors"". Responding to the article, Richard Burgon says woke refers to ""people who are against discrimination"", adding: ""We need to be proud of that and we need to communicate that in a way that doesn't alienate people."" Asked about the Batley and Spen by-election, Burgon warns that: ""If Labour doesn't win in Batley and Spen, Keir will have real problems."" Former home secretary David Blunkett says young people are ""thoughtful and believe in equality"" but says there are people ""who carry things to extremes and start talking about pulling down statues"". ""We've got to disavow those things we think are silly while reaching out to those who want a radical progressive agenda,"" he says. The former shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has been tweeting about her new job. She  says she's determined the party will ""seize every opportunity"" deliver change. Allow Twitter content?

He also suggests the leadership is more interested in ""taking the fight to left activists instead of the government"". Former home secretary David Blunkett accuses Burgon of ""going out of his way to be divisive"" He says the party needs to ""reshape how we address the world of tomorrow, rather than the 70s and 80s"".

"Labour's new shadow cabinet met earlier today for the first time following Kier Starmer's shake-up of his top team Anneliese Dodds is now the Labour Party's chair, with Rachel Reeves taking her old position Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott says she does not want a leadership challenge but calls on Sir Keir to develop a ""winning strategy"" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she could introduce legislation for an independence referendum by next spring But the Scottish Conservatives say Ms Sturgeon is acting beyond her powers PM Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of his Caribbean holiday in late 2019 Richard Morris, Lucy Webster and Emma Owen Nearly there. It's been quite the marathon. At this point, we're just awaiting results from a handful of Police and Crime Commissioner elections. There are nine more announcements to go, which we're expecting by the end of the day. They're from:  So at this point, we're going to wrap up this live page. Of course, do keep following the BBC News website as these last results are declared - you will find them allhere, along with a breakdown of the results from all the mayoral, council, Scottish and Welsh elections. And any further developments, and analysis of what it all means, can be found onour politics pages. Thank you for joining us. With most of the results from Thursday's polls now in, we can assess what we've learned about the political landscape. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, there is a firm majority for independence in the Scottish Parliament. With the UK government strongly against allowing another referendum, this debate is likely to rumble on - and perhaps become increasingly fractious. Meanwhile, south of the border, the Conservatives are doing well in areas which were once Labour strongholds. The party, which has been in power for 11 years, won the Hartlepool by-election and gained control of 13 councils. The results also indicated that governments across the UK's nations are being rewarded for their handling of the Covid crisis, and that the Leave-Remain divide is still crucial, five years on from the Brexit vote.

"Boris Johnson has set out the next stage of lockdown easing for England Pubs and restaurants can serve people inside from next Monday Galleries, theatres, cinemas and soft play centres can also reopen Guidance on hugging will change but people should consider the vulnerabilities of their loved ones, he says People will be able to meet inside in groups of six, or two households Up to 30 people will be allowed to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes The UK chief medical officers earlier lowered the Covid-19 alert level from four to three Zero coronavirus deaths were announced in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday Restrictions are also being eased across Europe, including in Ireland and Spain Edited by Emma Owen Thatâs all from us
today, thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Weâll
be back tomorrow morning with more updates. In the meantime, you can read more detail on all of today's stories by going to ourhome page. Todayâs coverage
was brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Alexandra Fouche, Jack Hunter, Alex
Kleiderman, Jennifer Meierhans, Richard Morris, Ashitha Nagesh, Emma Owen, Lauren
Turner and Katie Wright. We are going to be bringing our live coverage to a close soon so here's a recap on the main news from the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The governmentâs science advisers â the body known as Sage â
have painted a far more optimistic picture of the months to come than just a
few weeks ago. The crucial shift comes from evidence that vaccines are
significantly cutting the chances of immunised people passing the virus on if
they become ill. The weeks and months to come look far more promising once
that is factored into the equation. A third wave is still anticipated and even the reopening
next Monday is likely to lead to cases starting to rise again. However, Sage â the scientific advisory group for
emergencies â says the next stage of rule relaxing is highly unlikely to put
intense pressure on hospitals. And, while there is uncertainty, any future peaks could be
substantially smaller than the first wave in March last year. There are still key questions that could change the
forecasts, such as: Will immunity wane? What about variants? How much will the summer
weather suppress the virus? How will we behave when the rules are relaxed? Will
we go back to normal or will some of us keep working from home and wear facemasks
even if the rules are relaxed? So these projections will be scrutinised for months to come. Reality Check Earlier the prime minister announced that from Monday we can have our friends over or catch up for a drinkinsidea pub - it's the end of layering up to meet up. But if you'd warmed to the idea of an outdoor gathering, you can open it up to 30 people - the same amount of guests that will soon be allowed to weddings, receptions and other celebrations. Here's what else you'll be able to do from next week and what there is to look forward to after that. There's also been a lot of talk today about the return of hugging. From Monday, it's your choice whether or not to be socially distanced with close family and friends - so if you want to hug each other, you can. ButProf Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee advising the government says it would personally worry her ""if we were advocating we could hug all of our friends every time we meet them again"". Hugging risks spreading coronavirus and there are safer ways of doing it apparently, sohere's some reading up to help you decide whether to hug or not to hug. Pubs, restaurants and cafes in England, Scotland and Wales, will soon be able to serve customers inside again. But things won't quite be back to normal, these are the rules that will still be in place:  Here's a look at the rules in more detail. Earlier we brought you the UK's latest coronavirus data which showed that another four deaths had been reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Looking closer at those reported figures, four of them were recorded in Wales, meaning there wereno coronavirus deaths announced in England, Scotland and Northern Irelandtoday. Take a look at the UK's latest figures in the charts below. The World Health Organization briefing also heard that the world is seeing a levelling off in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths. Numbers are declining in most areas, including the Americas and Europe, the worst-hit regions. ""But itâs an unacceptably high plateau, with more than 5.4 million reported COVID-19 cases and almost 90,000 deaths last week,"" the WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the briefing. He said a global disparity in who can access vaccines remains one of the biggest obstacles to ending the pandemic. The new coronavirus variant known as B.1.617, first detected in India, is a variant of global concern, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, told a briefing that it may have increased transmissibility. The variant continues to tear through India,where infections and deaths came  close to record daily highs on Monday. The variant has three lineages, of which B.1.617.2 is the fastest growing. At the UK government's Covid briefing today, England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said that variant was a concern and officials were keeping a close eye on it. ""Our view is that this is a highly transmissible variant... [but] at this point in time, our view is it is less likely to be
able to escape vaccination than some of the other variants,"" he
said. Here's what we know about the India Covid variant. Wembley last hosted the Champions League final in 2013 Portugal has emerged asa strong candidate to host this season's Champions League final later this monthafter Uefa did not gain guarantees of the coronavirus exemptions it wants to move the game to Wembley. Uefa, UK government officials and the Football Association met earlier today to discuss moving the game between Chelsea and Manchester City from Istanbul. Uefa has decided it will be moved after Turkey was put on England'sred travel listwhich the government says means fans cannot travel. Portugal is on the green list so fans from England would be allowed to attend on 29 May. Travellers from England to green-list countries will be required to take Covid tests before and after travel but do not have to quarantine on their return. The match could still be played at Wembley but it would require a major shift from the government, who have so far failed to reach an agreement with Uefa. European football's governing body feels in Portugal it is going to be easier to gain access for sponsors and broadcasters, who would need to be compensated if they were unable to attend the game. Porto has been mentioned as a potential venue but it is understood Lisbon, which hosted last year's final, is also a possibility. We've got more on Scotland's foreign travel traffic light system which is expected to come into effect on 24 May. Earlier, the BBC was told that people in Scotland will be able to travel to some foreign destinations without the need to quarantine on their return. Countries are to be classified as green, amber and red and a review will take place every four weeks, the BBC understands. The Scottish government says a Covid briefing will take place on Tuesday and it would not comment on reports. But if it's similar to England's traffic light system, here's how it could work. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring Russia is aiming to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 by September, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko has said. When asked on about the country's vaccine rollout, Murashko said it was progressing ""as planned"" and insisted that Russia's target for collective immunity will be met,the Interfax news agency reported.,external This comes despite Russia's slow start to its vaccination campaign with official figures showing that by 6 May only 13.4 million people had received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 9.4 million had received both. Russia's vaccine rollout has been affected by some public scepticism, polls suggest This is some way off the target of vaccinating 70% of the
adult population by the end of the summer,initially given by President Vladimir Putin in March.,external Russia's rollout has been affected by some public scepticism
of vaccines as independent pollster Levada Centre suggested that in February only
30% of Russians were willing to receive the Sputnik V vaccine - the country's
most widely used jab. The coronavirus
data supports the decision to continue to ease lockdown restrictions in England,
according to the new shadow leader of the House of Commons. Responding to the announcements unveiled at the Downing Street news conference, Thangam Debbonaire says she is looking forward to the prospect of hugging loved ones again and visiting people
in their homes. However she adds that people still âneed to exercise cautionâ. Being able to reopen indoors from next week is âgreat
newsâ for the hospitality industry which has âgone through such a lotâ, she
adds. Asked whether the country should open up
sooner than the government's roadmap, she says we need to wait to see the data once restrictions have eased further
to find out whether there has been an impact. âThereâs no denying
that everybody must be looking forward to things getting better and opening up
this summer,"" she says. This video can not be played Boris Johnson warns not to 'throw caution to the wind' Despite confirming that hugging relatives and friends from different households will be allowed from Monday, the Prime Minister urged people to remain cautious. Speaking at the Covid briefing, Boris Johnson warned that ""this does not mean we should throw caution to the wind"", and hugging is still a main way that the virus can spread. Meeting outdoors is still safer, he added, and encouraged opening windows while meeting indoors. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmedthe third stage of England's roadmap out of lockdownwill go ahead on 17 May - next Monday. In a significant step towards normality after off-and-on restrictions for more than a year:  Read morehere. Helen CattPolitical correspondent So Step three is going ahead; that's been expected for a while now. The updating of guidance to say we can have physical contact with friends and family again - even if caution was very much the word - also means life should feel a bit more normal from next week. There were several hints in this news conference that seemed to suggest the Prime Minister is reasonably confident that Step four is also likely to happen from 21 June too, although once again he resisted any temptation to suggest that date could be brought forward. He did promise though more information this month to help businesses prepare and there is the start of a shift in tone to letting people make up their own mind about how best to protect themselves. However, both he and the scientists stressed that next week marks a particularly big step. The discussion of the India variant and situations which ""can come out of a blue sky"" mean that there is still a heavy dose of caution to all this. The ""stay in the UK"" restriction will lift from Monday and people will be able to travel to
green-list countries, the PM confirmed during the Downing Street press conference. But he urged caution
and stresses that we must remain vigilant to unexpected changes in the data, and
the spread of new variants. To ensure our progress through the roadmap continues to be irreversible, he says people must continue to follow the rules, remember ""hands, face, space, fresh
air"", and come forward to get the vaccine when called. Before the PM was able to announce the lifting of further coronavirus restrictions had had to get approval from his cabinet. MPs reviewed the latest data which shows infection rates are at their lowest level since last September, and deaths and hospitalisations are at their lowest level since last July. They were also told that more than two thirds of all adults across the UK have been vaccinated, with more than 18 million people having received their second dose. And in light of the most recent data, the four UK chief medical officers had confirmed that the UK Covid-19 alert level should move from level four to level three. The changes to lockdown restrictions were approved by Cabinet at a meeting earlier today. The prime minister answered questions from the public and journalists at the briefing Now the prime
minister is asked whether it would be irresponsible for Scotland to hold a
second referendum during this stage of the pandemic. Boris Johnson says
he had good conversations with the heads of the devolved nations and everyoneâs
number one priority was to come out of the pandemic and ""build back better"". Prof Chris Whitty
is asked about the threat of one of the Indian variants in the UK. He says cases
of it have gone up sharply and thatâs a ""reason to be very careful about it"". ""What we know with all the variants is that
things can come out of the blue sky - youâre not expecting it and then it can happen."" He adds that at
this point in time âour view is that this is a highly transmissible variantâ
but it is less likely to be able to escape vaccination, although the data is
incomplete. Sir Patrick Vallance joined the PM at the briefing Jason Groves from the Daily Mail asks if this is potentially the last lockdown we see, bar any new ""terrible variant"" because of the vaccination programme. He asks if people should expect to continue working from home in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""this is a big step forward"" and there will be ""many many more people vaccinated"" this time around, but it is important that ""we don't get ahead of ourselves"". ""Everything is pointing in the direction"" that the vaccines are reducing infection rates. Boris Johnson says the more people can communicate remotely, the more reasons they find to meet face to face. He says he is ""pretty certain that eventually our town centres are going to be full of bustle, full of people who want to interact again"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Labour's new shadow cabinet met earlier today for the first time following Kier Starmer's shake-up of his top team Anneliese Dodds is now the Labour Party's chair, with Rachel Reeves taking her old position Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott says she does not want a leadership challenge but calls on Sir Keir to develop a ""winning strategy"" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she could introduce legislation for an independence referendum by next spring But the Scottish Conservatives say Ms Sturgeon is acting beyond her powers PM Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of his Caribbean holiday in late 2019 Richard Morris, Lucy Webster and Emma Owen Nearly there. It's been quite the marathon. At this point, we're just awaiting results from a handful of Police and Crime Commissioner elections. There are nine more announcements to go, which we're expecting by the end of the day. They're from:  So at this point, we're going to wrap up this live page. Of course, do keep following the BBC News website as these last results are declared - you will find them allhere, along with a breakdown of the results from all the mayoral, council, Scottish and Welsh elections. And any further developments, and analysis of what it all means, can be found onour politics pages. Thank you for joining us. With most of the results from Thursday's polls now in, we can assess what we've learned about the political landscape. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, there is a firm majority for independence in the Scottish Parliament. With the UK government strongly against allowing another referendum, this debate is likely to rumble on - and perhaps become increasingly fractious. Meanwhile, south of the border, the Conservatives are doing well in areas which were once Labour strongholds. The party, which has been in power for 11 years, won the Hartlepool by-election and gained control of 13 councils. The results also indicated that governments across the UK's nations are being rewarded for their handling of the Covid crisis, and that the Leave-Remain divide is still crucial, five years on from the Brexit vote. Read more on these elections' key lessons. We're nearing the end of our live coverage of the election results, so here's a simple catch-up, in pictures, of  the long weekend of counting. The Utilita Arena in Birmingham was given over to counting votes Waiting for results can be a hungry business Count Binface failed in his bid to become London's mayor And in Wales, Captain Beany (left) didn't manage to take Mark Drakeford's seat in the Welsh Parliament SNP candidate for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, Karen Adam was more successful. As was Sadiq Khan, seen here at the signing in ceremony at the Globe Theatre Boris Johnson returned to Hartlepool to celebrate his party's victory in the by-election Despite briefings that Keir Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, had fallen out after he removed her as Labour Party chair, they've been spotted together in Parliament's Portcullis House.

Because MPs are elected, they cannot technically resign. Instead, in one of Parliament's many quirks,they must be appointed to a historical crown office.,external So, as Labour's Tracy Brabin can no longer be MP for Batley and Spen, having been elected as mayor of West Yorkshire, there will now be a by-election to fill her seat. She says it's an ""enormous privilege"" to be the first holder of the newly-created mayoralty.  The message from the UK government today has been clear - the focus needs to be rebuilding from the virus. Now is not the time to talk about Scottish independence. One minister, tasked with the morning interview round, said another referendum ""simply isn't on our radar"". Nadine Dorries said it would be both a divisive and expensive distraction. But the SNP is not giving up. It's deputy leader in the House of Commons said it was ""simply nonsense"" to say the party does not have a mandate to hold another referendum. Kirsten Oswald said the party has a ""significant and overwhelming"" case to press ahead when the time is right. Meanwhile Gordon Brown has been setting out his plan to keep the UK intact. He attacked Boris Johnson's ""muscular unionism"" which he said was ""at odds with mainstream Scottish opinion"". Could all this end up in the courts? Find out,here. Downing Street has insisted that Boris Johnson ""transparently declared"" his 2019 holiday to Mustique, amidan investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The prime minister's spokesman told journalists: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" Asked if the government believes the public think the rules matter, the spokesman said: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by businessman David Ross. Mr Ross, a co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, initially said he did not ""pay any monies"" for the trip to the private island of Mustique, in the Caribbean. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister, and Mr Johnson's declaration of a ""benefit in kind"" was ""correct"". Sir Keir is said to have told the meeting: ""To be clear, I take responsibility. Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me."" Labour's new look shadow cabinet has met for the first time after a weekend of recriminations following the election results and the reshuffle. But there was no radical change to the top table other than Rachel Reeves replacing Anneliese Dodds in the shadow chancellor role. Angela Rayner - who's removal from certain jobs in the party has caused outrage on the Labour Left - is back with a beefed up role. And there has been no shortage of advice for Keir Starmer on what Labour needs to do next to stem the tide of losses. The newly re-elected mayor for Great Manchester, Andy Burnham, has urged him to ditch the ""cautious"" approach to policy and back what is right. Addressing party staff this morning, Starmer admitted the results in England were ""profoundly disappointing"". He said he would soon be spelling out his approach to rebuilding the economy and changing a culture that  sets people ""against each other"".   We've had a few more results in for those police and crime commissioners elections. No changes so far today with both Kent and Cumbria sticking with the Conservative candidate while South Yorkshire is held by Labour. Counting is under way in Sussex whereBBC reporter Ben Weisz says,externalone voter apparently rejected all the candidates and instead wrote âJackie Weaverâ -of Handforth council fame- on their ballot. As Labour licks its wounds from last week's election results and the reshuffle upheaval, the Conservatives are keen to demonstrate that they are getting on with the business of government. At 17:00 BST today, the prime minister will hold a press conference in Downing Street, setting out next stage of lifting coronavirus restrictions in England. He's hoping to build on his party's feelgood factor from its election successes by announcing that the lockdown roadmap is on track and people will be able to hug each other from next week. He'll try to bind in the support of the devolved nations with a message that everyone needs to focus on rebuilding from the pandemic - with a message in particular for the SNP that the focus now has to be recovery and not independence. We'll bring you a updates from that Downing Street briefing here, but you can also follow it in more detailin our dedicated Covid live page. The Queen and Prince Charles at the 2019 State Opening of Parliament The Queen's Speech is happening in Parliament tomorrow. It's an opportunity for the government to set out its agenda for the year ahead. Although delivered by the monarch, the speech is written by the government. So what can we expect from this year's speech? Reports have suggested it will contain more than 25 bills, or proposed pieces of legislation, including the much-delayedEnvironment Billon post-Brexit rules for protecting nature, and the controversial Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, whichsparked protestsearlier this year. A much-talked about reform of social care could also make an appearance, but it's thought there won't be a specific bill on this yet. There'll also be new plans for England's planning regime, which could yet prove controversial with Conservative backbenchers. Read more about what could be in the speechhere. Former PM Gordon Brown  says Sir Keir Starmer has âgot to be given time and the power and the resourcesâ to âget on with bringing forward new policiesâ. He told BBC Scotland editor Sarah Smith the leader has âgot to get out there, as he wants to do it, and listen to the peopleâ.

It was the only contest to be held in the county in last week's bumper crop of elections. His responsibilities include setting Cumbria Constabulary's priorities, overseeing its budget and hiring its chief constable. The election was delayed from last year due to the pandemic. You can read the full story here. Jill Mortimer defeated Paul Williams in Hartlepool The defeated Labour candidate in the Hartlepool by-election, Paul Williams, is speaking to Radio 4's The World at One about what went wrong. He says he lost ""with great humility"" because even though it is ""hard to take a defeat like this"" the reality is that ""voters are never wrong"". Labour lost in Hartlepool for two reasons, he says. He believes Labour had a ""credibility gap"" and ""an identity gap"". People expected when they voted Labour in the past that things would improve for then, he adds, but things did not get better and so people blamed the party. He says voters in Hartlepool and across the country do not know who Labour is or what it stands for and the challenge for Sir Keir Starmer is to come up with a policy offer to fill that vision. It's been a busy start to the week, with the fall-out from elections across Britain continuing. If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the day's top political stories: Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The newly, moderately reshuffled shadow cabinet gathered
at midday today in the Boothroyd room of Portcullis House in Parliament after a tumultuous weekend
for the party in the wake of poor election results. Face-to-face meetings are
still relatively rare at Westminster but this was hardly a happy reunion. One
senior frontbencher managed a smile on the way in but wearily said they were just
glad the elections were over. Before the meeting, another described the
situation the party faced as âcatastrophicâ and frustratedly suggested the following infighting had made things worse, giving
voters more reasons not to vote Labour. Sir Keir Starmer welcomed new members of his top team and said his
deputy Angela Rayner had a big new role taking the fight to the Tories, which
an ally of hers said would enable her to perform more to her strengths. But Sir
Keir added that he and nobody else had responsibility for Labourâs results. After some difficult days and public disagreements about the future for Labour, itâs likely there will be more to
come. The SNP's deputy leader in the House of Commons, Kirsten Oswald, is also on the BBC's Politics Live programme. She says that, despite the lack of an overall majority in Holyrood, it is ""simply nonsense"" for the UK government to say that the SNP does not have a mandate to hold another independence referendum. The SNP has won the election with a landslide, she says, giving an ""amazing and strong mandate"" to Nicola Sturgeon. ""There is no way really that you can look at this and say that there isn't a significant and overwhelming mandate for the SNP to go forward and deliver what people voted for us to do,"" she adds. ""That's what democracy is all about. That's what democracy dictates that we should do."" Over the weekend Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said the party had been taken over by ""woke warriors"". Responding to the article, Richard Burgon says woke refers to ""people who are against discrimination"", adding: ""We need to be proud of that and we need to communicate that in a way that doesn't alienate people."" Asked about the Batley and Spen by-election, Burgon warns that: ""If Labour doesn't win in Batley and Spen, Keir will have real problems."" Former home secretary David Blunkett says young people are ""thoughtful and believe in equality"" but says there are people ""who carry things to extremes and start talking about pulling down statues"". ""We've got to disavow those things we think are silly while reaching out to those who want a radical progressive agenda,"" he says. The former shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has been tweeting about her new job. She  says she's determined the party will ""seize every opportunity"" deliver change. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC's Politics Live, former shadow minister Richard Burgon says the election results are ""very upsetting"" and that it is ""unfair"" to place responsibility for the defeats on Angela Rayner. He says the party leader needs to ""change direction"" instead of ""rearranging the deck chairs"". He also suggests the leadership is more interested in ""taking the fight to left activists instead of the government"". Former home secretary David Blunkett accuses Burgon of ""going out of his way to be divisive"" He says the party needs to ""reshape how we address the world of tomorrow, rather than the 70s and 80s"".

"Doug Beattie, a retired Army captain, said he was the right person to be able to ""rekindle the fortunes"" of the UUP Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie has put his name forward to be the next leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). The party has begun the process of appointing a new leader after Steve Aiken announced his resignation. Mr Aiken said the party was ""not breaking through"" and had ""not been working as well as it should be"". Mr Beattie, a retired Army captain, said he was the right person to ""rekindle the fortunes"" of the UUP and give a clear vision for the future. He told BBC Newsline he would have a different style and would be ""able to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity"". Mr Beattie, who was elected MLA for Upper Bann in 2016, said people underestimated Mr Aiken, whom he described as a strong unionist with liberal views. ""I share [those views] with him,"" he added. ""Maybe the presentation might be slightly different and maybe we have to work on how we get our message out to people."" Mr Beattie said the Northern Ireland Protocol, the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland which places a border in the Irish Sea, must be replaced. This video can not be played Unionism needs to get its act together - Steve Aiken He said it was damaging to the Good Friday Agreement but the party had an alternative ready to go. ""I do not want a hardened border on the island of Ireland. But neither do I want a border in the Irish Sea,"" Mr Beattie said. Earlier, outgoing leader Mr Aiken said unionism needed to ""get its act together"" and there was now a time for reflection. Mr Aiken will remain in charge temporarily until his successor is found. A virtual meeting of the party's ruling executive will be held on Tuesday night to discuss the leadership process. Mr Aiken has been in charge since November 2019. Steve Aiken told a press conference in Stormont that the UUP had ""not been working as well as it should be"" Mr Aiken said the UUP continued to do what was right not only for unionists but for all in Northern Ireland. He said his resignation as party leader was a ""bittersweet moment"". ""I am, however, self-aware enough to realise that our party, despite our strengths, is not breaking through,"" he said. ""I am also very aware of my limitations. And despite the successes over the last 19 months, I realise that a change of leadership is needed."" Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie (right) has been tipped as a possible successor to Mr Aiken (left) Mr Aiken said the UUP was a team in which all parts needed to work effectively. ""Quite frankly, it hasn't been working as well as it should be. That is down to me,"" he said. ""Rather than being the perceived problem, I want to be part of the solution."" Party chairman Danny Kennedy thanked Mr Aiken for his leadership, describing him as a ""dedicated Ulster Unionist"". No happy birthday as unionism loses another leader Steve Aiken resigns as Ulster Unionist leader From submariner to Stormont party leader Lagan Valley assembly member Robbie Butler, who is the party's chief whip, has also been mentioned as a possible contender. Party chairman Danny Kennedy (left) described Mr Aiken as a ""dedicated Ulster Unionist"" In his letter of resignation, Mr Aiken said he had taken the party as far as he could. He said it had been a ""privilege to lead in these difficult and trying times"" and he took pride in the party's decision to take on the challenging health minister portfolio when Stormont was restored in 2020. His departure follows theresignation of Arlene Foster as DUP leader and first ministerafter an internal revolt. More than 20 DUP NI Assembly members and four MPs signed a letter voicing no-confidence in her leadership.

"Council leaders from across the political divide in England are urging ministers to make good their promise to ""fix social care"" by setting out plans in Tuesday's Queen's Speech. The Local Government Association has sent a cross-party letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, saying failure to act now would be ""a bitter blow"". The government says improving social care ""remains a priority"". The promise was made by Boris Johnsonon his first day as prime minister. Ministers have previously saidplans will be brought forward this yearand, when quizzed, have maintained that cross-party agreement on social care reform will be vital - the LGA's letter shows that at work. It comes amid increasing concern that long-promised reform will only get the briefest of mentions in the Queen's Speech, where the government sets out its legislative programme for the coming year. Queen's Speech 2021: What can we expect? Put councils in 'driving seat' to fix social care Why more people are talking about social care In the letter, council leaders from across the political spectrum call on the government to put the reform and funding of the adult care system at the centre of its thinking on how we emerge from the pandemic. Local authorities fund many care services and they want investment which moves the system from being based around care homes and hospitals, to one which focuses on prevention and community support. The letter says reform needs to pool the risk of having high care costs after developing a condition such as dementia, with funding provided through taxation or a social-care premium. It argues that this is an investment in people, rather than ""a cost that is too difficult or too high"". It urges the government to: invest in a care model which supports people to live independently in their own homes and communities end ""unsustainable"", one-off, ""sticking plaster"" solutions find a long-term way of bringing more money into social care ""All of us in local government, across the political divide, want to see the Queen's Speech finally set out the plans we have been waiting for,"" said LGA Chairman James Jamieson. ""This is about an investment in people, in all of us. ""A failure to act will be a bitter blow to everyone connected to social care."" The pandemic has increased pressure on an already fragile care system, which provides support for older and disabled people in care homes and in their own homes. Residential and nursing homes saw a particularly high number of deaths in the first wave of Covid-19. The pandemic also highlighted existing problems, such as the low pay and long hours of care staff in a sector that struggles to recruit enough workers. A government spokesperson said: ""Improving the adult social care system remains a priority for this government and we are committed to ensuring every person receives care that provides the dignity they deserve. ""Throughout the pandemic we have provided almost Â£1.8bn in specific funding for adult social care including infection prevention and control measures. ""We've also provided free PPE and additional testing and prioritised health and care workers for the vaccine."" 'I struggled to go into the rooms of people who died' Care home Covid deaths 'like losing family' The LGA letter coincides with polling for a care charity which suggests there is public support for greater focus on social care by government. Researchers for MHA, which runs care homes and community services, questioned just over 2,000 UK adults online and, of these, found: 69% wanted social care to be the government's top priority 43% felt the government did not care about the needs of older people MHA chief executive Sam Monaghan said the devastating effect of Covid-19 on care homes had made people question ""what's important and the kind of society we want to be"". ""What we now need is decisive action from government... ""We have a growing population of older people who deserve respect and certainty for the future."" Fiona Carragher, director of research at Alzheimer's Society, called on the government ""to completely overhaul our social care system"". She said she wanted to see ""free, personalised care... on an equal footing with the NHS"", together with plans to develop a workforce with the skills ""to deliver the best care"" for people with dementia.

"A cyber-criminal gang that took a major US fuel pipeline offline over the weekend has acknowledged the incident in a public statement. ""Our goal is to make money and not creating problems for society,"" DarkSide wrote on its website. The US issued emergency legislation on Sunday after Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware cyber-attack. The pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day - 45% of the East Coast's supply of diesel, petrol and jet fuel. The operator took itself offline on Friday after the cyber-attack. Work to restore service is continuing. How did cyber-attackers shut off a US pipeline? The ransomware surge ruining lives Travelex being held to ransom by hackers On Monday, the FBI officially confirmed that DarkSide was responsible for compromising Colonial Pipeline's networks, saying that it was continuing to work with the firm and other government agencies on the investigation. During a speech about the economy at the White House on Monday, US President Joe Biden said that he was being ""personally briefed"" on the situation with the pipeline each day. US President Joe Biden answers questions about the fuel pipeline cyber-attack during a speech about the economy at the White House ""The agencies across the government have acted quickly to mitigate any impact on our fuel supply,"" he said. ""We're prepared to take additional steps depending on how quickly the company is able to bring its pipeline back up to capacity."" A number of cyber-security researchers, including firms contacted by the BBC, have speculated that the cyber-criminal gang could be Russian, as their software avoids encrypting any computer systems where the language is set as Russian. Mr Biden said that the US government was concerned about this aspect of the cyber-attack. ""I'm gonna be meeting with President Putin and so far there is no evidence, based on our intelligence people, that Russia is involved,"" he said. ""Although, there's evidence that the actors' ransomware is in Russia - they have some responsibility to deal with this."" DarkSide posted a statement on its website on Monday, describing itself as ""apolitical"". The Colonial Pipeline carries 2.5 million barrels a day ""We do not participate in geopolitics, do not need to tie us with a defined government and look for... our motives,"" the group said. The group also indicated it had not been aware that Colonial was being targeted by one of its affiliates, saying: ""From today, we introduce moderation and check each company that our partners want to encrypt to avoid social consequences in the future."" US fuel prices at the pump rose six cents per gallon on the week to $2.967 per gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, the American Automobile Association (AAA) said on Monday, while Wall Street shares in US energy firms were up 1.5%. The AAA said prices were heading towards their highest level since 2014. On Sunday, the US governmentrelaxed rules on fuel being transported by road,externalto minimise disruption to supply. This allowed drivers in 18 states to work extra or more flexible hours when transporting refined petroleum products. However, there are fears that this could change if the shutdown is prolonged. Independent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC a lot of fuel was now stranded at refineries in Texas. ""Unless they sort it out by Tuesday, they're in big trouble,"" said Mr Sharma. ""The first areas to be hit would be Atlanta and Tennessee, then the domino effect goes up to New York."" He said oil futures traders were now ""scrambling"" to meet demand, at a time when US inventories are declining. Demand - especially for fuel for cars - is on the rise as consumers return to the roads and the economy recovers. The temporary waiver issued by the Department of Transportation enables oil products to be shipped in tankers up to New York, but this would not be anywhere near enough to match the pipeline's capacity, Mr Sharma warned. Sources said the ransomware attack was likely to have been caused by a cyber-criminal gang called DarkSide, who infiltrated Colonial's network and locked the data on some computers and servers, demanding a ransom on Friday. The gang stole almost 100 gigabytes of data hostage, threatening to leak it onto the internet. The FBI and other government agencies worked with private companies to respond - the cloud computing system the hackers used to collect the stolen data was taken offline on Saturday, Reuters reported. On Sunday, Colonial said that although its four main pipelines remained offline, some smaller lines between terminals and delivery points were now operational. ""Quickly after learning of the attack, Colonial proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat. These actions temporarily halted all pipeline operations and affected some of our IT systems, which we are actively in the process of restoring,""the firm said,external. It added it would bring its full system back online ""only when we believe it is safe to do so, and in full compliance with the approval of all federal regulations"". An example of a DarkSide ransomware notice that appears on victims' computer screens The incident highlightsthe risk ransomware can pose to critical national industrial infrastructure,external, not just businesses. In addition to a notice on their computer screens, victims of a DarkSide attack receive an information pack informing them that their computers and servers are encrypted. The gang lists all the types of data it has stolen, and sends victims the URL of a ""personal leak page"" where the data is already loaded, waiting to be automatically published, should the company or organisation not pay before the deadline is up. DarkSide also tells victims it will provide proof of the data it has obtained, and is prepared to delete all of it from the victim's network. According to Digital Shadows, a London-based cyber-security firm,DarkSide operates like a business,external. A redacted screenshot of DarkSide's website on the dark web details its success in attacking a large US manufacturer The gang develops the software used to encrypt and steal data from companies. It then provides ransomware to ""affiliates"" who pay DarkSide a percentage of their earnings from any successful attacks. When it released new software in March that could encrypt data faster than before, the gang issued a press release and invited journalists to interview it. It even has a website on the dark web where it lists all the companies it has hacked and what was stolen, and an ""ethics"" page where it says which organisations it will not attack. DarkSide also works with ""access brokers"" - nefarious hackers who work to harvest the login details for as many working user accounts on various services as they can find. Rather than break into these accounts and alert users or the service providers, these brokers sit on the usernames and passwords and sell them off to the highest bidders - cyber-criminal gangs who want to use them to carry out much larger crimes. Digital Shadows thinks the Colonial attack was helped by the coronavirus pandemic, with more engineers remotely accessing control systems for the pipeline from home. James Chappell, co-founder of Digital Shadows, believes DarkSide could have bought account login details for remote desktop software such as TeamViewer and Microsoft Remote Desktop. DarkSide's website on the dark web details its achievements and sets out ""ethics"" of sorts He says it is possible for anyone to look up the login portals for computers connected to the internet on search engines like Shodan, and then ""have-a-go"" hackers just keep trying usernames and passwords until they get some to work. ""We're seeing a lot of victims now, this is seriously a big problem,"" said Mr Chappell. ""The amount of small businesses that are falling victim to this... It's becoming a big problem for the economy globally."" Digital Shadows' research shows the cyber-criminal gang is likely to be based in a Russian-speaking country, as it avoids attacking companies in post-Soviet states including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.

"Counting was held across Scotland for two days after Thursday's election As the dust settles after a marathon two-day count and the winners prepare for life at Holyrood, we look at the facts and figures behind the story of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. The SNP has been handed a fresh five-year term in government at Holyrood, theirfourthin a row. By the time it is up in 2026, the party will have been in government for19 years- and Nicola Sturgeon may be asking for votes from people who were born after she first entered government. The proportional representation system used for Holyrood elections essentially did its job of producing a parliament which roughly mirrors the way people voted as a whole across Scotland. The SNP took just underhalf of the vote, and won just underhalf of the seatsin parliament. Nicola Sturgeon has been handed a fresh five-year term in government at Holyrood The Conservatives took23.5%of the ""peach party vote"" they based much of their campaigning on, and were rewarded with24%of the seats. Labour meanwhile had19%of the regional list vote and17%of the seats, while the Greens got8%of the vote and6%of the seats. The Lib Dems took all four of their seats from constituency contests, but still based on list tallies across Scotland ended up with3%of the seats from5%of the vote. This has been an election where not much has changed - onlythreeof the 73 constituencies changed hands, compared to 18 in 2016. Ranking the results by how narrow the winning margin was, there were16seats with a single-digit majority - generally considered a ""marginal"" seat. This is the same number as there were before the election, and indeed 10 of them are the very same seats. We may spend election night in 2026 talking about Eastwood, Aberdeenshire West and Dumbarton all over again. The difference is that after 2016, nine of the 10 most marginal seats were SNP targets. Now, onlythreeare - and they are defending the other seven. It may seem an obvious point given they now hold the lion's share of constituencies, but there are fewer easy targets for Nicola Sturgeon's party in future - and far more wobbly seats to defend, including the country's most marginal in Ayr which they won by just170votes. As previously, these close contests are mostly SNP-Conservative affairs. Labour was not in second place in a single constituency with a single-digit majority before the election, and they only have one now - East Lothian, the seat they lost to the SNP. This means there is little in the way of obvious target seats for Anas Sarwar to start building towards challenging in 2026. One striking change between the 2016 and 2021 results was that in Shetland - which has gone from the safest seat in Scotland, with a 44.3% majority to the ninth most marginal, with a cushion of just6.8%. These figures exclude the fact there wasa by-election midway throughthe term, but it is still a big shift in a Lib Dem stronghold. The safest seat now belongs to Shona Robison in Dundee City East with a41.4%majority - with her Dundee City West neighbour Joe Fitzpatrick in second spot on40.2%. Anas Sarwar now has few obvious target seats for Labour at the next election Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has also constructed something of a fortress in Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, with the biggest majority in terms of raw votes -15,861of them. Perhaps the rise of tactical voting in this election means we need a new way to talk about ""safe"" seats, though. Contests have increasingly become a race between the SNP and whichever other party is best placed locally to challenge them. On that front, there were29seats where the SNP won more than 50% of the vote - so much that even if the opposition clubbed together and backed one candidate, they would still not win. The Conservatives only hadoneseat with a margin this wide - Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire - and Labour had none. Oddly though, the smallest party, the Lib Dems, hadthree. And their fourth seat was not far behind, on 48.6%. They seem to have become the party of extremes, because they also lost their deposit in50of the 73 constituencies, by polling under 5% of the vote. Kate Forbes' seat in Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch had the biggest majority in terms of raw votes While nothing much has changed in the makeup of the parliament, the existing parties rather entrenched their positions. There was a lot of talk of smaller parties during the campaign, with Alex Salmond launching the Alba Party to great fanfare, but ultimately they barely made a dent in the figures with1.7%of the regional ballot. George Galloway's All for Unity group similarly flopped, managing0.9%of the vote. And UKIP - now dedicated to shutting down Holyrood - secured just 3,848 list votes,0.1%of the 2.7m cast around Scotland - and behind the rather more bluntly-titled Abolish the Scottish Parliament Party on0.3%. With turnout high and social distancing in place, some Scots - including Patrick Harvie - had to queue outside polling stations One of the big stories across Scotland was how many people came out to vote. Turnout hit a record high for a Holyrood election, at63.2%. It was up in every single constituency, and indeed at least half of the registered electorate took part in every seat. It was over 60% in54of the 73 constituencies, and over 70% in four. The overall figure is ten points up on the average of the five previous Holyrood elections, and well in advance of the previous high of 59% in 1999. However it still lags behind the levels recorded in recent general elections north of the border - turnout was 68.1% for the Westminster election in December 2019 - and a good way off the massive engagement in the 2014 referendum, which was 84.6%.

today, thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Weâll
be back tomorrow morning with more updates. In the meantime, you can read more detail on all of today's stories by going to ourhome page. Todayâs coverage
was brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Alexandra Fouche, Jack Hunter, Alex
Kleiderman, Jennifer Meierhans, Richard Morris, Ashitha Nagesh, Emma Owen, Lauren
Turner and Katie Wright. We are going to be bringing our live coverage to a close soon so here's a recap on the main news from the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The governmentâs science advisers â the body known as Sage â
have painted a far more optimistic picture of the months to come than just a
few weeks ago. The crucial shift comes from evidence that vaccines are
significantly cutting the chances of immunised people passing the virus on if
they become ill. The weeks and months to come look far more promising once
that is factored into the equation. A third wave is still anticipated and even the reopening
next Monday is likely to lead to cases starting to rise again. However, Sage â the scientific advisory group for
emergencies â says the next stage of rule relaxing is highly unlikely to put
intense pressure on hospitals. And, while there is uncertainty, any future peaks could be
substantially smaller than the first wave in March last year. There are still key questions that could change the
forecasts, such as: Will immunity wane? What about variants? How much will the summer
weather suppress the virus? How will we behave when the rules are relaxed? Will
we go back to normal or will some of us keep working from home and wear facemasks
even if the rules are relaxed? So these projections will be scrutinised for months to come. Reality Check Earlier the prime minister announced that from Monday we can have our friends over or catch up for a drinkinsidea pub - it's the end of layering up to meet up. But if you'd warmed to the idea of an outdoor gathering, you can open it up to 30 people - the same amount of guests that will soon be allowed to weddings, receptions and other celebrations. Here's what else you'll be able to do from next week and what there is to look forward to after that. There's also been a lot of talk today about the return of hugging. From Monday, it's your choice whether or not to be socially distanced with close family and friends - so if you want to hug each other, you can. ButProf Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee advising the government says it would personally worry her ""if we were advocating we could hug all of our friends every time we meet them again"". Hugging risks spreading coronavirus and there are safer ways of doing it apparently, sohere's some reading up to help you decide whether to hug or not to hug. Pubs, restaurants and cafes in England, Scotland and Wales, will soon be able to serve customers inside again. But things won't quite be back to normal, these are the rules that will still be in place:  Here's a look at the rules in more detail. Earlier we brought you the UK's latest coronavirus data which showed that another four deaths had been reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Looking closer at those reported figures, four of them were recorded in Wales, meaning there wereno coronavirus deaths announced in England, Scotland and Northern Irelandtoday. Take a look at the UK's latest figures in the charts below. The World Health Organization briefing also heard that the world is seeing a levelling off in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths. Numbers are declining in most areas, including the Americas and Europe, the worst-hit regions. ""But itâs an unacceptably high plateau, with more than 5.4 million reported COVID-19 cases and almost 90,000 deaths last week,"" the WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the briefing. He said a global disparity in who can access vaccines remains one of the biggest obstacles to ending the pandemic. The new coronavirus variant known as B.1.617, first detected in India, is a variant of global concern, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, told a briefing that it may have increased transmissibility. The variant continues to tear through India,where infections and deaths came  close to record daily highs on Monday. The variant has three lineages, of which B.1.617.2 is the fastest growing. At the UK government's Covid briefing today, England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said that variant was a concern and officials were keeping a close eye on it. ""Our view is that this is a highly transmissible variant... [but] at this point in time, our view is it is less likely to be
able to escape vaccination than some of the other variants,"" he
said. Here's what we know about the India Covid variant. Wembley last hosted the Champions League final in 2013 Portugal has emerged asa strong candidate to host this season's Champions League final later this monthafter Uefa did not gain guarantees of the coronavirus exemptions it wants to move the game to Wembley. Uefa, UK government officials and the Football Association met earlier today to discuss moving the game between Chelsea and Manchester City from Istanbul. Uefa has decided it will be moved after Turkey was put on England'sred travel listwhich the government says means fans cannot travel. Portugal is on the green list so fans from England would be allowed to attend on 29 May. Travellers from England to green-list countries will be required to take Covid tests before and after travel but do not have to quarantine on their return. The match could still be played at Wembley but it would require a major shift from the government, who have so far failed to reach an agreement with Uefa. European football's governing body feels in Portugal it is going to be easier to gain access for sponsors and broadcasters, who would need to be compensated if they were unable to attend the game. Porto has been mentioned as a potential venue but it is understood Lisbon, which hosted last year's final, is also a possibility. We've got more on Scotland's foreign travel traffic light system which is expected to come into effect on 24 May. Earlier, the BBC was told that people in Scotland will be able to travel to some foreign destinations without the need to quarantine on their return. Countries are to be classified as green, amber and red and a review will take place every four weeks, the BBC understands. The Scottish government says a Covid briefing will take place on Tuesday and it would not comment on reports. But if it's similar to England's traffic light system, here's how it could work. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring Russia is aiming to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 by September, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko has said. When asked on about the country's vaccine rollout, Murashko said it was progressing ""as planned"" and insisted that Russia's target for collective immunity will be met,the Interfax news agency reported.,external This comes despite Russia's slow start to its vaccination campaign with official figures showing that by 6 May only 13.4 million people had received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 9.4 million had received both. Russia's vaccine rollout has been affected by some public scepticism, polls suggest This is some way off the target of vaccinating 70% of the
adult population by the end of the summer,initially given by President Vladimir Putin in March.,external Russia's rollout has been affected by some public scepticism
of vaccines as independent pollster Levada Centre suggested that in February only
30% of Russians were willing to receive the Sputnik V vaccine - the country's
most widely used jab. The coronavirus
data supports the decision to continue to ease lockdown restrictions in England,
according to the new shadow leader of the House of Commons. Responding to the announcements unveiled at the Downing Street news conference, Thangam Debbonaire says she is looking forward to the prospect of hugging loved ones again and visiting people
in their homes. However she adds that people still âneed to exercise cautionâ. Being able to reopen indoors from next week is âgreat
newsâ for the hospitality industry which has âgone through such a lotâ, she
adds. Asked whether the country should open up
sooner than the government's roadmap, she says we need to wait to see the data once restrictions have eased further
to find out whether there has been an impact. âThereâs no denying
that everybody must be looking forward to things getting better and opening up
this summer,"" she says. This video can not be played Boris Johnson warns not to 'throw caution to the wind' Despite confirming that hugging relatives and friends from different households will be allowed from Monday, the Prime Minister urged people to remain cautious. Speaking at the Covid briefing, Boris Johnson warned that ""this does not mean we should throw caution to the wind"", and hugging is still a main way that the virus can spread. Meeting outdoors is still safer, he added, and encouraged opening windows while meeting indoors. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmedthe third stage of England's roadmap out of lockdownwill go ahead on 17 May - next Monday. In a significant step towards normality after off-and-on restrictions for more than a year:  Read morehere. Helen CattPolitical correspondent So Step three is going ahead; that's been expected for a while now. The updating of guidance to say we can have physical contact with friends and family again - even if caution was very much the word - also means life should feel a bit more normal from next week. There were several hints in this news conference that seemed to suggest the Prime Minister is reasonably confident that Step four is also likely to happen from 21 June too, although once again he resisted any temptation to suggest that date could be brought forward. He did promise though more information this month to help businesses prepare and there is the start of a shift in tone to letting people make up their own mind about how best to protect themselves. However, both he and the scientists stressed that next week marks a particularly big step. The discussion of the India variant and situations which ""can come out of a blue sky"" mean that there is still a heavy dose of caution to all this. The ""stay in the UK"" restriction will lift from Monday and people will be able to travel to
green-list countries, the PM confirmed during the Downing Street press conference. But he urged caution
and stresses that we must remain vigilant to unexpected changes in the data, and
the spread of new variants. To ensure our progress through the roadmap continues to be irreversible, he says people must continue to follow the rules, remember ""hands, face, space, fresh
air"", and come forward to get the vaccine when called. Before the PM was able to announce the lifting of further coronavirus restrictions had had to get approval from his cabinet. MPs reviewed the latest data which shows infection rates are at their lowest level since last September, and deaths and hospitalisations are at their lowest level since last July. They were also told that more than two thirds of all adults across the UK have been vaccinated, with more than 18 million people having received their second dose. And in light of the most recent data, the four UK chief medical officers had confirmed that the UK Covid-19 alert level should move from level four to level three. The changes to lockdown restrictions were approved by Cabinet at a meeting earlier today. The prime minister answered questions from the public and journalists at the briefing Now the prime
minister is asked whether it would be irresponsible for Scotland to hold a
second referendum during this stage of the pandemic. Boris Johnson says
he had good conversations with the heads of the devolved nations and everyoneâs
number one priority was to come out of the pandemic and ""build back better"". Prof Chris Whitty
is asked about the threat of one of the Indian variants in the UK. He says cases
of it have gone up sharply and thatâs a ""reason to be very careful about it"". ""What we know with all the variants is that
things can come out of the blue sky - youâre not expecting it and then it can happen."" He adds that at
this point in time âour view is that this is a highly transmissible variantâ
but it is less likely to be able to escape vaccination, although the data is
incomplete. Sir Patrick Vallance joined the PM at the briefing Jason Groves from the Daily Mail asks if this is potentially the last lockdown we see, bar any new ""terrible variant"" because of the vaccination programme. He asks if people should expect to continue working from home in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""this is a big step forward"" and there will be ""many many more people vaccinated"" this time around, but it is important that ""we don't get ahead of ourselves"". ""Everything is pointing in the direction"" that the vaccines are reducing infection rates. Boris Johnson says the more people can communicate remotely, the more reasons they find to meet face to face. He says he is ""pretty certain that eventually our town centres are going to be full of bustle, full of people who want to interact again"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Reality Check Earlier the prime minister announced that from Monday we can have our friends over or catch up for a drinkinsidea pub - it's the end of layering up to meet up. But if you'd warmed to the idea of an outdoor gathering, you can open it up to 30 people - the same amount of guests that will soon be allowed to weddings, receptions and other celebrations. Here's what else you'll be able to do from next week and what there is to look forward to after that. There's also been a lot of talk today about the return of hugging. From Monday, it's your choice whether or not to be socially distanced with close family and friends - so if you want to hug each other, you can. ButProf Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee advising the government says it would personally worry her ""if we were advocating we could hug all of our friends every time we meet them again"". Hugging risks spreading coronavirus and there are safer ways of doing it apparently, sohere's some reading up to help you decide whether to hug or not to hug. Pubs, restaurants and cafes in England, Scotland and Wales, will soon be able to serve customers inside again. But things won't quite be back to normal, these are the rules that will still be in place:  Here's a look at the rules in more detail. Earlier we brought you the UK's latest coronavirus data which showed that another four deaths had been reported within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Looking closer at those reported figures, four of them were recorded in Wales, meaning there wereno coronavirus deaths announced in England, Scotland and Northern Irelandtoday. Take a look at the UK's latest figures in the charts below. The World Health Organization briefing also heard that the world is seeing a levelling off in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths. Numbers are declining in most areas, including the Americas and Europe, the worst-hit regions. ""But itâs an unacceptably high plateau, with more than 5.4 million reported COVID-19 cases and almost 90,000 deaths last week,"" the WHO's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the briefing. He said a global disparity in who can access vaccines remains one of the biggest obstacles to ending the pandemic. The new coronavirus variant known as B.1.617, first detected in India, is a variant of global concern, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on Covid-19, told a briefing that it may have increased transmissibility. The variant continues to tear through India,where infections and deaths came  close to record daily highs on Monday. The variant has three lineages, of which B.1.617.2 is the fastest growing. At the UK government's Covid briefing today, England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said that variant was a concern and officials were keeping a close eye on it. ""Our view is that this is a highly transmissible variant... [but] at this point in time, our view is it is less likely to be
able to escape vaccination than some of the other variants,"" he
said. Here's what we know about the India Covid variant. Wembley last hosted the Champions League final in 2013 Portugal has emerged asa strong candidate to host this season's Champions League final later this monthafter Uefa did not gain guarantees of the coronavirus exemptions it wants to move the game to Wembley. Uefa, UK government officials and the Football Association met earlier today to discuss moving the game between Chelsea and Manchester City from Istanbul. Uefa has decided it will be moved after Turkey was put on England'sred travel listwhich the government says means fans cannot travel. Portugal is on the green list so fans from England would be allowed to attend on 29 May. Travellers from England to green-list countries will be required to take Covid tests before and after travel but do not have to quarantine on their return. The match could still be played at Wembley but it would require a major shift from the government, who have so far failed to reach an agreement with Uefa. European football's governing body feels in Portugal it is going to be easier to gain access for sponsors and broadcasters, who would need to be compensated if they were unable to attend the game. Porto has been mentioned as a potential venue but it is understood Lisbon, which hosted last year's final, is also a possibility. We've got more on Scotland's foreign travel traffic light system which is expected to come into effect on 24 May. Earlier, the BBC was told that people in Scotland will be able to travel to some foreign destinations without the need to quarantine on their return. Countries are to be classified as green, amber and red and a review will take place every four weeks, the BBC understands. The Scottish government says a Covid briefing will take place on Tuesday and it would not comment on reports. But if it's similar to England's traffic light system, here's how it could work. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring Russia is aiming to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 by September, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko has said. When asked on about the country's vaccine rollout, Murashko said it was progressing ""as planned"" and insisted that Russia's target for collective immunity will be met,the Interfax news agency reported.,external This comes despite Russia's slow start to its vaccination campaign with official figures showing that by 6 May only 13.4 million people had received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 9.4 million had received both. Russia's vaccine rollout has been affected by some public scepticism, polls suggest This is some way off the target of vaccinating 70% of the
adult population by the end of the summer,initially given by President Vladimir Putin in March.,external Russia's rollout has been affected by some public scepticism
of vaccines as independent pollster Levada Centre suggested that in February only
30% of Russians were willing to receive the Sputnik V vaccine - the country's
most widely used jab. The coronavirus
data supports the decision to continue to ease lockdown restrictions in England,
according to the new shadow leader of the House of Commons. Responding to the announcements unveiled at the Downing Street news conference, Thangam Debbonaire says she is looking forward to the prospect of hugging loved ones again and visiting people
in their homes. However she adds that people still âneed to exercise cautionâ. Being able to reopen indoors from next week is âgreat
newsâ for the hospitality industry which has âgone through such a lotâ, she
adds. Asked whether the country should open up
sooner than the government's roadmap, she says we need to wait to see the data once restrictions have eased further
to find out whether there has been an impact. âThereâs no denying
that everybody must be looking forward to things getting better and opening up
this summer,"" she says. This video can not be played Boris Johnson warns not to 'throw caution to the wind' Despite confirming that hugging relatives and friends from different households will be allowed from Monday, the Prime Minister urged people to remain cautious. Speaking at the Covid briefing, Boris Johnson warned that ""this does not mean we should throw caution to the wind"", and hugging is still a main way that the virus can spread. Meeting outdoors is still safer, he added, and encouraged opening windows while meeting indoors. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmedthe third stage of England's roadmap out of lockdownwill go ahead on 17 May - next Monday. In a significant step towards normality after off-and-on restrictions for more than a year:  Read morehere. Helen CattPolitical correspondent So Step three is going ahead; that's been expected for a while now. The updating of guidance to say we can have physical contact with friends and family again - even if caution was very much the word - also means life should feel a bit more normal from next week. There were several hints in this news conference that seemed to suggest the Prime Minister is reasonably confident that Step four is also likely to happen from 21 June too, although once again he resisted any temptation to suggest that date could be brought forward. He did promise though more information this month to help businesses prepare and there is the start of a shift in tone to letting people make up their own mind about how best to protect themselves. However, both he and the scientists stressed that next week marks a particularly big step. The discussion of the India variant and situations which ""can come out of a blue sky"" mean that there is still a heavy dose of caution to all this. The ""stay in the UK"" restriction will lift from Monday and people will be able to travel to
green-list countries, the PM confirmed during the Downing Street press conference. But he urged caution
and stresses that we must remain vigilant to unexpected changes in the data, and
the spread of new variants. To ensure our progress through the roadmap continues to be irreversible, he says people must continue to follow the rules, remember ""hands, face, space, fresh
air"", and come forward to get the vaccine when called. Before the PM was able to announce the lifting of further coronavirus restrictions had had to get approval from his cabinet. MPs reviewed the latest data which shows infection rates are at their lowest level since last September, and deaths and hospitalisations are at their lowest level since last July. They were also told that more than two thirds of all adults across the UK have been vaccinated, with more than 18 million people having received their second dose. And in light of the most recent data, the four UK chief medical officers had confirmed that the UK Covid-19 alert level should move from level four to level three. The changes to lockdown restrictions were approved by Cabinet at a meeting earlier today. The prime minister answered questions from the public and journalists at the briefing Now the prime
minister is asked whether it would be irresponsible for Scotland to hold a
second referendum during this stage of the pandemic. Boris Johnson says
he had good conversations with the heads of the devolved nations and everyoneâs
number one priority was to come out of the pandemic and ""build back better"". Prof Chris Whitty
is asked about the threat of one of the Indian variants in the UK. He says cases
of it have gone up sharply and thatâs a ""reason to be very careful about it"". ""What we know with all the variants is that
things can come out of the blue sky - youâre not expecting it and then it can happen."" He adds that at
this point in time âour view is that this is a highly transmissible variantâ
but it is less likely to be able to escape vaccination, although the data is
incomplete. Sir Patrick Vallance joined the PM at the briefing Jason Groves from the Daily Mail asks if this is potentially the last lockdown we see, bar any new ""terrible variant"" because of the vaccination programme. He asks if people should expect to continue working from home in the future. Sir Patrick Vallance says ""this is a big step forward"" and there will be ""many many more people vaccinated"" this time around, but it is important that ""we don't get ahead of ourselves"". ""Everything is pointing in the direction"" that the vaccines are reducing infection rates. Boris Johnson says the more people can communicate remotely, the more reasons they find to meet face to face. He says he is ""pretty certain that eventually our town centres are going to be full of bustle, full of people who want to interact again"". Â© 2025 BBC.

today, thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Weâll
be back tomorrow morning with more updates. In the meantime, you can read more detail on all of today's stories by going to ourhome page. Todayâs coverage
was brought to you by: Hugo Bachega, Alexandra Fouche, Jack Hunter, Alex
Kleiderman, Jennifer Meierhans, Richard Morris, Ashitha Nagesh, Emma Owen, Lauren
Turner and Katie Wright. We are going to be bringing our live coverage to a close soon so here's a recap on the main news from the UK: We'll be wrapping up the live page for the day shortly, thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of some of the biggest stories from around the world today: James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News The governmentâs science advisers â the body known as Sage â
have painted a far more optimistic picture of the months to come than just a
few weeks ago. The crucial shift comes from evidence that vaccines are
significantly cutting the chances of immunised people passing the virus on if
they become ill. The weeks and months to come look far more promising once
that is factored into the equation. A third wave is still anticipated and even the reopening
next Monday is likely to lead to cases starting to rise again. However, Sage â the scientific advisory group for
emergencies â says the next stage of rule relaxing is highly unlikely to put
intense pressure on hospitals. And, while there is uncertainty, any future peaks could be
substantially smaller than the first wave in March last year. There are still key questions that could change the
forecasts, such as: Will immunity wane? What about variants? How much will the summer
weather suppress the virus? How will we behave when the rules are relaxed? Will
we go back to normal or will some of us keep working from home and wear facemasks
even if the rules are relaxed? So these projections will be scrutinised for months to come.

"A police car blocking an entrance to the Dunedin Central Countdown, where the stabbing took place Four people have been injured, three of whom are now in a critical condition, after a stabbing attack at a New Zealand supermarket. The stabbing took place at a Countdown store in the city of Dunedin on the South Island. Bystanders tackled the attacker, who was then arrested. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the motive was not clear but that there was no indication it was a domestic terror event. Police district commander Paul Basham described Monday's incident as a random attack. He said it was ""nothing short of heroic"" that shoppers and staff had stopped the attacker. Incidents of mass violence are rare in New Zealand but the country saw the 2019 Christchurch shooting when a white supremacist killed more than 50 people at two mosques. Local media reports say the four injured on Monday are made up of both supermarket employees and customers. Police said the suspect sustained a minor injury and was receiving medical attention under police guard. He has not not yet been charged. The names of the victims and the suspect have not been made public. Witnesses described chaotic scenes at the supermarket as the attack unfolded. ""We just heard a scream and thought someone must've fallen, but it got louder and louder and more people were screaming,"" an unnamed woman told the Otago Daily Times. ""I saw one red hand among the people; a bloody hand, and everybody started running towards the exits."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Countdown said in a media statement that it was ""shocked and devastated by the events in our store"" in Dunedin - a city with a population of about 130,000. ""Our priority right now is our injured team members and caring for our wider team in the wake of this extremely traumatic event,"" it said. ""We are deeply upset that customers who tried to help our team members were also injured."" It added that the store would remain closed for the rest of Monday and on Tuesday.

"Labour's new shadow cabinet met earlier today for the first time following Kier Starmer's shake-up of his top team Anneliese Dodds is now the Labour Party's chair, with Rachel Reeves taking her old position Veteran Labour MP Diane Abbott says she does not want a leadership challenge but calls on Sir Keir to develop a ""winning strategy"" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she could introduce legislation for an independence referendum by next spring But the Scottish Conservatives say Ms Sturgeon is acting beyond her powers PM Boris Johnson is being investigated by the MPs' standards watchdog over the funding of his Caribbean holiday in late 2019 Richard Morris, Lucy Webster and Emma Owen Nearly there. It's been quite the marathon. At this point, we're just awaiting results from a handful of Police and Crime Commissioner elections. There are nine more announcements to go, which we're expecting by the end of the day. They're from:  So at this point, we're going to wrap up this live page. Of course, do keep following the BBC News website as these last results are declared - you will find them allhere, along with a breakdown of the results from all the mayoral, council, Scottish and Welsh elections. And any further developments, and analysis of what it all means, can be found onour politics pages. Thank you for joining us. With most of the results from Thursday's polls now in, we can assess what we've learned about the political landscape. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, there is a firm majority for independence in the Scottish Parliament. With the UK government strongly against allowing another referendum, this debate is likely to rumble on - and perhaps become increasingly fractious. Meanwhile, south of the border, the Conservatives are doing well in areas which were once Labour strongholds. The party, which has been in power for 11 years, won the Hartlepool by-election and gained control of 13 councils. The results also indicated that governments across the UK's nations are being rewarded for their handling of the Covid crisis, and that the Leave-Remain divide is still crucial, five years on from the Brexit vote. Read more on these elections' key lessons. We're nearing the end of our live coverage of the election results, so here's a simple catch-up, in pictures, of  the long weekend of counting. The Utilita Arena in Birmingham was given over to counting votes Waiting for results can be a hungry business Count Binface failed in his bid to become London's mayor And in Wales, Captain Beany (left) didn't manage to take Mark Drakeford's seat in the Welsh Parliament SNP candidate for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, Karen Adam was more successful.

Because MPs are elected, they cannot technically resign. Instead, in one of Parliament's many quirks,they must be appointed to a historical crown office.,external So, as Labour's Tracy Brabin can no longer be MP for Batley and Spen, having been elected as mayor of West Yorkshire, there will now be a by-election to fill her seat. She says it's an ""enormous privilege"" to be the first holder of the newly-created mayoralty.  The message from the UK government today has been clear - the focus needs to be rebuilding from the virus. Now is not the time to talk about Scottish independence. One minister, tasked with the morning interview round, said another referendum ""simply isn't on our radar"". Nadine Dorries said it would be both a divisive and expensive distraction. But the SNP is not giving up. It's deputy leader in the House of Commons said it was ""simply nonsense"" to say the party does not have a mandate to hold another referendum. Kirsten Oswald said the party has a ""significant and overwhelming"" case to press ahead when the time is right. Meanwhile Gordon Brown has been setting out his plan to keep the UK intact. He attacked Boris Johnson's ""muscular unionism"" which he said was ""at odds with mainstream Scottish opinion"". Could all this end up in the courts? Find out,here. Downing Street has insisted that Boris Johnson ""transparently declared"" his 2019 holiday to Mustique, amidan investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The prime minister's spokesman told journalists: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" Asked if the government believes the public think the rules matter, the spokesman said: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by businessman David Ross. Mr Ross, a co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, initially said he did not ""pay any monies"" for the trip to the private island of Mustique, in the Caribbean. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister, and Mr Johnson's declaration of a ""benefit in kind"" was ""correct"". Sir Keir is said to have told the meeting: ""To be clear, I take responsibility. Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me."" Labour's new look shadow cabinet has met for the first time after a weekend of recriminations following the election results and the reshuffle. But there was no radical change to the top table other than Rachel Reeves replacing Anneliese Dodds in the shadow chancellor role. Angela Rayner - who's removal from certain jobs in the party has caused outrage on the Labour Left - is back with a beefed up role. And there has been no shortage of advice for Keir Starmer on what Labour needs to do next to stem the tide of losses. The newly re-elected mayor for Great Manchester, Andy Burnham, has urged him to ditch the ""cautious"" approach to policy and back what is right. Addressing party staff this morning, Starmer admitted the results in England were ""profoundly disappointing"". He said he would soon be spelling out his approach to rebuilding the economy and changing a culture that  sets people ""against each other"".   We've had a few more results in for those police and crime commissioners elections. No changes so far today with both Kent and Cumbria sticking with the Conservative candidate while South Yorkshire is held by Labour. Counting is under way in Sussex whereBBC reporter Ben Weisz says,externalone voter apparently rejected all the candidates and instead wrote âJackie Weaverâ -of Handforth council fame- on their ballot. As Labour licks its wounds from last week's election results and the reshuffle upheaval, the Conservatives are keen to demonstrate that they are getting on with the business of government. At 17:00 BST today, the prime minister will hold a press conference in Downing Street, setting out next stage of lifting coronavirus restrictions in England. He's hoping to build on his party's feelgood factor from its election successes by announcing that the lockdown roadmap is on track and people will be able to hug each other from next week. He'll try to bind in the support of the devolved nations with a message that everyone needs to focus on rebuilding from the pandemic - with a message in particular for the SNP that the focus now has to be recovery and not independence.

The Queen and Prince Charles at the 2019 State Opening of Parliament The Queen's Speech is happening in Parliament tomorrow.

Jill Mortimer defeated Paul Williams in Hartlepool The defeated Labour candidate in the Hartlepool by-election, Paul Williams, is speaking to Radio 4's The World at One about what went wrong. He says he lost ""with great humility"" because even though it is ""hard to take a defeat like this"" the reality is that ""voters are never wrong"". Labour lost in Hartlepool for two reasons, he says. He believes Labour had a ""credibility gap"" and ""an identity gap"". People expected when they voted Labour in the past that things would improve for then, he adds, but things did not get better and so people blamed the party. He says voters in Hartlepool and across the country do not know who Labour is or what it stands for and the challenge for Sir Keir Starmer is to come up with a policy offer to fill that vision. It's been a busy start to the week, with the fall-out from elections across Britain continuing. If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the day's top political stories: Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The newly, moderately reshuffled shadow cabinet gathered
at midday today in the Boothroyd room of Portcullis House in Parliament after a tumultuous weekend
for the party in the wake of poor election results. Face-to-face meetings are
still relatively rare at Westminster but this was hardly a happy reunion. One
senior frontbencher managed a smile on the way in but wearily said they were just
glad the elections were over. Before the meeting, another described the
situation the party faced as âcatastrophicâ and frustratedly suggested the following infighting had made things worse, giving
voters more reasons not to vote Labour. Sir Keir Starmer welcomed new members of his top team and said his
deputy Angela Rayner had a big new role taking the fight to the Tories, which
an ally of hers said would enable her to perform more to her strengths. But Sir
Keir added that he and nobody else had responsibility for Labourâs results. After some difficult days and public disagreements about the future for Labour, itâs likely there will be more to
come. The SNP's deputy leader in the House of Commons, Kirsten Oswald, is also on the BBC's Politics Live programme. She says that, despite the lack of an overall majority in Holyrood, it is ""simply nonsense"" for the UK government to say that the SNP does not have a mandate to hold another independence referendum. The SNP has won the election with a landslide, she says, giving an ""amazing and strong mandate"" to Nicola Sturgeon. ""There is no way really that you can look at this and say that there isn't a significant and overwhelming mandate for the SNP to go forward and deliver what people voted for us to do,"" she adds. ""That's what democracy is all about. That's what democracy dictates that we should do."" Over the weekend Labour MP Khalid Mahmood said the party had been taken over by ""woke warriors"". Responding to the article, Richard Burgon says woke refers to ""people who are against discrimination"", adding: ""We need to be proud of that and we need to communicate that in a way that doesn't alienate people."" Asked about the Batley and Spen by-election, Burgon warns that: ""If Labour doesn't win in Batley and Spen, Keir will have real problems."" Former home secretary David Blunkett says young people are ""thoughtful and believe in equality"" but says there are people ""who carry things to extremes and start talking about pulling down statues"". ""We've got to disavow those things we think are silly while reaching out to those who want a radical progressive agenda,"" he says. The former shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has been tweeting about her new job. She  says she's determined the party will ""seize every opportunity"" deliver change. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC's Politics Live, former shadow minister Richard Burgon says the election results are ""very upsetting"" and that it is ""unfair"" to place responsibility for the defeats on Angela Rayner. He says the party leader needs to ""change direction"" instead of ""rearranging the deck chairs"". He also suggests the leadership is more interested in ""taking the fight to left activists instead of the government"". Former home secretary David Blunkett accuses Burgon of ""going out of his way to be divisive"" He says the party needs to ""reshape how we address the world of tomorrow, rather than the 70s and 80s"".

With most of the results from Thursday's polls now in, we can assess what we've learned about the political landscape. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, there is a firm majority for independence in the Scottish Parliament. With the UK government strongly against allowing another referendum, this debate is likely to rumble on - and perhaps become increasingly fractious. Meanwhile, south of the border, the Conservatives are doing well in areas which were once Labour strongholds. The party, which has been in power for 11 years, won the Hartlepool by-election and gained control of 13 councils. The results also indicated that governments across the UK's nations are being rewarded for their handling of the Covid crisis, and that the Leave-Remain divide is still crucial, five years on from the Brexit vote. Read more on these elections' key lessons. We're nearing the end of our live coverage of the election results, so here's a simple catch-up, in pictures, of  the long weekend of counting.

Because MPs are elected, they cannot technically resign. Instead, in one of Parliament's many quirks,they must be appointed to a historical crown office.,external So, as Labour's Tracy Brabin can no longer be MP for Batley and Spen, having been elected as mayor of West Yorkshire, there will now be a by-election to fill her seat. She says it's an ""enormous privilege"" to be the first holder of the newly-created mayoralty.  The message from the UK government today has been clear - the focus needs to be rebuilding from the virus. Now is not the time to talk about Scottish independence. One minister, tasked with the morning interview round, said another referendum ""simply isn't on our radar"". Nadine Dorries said it would be both a divisive and expensive distraction. But the SNP is not giving up. It's deputy leader in the House of Commons said it was ""simply nonsense"" to say the party does not have a mandate to hold another referendum. Kirsten Oswald said the party has a ""significant and overwhelming"" case to press ahead when the time is right. Meanwhile Gordon Brown has been setting out his plan to keep the UK intact. He attacked Boris Johnson's ""muscular unionism"" which he said was ""at odds with mainstream Scottish opinion"". Could all this end up in the courts? Find out,here. Downing Street has insisted that Boris Johnson ""transparently declared"" his 2019 holiday to Mustique, amidan investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The prime minister's spokesman told journalists: ""The prime minister transparently declared the benefit in kind in the Commons register of interests."" Asked if the government believes the public think the rules matter, the spokesman said: ""Clearly the rules are set out and it's important that everyone abides by them, as the prime minister has done throughout."" Mr Johnson has previously declared he received accommodation worth Â£15,000, covered by businessman David Ross. Mr Ross, a co-founder of Carphone Warehouse, initially said he did not ""pay any monies"" for the trip to the private island of Mustique, in the Caribbean. He later clarified that he had ""facilitated"" accommodation for the prime minister, and Mr Johnson's declaration of a ""benefit in kind"" was ""correct"". Sir Keir is said to have told the meeting: ""To be clear, I take responsibility. Nobody else. I lead the Labour Party and it is entirely on me."" Labour's new look shadow cabinet has met for the first time after a weekend of recriminations following the election results and the reshuffle. But there was no radical change to the top table other than Rachel Reeves replacing Anneliese Dodds in the shadow chancellor role. Angela Rayner - who's removal from certain jobs in the party has caused outrage on the Labour Left - is back with a beefed up role.

"This video can not be played Rail disruption: Hitachi Rail CEO on cracks found in trains Travel disruption caused by the discovery of cracks in some high-speed trains is expected to continue this week. Robert Nisbet, of the Rail Delivery Group, said initial inspections of 183 trains taken out of service on Saturday should conclude by the end of Sunday. But he warned that disruption was expected to ""carry on for a few days"". GWR advised against travel on Monday, while LNER urged people with bookings to check before they travelled. Hitachi Class 800 trains used by the firms were taken out of service for safety inspections. Andrew Barr, CEO of Hitachi Rail, apologised to passengers and said the trains were withdrawn because of cracks found on the metal that linked the train's body with the underside of the train, known as the bogie. On Sunday evening, the UK government asked Hitachi to set out a comprehensive plan to identify the extent of the cracking and outline a longer term repair strategy. Your questions on high-speed trains Train services cancelled after cracks found Is it safe to use public transport again? While this sort of problem doesn't affect the structural integrity of the train - so it's not a danger to passengers - I'm told the risk is more about the possibility of something falling off. GWR is the most affected network. As the first operator in the country to introduce the Hitachi 800 in 2017, its trains are older. Its fleet of 93 is also much bigger than other operators', meaning more trains to check and fix. Some are already back in service - and we're told inspections should be done by the end of Sunday. And Hitachi Rail's boss told me the company would periodically reinspect the trains while a permanent solution is found. Disruption on long distance routes will go on for at least the next few days. That's partly because some trains and crew won't be in the right place. Also, some carriages won't be able to go straight back into use because they need repairing. We don't yet know precisely how many yet. It's possible some which aren't yet showing a crack might also need remedial work. Mr Nisbet, whose organisation represents train operators and Network Rail, also apologised for the disruption. He told BBC Breakfast that rail firms were running as many services as possible, including rail replacement services, putting on extra staff at affected stations, relaxing ticket acceptance rules and offering compensation for delays. He said it was ""gratifying to see the speed"" at which initial inspections were taking place but said it was impossible to say how long the checks would take. ""We don't want to rush it,"" he said. Mr Nisbet said the cracks - measuring millimetres - ""didn't pose any particular danger to passengers"" but had the potential to develop if left untreated. The Department for Transport said independent safety regulator the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) will be closely involved in overseeing Hitachi's plans for safety inspections for the Class 800 fleet. Rail Minister Chris Heaton Harris said: ""I expect operators to explore all options for replacement services to help people complete their journeys."" He thanked passengers for their patience in the meantime. Anna Celac had hoped to see a friend in London Instagram photographer Anna Celac hoped to travel from Cardiff to London Paddington to see a friend she hadn't seen since last year. When she bought her ticket on Saturday night, she said the website she booked with didn't report any disruption. She says she was disappointed when she had to cancel her trip, as the replacement bus service would have left her with too little time in the capital. Only around 10% of Great Western Railway's long-distance services ran on Sunday, with a similar service expected on Monday, the operator said. GWR said customers for long-distance services should not travel on Monday and refunds would be issued. Local services have been running, but they were expected to be very busy and rail replacement services were limited. The company earlier said cracks were detected on ""more than one"" Hitachi 800 train, so all 93 in its fleet were being inspected as a precaution. It comes after six of the trains were taken out of service by GWR last monthafter hairline cracks were found in the suspension system during routine maintenance. London North Eastern Railway,externalapologised to customers, saying it was experiencing ""significant disruption"" due to the checks. It is running a limited service on the East Coast Main Line, between Edinburgh, Newcastle, York and London, and will be unable to run trains between Edinburgh and Inverness/Aberdeen until Saturday 15 May at the earliest. LNER added that some services would also be cancelled on Monday - and passengers should check before setting off to the station. Great Western Railway services in and out of London Paddington were cancelled on Saturday Hull Trains,externalsaid checks on its trains had been completed and services would resume as normal. But the operator added it expected services to be ""extremely busy"" and could not guarantee that social distancing guidelines would be adhered to. Refunds were being offered for its Sunday morning services,according to its website,external. TransPennine Expresssaid it was now running a normal service,external, but advised customers travelling between York and Newcastle to check for any knock-on impact before travelling. LNER passengers affected by cancellations can use their tickets on the following operators' services instead: ScotRail between Aberdeen and Edinburgh Avanti West Coast between London Euston and Manchester for customers with an open ticket TransPennine Express between Manchester, Leeds and York East Midlands Railway between London St Pancras International and Sheffield Northern services between Sheffield, Leeds and York and via any other ""reasonable"" route Thameslink services between London, Stevenage and Peterborough CrossCountry between Leeds, York and Edinburgh Rail replacement coaches are operating at York, Newcastle and Edinburgh, and also between Doncaster and Peterborough. LNER says affected customers' tickets will be valid up to and including Sunday 16 May, though new reservations will need to be made.

"A police car blocking an entrance to the Dunedin Central Countdown, where the stabbing took place Four people have been injured, three of whom are now in a critical condition, after a stabbing attack at a New Zealand supermarket. The stabbing took place at a Countdown store in the city of Dunedin on the South Island. Bystanders tackled the attacker, who was then arrested. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the motive was not clear but that there was no indication it was a domestic terror event. Police district commander Paul Basham described Monday's incident as a random attack. He said it was ""nothing short of heroic"" that shoppers and staff had stopped the attacker. Incidents of mass violence are rare in New Zealand but the country saw the 2019 Christchurch shooting when a white supremacist killed more than 50 people at two mosques. Local media reports say the four injured on Monday are made up of both supermarket employees and customers. Police said the suspect sustained a minor injury and was receiving medical attention under police guard. He has not not yet been charged. The names of the victims and the suspect have not been made public. Witnesses described chaotic scenes at the supermarket as the attack unfolded. ""We just heard a scream and thought someone must've fallen, but it got louder and louder and more people were screaming,"" an unnamed woman told the Otago Daily Times. ""I saw one red hand among the people; a bloody hand, and everybody started running towards the exits."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We are deeply upset that customers who tried to help our team members were also injured."" It added that the store would remain closed for the rest of Monday and on Tuesday.

"The next stage of lockdown easing is likely to see the reopening of indoor hospitality Indoor hospitality and household mixing are set to return from next Monday, as the PM is due to confirm the next stage of lockdown easing in England. Boris Johnson is expected to say the data supports a further relaxation of measures at a 17:00 BST Downing Street news conference later. It could also include guidance that it is now safe to hug friends and family. Health Minister Nadine Dorries said she was ""hopeful"" hugging could be allowed but urged people to act ""cautiously"". Ahead of the Downing Street briefing, the UKreduced its Covid alert level from level four to three, meaning the virus is in general circulation but transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced. Under the next stage of thegovernment's road map for lifting England's lockdown, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors. People are also likely to be allowed to stay overnight with those not in their household or bubble. Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues such as cinemas and soft play areas are set to be permitted to reopen indoors. When can we have a 'cautious' hug? What changes are coming on 17 May? The science of hugs: Why do we miss them so much? A government science adviser said that if the guidance does allow hugs, they should be selective, brief, and should avoid face-to-face contact to minimise the risk of spreading the virus. But Ms Dorries said ""the data is looking extremely positive"" when she was asked if the guidance would be relaxed to allow hugging between friends and family. ""We've all missed the hugs, we've all missed the close and intimate contact we've had with friends and family and so I'm hopeful that we will be hugging and kissing again indoors,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She stressed that people should take this step ""a little bit cautiously"" to protect people who may be vulnerable and avoid a resurgence of the virus, however. It is a sign of how successful the country has been in getting infection rates down that there is no doubt that the next unlocking will take place. Allowing indoor mixing was always the step that concerned experts the most in the roadmap - given how much easier the virus spreads indoors compared to outdoors. Modelling earlier this year warned there could be a deadly summer surge - but that now looks overly pessimistic. Lockdown and social distancing has done most of the hard work in getting infection levels low, but now the vaccines are going to take the load. From the evidence gathered so far, they are more than up to the job in combating the dominant virus in the UK. Early signs are also promising for the variants. Some scientists are even suggesting the UK could be on brink of reaching herd immunity. As always with this virus, it would be foolish to get too far ahead of ourselves. But the signs look very promising. As part of other measures set to be relaxed, the rest of the accommodation sector is to reopen, along with indoor group sports and exercise classes. And up to 30 people are to be allowed to attend weddings, receptions and wakes, as well as funerals. Foreign holidays will also return. On Friday, the government announced that12 destinations would be placed on England's travel green list, meaning anyone returning from those areas will not need to quarantine from 17 May. Monday's announcement of lockdown easing will be stage three of the road map announced by the government in February, with the final stage scheduled for 21 June, when the government hopes to remove all legal restrictions on social contact.

The government has to be satisfied thatits four tests,externalhave been met before progressing to the next stage. These tests rest on the successful rollout of vaccines; evidence that jabs are reducing serious illness and death; infection rates being under control and the risk from coronavirus variants not changing. This video can not be played Catherine Noakes, from the University of Leeds, says we should hug safely The government said the latest data suggested that easing restrictions from 17 May was unlikely to risk a resurgence in infections. It said infection rates were at the lowest level since September 2020 and hospital admissions were continuing to decrease. On Sunday, the UK recorded another two deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and a further 1,770 cases. Mr Johnson said: ""The data reflects what we already knew - we are not going to let this virus beat us. ""The roadmap remains on track, our successful vaccination programme continues - more than two-thirds of adults in the UK have now had the first vaccine - and we can now look forward to unlocking, cautiously but irreversibly.""

LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Prof Cath Noakes, a member of the Sage committee that advises the government, told the BBC on Sunday that if people hugged their friends every time they see them, it would ""perpetuate an awful lot of additional close contact that could spread the virus"". But she said the risk from grandparents who are fully vaccinated hugging their grandchildren was likely to be low in most cases. The devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions. In Wales, indoor hospitality such as pubs, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and museums are expected to reopen from 17 May. All tourist accommodation is due to reopen and wedding receptions can have up to 30 people indoors and 50 outdoors. In Scotland from 17 May, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart.

"Avengers star Scarlett Johansson says the body behind the Globes needs ""fundamental reform"" Actor Scarlett Johansson has joined criticism of the body behind the Golden Globe Awards over how it plans to tackle discrimination. Golden Globe organisers the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) has been accused of a lack of diversity and shadowy workings. Earlier this week the body voted in reforms to widen its membership. But Ms Johansson is among stars and industry figures who say it still needs ""fundamental reform"". The Golden Globes are second only to the Oscars in terms of profile, but organisers have been accused of discriminatory practices, accepting ""freebies"" and other ethical lapses. In February,an exposÃ© in the Los Angeles Times revealed,externalthere were no black people among the organisation's 87 members who vote for the awards. This week, the HFPA outlined a package of reforms to how it works in a bid to make the organisation more inclusive. The Golden Globes is one of the year's biggest and starriest awards ceremonies They include widening its membership, with an emphasis on recruiting black members, and hiring diversity advisers. It also said it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules. ""Today's overwhelming vote to reform the Association reaffirms our commitment to change,"" said HFPA president Ali Sar in a statement on Thursday. Many high-profile Hollywood figures have said the initiatives are not good enough. Ms Johansson, who has been nominated for five Golden Globes, urged others in the film industry to boycott the organisation unless it makes significant internal changes. The 36-year-old recalled facing ""sexist questions and remarks by certain HFPA members that bordered on sexual harassment"". Golden Globe award organisers expel former boss Nomadland and Borat win top awards at Globes ""Unless there is necessary fundamental reform within the organization, I believe it is time that we take a step back from the HFPA and focus on the importance and strength of unity within our unions and the industry as a whole,"" she said. Ms Johansson's Avengers co-star Mark Ruffalo joined her, writing that the HFPA's reforms were ""discouraging"" in a social media post on Friday. ""Now is the time to step up and right the wrongs of the past,"" he said. ""Honestly, as a recent winner of a Golden Globe, I cannot feel proud or happy about being a recipient of this award.""

Meanwhile, Netflix and Amazon studios said they would stop doing business with the HFPA until it goes further with its reform plans. Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos said he was putting their relationship on hold ""until more meaningful changes are made"". Criticism of the HFPA burst into the open in February when the LA Times wrote its exposÃ© detailing alleged ethical conflicts and other misconduct. Following the story, more than 100 Hollywood PR firms threatened to advise the stars they represent not to work with the HFPA if changes were not made. They accused the organisation of ""discriminatory behaviour, unprofessionalism, ethical impropriety and alleged financial corruption"". The same group have said that despite this week's changes it will continue boycotting the HFPA. The HFPA did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.
