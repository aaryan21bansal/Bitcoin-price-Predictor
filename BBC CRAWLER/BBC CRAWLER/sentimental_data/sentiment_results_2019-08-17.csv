"Senior Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin has said he does not support Jeremy Corbyn becoming a caretaker prime minister in a bid to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But he backed discussions across the Commons to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK will leave the EU by 31 October ""do or die"". Mr Corbyn said the UK needs a government that is ""prepared to negotiate"" with the EU. His current plan is to win a no-confidence vote in the government, become interim prime minister and ""do everything we can"" to stop a no-deal Brexit. What is a vote of no confidence? Clarke and Harman 'open to leading government' Corbyn 'open to' law forcing Brexit delay Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Once in the role of caretaker prime minister, Mr Corbyn say he intends to delay Brexit, call a snap election, and campaign for another referendum. Sir Oliver, who was among senior Tories who received a letter from Mr Corbyn about the plan, was asked about Mr Corbyn's proposal on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""That appears to be his agenda. I have to say it is not one I personally share,"" he said. ""I don't think it's at all likely that a majority would be formed for that and I personally wouldn't want to vote for it. I wouldn't be able to support that, no."" Sir Oliver, a former cabinet minister, has led several attempts in Parliament to break the Brexit impasse and prevent a no-deal Brexit. But he said he was ""not very inclined"" to help bring down the government in a no-confidence vote and would ""rule it out"" if it led to Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. His comments came amid an ongoing row among MPs who oppose no deal, with Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson initially dismissing Mr Corbyn's plan as a ""nonsense"". Mr Corbyn said he assumed everyone who wanted to avoid a no-deal Brexit - including the Liberal Democrats - would vote for the motion of no confidence that Labour intends to launch against the government. ""What we need is a government that is prepared to negotiate with the European Union so we don't have a crash-out on the 31st,"" he added. Anna Soubry, leader of the Independent Group, said she would ""not support nor facilitate any government led by Jeremy Corbyn"". But the head of the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon, was among those applying pressure to Ms Swinson to change her stance. The Liberal Democrat leader suggested Tory grandee Ken Clarke or former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman could head a temporary government instead of Mr Corbyn. Mr Clarke responded on Friday to sayhe was willing to lead a government of national unityto avoid a no-deal Brexit. Asked if Mr Clarke or Ms Harman could lead the country through a political crisis, Mr Corbyn said: ""What we need is a respect for the electoral process that brought about the results from the last general election."" Sir Oliver suggested the majority of MPs did not want a no-deal Brexit, although he said he was ""not terribly optimistic"" they would reach an agreement. The former minister, who has agreed to meet with Mr Corbyn to discuss plans to avoid a no deal, said opponents of the government's Brexit position needed to ""talk a lot"" and ""talk frankly"". Meanwhile, fellow senior Tory MP Dominic Grieve said there was a ""a considerable head of steam growing to try to make sure that no deal doesn't occur"".

Mr Grieve, a former attorney general, said there was a ""growing number"" of Tory MPs who were ""horrified"" by the direction of Mr Johnson's government. ""His views, and the way he's expressing them, are so removed from what I would describe as proper and traditional conservatism as to cause real disquiet,"" he said.

"This video can not be played The Agreement Generation - What do they think? Half a century ago, life in Northern Ireland took on a grim new normality. The dreadful rhythm of murders and maimings continued for three decades, with the conflict largely ending in the late 1990s. But while the worst of the Troubles may feel more distant with each passing year the legacy of trauma is very current. Denise Mullan is one of thousands of people living with it. Her father Denis was shot dead by loyalists at their family home near Moy in County Tyrone in 1975. Many of those experiencing mental health problems today were children during the Troubles She was four years old but describes her memories in detail. She remembers clay balls, which the gunmen threw at the house before they attacked, ""sliding down the wall"". Denis Mullan's wife, son and daughter Denise were close to him when he was killed in 1975 She recalls her mother, who was also fired upon a number of times, ""going out through the kitchen window"". She went to look in on her younger brother, who was 13 months old at the time, in his cot. Then she went back to her father and stayed with him for, she now knows, two hours. ""My nightdress was covered in his blood,"" she recounts. A form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) means a certain smell - which reminds her of the night her father was murdered - brings back memories, suddenly and terribly. ""I can't exactly describe to you what it's like,"" she says. ""But whenever that smell comes over me, I take the shakes. My legs become weak. My mind becomes blank. ""It can pass within a few seconds or minutes. But for the rest of the day you just feel you've been beaten black and blue."" Denise Mullan was four years old when she witnessed the murder of her father PTSD affects different people in various ways. Researchers have found the condition is particularly common in Northern Ireland. An Ulster University study in 2011 found that 8.8% of people had met the criteria for PTSD at some point. Academics said that was ahead of the rate in other post-conflict societies. Siobhan O'Neill, who is professor of mental health sciences at the university, says: ""The difference here is that people here weren't offered support and services. ""We didn't screen for PTSD, so there is a lot of hidden post-traumatic stress disorder."" Other figures she and her fellow researchers have published are just as sobering.  39%of people experienced a traumatic event 14%have a mental illness 9%have signs of PTSD Prof O'Neill says that contributes to a high suicide rate: ""Our male rate is twice that of England."" She also points out that in spite of the fact that the prevalence of mental illness is highest in the UK funding for mental health is significantly lower compared with other regions. ""It isn't until relatively recently that we've realised the mental health needs of this population,"" she says. ""Until five or 10 years ago, people weren't really coming forward and asking for help. ""But there's been a huge shift in that. ""People are asking for help and we're finding services are struggling with the demand because of the lack of investment in this area."" Mental health has become a much more public issue since the height of the conflict. Denise Mullan remembers that people ""hadn't even heard of counselling in the 1970s and 1980s"". Many people are living with ""hidden post-traumatic stress disorder"", says Prof Siobhan O'Neill Of the many thousands of people who witnessed appalling scenes, members of the emergency services were particularly exposed. Retired firefighter Bob Pollock recounts that after he and some colleagues were caught up in a bombing in the early 1970s, a senior officer ""poured us a brandy each, then said: 'Away you go.'"" Such stories are common among those who were on the frontline, responding to tragedies. Bob says he is thankful he has not suffered major psychological distress as a result of his experiences. But he is aware that his generation may only have started to consider their long-term mental health after they retired. ""Post-traumatic stress can come on many years down the line - people can suppress it,"" he says. ""When you're in the job you have other things going on. ""But when you're coming out of the job you have time to think about things like: 'Was I really that close to that?'"" As a firefighter, Bob Pollock dealt with many major incidents in the Troubles As awareness of mental health has risen and issues that were once taboo are talked about more, many from the generation that lived through the Troubles are seeking out help for the first time. Alan McBride, the co-ordinator of the Wave Trauma Centre, says Troubles anniversaries tend to bring an influx of people asking for help. ""We never really escape our Troubles here,"" he says. Alan, whose wife Sharon was one of nine civilians killed in the IRA Shankill bombing in 1993, has ""no doubt"" that people in certain areas of high deprivation feel ""left behind"" by the peace process and are particularly feeling the legacy of mental health problems. ""In Northern Ireland, there's a shortage of counsellors and a shortage of resources,"" he says. ""The waiting list at Wave is four months."" Experts are becoming more concerned that young people, who were not even born when the conflict was going on, are now feeling the effect too - so-called ""trans-generational trauma"". Alan McBride's wife Sharon was one of 10 people who died when an IRA bomb exploded on Belfast's Shankill Road Prof O'Neill explains: ""Children who have parents with mental health issues are more likely to have mental health problems themselves. ""It's also about the legacy of the conflict in some communities. ""There is unemployment, drug use and low educational attainment. ""All of these things can come together to create an environment which is toxic for a child."" She believes there needs to be a greater focus on funding for measures to prevent mental illness. ""We know if we can intervene early, we can prevent the long-term damage to children's health and life chances as they grow into adulthood."" What set Northern Ireland's Troubles alight? What led to Northern Ireland's conflict? How 1969 violence led to Army's longest campaign The Battle of the Bogside that saw Army deployed The worst years of the Troubles are receding further into the past but the impact of the conflict remains very present. Denise Mullan began to go to counselling last year, she says, after her mother ""hit the wall"" as a result of the trauma she suffered. She told me: ""There are many weeks when it pains me to go. ""But I know I have to continue with it because in 20 or 30 years, I don't want to hit the wall."" She strongly believes the mental health consequences of the Troubles must be addressed for the sake of the future. ""This is how Northern Ireland will move on. ""There are so many victims out there who need help and understanding.""

"Antonio Basco was expecting a near-empty church for the funeral of his wife who died in the El Paso mass shooting in Texas, US, in August. Mr Basco said he did not have family so he invited the community - but was shocked to find people queuing to get in. The size of the crowd was so huge that the funeral company had to move the service to a larger facility. As he walked in, Mr Basco said: ""This is incredible."" About 700 people queued to pay their respects to Margie Reckard, 63, one of 22 people killed when a gunman opened fire at a Walmart store. The line went around the church and along another road. Many people came from across the US. Hala Hijazi travelled from San Francisco to attend the service.She said that she read Tony Basco's story,externaland knew she had to attend. ""It pierced into my heart and soul and made me book a flight to El Paso. We need to show when America is in pain, we are all in pain,"" she said. According to the New York Times, about 900 floral arrangements sent from as far afield as Asia were sent to the service. Some were sent from Dayton, Ohio, where another mass shooting killed nine people just hours after the attack in El Paso. El Paso victim's father 'forgives' the gunman 'The worst thing I've been through in my life' It was standing-room only inside the El Paso venue. The service included singing and a mariachi band. Dean Reckard, Margie Reckard's son from another marriage, said his mother ""loved everyone regardless of colour, religion or politics"". He added: ""Everywhere I look, I just see all these flowers.I don't think I've ever seen this many flowers,external."" Her grandson Tyler said: ""People were telling me they came from different faiths, different cities. It's just incredible how much love and support every single one of you has shown."" Mr Basco and Ms Reckard met at a bar in Nebraska 22 years ago and eventually settled in El Paso. They enjoyed travelling around the US by train. He said their life was ""like a fairytale"". ""She was a lady and she was the love of my life,external."" This video can not be played Roman's friend died in the attack: 'I wish the killer had known the real El Paso' After hearing Mr Basco's story, the funeral home director told the BBC they had decided to cover the full cost of the funeral. Harrison B Johnson said: ""We have had a tremendous outpouring of support after we shared the post. It is our privilege to honour and serve the community to try and make that burden lighter after a tragedy that has devastated our community.

"Mariam the dugong died from an infection caused by bit of plastic in her stomach An orphaned dugong, made famous after it was rescued earlier this year in Thailand, has died. The animal named Mariam died on Saturday from an infection that was exacerbated by bits of plastic lining her stomach, according to officials. Mariam became an internet star after images showed her nuzzling into rescuers when she became stranded on a beach in April. There are only a few hundred of the sea mammals left in Thailand. The eight-month-old dugong was found ill a week ago and refused to eat. She died around midnight on Saturday after going into shock. Efforts to resuscitate her failed. Chaiyapruk Werawong, head of Trang province marine park, told AFP: ""She died from a blood infection and pus in her stomach."" Plastic particles falling out of sky with snow Turtles eat plastic they mistake for sea grass During an autopsy, several pieces of plastic including one measuring 20cm (eight inches) were found inside her stomach. Nantarika Chansue, one of the vets who looked at Mariam, said: ""Everyone is saddened by the loss, but it reiterates that we need to save the environment to save these rare animals."" Mariam featured in live webcasts alongside Jamil, another dugong rescued shortly after her. The webcasts showed her being fed and receiving treatment from vets. Many people have shared their sadness at her death on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Peter Duncan died in hospital shortly after being attacked A 17-year-old boy has been charged with murdering a lawyer who was stabbed to death with a screwdriver. Peter Duncan, 52, was attacked on Wednesday after what police said was a chance ""coming together"" with a group of youths in Newcastle city centre. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with murder, possession of an offensive weapon and theft. He is due to appear at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court on Monday. Northumbria Police said it believed Mr Duncan, from Newcastle, had been attacked after a ""chance encounter"" outside a branch of Greggs in Old Eldon Square. He was described by his family as a ""devoted father and husband"". ""Peter was a kind and caring man who was always first to help others,"" they said in a statement. ""His death will leave such a huge hole in our lives and he'll be deeply missed by us all."" A cordon was put in place in Eldon Square According to his profile on LinkedIn, Mr Duncan trained as an electrical engineer before graduating from Northumbria University with a law degree in 2003.

"Mariam the dugong died from an infection caused by bit of plastic in her stomach An orphaned dugong, made famous after it was rescued earlier this year in Thailand, has died. The animal named Mariam died on Saturday from an infection that was exacerbated by bits of plastic lining her stomach, according to officials. Mariam became an internet star after images showed her nuzzling into rescuers when she became stranded on a beach in April. There are only a few hundred of the sea mammals left in Thailand. The eight-month-old dugong was found ill a week ago and refused to eat. She died around midnight on Saturday after going into shock. Efforts to resuscitate her failed. Chaiyapruk Werawong, head of Trang province marine park, told AFP: ""She died from a blood infection and pus in her stomach."" Plastic particles falling out of sky with snow Turtles eat plastic they mistake for sea grass During an autopsy, several pieces of plastic including one measuring 20cm (eight inches) were found inside her stomach. Nantarika Chansue, one of the vets who looked at Mariam, said: ""Everyone is saddened by the loss, but it reiterates that we need to save the environment to save these rare animals."" Mariam featured in live webcasts alongside Jamil, another dugong rescued shortly after her. The webcasts showed her being fed and receiving treatment from vets.

Writing in the New York Times at the time,Felix, 33, said:,external""I asked Nike to contractually guarantee that I wouldn't be punished if I didn't perform at my best in the months surrounding childbirth. ""I wanted to set a new standard. If I, one of Nike's most widely marketed athletes, couldn't secure these protections, who could? Nike declined."" Felixreturned to racingfor the first time in 13 months in July at the US National Championships.

"Grace 1, which is currently anchored in the Strait of Gibraltar, is carrying 2.1m barrels of oil The US justice department has issued a warrant to seize a detained Iranian oil tanker, a day after a judge in Gibraltar ordered it to be released. The Grace 1 supertanker, which is carrying 2.1m barrels of oil, was detained on 4 July on suspicion of illegally transporting oil to Syria. A last-minute legal attempt by the US to keep the tanker detained was rejected by Gibraltar on Thursday. Iran previously called the detention of Grace 1 an ""illegal interception"". Gibraltar orders release of Grace 1 Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Two weeks after Grace 1 was detained, on 19 July, Iran seized the British flagged tanker Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz. Although Iran claimed the ship had violated ""international maritime rules"", the seizure of Stena Impero was widely believed to be an act of retaliation. The warrant, issued by a US federal court in Washington on Friday,,externalis addressed to ""the United States Marshals Service and/or any other duly authorized law enforcement officer"". It called for the tanker and the oil on board to be seized. It has also ordered the seizure of $995,000 (Â£818,000) from an account at an unnamed US bank linked to Paradise Global Trading LLC, an Iranian company. The justice department said the ship and the firm had been involved in violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, bank fraud, money laundering and terrorism forfeiture statutes. ""A network of front companies allegedly laundered millions of dollars in support of such shipments,"" federal prosecutor Jessie Liu said. She added the parties involved were linked with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the US regards as a foreign terrorist organisation. Although the warrant orders ""any"" law enforcement officer to seize the tanker and its cargo, it is unlikely to result in any action by the UK or Gibraltarian authorities, according to Prof Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern politics and international relations at LSE. He said: ""It would take a great deal of arm-twisting [by the US] to really persuade another Gibraltarian court to take the tanker back."" Gibraltar's government said it had received assurances from Iran that Grace 1 would not sail to countries ""subject to European Union sanctions"" - that is, Syria. The British territory's chief minister Fabian Picardo added: ""We have deprived the Assad regime in Syria of more than $140m worth of crude oil."" This video can not be played Grace 1: Inside the seized supertanker After a judge ordered the tanker's release, Mr Picardo earlier told the BBC that the vessel would be able to leave as soon as the logistics had been figured out: ""Could be today, could be tomorrow.""

"This video can not be played The Agreement Generation - What do they think? Half a century ago, life in Northern Ireland took on a grim new normality. The dreadful rhythm of murders and maimings continued for three decades, with the conflict largely ending in the late 1990s. But while the worst of the Troubles may feel more distant with each passing year the legacy of trauma is very current. Denise Mullan is one of thousands of people living with it. Her father Denis was shot dead by loyalists at their family home near Moy in County Tyrone in 1975. Many of those experiencing mental health problems today were children during the Troubles She was four years old but describes her memories in detail. She remembers clay balls, which the gunmen threw at the house before they attacked, ""sliding down the wall"". Denis Mullan's wife, son and daughter Denise were close to him when he was killed in 1975 She recalls her mother, who was also fired upon a number of times, ""going out through the kitchen window"". She went to look in on her younger brother, who was 13 months old at the time, in his cot. Then she went back to her father and stayed with him for, she now knows, two hours. ""My nightdress was covered in his blood,"" she recounts. A form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) means a certain smell - which reminds her of the night her father was murdered - brings back memories, suddenly and terribly. ""I can't exactly describe to you what it's like,"" she says. ""But whenever that smell comes over me, I take the shakes. My legs become weak. My mind becomes blank. ""It can pass within a few seconds or minutes. But for the rest of the day you just feel you've been beaten black and blue."" Denise Mullan was four years old when she witnessed the murder of her father PTSD affects different people in various ways. Researchers have found the condition is particularly common in Northern Ireland. An Ulster University study in 2011 found that 8.8% of people had met the criteria for PTSD at some point. Academics said that was ahead of the rate in other post-conflict societies. Siobhan O'Neill, who is professor of mental health sciences at the university, says: ""The difference here is that people here weren't offered support and services. ""We didn't screen for PTSD, so there is a lot of hidden post-traumatic stress disorder."" Other figures she and her fellow researchers have published are just as sobering.  39%of people experienced a traumatic event 14%have a mental illness 9%have signs of PTSD Prof O'Neill says that contributes to a high suicide rate: ""Our male rate is twice that of England."" She also points out that in spite of the fact that the prevalence of mental illness is highest in the UK funding for mental health is significantly lower compared with other regions. ""It isn't until relatively recently that we've realised the mental health needs of this population,"" she says. ""Until five or 10 years ago, people weren't really coming forward and asking for help. ""But there's been a huge shift in that. ""People are asking for help and we're finding services are struggling with the demand because of the lack of investment in this area."" Mental health has become a much more public issue since the height of the conflict. Denise Mullan remembers that people ""hadn't even heard of counselling in the 1970s and 1980s"". Many people are living with ""hidden post-traumatic stress disorder"", says Prof Siobhan O'Neill Of the many thousands of people who witnessed appalling scenes, members of the emergency services were particularly exposed. Retired firefighter Bob Pollock recounts that after he and some colleagues were caught up in a bombing in the early 1970s, a senior officer ""poured us a brandy each, then said: 'Away you go.'"" Such stories are common among those who were on the frontline, responding to tragedies. Bob says he is thankful he has not suffered major psychological distress as a result of his experiences. But he is aware that his generation may only have started to consider their long-term mental health after they retired. ""Post-traumatic stress can come on many years down the line - people can suppress it,"" he says. ""When you're in the job you have other things going on. ""But when you're coming out of the job you have time to think about things like: 'Was I really that close to that?'"" As a firefighter, Bob Pollock dealt with many major incidents in the Troubles As awareness of mental health has risen and issues that were once taboo are talked about more, many from the generation that lived through the Troubles are seeking out help for the first time. Alan McBride, the co-ordinator of the Wave Trauma Centre, says Troubles anniversaries tend to bring an influx of people asking for help. ""We never really escape our Troubles here,"" he says. Alan, whose wife Sharon was one of nine civilians killed in the IRA Shankill bombing in 1993, has ""no doubt"" that people in certain areas of high deprivation feel ""left behind"" by the peace process and are particularly feeling the legacy of mental health problems. ""In Northern Ireland, there's a shortage of counsellors and a shortage of resources,"" he says. ""The waiting list at Wave is four months."" Experts are becoming more concerned that young people, who were not even born when the conflict was going on, are now feeling the effect too - so-called ""trans-generational trauma"". Alan McBride's wife Sharon was one of 10 people who died when an IRA bomb exploded on Belfast's Shankill Road Prof O'Neill explains: ""Children who have parents with mental health issues are more likely to have mental health problems themselves. ""It's also about the legacy of the conflict in some communities. ""There is unemployment, drug use and low educational attainment. ""All of these things can come together to create an environment which is toxic for a child."" She believes there needs to be a greater focus on funding for measures to prevent mental illness. ""We know if we can intervene early, we can prevent the long-term damage to children's health and life chances as they grow into adulthood."" What set Northern Ireland's Troubles alight? What led to Northern Ireland's conflict? How 1969 violence led to Army's longest campaign The Battle of the Bogside that saw Army deployed The worst years of the Troubles are receding further into the past but the impact of the conflict remains very present. Denise Mullan began to go to counselling last year, she says, after her mother ""hit the wall"" as a result of the trauma she suffered. She told me: ""There are many weeks when it pains me to go. ""But I know I have to continue with it because in 20 or 30 years, I don't want to hit the wall."" She strongly believes the mental health consequences of the Troubles must be addressed for the sake of the future. ""This is how Northern Ireland will move on. ""There are so many victims out there who need help and understanding.""

"Different approaches to protecting elephants are set to dominate the debate at a key conservation conference starting in Geneva today. Delegates from more than 180 countries are gathering for the meeting of theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species,external(Cites). Some African nations are again pushing to reopen the trade in ivory. However others are seeking the highest possible protections for all of Africa's elephants. Nature's emergency in five graphics Trump to roll back endangered species protections Eleven new species of rain frog discovered Call to 'step up' fight for red squirrels The Cites meeting, held every three years, will discuss a record56 proposals,externalsubmitted by governments to the Conference of the Parties, known as COP18. The COP was due to be held in Sri Lanka earlier this year but was moved to Switzerland in the wake of thebomb attacks at Easter. Key among the items on the agenda will be competing ideas on how to protect African elephants, which have seen a huge decline in numbers due to poaching over the past 20 years. A study published in 2016 estimated that 30-40,000 of the giant creatures were killed by poachers every year with roughly 400,000 left in total. In many parts of Africa, elephants are protected underCites Appendix I,external, which means that trade is only permitted under exceptional circumstances. At this meeting, Zambia is seeking to have its elephants downlisted to Appendix II. This would allow a commercial trade in registered raw ivory with approved trading partners. Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are also proposing that ivory from elephants in their region be traded. On the other end of the scale, a number of countries including Kenya, Nigeria and Gabon are proposing that all elephants in Africa be listed as Appendix I, the highest form of protection available to Cites. ""The elephant is in the centre of the debate once again,"" said Vera Weber from theFranz Weber Foundation,external, which campaigns to protect endangered species. ""Only five countries want to re-open the trade in ivory but there is a 32-country bloc with the African elephant coalition that want full protection and a complete ban on ivory trade."" While all the elephant proposals are considered unlikely to reach the two thirds majority needed to change the rules, some environmentalists are concerned that the European Union will support the Zambian proposal if the Zambians establish a zero quota and agree to not sell any ivory into approved markets. Vera Weber believes this would be a disastrous signal to send. ""Thirty years ago in 1989, the parties decided to vote for the uplifting of African elephants and this basically saved the elephant from extinction,"" she told BBC News. ""And now we look at therecently released IPBES reportthat says that a million species are going towards extinction in the next years, so now is not the moment to speak about any trade in endangered species and the African elephant is an endangered species."" As well as elephants there are likely to be significant debates at this meeting over giraffes, sharks, rhinos and a number of threatened plant and tree species. Some environmentalists are very concerned about giraffes, who they say are suffering a ""silent extinction"" with numbers dropping by 40% over the last 30 years because of habitat loss, civil unrest, illegal hunting and the international trade in body parts. For the first time a proposal to protect giraffes is on the agenda For the first time at Cites, there is a proposal to give these giraffes a measure of protection from trade. ""It is important that giraffes are listed by Cites because currently we can't say for certain how much of their huge population decline is due to trade,"" said Matt Collis from the International Fund for Animal Welfare. ""We do know it is a significant factor though as the only country that currently collects data on trade in giraffes, the US, has reported almost 40,000 giraffe items traded in a decade, from 2006 to 2015."" Sharks are also the subject of efforts to increase protection. Six years ago at the Cites meeting in Thailand,a number of shark species were listedfor the first time. Now at this meeting there are proposals to list a further 18 of the most threatened species including both the longfin and shortfin mako shark. A Saiga antelope released in Southern Russia Another species where countries are seeking to tighten trade restrictions is the Saiga antelope, mainly found in Russia, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. Abacterial infection wiped outhuge numbers of the animals in 2015 but it also suffers from poaching due to demand from traditional medicine. The US and Mongolia are seeking a ban on all international trade in the species, a move that is being vigorously opposed by Kazakhstan, who say that numbers are starting to rise. One other proposal gaining attention, even if it is not likely to secure a majority, is from Israel. They are asking the conference to restrict trade in an extinct animal, the woolly mammoth.  The intention is to try to stop poachers passing off elephant ivory as mammoth tusks which are sometimes collected in Siberia from melting permafrost.

"Grace 1, which is currently anchored in the Strait of Gibraltar, is carrying 2.1m barrels of oil The US justice department has issued a warrant to seize a detained Iranian oil tanker, a day after a judge in Gibraltar ordered it to be released. The Grace 1 supertanker, which is carrying 2.1m barrels of oil, was detained on 4 July on suspicion of illegally transporting oil to Syria. A last-minute legal attempt by the US to keep the tanker detained was rejected by Gibraltar on Thursday. Iran previously called the detention of Grace 1 an ""illegal interception"". Gibraltar orders release of Grace 1 Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Two weeks after Grace 1 was detained, on 19 July, Iran seized the British flagged tanker Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz. Although Iran claimed the ship had violated ""international maritime rules"", the seizure of Stena Impero was widely believed to be an act of retaliation. The warrant, issued by a US federal court in Washington on Friday,,externalis addressed to ""the United States Marshals Service and/or any other duly authorized law enforcement officer"". It called for the tanker and the oil on board to be seized. It has also ordered the seizure of $995,000 (Â£818,000) from an account at an unnamed US bank linked to Paradise Global Trading LLC, an Iranian company. The justice department said the ship and the firm had been involved in violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, bank fraud, money laundering and terrorism forfeiture statutes. ""A network of front companies allegedly laundered millions of dollars in support of such shipments,"" federal prosecutor Jessie Liu said. She added the parties involved were linked with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the US regards as a foreign terrorist organisation. Although the warrant orders ""any"" law enforcement officer to seize the tanker and its cargo, it is unlikely to result in any action by the UK or Gibraltarian authorities, according to Prof Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern politics and international relations at LSE. He said: ""It would take a great deal of arm-twisting [by the US] to really persuade another Gibraltarian court to take the tanker back."" Gibraltar's government said it had received assurances from Iran that Grace 1 would not sail to countries ""subject to European Union sanctions"" - that is, Syria. The British territory's chief minister Fabian Picardo added: ""We have deprived the Assad regime in Syria of more than $140m worth of crude oil."" This video can not be played Grace 1: Inside the seized supertanker After a judge ordered the tanker's release, Mr Picardo earlier told the BBC that the vessel would be able to leave as soon as the logistics had been figured out: ""Could be today, could be tomorrow."" Neither Britain nor Gibraltar have responded to the US warrant.

"Different approaches to protecting elephants are set to dominate the debate at a key conservation conference starting in Geneva today. Delegates from more than 180 countries are gathering for the meeting of theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species,external(Cites). Some African nations are again pushing to reopen the trade in ivory. However others are seeking the highest possible protections for all of Africa's elephants. Nature's emergency in five graphics Trump to roll back endangered species protections Eleven new species of rain frog discovered Call to 'step up' fight for red squirrels The Cites meeting, held every three years, will discuss a record56 proposals,externalsubmitted by governments to the Conference of the Parties, known as COP18. The COP was due to be held in Sri Lanka earlier this year but was moved to Switzerland in the wake of thebomb attacks at Easter. Key among the items on the agenda will be competing ideas on how to protect African elephants, which have seen a huge decline in numbers due to poaching over the past 20 years. A study published in 2016 estimated that 30-40,000 of the giant creatures were killed by poachers every year with roughly 400,000 left in total. In many parts of Africa, elephants are protected underCites Appendix I,external, which means that trade is only permitted under exceptional circumstances. At this meeting, Zambia is seeking to have its elephants downlisted to Appendix II. This would allow a commercial trade in registered raw ivory with approved trading partners. Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are also proposing that ivory from elephants in their region be traded. On the other end of the scale, a number of countries including Kenya, Nigeria and Gabon are proposing that all elephants in Africa be listed as Appendix I, the highest form of protection available to Cites. ""The elephant is in the centre of the debate once again,"" said Vera Weber from theFranz Weber Foundation,external, which campaigns to protect endangered species. ""Only five countries want to re-open the trade in ivory but there is a 32-country bloc with the African elephant coalition that want full protection and a complete ban on ivory trade."" While all the elephant proposals are considered unlikely to reach the two thirds majority needed to change the rules, some environmentalists are concerned that the European Union will support the Zambian proposal if the Zambians establish a zero quota and agree to not sell any ivory into approved markets. Vera Weber believes this would be a disastrous signal to send.
