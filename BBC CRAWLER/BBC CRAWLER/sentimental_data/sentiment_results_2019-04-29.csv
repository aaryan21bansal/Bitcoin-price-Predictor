"More than 40,000 runners will be feeling pretty sore today after completing the London Marathon on Sunday. Elite runner Hayley Carruthers is already back at work despite crawling over the finish line. ""I started counting my steps and my head was gone, I think I lost sight in one eye,"" Hayley tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I just couldn't lift my legs at all and I just couldn't move. ""It was just petrifying."" Hayley, who's 26 and works in the NHS, says she started to feel bad just after the half-way point. ""My legs felt like lead and I felt sick. ""It gradually got worse and worse."" TV viewers and spectators on The Mall watched as Hayley approached the finish line at 26.2 miles before her legs gave way - she fell just metres before the finish. ""To get to 20 miles and think I've still got another 10km to go - I genuinely didn't think I could finish. ""It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do."" Despite crawling over the finishing line with the help of marathon marshals, Hayley still managed to beat her personal best time by three minutes, finishing in 02:33:59. She crossed the line in 18th place and says it was the toughest thing - physically and mentally - she's ever had to do. ""We started too fast and I got carried away with the excitement of being in the elite race and all the excitement of London really. ""We ran the first half far too quickly and it just ended up being a survival fest."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would"" A public inquiry into what has been called ""the worst treatment scandal in the history of the NHS"" is to start taking evidence on Tuesday. Some 4,800 people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C or HIV in the 1970s and 1980s. More than 2,000 are thought to have died. Thousands more may have been exposed through blood transfusions after an operation or childbirth. One victim's widow says she wants ""justice"" and people held to account. Su Gorman's husband, Steve Dymond, died aged 62 on 23 December last year of organ failure - ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man. Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme in April 2018, Steve said: ""It's not the life I imagined in terms of dreams, in terms of ambitions. ""It's become a life of sickness, illness, worry, anxiety. ""When I talk about my wife, I talk about her as my widow in waiting."" Aged eight, Matt (pictured) was given blood products contaminated with HIV -when he found out, he couldn't tell a soul Liz married twice -the same NHS scandal killed both her husbands Steve was born in 1956 with a mild form of haemophilia, a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting properly. He played rugby at school and studied Russian at university where he met his wife, Su, waiting on a train platform. ""He had a massive bruise on his thigh the size of a postcard and it worried me,"" she remembers. ""Steve was not in the habit of getting treatment, so he said he would get it checked out. That was the first time they injected him with a 'wonder drug' called Factor VIII."" Steve and Su on their wedding day At the time that new drug was made from the pooled blood plasma of tens of thousands of donors. In the 1970s and 1980s, the NHS was importing Factor VIII from the US, where high-risk groups like prisoners were paid to give blood. The first sign that something was very wrong came in about 1983. Reports of a new form of cancer started to emerge, first in the gay community then among other groups like haemophiliacs. Around this time, Steve had a minor accident and went to the local hospital to get it checked out. Factor VIII was imported from the US in the 1970s and 1980s ""The young registrar took a packet off the shelf and treated him with Factor VIII. The bruise disappeared after an hour, so it was totally unnecessary,"" said Su. ""Shortly after, they called him back and said he had been exposed to HIV."" The testing process took 18 months - an ""absolutely terrifying"" period. Some 1,200 British haemophiliacs were infected with HIV in this way, including many young children of primary school age. Only 250 are still alive today. Steve was one of the lucky ones. ""It was a huge relief. He was told he was clear of the HIV but no mention was made of the Hepatitis C at that point,"" says Su. Hepatitis C is a virus now thought to affect more than 150 million people, some 2% of the world population. Yet it was not discovered and named until 1989. It was not until 1993, then living and working in France, that Steve was told he had the condition. At the time the couple were trying again for a baby. They were immediately taken off the IVF programme. Steve Dymond died in December of organ failure, ultimately caused by the medicine he was given as a young man ""Steve was told bluntly that the [possible] consequences were liver cirrhosis, cancer, a transplant, premature death,"" says Su. ""Within 24 hours [of diagnosis] we found out we would never have children and that he was going to die early."" It was only in 2013 that a new drug was approved that could successfully eliminate the Hepatitis C virus from Steve's body. By then, though, the damage was already done. Scans showed his liver was cirrhotic and a bunch of cells showed the early signs of cancer. His health declined quickly in the last 18 months of his life. This video can not be played Steve Dymond speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme in April last year In late December 2018 he woke at home coughing up blood. ""They took him to intensive care. He knew I was there and he said to me, 'I love you',"" says Su. ""The last thing he said was he wanted those who had done this to him to repent. Then at one in the morning, as he was holding my hand, he left me."" A public inquiry into the scandal was first announced in July 2017. Since then, campaign groups estimate that more than 150 infected haemophiliacs like Steve have died. The inquiry will consider evidence from approximately 2,500 people, most of whom were infected with, or affected by, contaminated blood products such as Factor VIII or IX. Victims and relatives want to know why warnings about the safety of the medicine may have been ignored, why plans to make the UK self-sufficient in blood products were scrapped, and why many documents and patient records appear to have been lost or destroyed. The inquiry, led by retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, could last for more than two years. Ahead of the public hearings, the government announced more financial support for people in England affected by the tragedy, to a total of Â£75m from Â£46m. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The contaminated blood scandal was a tragedy that should never have happened and has caused unimaginable pain and hurt for victims and their families for decades. ""I know this will be a difficult time for victims and their families - but today will begin a journey which will be dedicated to getting to the truth of what happened and in delivering justice to everyone involved."" ""I want to see justice,"" says Su. ""I want to see people called to account, I want to see anybody found to have behaved inappropriately, criminally or negligently made to explain themselves. ""Steve's dying words were he wanted them to repent. I promised him they would, and that's a promise I intend to keep.""

"An independent body should oversee the rail network, according to Britain's railway companies. In submissions made to a government-appointed review into rail, the firms also said long-distance routes should be serviced by more than one company. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) added that control of commuter routes could be handed over to local authorities. It suggested commuter routes could be organised in a similar way to Transport for London in the capital. Local government oversees timetables and organisation in London, with private operators subcontracted to provide the services. ""We are suggesting replacing the current franchise system as it stands at the moment,"" RDG regional director Robert Nisbettold BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""These proposals would result in a much more joined-up railway and greater accountability to passengers. ""We believe that would be best done by a system of dynamic contracts around the country. ""There would be an overarching apolitical body that would be in charge of this system, dealing with the trade-offs, but also policing it and issuing rules that bind and fines that bite. ""We are putting forward what we think is a compelling vision for both the public and private sectors working together in partnership, underpinned by an easier fare system which would deliver the best fare for any passenger whenever they took their journey."" The Strategic Rail Authority, which was established in 2000, used to carry out this role, but it was abolished in 2004. Cable thefts lead to more train delays, says Network Rail Operators say government should lose oversight of rail Rail regulator orders Network Rail to improve performance Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said: ""In the major northern cities, and across the Northern Powerhouse, this devolution would make it possible to integrate transport better. ""This is already being worked towards, with more touch-in-and-out travel within - and in between - our towns and cities in the North. ""This would be used by more of us as passengers if the government supports the fare system being reformed more quickly."" If you found the plot of Avengers: Endgame hard to follow - constant jumps backward and forward in time and endless reprises of old plots - then you can give up now on trying to understand what is happening on the reshaping of the railways. There has been constant discussion of the best structure for the industry since privatisation in the late 1990s. There is a well-established pattern: pressure for change gradually builds up to a reorganisation, which is given a short period of grace before the cycle begins again. We are at the late stages of a cycle, with Keith Williams, the former British Airways chief executive, in charge of delivering the new structural plan. The Rail Delivery Group's plans follow the Avengers: Endgame model - there are blasts from the past and missed ideas that have been tried before. The idea for a new central, non-political rail authority is both. There was a Strategic Rail Authority, which did some good - and along the way, trod on many important people's toes - which might have played a part in its eventual disbanding in 2004. Handing control of commuter routes to local authorities is an extension of what has already happened on some London commuter routes, with the creation of the London Overground, while the idea for competition between inter-city operators is straight out of Sir John Major's original privatisation blueprint. Mr Williams' task is to make sense of this convoluted plot and produce a plan that survives beyond the normal cycle of change. Currently, most UK rail services are operated by fixed-term franchises, which involve the Department for Transport (DfT) setting out a specification covering areas such as service levels, upgrades and performance. Train companies then submit bids to run the franchise and the DfT selects one of the applicants. Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said the RDG was proposing a ""deregulated free-for-all"" that would lead to fare rises for customers. The RDG's vision is likely to be seen as an attempt to stave off nationalisation, as proposed by Labour. But the government has said privatisation has helped ""transform"" the industry. The UK's rail network has been beset by problems, with the East Coast Mainline brought back under government control in May - for the third time in a decade. Last year, hundreds of trains were cancelled amid a huge timetable reorganisation on services including Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern. This month, Stagecoach was barred from three rail franchise bids, including one in partnership with Virgin Group. The DfT disallowed the bids because they did not meet pensions rules. Virgin was bidding to renew the West Coast franchise in partnership with Stagecoach and France's SNCF. Stagecoach had also applied for the East Midlands and South Eastern franchises, both of which have been rejected. Keith Williams, former chief executive of British Airways, is due to deliver a report on the future of the industry this autumn.

"The UK government's plan to ban the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars by 2040 is too tame, advisers will say. Drivers will benefit if electric cars come to dominate the new car market a full decade earlier, they will claim. The Committee on Climate Change believes the cost of electric cars will be similar to that of petrol or diesel vehicles by 2024-5. But the speed of installing charging points will have to radically improve to cope with the coming demand. The UK government's current policy is to insist that by 2040, all new cars and vans sold in the UK should be zero emissions capable - that means battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric or hydrogen. But critics have pointed out that would mean some older petrol and diesel vehicles will still be on the roads after 2050. That's the expected date by which the government should have reduced carbon emissions from all sources to zero. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts To keep carbon emissions down, look underfoot Glimpsing a world beyond human extinction 'Nature's emergency is our emergency too' The committee believes drivers can cash in by switching to zero-emissions vehicles when the price comes down. It anticipates big savings in fuel and also in the costs of running and servicing an electric vehicle. The committee will say 2030 would be a feasible date for the government to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. But members have to be sure their recommendations are achievable and they're not certain there will be enough cobalt in the world by then to build the batteries needed. So I understand they'll recommend that the end date for new fossil fuel-powered cars should be 2035 at the latest. There's a big question mark over whether we will be able to reliably charge up. The committee has repeatedly warned the government that the installation of charging points is too slow. MPs have weighed in, too. Mary Creagh, chair of the environment audit committee, told me: ""Ministers are useless. ""They seem to think the market will miraculous provide charging point and the government has no job to regulate charging points."" From my own personal experience of borrowing an electric car for a long weekend, charging at motorway services was fine - but in deepest Dorset I tried two charge points provided by smaller firms, but both had software problems which made it impossible for me to get any power. AA President Edmund King says not. He said if battery manufacturers could find enough resources, electric cars might undercut petrol cars on price in the late 2020s. But, he said: ""On balance we feel that the 2040 target is about right and still challenging for industry and governments."" But Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that electric vehicleswill compete on cost with petrol and diesel, starting in 2024,external. China will be in the lead, it says. The Scottish government has a target of 2032 - and the insurance group LV is backing that. It said: ""The UK is in a fortunate position in that motor manufacturers have already matched demand with a production line stacked with electric car and plug-in hybrid models, as the clamour from consumers' changes to cleaner motoring."" A source at the Department for Transport indicated that the government might consider bringing forward the switchover date if drivers were turning to electric cars more quickly. He said the department was in talks with the Treasury over a plan to subsidise car charging points in people's homes. This, he said, would be more economical than trying to get a comprehensive network of public charging points across the country.

"The US has warned that its intelligence sharing with other countries would have to be re-evaluated if those countries use Huawei to build their 5G networks. Senior US official Rob Strayer said any such role for the firm posed an ""unacceptable risk"" to security. It has been reported that the UK might allow the Chinese telecoms firm into the non-core parts of its 5G network. But opponents of the plan have raised concerns about Huawei's ties to the Chinese government. Last week, a leak from the UK's National Security Council indicatedthe government had decided to allow the Chinese telecoms firm to have a limited rolein bringing 5G to the UK. The news provoked controversy, with reports several of Prime Minister Theresa May's senior cabinet ministers had warned against the move. This video can not be played Emily Taylor from the Royal Institute of International Affairs explains what worries security experts about 5G. The US expressed serious concerns at the time, since, along with Australia and New Zealand, it belives the Chinese firm is a security risk because of its ties to the state. Responding to Mr Strayer's intervention, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""Our position has always been that where national security concerns arise in any foreign investment the government will assess the risks and consider what course of action to take."" China's ambassador in London saidBritain should resist pressure from other nations, and that the company had a ""good track record on security"". What is 5G? Huawei: The story of a controversial company Huawei ban 'would delay 5G rollout' Beijing defends Huawei Mr Strayer, the deputy assistant secretary for cyber and international communications at the US State Department, said the US was letting other countries know that if they put ""unsecure and untrusted vendors"" into their 5G networks, ""in any place"" then it was ""going to have to consider the risk that produces to our information-sharing arrangements with them"". 5G is the next - and fifth - generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Strayer said: ""We think the stakes couldn't be higher with regard to 5G technology, because of all of the things we build out over the coming years on top of that tech. ""This is truly a monumental decision being made now... we think there's unacceptable risk in letting untrusted vendors provide that base infrastructure because they could disrupt any of those critical services. ""In addition we're concerned about the ability for a government that has the track record... that China has, to potentially have access to that massive increase in data, personal data in many cases, that could be used in nefarious ways."" Mr Strayer earlier told journalists even allowing an ""untrustworthy"" operator into the ""edges"" of the network created risks of espionage or sabotage. He added: ""We should be concerned about all parts of the 5G network. No part of the 5G network should have parts or software coming from a vendor that could be under the control of an authoritarian government."" It is understood telecoms operators who use Huawei equipment in their networks have been asked to attend a meeting with officials including Mr Strayer at the US Embassy in London on Tuesday. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. The world is going mobile and existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns, particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average and experts say 5G - which is starting to be rolled out in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Six UK cities named as 5G pioneers Huawei was started by a former People's Liberation Army officer in 1987. The company started out making equipment for phone networks and has grown rapidly to become a global leader. It is based in Shenzhen, Guangdong, and is owned by 80,000 of its 180,000 employees. More recently it has started making smartphones as well, and Huawei has now captured about 16% of the global market, making it the world's third-largest supplier after Samsung and Apple. The US points to its founder's military background and potential interference from the Chinese government to argue it represents a risk to national security. Australia and New Zealand have blocked telecoms companiesfrom using Huawei equipment in 5G networks, citing security concerns. But the company is keen to portray itself as a firm with no ties to the Chinese government. It says it prioritises safety and security and that at least some of the hostility is because the firm poses a competitive threat. Should we be worried about Huawei?

"Members of Labour's negotiating team (l-r): Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman The latest talks between ministers and Labour to try to end the Brexit impasse were ""positive"" and ""productive"", the PM's de facto deputy has said. Speaking afterwards, David Lidington said he was ""encouraged"" by a sense from both sides about the ""need to inject greater urgency"" into the talks. He said there would be further meetings between the parties this week. Labour's shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said there had been ""really constructive discussion"" on Monday. She said the two parties were ""getting much more into the nuts and bolts of the detail"", and that she believed the government was ""open to moving forward in our direction"". Cross-party negotiations have been taking place for a number of weeks after Theresa May's Brexit deal with the EU was effectively rejected for a third time by MPs. Ministers insist it is still their aim to get MPs' approval for the terms of the UK's exit from the EU by 22 May so the country does not have to take part in elections to the European Parliament a day later. To that end, No 10 says it wants to introduce the Withdrawal Bill - legislation required to implement the withdrawal deal - to Parliament as soon as possible, but Downing Street said that process would not begin until it had a ""realistic prospect of securing passage"". Brexit: What happens next? Cross-party Brexit talks 'testing ideas' What is Labour's customs union policy? Monday's talks were led on the government side by Chancellor Philip Hammond, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The Labour team included shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Ms Hayman. Labour had previously complained that the government appeared unwilling to move on a number of key areas, particularly on the possibility of a customs union with the EU after Brexit. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington speaks to reporters after the meeting Cabinet Office Minister Mr Lidington has said it would not be ""sensible"" to set a ""hard and fast"" deadline for the talks, warning that it would become a ""cliff edge in itself that ramps up expectations"". But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said discussions appeared to have gone better than on previous days. The sides are a long way off any breakthrough - and it is fair to say expectations are low that there will actually be a deal in the end - but the mood at least seems better, she added. What are the Brexit sticking points? Ms Hayman confirmed that a ""public vote"" on Brexit had been on the agenda for all of their meetings and Labour was ""exploring ways in which we can work with the government on this"". Bur Mr Lidington said it was not government policy and that the proposal had been voted down in the House of Commons. Earlier Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti said Labour front benchers involved in the talks must tell the party's ruling national executive committee on Tuesday ""whether there is any hope for sensible Brexit"", or whether the only means of breaking the deadlock looks to be a second referendum or a general election. The EU has set a new deadline of 31 October for the UK's departure.

"This video can not be played Is this whale a Russian spy? A beluga whale found off Norway's coast wearing a special Russian harness was probably trained by the Russian navy, a Norwegian expert says. Marine biologist Prof Audun Rikardsen said the harness had a GoPro camera holder and a label sourcing it to St Petersburg. A Norwegian fisherman managed to remove it from the whale. He said a Russian fellow scientist had told him that it was not the sort of kit that Russian scientists would use. Russia has a naval base in the region. The tame beluga repeatedly approached Norwegian boats off Ingoya, an Arctic island about 415km (258 miles) from Murmansk, where Russia's Northern Fleet is based. Belugas are native to Arctic waters. Norway's public broadcaster NRK has put out a video,externalshowing the beluga's harness being released. Prof Rikardsen told the BBC that the harness ""was attached really tightly round its head, in front of its pectoral fins and it had clips"". He said there was a GoPro attachment, but no camera. ""A Russian colleague said they don't do such experiments, but she knows the navy has caught belugas for some years and trained them - most likely it's related to that,"" he said. Read more on similar topics: International outcry over Russian 'whale jail' Russia jails Norwegian for spying on submarines What makes Russiaâs new spy ship Yantar special? A Russian reserve colonel, who has written previously about the military use of marine mammals, shrugged off Norway's concern about the beluga. But he did not deny that it could have escaped from the Russian navy. Interviewed by Russian broadcaster Govorit Moskva, Col Viktor Baranets said ""if we were using this animal for spying do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'please call this number'?"" ""We have military dolphins for combat roles, we don't cover that up,"" he said. ""In Sevastopol (in Crimea) we have a centre for military dolphins, trained to solve various tasks, from analysing the seabed to protecting a stretch of water, killing foreign divers, attaching mines to the hulls of foreign ships."" The dolphin facility in Crimea used to be under Ukrainian control, but was seized by the Russian navy in 2014, when Russian forces took over the peninsula. Prof Rikardsen, who teaches at the University of Tromso, said ""belugas, like dolphins and killer whales, are quite intelligent - they are Arctic animals and quite social, they can be trained like a dog"". He said the harness was difficult to remove - the last clip was undone by attaching a hook to it and letting the whale drag the Norwegian fishing boat. ""The beluga had come to the boats repeatedly for two or three days, looking for food, with its mouth open,"" he told the BBC. ""It's a challenge now if the whale will adjust to natural food. Also it needs to find a group - if not, it will probably still come up to a boat.""

"This video can not be played Ruth Davidson: ""If the majority of Scots need a voice to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon, then I will be that voice."" The next UK prime minister should continue to refuse to back a new vote on independence, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said. The Edinburgh Central MSP has been on maternity leave since October, when she gave birth to her son, Finn. She is returning to work the week after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an independence referendum by 2021. But Ms Davidson told BBC Scotland that she and the majority of Scots did not want another poll to be held. She also said Brexit was a ""mess"" and called on politicians to work together to find a compromise solution. Sturgeon wants indyref2 vote by 2021 Ruth Davidson gives birth to baby boy Ms Davidson is returning to the political front line ahead of the Scottish Conservative conference, which starts on Friday in Aberdeen. In an exclusive interview with BBC Scotland, she said it would be ""tough to tear myself away from the wee man"" to come back to Holyrood, but said that ""having a child and coming back to work is a part that lots of women play"". Ruth Davidson is returning to full-time politics after maternity leave following the birth of her son Finn Her return also follows Ms Sturgeon's Holyrood statement setting out plans for a second independence referendum, with legislation for such a vote due to be tabled in May. The SNP leader wants to get the agreement of the UK government before calling a vote, but this has been ruled out by several senior members of the prime minister's cabinet. On SundayMs Sturgeon told her party's conferencethat if support for independence was ""surging"", then ""no Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland's right to choose"". Nicola Sturgeon wants the UK government to agree to holding a new independence poll Asked about the UK government agreeing to a new referendum, Ms Davidson said that ""I'll say no, and this prime minister and the next prime minister should say so too"". The Scottish Conservative leader said the agreement underpinning the 2014 vote had been signed on the basis it would settle the matter in the long term. She said: ""Nicola Sturgeon doesn't agree with Nicola Sturgeon on this. Not only is she going back on the Edinburgh Agreement that she signed, where she said she would respect the result for a generation, the test she put down for any future referendum before the last election would be that the majority of Scots would want it. ""The majority of Scots don't want this, and if they need a voice to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon, I will be that voice. ""I don't agree with re-running a referendum in which the main signatories - including Nicola Sturgeon - said it would last for a generation. She's done everything she can to rip that agreement up since then."" Ms Davidson had previously said the UK government should not stand in the way of a second referendum, telling the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme in 2016 that""constitutionally the UK government shouldn't block it, no"". Pressed about this, she repeated that ""it's very clear that a majority of Scots don't want it"". She said: ""I'm saying that [Nicola Sturgeon] doesn't fulfil her own criteria for a second referendum. I don't agree with holding one, and I will be actively campaigning for one not to take place. ""And were one to take place, I would actively campaign for Scotland to stay in the UK."" SNP deputy leader Keith Brown responded that support for independence was ""on the rise"", and said the Tories were ""running scared"" with their ""utterly undemocratic move to block the people of Scotland having a say"". Ms Davidson tweeted a picture of herself with Finn and her partner Jen Wilson Ms Sturgeon's referendum plan is built around a response to Brexit, something she called ""an unforgivable act of Tory sabotage on our country"". However, she also told her conference on Sunday that the SNP's ""policy is no Brexit"", saying her MPs ""will not vote for a Tory Brexit and will not vote for a Labour Brexit"". Ms Davidson said that from watching from home, Brexit ""looks like a bit of a mess"", adding that ""a lot of people are wondering why we haven't gone yet"". She said: ""My message to colleagues both in my party and others is now is the time, instead of sticking in your trenches and hoping everyone moves to you, is to take that first step forward and start that compromise that clearly needs to happen. ""If the country is going to come together, it does require politicians to come together first. ""We in Scotland know better than anyone that divisions with constitutional referenda often happen more after the vote has taken place, rather than in the run-up to it. ""We've got two sets of people in their trenches shouting at each other - on one side people demanding a second referendum and on the other demanding a no-deal Brexit. ""And actually for the country, the place where we can coalesce is somewhere in the middle. That's where I'm hoping we can get to, and where I'm encouraging colleagues to get to.""

"Rod Rosenstein: ""We enforce the law without fear or favour"" Rod Rosenstein, the US deputy attorney general who oversaw the special counsel inquiry into President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia, has resigned. Mr Rosenstein, who had a fraught working relationship with Mr Trump, will step down on 11 May in a departure that had been expected for months. In his letter, he paid tribute to Mr Trump, even praising the president's ""courtesy and humour"". Mr Trump once tweeted an image showing Mr Rosenstein jailed for treason. Mr Rosenstein - who was originally appointed by Republican President George W Bush - had been expected to resign in March following the appointment of William Barr as attorney general. But the justice department second-in-command stayed in the job a while longer to help Mr Barr manage a redacted public release of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. The report cleared the Trump campaign of conspiring with Russia to sway the 2016 election, but did not exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. This video can not be played The Mueller report - in 60 seconds In his letter, Mr Rosenstein praises some of what he calls the Department of Justice's achievements and its employees' ""devotion to duty"". ""I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve; for the courtesy and humour you often display in our personal conversations; and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity,"" he wrote, addressing the president directly. ""The Department of Justice pursues those goals while operating in accordance with the rule of law. The rule of law is the foundation of America. It secures our freedom, allows our citizens to flourish, and enables our nation to serve as a model of liberty and justice for all."" He goes on to say that ""truth is not determined by opinion polls"". ""We ignore fleeting distractions and focus our attention on the things that matter, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle."" In his conclusion, he echoes one of Mr Trump's campaign slogans: ""We keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we always put America first."" The White House said Mr Trump had already nominated Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen to replace Mr Rosenstein. The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Rod Rosenstein is leaving the justice department, and he's doing it on his own terms. Not too long ago, such a dignified exit would have come as a real surprise to most observers. Donald Trump frequently seemed to view Mr Rosenstein as an internal threat. It got so bad that Mr Rosenstein reportedly expressed fear that he would be unceremoniously sacked via presidential tweet. Rosenstein managed to navigate the hazardous terrain of the Trump administration, however, seeing the special counsel investigation that he initiated to its conclusion. It is that Russia inquiry, with its no-Trump-conspiracy conclusion and open question on presidential obstruction, that will be Mr Rosenstein's legacy. Mr Rosenstein announced his departure with a six-paragraph mini-lecture on the importance of respect for the rule of law, and of a justice department free from political influence. That could be viewed as a not-so-subtle rebuke of the president's near-constant badgering of justice department officials, although it will almost certainly fall on deaf ears. Perhaps, however, it will allow the long-time government lawyer a measure of satisfaction, believing he had the last word. In this administration, that is a not unremarkable achievement. In May 2017, Mr Rosenstein was left in charge of appointing someone to oversee the Russia investigation after Mr Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Jeff Sessions, who was attorney general at the time, had already recused himself, meaning that his deputy had to take on the responsibility. Mr Rosenstein surprised the White House by appointing Mr Mueller, a former FBI director. The deputy attorney general spent the past two years overseeing Mr Mueller's work and defending the inquiry from attacks by Mr Trump, who continually condemned the probe as a ""witch hunt"". Mr Rosenstein's departure seemed imminent after the New York Times last September reported that he had discussed ousting Mr Trump. Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper said Mr Rosenstein had suggested secretly recording the president in order to prove he was dysfunctional. He had supposedly cited the 25th amendment of the constitution, which allows for the removal of a president if deemed unfit for office. Mr Rosenstein dismissed the claims as ""inaccurate and factually incorrect"", and a justice department source told the BBC at the time that the comment had been sarcastic. But former acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe said in a TV interview that Mr Rosenstein was serious when he suggested wearing a wire inside the White House to covertly tape the president. Mr Trump accused Mr Rosenstein on Twitter of ""illegal and treasonous"" activity. While the deputy attorney general managed to weather that controversy, Mr Trump in November retweeted an image of the deputy attorney general behind prison bars. The Mueller report - in 60 seconds.

"Boeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg Boeing's boss has refused to admit that a system introduced in its 737 Max 8 aircraft was flawed following two fatal plane crashes. Appearing in front of investors and the media, Dennis Muilenburg maintained the system was only one factor in a chain of events that led to the disasters. But new reports have raised fresh questions about the plane's safety. It has emerged that whistleblowers connected to Boeing contacted the US airline regulator about the system. Meanwhile,the Wall Street Journal revealed,externalthat Boeing failed to activate a safety feature linked to sensors on 737 Max planes bought by its biggest customer, Southwest Airlines. The 737 Max is grounded worldwide after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed near Addis Ababa in March, killing all 157 people on board. It follows a crash by Lion Air in Indonesia five months earlier, which claimed 189 lives. How can Boeing regain trust? Pilot explains the Boeing 737 Max's anti-stall system Airlines count the cost of Boeing 737 Max grounding Facing shareholders and the media for the first time since the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy, Mr Muilenburg acknowledged that a common factor in both accidents was faulty data from a sensor triggering the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) at the wrong time. The system is designed to improve the handling characteristics of the aircraft and improve stability when the nose is pitched up at a high angle. It was a new addition to the 737 Max when the aircraft was launched in 2017, and was designed to make the aircraft more like the previous generation of 737 to fly. It works by trimming the nose of the plane downwards. In both accidents, it appears to have activated when the pilots were trying to gain height, depriving them of control. However, Mr Muilenburg said that the MCAS system met its ""design and certification criteria"" and pointed to a number of other scenarios that may have contributed to the fatal accidents including actions taken or not taken by pilots. He added: ""As in most accidents, there are a chain of events that occur. It is not correct to attribute that to any single item."" A preliminary report into the Ethiopian Airlines flight found that the plane nosedived several times before hitting the ground. In the case of the Lion Air flight, a report suggested that the system malfunctioned and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it plummeted into the sea. Boeing has developed and is testing a software update for MCAS. Mr Muilenburg's comments came after it emerged that several whistleblowers had contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after the Ethiopian Airlines crash to voice concerns about the company's manufacturing processes. One of them reported having seen damage to wiring used by a vital sensor aboard the aircraft - the same sensor that has been implicated in both crashes. An FAA spokesman said the allegations were under investigation and had not been officially substantiated. Boeing has also come under pressure over the information available to pilots aboard the aircraft, after one of its major customers, Southwest Airlines, told US media it had not been informed that a warning feature previously offered as standard on the 737 had become a paid-for option on the new model. The feature was a so-called ""AOA Disagree"" alert, meant to inform pilots of significant discrepancies between the information provided by two angle-of-attack sensors in the nose of the aircraft. This would provide a warning if one of them was faulty. The angle of attack sensors are used to determine the angle at which an aircraft encounters the airflow over it. On the 737 Max, the flight computers relied on data from a single one of them to decide when to activate the MCAS system, and a sensor failure is believed to have been a factor in both crashes. Southwest told the Wall Street Journal it had not been made aware that the warning feature was not available as a standard item until after the Lion Air crash in October. Mr Muilenburg maintained early on Monday: ""We don't make safety features optional."" A family member of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims mourns at the fenced-off accident site In a later statement, Boeing then said: ""The disagree alert was intended to be a standard, stand-alone feature on Max airplanes. However, the disagree alert was not operable on all airplanes because the feature was not activated as intended. ""The disagree alert was tied or linked into the angle of attack indicator, which is an optional feature on the Max. Unless an airline opted for the angle of attack indicator, the disagree alert was not operable."" It said that once the 737 Max 8 returned to the skies, it would have ""an activated and operable disagree alert and an optional angle of attack indicator"". The angle of attack indicator is another instrument available to pilots, designed to warn of a possible aerodynamic stall. Boeinghas already seen a $1bn (Â£773m) drop in revenuesrelated to the 737 Max crisis, while somecustomers have reviewed their orders. On Tuesday, Virgin Australia saidit had reached an agreement,externalwith Boeing to defer deliveries of 737 Max aircraft. In a statement, the company said it would delay first deliveries of Boeing Max 737 jets from November 2019 to July 2021. ""We will not introduce any new aircraft to the fleet unless we are completely satisfied with its safety,"" Virgin Australia Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said.

Born in LA, Singleton was considered a trailblazer for African-American directors in the 1990s. In 1992, he became the first African-American filmmaker to be nominated for the best director Oscar with his debut feature Boyz N The Hood. Fresh out of college, he also became the youngest ever director to be nominated for the accolade. He received a second nomination for best original screenplay for the film. Early on Monday, the director's family announced they had taken the ""agonising decision"" to remove him from life-support. ""We are grateful to his fans, friends and colleagues for the outpour of love and prayers during this incredibly difficult time,"" they said. ""We want to thank all the doctors at Cedars Sinai for the impeccable care he received.""

In their statements, the family also took the opportunity to raise awareness around hypertension, or high blood pressure, in the African-American community. They said the director had ""silently struggled"" with the condition, and urged people to familiarise themselves with symptoms. Filmmaker Jordan Peele, who is behind titles like Get Out and Us, was among those who reacted to the news of Singleton's death. ""John was a brave artist and a true inspiration. His vision changed everything,"" he said in a tweet. Spike Lee posted a touching Instagram tribute to the late director, in which he recalled meeting him while he was a film student.

Singleton was born in 1968 and grew up in South Central Los Angeles.He told the Hollywood Reporter in 2014 his upbringing had made him ""more of a fighter,,externalmore of a hustler, and it made me really appreciate life in a different way as a storyteller"". After studying at a high school in Pasadena, Singleton went on to get a place at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Less than a month after graduation, he was making his formative Boyz N the Hood alongside producer Steve Nicolaides. The film, partly inspired by his childhood, explored themes of youth and friendship with the backdrop of inner-city violence in Los Angeles. The film was met with high-praise on its Cannes debut and went on to become a box-office success. It offered breakout roles for actors including Angela Bassett, Nia Long and Cuba Gooding Jr. It also offered rapper Ice Cube his acting debut. Alongside the Shaft remake in 2000, Singleton's other credits include Higher Learning and the aforementioned Poetic Justice, starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur. Singleton was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003 He also directed 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious and Michael Jackson's video for Remember the Time. More recently, he had focused on TV projects, directing episodes of Empire and American Crime Story, as well as acting as creator and executive producer on 2017's Snowfall. In interviews, Singleton has accused Hollywood of trying to ""homogenise"" black film-making. ""They want black people to be who they want them to be, as opposed to what they are. The black films now - so-called black films now - they're great. They're great films. But they're just product,"" he said in 2014. ""They're not moving the bar forward creatively â¦ when you try to make it homogenised, when you try to make it appeal to everybody, then you don't have anything that's special.""

"Sala had been flying to join his new team, Cardiff City, when the plane carrying him crashed Two people have been arrested after a photo purporting to show the post-mortem examination of footballer Emiliano Sala was posted on Twitter. A woman, 48, and man, 62, from Wiltshire have been arrested on suspicion of unauthorised access to computer material. Argentine striker Sala, 28, died in a plane crash in January. Police said there was no evidence to suggest a break-in at the mortuary. They also urged people to stop sharing the image of the body, which is ""causing further distress to Emiliano's family and friends"". 'Sala body photo' posted online Sala transfer flights probe urged Sala's dad dies three months after son The woman, of Corsham, Wiltshire was also arrested on suspicion of malicious communications, and has been released on conditional bail. The man, from Calne in Wiltshire, has been released under investigation. Sala had been playing for Nantes before making his move to Cardiff Wiltshire Police said: ""There is no evidence to suggest a break-in at the mortuary, and no evidence to suggest that any staff from the mortuary, or indeed any other council employees, are involved in any wrongdoing."" A post-mortem examination on Sala was conducted on 7 February at Holly Tree Lodge Mortuary in Dorset. Dorset Police began an investigation on 13 February when the force became aware of the image on Twitter, which was swiftly removed, but had been circulated extensively on various social media sites. Det Insp Gemma Vinton, senior investigating officer for Wiltshire Police, said: ""During the course of this ongoing investigation we have been liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service Wessex. ""A file of evidence was sent to the CPS last week to consider whether criminal charges should be brought again the two individuals under investigation by Wiltshire Police. ""My thoughts remain with Emiliano's family for the pain they have endured throughout the last three months, and who should not have to go through the additional anguish of knowing such distressing images have circulated on the internet. ""I would also urge people to stop sharing the image - this is causing further distress to Emiliano's family and friends.""

"Pemba, the regional capital, has experienced more than 2m (6.5ft) of rain and flooding Mozambique requires urgent life-saving relief to deal with the destructive aftermath of Cyclone Kenneth, an aid organisation has said. Save the Children says the humanitarian situation is significant and life-threatening and more funds are needed. The UN gave Mozambique and Comoros Island $13m (Â£10m) for food, water and repair of infrastructure. The death toll in cyclone-hit northern Mozambique is 38, but is expected to rise, officials say. Meanwhile aid workers are scrambling to reach the areas that were worse hit by the cyclone. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The storm struck the southern African nation last week with winds of 220km/h (140mph), flattening villages and damaging thousands more homes. It lost its strength, but torrential rain was still battering the area on Tuesday, with more expected. As a result, aid efforts by air have been hindered. Africa Live: Update on the aftermath of Cyclone Kenneth, and other stories In pictures: Cyclone Kenneth aftermath It is predicted the weather system will dump twice as much rainfall as Cyclone Idai, which struck last month, leaving more than 900 dead across southern Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. The flood risk was compounded by Kenneth hitting at the end of the rainy season when river levels were already high, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) noted. Already, Pemba, the regional capital of Cabo Delgado state, has experienced more than 2m (6.5ft) of rain and flooding. Aid workers have been trying to deliver medical and food supplies to people cut off by the flood waters before more rain falls on Tuesday. Nicholas Finney, Save the Children's response team leader, says that poor people in the region have been hardest hit. ""Those who were already living on the brink of poverty have now been left with nothing. With donations dwindling, we're facing a critical situation,"" he said. According to Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC), 38 people have been killed by Cyclone Kenneth, while another 35,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged. The privately-owned O Pais website reported five people died after part of a rubbish dump collapsed onto homes in Pemba on Sunday evening. It is unclear if these deaths are recorded in the government total. Ocha says humanitarian needs ""have sky-rocketed,external, and the humanitarian response will need to rapidly scale up"". This video can not be played Cyclone Kenneth left roads looking like waterfalls Some 200,000 people are in danger in Pemba alone, Ocha warned. Spokesman Saviano Abreu added that the situation in the northern towns of Macomia and Quissanga was critical, while there were also worries for the cut-off island of Ibo. But attempts to reach those areas had not been entirely successful. ""We managed to send one flight with World Food Programme (WFP) supplies of rice and biscuits, and some non-food items,"" Mr Abreu told news agency AFP. ""But unfortunately the weather conditions are changing too fast and threatening the operation. It's raining again and the second flight couldn't go."" This satellite image shows the cyclone over northern Mozambique and Tanzania on Friday night. On Sundaya spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was appealing for ""additional resources"",externalfrom the international community ""to fund the response in the immediate, medium and longer term"". Tropical cyclones in this part of the Indian Ocean are not that rare. However, according to the BBC's Environment Correspondent Matt McGrath, Cyclone Idai was the seventh such major storm of the Indian Ocean season when it struck back in March. That is more than double the average for the time of year. What's even more unusual, however, is the fact Idai and Kenneth hit in such quick succession. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), ""there is no record of two storms of such intensity striking Mozambique in the same season"". Cyclone Idai: How prepared was southern Africa? Cyclone Idai: What's the role of climate change? It is especially unusual in the context of the trend which has seen tropical cyclones in the region decrease slightly over the past seven decades. But it is far too early - and too small a sample size - to say whether this frequency is a direct result of climate change. Instead, experts point to other elements making the storm's impact worse which they know are related to climate change. ""There is absolutely no doubt that when there is a tropical cyclone like this, then because of climate change the rainfall intensities are higher,"" Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, told the BBC in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai. ""And also because of sea-level rise, the resulting flooding is more intense than it would be without human-induced climate change."" Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there. That, in addition to warnings by authorities ahead of the storm, could significantly stem losses compared with Cyclone Idai. This video can not be played Sarah Keith-Lucas presents an update on the impact from Cyclone Kenneth But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds, andthe area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months,which could complicate humanitarian operations. Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people. Cyclone 'wipes out' Mozambique villages.

Born in LA, Singleton was considered a trailblazer for African-American directors in the 1990s. In 1992, he became the first African-American filmmaker to be nominated for the best director Oscar with his debut feature Boyz N The Hood. Fresh out of college, he also became the youngest ever director to be nominated for the accolade. He received a second nomination for best original screenplay for the film. Early on Monday, the director's family announced they had taken the ""agonising decision"" to remove him from life-support. ""We are grateful to his fans, friends and colleagues for the outpour of love and prayers during this incredibly difficult time,"" they said. ""We want to thank all the doctors at Cedars Sinai for the impeccable care he received."" Boyz N The Hood starred Ice Cube (left) and focused on inner-city violence in Los Angeles Later, a spokesperson for the family confirmed the father-of-seven had died surrounded by friends and family. In their statements, the family also took the opportunity to raise awareness around hypertension, or high blood pressure, in the African-American community. They said the director had ""silently struggled"" with the condition, and urged people to familiarise themselves with symptoms. Filmmaker Jordan Peele, who is behind titles like Get Out and Us, was among those who reacted to the news of Singleton's death. ""John was a brave artist and a true inspiration. His vision changed everything,"" he said in a tweet. Spike Lee posted a touching Instagram tribute to the late director, in which he recalled meeting him while he was a film student. ""With His Passion, His Heart, The Way He Talked About His Love For Cinema And Black Folks I Could See John Would Make It Happen, And He Did,"" the post said. Allow Instagram content?

"A man who has been playing a single continuous game of Minecraft for the past five years says he is devastated to have been finally ""killed"". Phil Watson, 31, of Newcastle, had been playing in the most difficult Hardcore mode, which means his character cannot be brought back to life. Having walked 6,316km, flown 7,798km and jumped 732,389 times, he had got ""a bit full of myself"" and been startled by a zombie baby and eaten by a spider. He says the five-year game is a record. ""It was never about being the best or the longest, I just liked playing it and managed to survive,"" he told BBC News. ""I started saying I was the world's longest Hardcore survivor because I couldn't find anyone else. ""We couldn't find anyone who had lasted more than a couple of months."" Mr Watson plays Minecraft most days, averaging about 20 hours a week. For those familiar with Minecraft, Mr Watson's character was attacked by a zombie baby wearing enchanted armour. He ran away from it and was shot in the back by a hidden skeleton, which knocked him into the spider. He could have survived all of this if he had eaten a health-giving golden apple sooner, he said. ""I ran out of luck,"" Mr Watson said. ""There's so much I could have done, I felt stupid making such an easy mistake."" Phil Watson and his fiancee, Kristin Rosales Mr Watson has more than 3,500 followers on YouTube and nearly 2,000 on game-streaming platform Twitch, where he is known as Philza and met his fiancee, Kristin Rosales.

"Boeing chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg Boeing's boss has refused to admit that a system introduced in its 737 Max 8 aircraft was flawed following two fatal plane crashes. Appearing in front of investors and the media, Dennis Muilenburg maintained the system was only one factor in a chain of events that led to the disasters. But new reports have raised fresh questions about the plane's safety. It has emerged that whistleblowers connected to Boeing contacted the US airline regulator about the system. Meanwhile,the Wall Street Journal revealed,externalthat Boeing failed to activate a safety feature linked to sensors on 737 Max planes bought by its biggest customer, Southwest Airlines. The 737 Max is grounded worldwide after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed near Addis Ababa in March, killing all 157 people on board. It follows a crash by Lion Air in Indonesia five months earlier, which claimed 189 lives. How can Boeing regain trust? Pilot explains the Boeing 737 Max's anti-stall system Airlines count the cost of Boeing 737 Max grounding Facing shareholders and the media for the first time since the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy, Mr Muilenburg acknowledged that a common factor in both accidents was faulty data from a sensor triggering the plane's Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) at the wrong time. The system is designed to improve the handling characteristics of the aircraft and improve stability when the nose is pitched up at a high angle. It was a new addition to the 737 Max when the aircraft was launched in 2017, and was designed to make the aircraft more like the previous generation of 737 to fly. It works by trimming the nose of the plane downwards. In both accidents, it appears to have activated when the pilots were trying to gain height, depriving them of control. However, Mr Muilenburg said that the MCAS system met its ""design and certification criteria"" and pointed to a number of other scenarios that may have contributed to the fatal accidents including actions taken or not taken by pilots. He added: ""As in most accidents, there are a chain of events that occur. It is not correct to attribute that to any single item."" A preliminary report into the Ethiopian Airlines flight found that the plane nosedived several times before hitting the ground. In the case of the Lion Air flight, a report suggested that the system malfunctioned and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it plummeted into the sea. Boeing has developed and is testing a software update for MCAS. Mr Muilenburg's comments came after it emerged that several whistleblowers had contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after the Ethiopian Airlines crash to voice concerns about the company's manufacturing processes. One of them reported having seen damage to wiring used by a vital sensor aboard the aircraft - the same sensor that has been implicated in both crashes. An FAA spokesman said the allegations were under investigation and had not been officially substantiated. Boeing has also come under pressure over the information available to pilots aboard the aircraft, after one of its major customers, Southwest Airlines, told US media it had not been informed that a warning feature previously offered as standard on the 737 had become a paid-for option on the new model. The feature was a so-called ""AOA Disagree"" alert, meant to inform pilots of significant discrepancies between the information provided by two angle-of-attack sensors in the nose of the aircraft. This would provide a warning if one of them was faulty. The angle of attack sensors are used to determine the angle at which an aircraft encounters the airflow over it. On the 737 Max, the flight computers relied on data from a single one of them to decide when to activate the MCAS system, and a sensor failure is believed to have been a factor in both crashes. Southwest told the Wall Street Journal it had not been made aware that the warning feature was not available as a standard item until after the Lion Air crash in October. Mr Muilenburg maintained early on Monday: ""We don't make safety features optional."" A family member of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims mourns at the fenced-off accident site In a later statement, Boeing then said: ""The disagree alert was intended to be a standard, stand-alone feature on Max airplanes. However, the disagree alert was not operable on all airplanes because the feature was not activated as intended. ""The disagree alert was tied or linked into the angle of attack indicator, which is an optional feature on the Max. Unless an airline opted for the angle of attack indicator, the disagree alert was not operable."" It said that once the 737 Max 8 returned to the skies, it would have ""an activated and operable disagree alert and an optional angle of attack indicator"". The angle of attack indicator is another instrument available to pilots, designed to warn of a possible aerodynamic stall. Boeinghas already seen a $1bn (Â£773m) drop in revenuesrelated to the 737 Max crisis, while somecustomers have reviewed their orders. On Tuesday, Virgin Australia saidit had reached an agreement,externalwith Boeing to defer deliveries of 737 Max aircraft. In a statement, the company said it would delay first deliveries of Boeing Max 737 jets from November 2019 to July 2021. ""We will not introduce any new aircraft to the fleet unless we are completely satisfied with its safety,"" Virgin Australia Chief Executive Paul Scurrah said.

Born in LA, Singleton was considered a trailblazer for African-American directors in the 1990s. In 1992, he became the first African-American filmmaker to be nominated for the best director Oscar with his debut feature Boyz N The Hood. Fresh out of college, he also became the youngest ever director to be nominated for the accolade. He received a second nomination for best original screenplay for the film. Early on Monday, the director's family announced they had taken the ""agonising decision"" to remove him from life-support. ""We are grateful to his fans, friends and colleagues for the outpour of love and prayers during this incredibly difficult time,"" they said. ""We want to thank all the doctors at Cedars Sinai for the impeccable care he received."" Boyz N The Hood starred Ice Cube (left) and focused on inner-city violence in Los Angeles Later, a spokesperson for the family confirmed the father-of-seven had died surrounded by friends and family. In their statements, the family also took the opportunity to raise awareness around hypertension, or high blood pressure, in the African-American community. They said the director had ""silently struggled"" with the condition, and urged people to familiarise themselves with symptoms. Filmmaker Jordan Peele, who is behind titles like Get Out and Us, was among those who reacted to the news of Singleton's death. ""John was a brave artist and a true inspiration. His vision changed everything,"" he said in a tweet. Spike Lee posted a touching Instagram tribute to the late director, in which he recalled meeting him while he was a film student. ""With His Passion, His Heart, The Way He Talked About His Love For Cinema And Black Folks I Could See John Would Make It Happen, And He Did,"" the post said. Allow Instagram content?

Singleton was born in 1968 and grew up in South Central Los Angeles.He told the Hollywood Reporter in 2014 his upbringing had made him ""more of a fighter,,externalmore of a hustler, and it made me really appreciate life in a different way as a storyteller"". After studying at a high school in Pasadena, Singleton went on to get a place at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Less than a month after graduation, he was making his formative Boyz N the Hood alongside producer Steve Nicolaides. The film, partly inspired by his childhood, explored themes of youth and friendship with the backdrop of inner-city violence in Los Angeles. The film was met with high-praise on its Cannes debut and went on to become a box-office success. It offered breakout roles for actors including Angela Bassett, Nia Long and Cuba Gooding Jr. It also offered rapper Ice Cube his acting debut. Alongside the Shaft remake in 2000, Singleton's other credits include Higher Learning and the aforementioned Poetic Justice, starring Janet Jackson and Tupac Shakur. Singleton was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003 He also directed 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious and Michael Jackson's video for Remember the Time. More recently, he had focused on TV projects, directing episodes of Empire and American Crime Story, as well as acting as creator and executive producer on 2017's Snowfall. In interviews, Singleton has accused Hollywood of trying to ""homogenise"" black film-making. ""They want black people to be who they want them to be, as opposed to what they are. The black films now - so-called black films now - they're great. They're great films. But they're just product,"" he said in 2014. ""They're not moving the bar forward creatively â¦ when you try to make it homogenised, when you try to make it appeal to everybody, then you don't have anything that's special.""

"This video can not be played Ruth Davidson: ""If the majority of Scots need a voice to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon, then I will be that voice."" The next UK prime minister should continue to refuse to back a new vote on independence, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson has said. The Edinburgh Central MSP has been on maternity leave since October, when she gave birth to her son, Finn. She is returning to work the week after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for an independence referendum by 2021. But Ms Davidson told BBC Scotland that she and the majority of Scots did not want another poll to be held. She also said Brexit was a ""mess"" and called on politicians to work together to find a compromise solution. Sturgeon wants indyref2 vote by 2021 Ruth Davidson gives birth to baby boy Ms Davidson is returning to the political front line ahead of the Scottish Conservative conference, which starts on Friday in Aberdeen. In an exclusive interview with BBC Scotland, she said it would be ""tough to tear myself away from the wee man"" to come back to Holyrood, but said that ""having a child and coming back to work is a part that lots of women play"". Ruth Davidson is returning to full-time politics after maternity leave following the birth of her son Finn Her return also follows Ms Sturgeon's Holyrood statement setting out plans for a second independence referendum, with legislation for such a vote due to be tabled in May. The SNP leader wants to get the agreement of the UK government before calling a vote, but this has been ruled out by several senior members of the prime minister's cabinet. On SundayMs Sturgeon told her party's conferencethat if support for independence was ""surging"", then ""no Westminster government can ever stand in the way of Scotland's right to choose"". Nicola Sturgeon wants the UK government to agree to holding a new independence poll Asked about the UK government agreeing to a new referendum, Ms Davidson said that ""I'll say no, and this prime minister and the next prime minister should say so too"". The Scottish Conservative leader said the agreement underpinning the 2014 vote had been signed on the basis it would settle the matter in the long term. She said: ""Nicola Sturgeon doesn't agree with Nicola Sturgeon on this. Not only is she going back on the Edinburgh Agreement that she signed, where she said she would respect the result for a generation, the test she put down for any future referendum before the last election would be that the majority of Scots would want it. ""The majority of Scots don't want this, and if they need a voice to stand up to Nicola Sturgeon, I will be that voice. ""I don't agree with re-running a referendum in which the main signatories - including Nicola Sturgeon - said it would last for a generation. She's done everything she can to rip that agreement up since then."" Ms Davidson had previously said the UK government should not stand in the way of a second referendum, telling the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme in 2016 that""constitutionally the UK government shouldn't block it, no"". Pressed about this, she repeated that ""it's very clear that a majority of Scots don't want it"". She said: ""I'm saying that [Nicola Sturgeon] doesn't fulfil her own criteria for a second referendum. I don't agree with holding one, and I will be actively campaigning for one not to take place. ""And were one to take place, I would actively campaign for Scotland to stay in the UK."" SNP deputy leader Keith Brown responded that support for independence was ""on the rise"", and said the Tories were ""running scared"" with their ""utterly undemocratic move to block the people of Scotland having a say"". Ms Davidson tweeted a picture of herself with Finn and her partner Jen Wilson Ms Sturgeon's referendum plan is built around a response to Brexit, something she called ""an unforgivable act of Tory sabotage on our country"". However, she also told her conference on Sunday that the SNP's ""policy is no Brexit"", saying her MPs ""will not vote for a Tory Brexit and will not vote for a Labour Brexit"". Ms Davidson said that from watching from home, Brexit ""looks like a bit of a mess"", adding that ""a lot of people are wondering why we haven't gone yet"". She said: ""My message to colleagues both in my party and others is now is the time, instead of sticking in your trenches and hoping everyone moves to you, is to take that first step forward and start that compromise that clearly needs to happen. ""If the country is going to come together, it does require politicians to come together first. ""We in Scotland know better than anyone that divisions with constitutional referenda often happen more after the vote has taken place, rather than in the run-up to it. ""We've got two sets of people in their trenches shouting at each other - on one side people demanding a second referendum and on the other demanding a no-deal Brexit. ""And actually for the country, the place where we can coalesce is somewhere in the middle. That's where I'm hoping we can get to, and where I'm encouraging colleagues to get to.""

"A man who has been playing a single continuous game of Minecraft for the past five years says he is devastated to have been finally ""killed"". Phil Watson, 31, of Newcastle, had been playing in the most difficult Hardcore mode, which means his character cannot be brought back to life. Having walked 6,316km, flown 7,798km and jumped 732,389 times, he had got ""a bit full of myself"" and been startled by a zombie baby and eaten by a spider. He says the five-year game is a record. ""It was never about being the best or the longest, I just liked playing it and managed to survive,"" he told BBC News. ""I started saying I was the world's longest Hardcore survivor because I couldn't find anyone else. ""We couldn't find anyone who had lasted more than a couple of months."" Mr Watson plays Minecraft most days, averaging about 20 hours a week. For those familiar with Minecraft, Mr Watson's character was attacked by a zombie baby wearing enchanted armour. He ran away from it and was shot in the back by a hidden skeleton, which knocked him into the spider. He could have survived all of this if he had eaten a health-giving golden apple sooner, he said. ""I ran out of luck,"" Mr Watson said. ""There's so much I could have done, I felt stupid making such an easy mistake."" Phil Watson and his fiancee, Kristin Rosales Mr Watson has more than 3,500 followers on YouTube and nearly 2,000 on game-streaming platform Twitch, where he is known as Philza and met his fiancee, Kristin Rosales. And he is already is thinking about returning to Minecraft. ""When it first happened I was so depressed I thought I didn't even want to look at Minecraft right now, I didn't ever want to see a zombie again,"" he said.

"Members of Labour's negotiating team (l-r): Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman The latest talks between ministers and Labour to try to end the Brexit impasse were ""positive"" and ""productive"", the PM's de facto deputy has said. Speaking afterwards, David Lidington said he was ""encouraged"" by a sense from both sides about the ""need to inject greater urgency"" into the talks. He said there would be further meetings between the parties this week. Labour's shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman said there had been ""really constructive discussion"" on Monday. She said the two parties were ""getting much more into the nuts and bolts of the detail"", and that she believed the government was ""open to moving forward in our direction"". Cross-party negotiations have been taking place for a number of weeks after Theresa May's Brexit deal with the EU was effectively rejected for a third time by MPs. Ministers insist it is still their aim to get MPs' approval for the terms of the UK's exit from the EU by 22 May so the country does not have to take part in elections to the European Parliament a day later. To that end, No 10 says it wants to introduce the Withdrawal Bill - legislation required to implement the withdrawal deal - to Parliament as soon as possible, but Downing Street said that process would not begin until it had a ""realistic prospect of securing passage"". Brexit: What happens next? Cross-party Brexit talks 'testing ideas' What is Labour's customs union policy? Monday's talks were led on the government side by Chancellor Philip Hammond, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The Labour team included shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Ms Hayman. Labour had previously complained that the government appeared unwilling to move on a number of key areas, particularly on the possibility of a customs union with the EU after Brexit. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington speaks to reporters after the meeting Cabinet Office Minister Mr Lidington has said it would not be ""sensible"" to set a ""hard and fast"" deadline for the talks, warning that it would become a ""cliff edge in itself that ramps up expectations"". But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said discussions appeared to have gone better than on previous days. The sides are a long way off any breakthrough - and it is fair to say expectations are low that there will actually be a deal in the end - but the mood at least seems better, she added. What are the Brexit sticking points? Ms Hayman confirmed that a ""public vote"" on Brexit had been on the agenda for all of their meetings and Labour was ""exploring ways in which we can work with the government on this"". Bur Mr Lidington said it was not government policy and that the proposal had been voted down in the House of Commons. Earlier Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti said Labour front benchers involved in the talks must tell the party's ruling national executive committee on Tuesday ""whether there is any hope for sensible Brexit"", or whether the only means of breaking the deadlock looks to be a second referendum or a general election. The EU has set a new deadline of 31 October for the UK's departure.

"Sana Muhammad, formerly known as Devi Unmathallegadoo, was nine months pregnant when she was killed The jury has been discharged in the trial of a man accused of murdering his pregnant ex-wife with a crossbow. Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 51, denied shooting his former wife Sana Muhammad at her home in Ilford, east London, on 12 November 2018. Mrs Muhammad, 35, was nine months pregnant. Her son was delivered by Caesarean section and survived. The Old Bailey jury was discharged for legal reasons and a retrial has been provisionally set for 4 November. Mr Unmathallegadoo had also denied a charge of the attempted destruction of the unborn baby. Jurors had deliberated for four days before Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC ordered that the case be re-tried by another jury. During the trial, the court heard Mr Unmathallegadoo spent two hours moving two crossbows, bolts, a hammer, a knife in a homemade sheath, cable ties and duct tape into his ex-wife's garden shed. Sana Muhammad suffered a fatal injury in her east London home When her new husband, Imtiaz Muhammad, took a box out to the shed, he found the defendant brandishing the crossbows, jurors heard. Mrs Muhammad was shot and fatally injured on the stairs of her house, which prosecutor Peter Wright QC told the jury was a ""deliberate and quite calculated act of revenge"". However, Mr Unmathallegadoo had told the court he fired the crossbow by accident and the weapon had been bought for a hunting trip in Mauritius.

"Spain's Socialist party won the election with 29% of the vote but failed to secure a majority Spain's Socialists are considering their next move after failing to gain a majority in Sunday's general election. Pedro Sanchez's party won the election with 29% of the vote. But he must join forces with either left-wing Podemos and other regional parties or the centre right if he decides to form a coalition government. However, fellow Socialist and Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said in a radio interview that the party would try to govern on its own. She told Cadena Ser: ""We have more than enough to steer this ship along the course it must follow."" And a senior Socialist politician, Miquel Iceta Llorens, told the BBC's Newshour that a minority government could work with case-by-case support from other parties. ""Podemos, the left-wing party is the main one, but also the Basque Nationalist Party, the Canarian Nationalist Party,"" Mr Iceta Llorens, First Secretary of the Socialist party in the region of Catalonia said. The Socialists had been governing as a minority since taking office last June. The election was called after Catalan nationalists withdrew support for the government's budget. Rise of nationalists vowing to 'make Spain great again' Pedro SÃ¡nchez: Spain's accidental PM on a roll For an absolute majority, the Socialist party, which has 123 seats, would need Podemos' 42 seats and 11 more seats from Basque nationalists or Catalan separatists. Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias said on Sunday evening that he would be willing to ""work towards a coalition government."" Alternatively, Mr Sanchez's party could form a government with centre-right Ciudadanos. However Albert Riviera, head of Ciudadanos, said he would lead the opposition and ""keep a close eye on the government."" Talks on any possible coalition could last for some weeks. With the local and European elections due in May, a government might not be formed until June or July. Populist party Vox won 24 seats marking the first time a significant far-right force has done so in decades.

"The man lost the tips of his fingers at Colchester Police Station in May 2015 Five police officers will face a misconduct hearing after a man lost the tips of three fingers when they were trapped under a toilet rim. Essex Police officers entered the 33-year-old arrested man's cell on 1 May 2015 to remove his foot from a toilet. The police watchdog said ""a number of techniques"" were used to remove him, but he grabbed on to the rim and his fingertips were severed as officers tried to restrain him. The hearings are set to begin on 7 May. An investigation was launched by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the injuries to the man's left hand at Colchester Police Station. The watchdog said it looked at the decision making by officers ""when the man, who was a foreign national presenting mental health concerns, was booked in to custody"" and ""in relation to the techniques and force used to remove the man from the toilet"". It also investigated the first aid the man received and his ""continued detention"" after his return from hospital. As a result, an inspector, three police constables and a temporary police sergeant are due to face gross misconduct charges.

"More than Â£9m has been paid in compensation since 2010 to 16 people who have had their criminal convictions overturned in Northern Ireland. New figures show that 84 people were wrongly convicted of crimes between 2007 and 2017. Charges ranged from murder to rape and included people serving life sentences. At least half of those who had their convictions overturned spent time in prison, amounting collectively to more than 100 years in custody. The figures were obtained through a series of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests sent by BBC News NI. One man, who spent three years in prison as a teenager for a conviction that was overturned 30 years later, has spoken about the significant impact it had on the rest of his life. Cases can be referred to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal by the Criminal Case Review Commission (CCRC). The CCRC, which investigates wrongful convictions in the UK, was set up by the government in response to a number ofhigh profile miscarriages of justice cases including the Birmingham Six. It receives about 1,400 applications a year from across the UK, including about 40 from Northern Ireland. Figures provided under FOI to BBC News NI show that a total of 84 defendants have had at least one criminal conviction overturned in the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal between 2007 and 2017. In Northern Ireland Â£9mIn compensation since 2010 84People wrongfully convicted of crimes between 2007 and 2017 30%Were sexual crimes 90%Of those wrongfully convicted were men 31Cases led to a re-trial 10Defendants were aged 16-20 when their conviction was quashed The Northern Ireland Prison Service said it only held records for those who were found to be wrongfully convicted and spent time in custody since 2006. The figures show that at least 46 people served prison sentences for convictions that were subsequently quashed. The longest single prison sentence served was six years. Twelve people who had their convictions overturned were serving life sentences. Dr Hannah Quirk is a former case review manager at the CCRC. She now lectures in criminal law at King's College London with an expertise in wrongful convictions and miscarriages of justice. Reacting to the figures, she said: ""I understand that people will be surprised as one person who is wrongfully convicted is one too many. ""But it's important to also understand what is meant by wrongful conviction. ""It would be very unusual for the Court of Appeal to say someone is innocent, instead it decides whether any new evidence has come to light that makes a conviction unsafe."" She added: ""So not all these cases will necessarily be about innocence and more about if the criminal justice system applied the rules fairly at the time and whether or not if the trial happened today that the person would be convicted based on the latest available evidence."" Charlie McMenamin was 16 years old in April 1978 when he was arrested and charged with a number of terrorist charges in Londonderry. He spent three years in prison. In 2007, almost 30 years later, the Court of Appeal ruled that he was wrongly convicted and found he was in a training school on the day he was alleged to have been involved in a gun attack on soldiers in Derry's Bogside. The Court of Appeal found evidence showing that an official at the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time told police that the charges were not to be proceeded with, but that was never passed on to the prosecuting lawyer. Mr McMenamin said: ""You have to remember I was 16 years old and I was being told by my legal people that if I fought the charges I could go to jail for 17 years. ""I was really reluctant to admit to something I hadn't done, but eventually I just give up because I didn't have faith in the justice system either way."" Mr McMenamin spent two years on remand and served a further year of his prison sentence. Charlie McMenamin was 16 years old in April 1978 ""Jail was tough, I got a lot of beatings. I felt why should I be here, so I just fought against the system. ""I was being told I was a political prisoner, but I was saying I wasn't because I was in jail for something I didn't do. So as a teenager I had all those battles going on as well, but you just go into survival mode."" He said the experience changed the course of his life. ""When I came out of jail, everything had changed, friends had moved on. I had a girlfriend, my teenage sweetheart, and in my last year in prison she died of cancer. ""Even practical things like travelling, I couldn't go to America and employment was a problem.  It had huge impact on the rest of my life."" In its conclusion, the Court of Appeal said it was left with a ""sense of unease"" about Mr McMenamin's case. It raised concerns about his age at the time and the fact he was denied access to a solicitor or an appropriate adult until after he had made admissions to an offence which was accepted by the prosecution he could not have committed. ""I fought the case for my family. My mother and father, who are now both deceased, had lived with it their whole lives. ""When I found out the conviction had been overturned I was actually physically sick, it was like the whole thing had left me and I was a different person."" The court service said it could not provide a breakdown of why each of the 84 criminal convictions were overturned because of the time and cost involved in a manual trawl of individual judgments. Deputy director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) Daniel Holder said there was a public interest in finding out more about why convictions were overturned. He said: ""I am surprised that this exercise has not been undertaken in order to identify and remedy any emergent patterns. ""One of the alarming issues from the legacy of our past is the circumstance where information is withheld from prosecutors and the courts to provide cover for the activities of paramilitary informants, who themselves were allowed to operate outside of the law."" Those who have had convictions overturned can apply for compensation. The Department of Justice in Northern Ireland has had responsibility for compensation since the devolution of policing and justice in April 2010. Compensation is calculated by independent assessors who look at what the person was convicted of, what the punishment was and what consequences it had on the person's life and whether they had a criminal record before. The Department of Justice said when considering an appeal for compensation for a criminal conviction there must have been grounds to support the appeal decision that a person experienced a ""miscarriage of justice"".

"A man who has been playing a single continuous game of Minecraft for the past five years says he is devastated to have been finally ""killed"". Phil Watson, 31, of Newcastle, had been playing in the most difficult Hardcore mode, which means his character cannot be brought back to life. Having walked 6,316km, flown 7,798km and jumped 732,389 times, he had got ""a bit full of myself"" and been startled by a zombie baby and eaten by a spider. He says the five-year game is a record. ""It was never about being the best or the longest, I just liked playing it and managed to survive,"" he told BBC News. ""I started saying I was the world's longest Hardcore survivor because I couldn't find anyone else. ""We couldn't find anyone who had lasted more than a couple of months."" Mr Watson plays Minecraft most days, averaging about 20 hours a week. For those familiar with Minecraft, Mr Watson's character was attacked by a zombie baby wearing enchanted armour. He ran away from it and was shot in the back by a hidden skeleton, which knocked him into the spider. He could have survived all of this if he had eaten a health-giving golden apple sooner, he said. ""I ran out of luck,"" Mr Watson said. ""There's so much I could have done, I felt stupid making such an easy mistake."" Phil Watson and his fiancee, Kristin Rosales Mr Watson has more than 3,500 followers on YouTube and nearly 2,000 on game-streaming platform Twitch, where he is known as Philza and met his fiancee, Kristin Rosales. And he is already is thinking about returning to Minecraft. ""When it first happened I was so depressed I thought I didn't even want to look at Minecraft right now, I didn't ever want to see a zombie again,"" he said.

"Women who are too anxious or embarrassed to go for a smear test could instead provide a urine sample to be screened for cervical cancer, research suggests. A trial found urine testing was as good at detecting a virus called HPV that is a big risk factor for the cancer. Bigger trials are still needed but experts said self-testing could be a game-changer for women. The number of people going for smear tests is lower than ever in the UK. NHS figures show attendance is now down to 71%, meaning several million women across England have not had a smear test for at least three and a half years. Smear tests prevent 75% of cervical cancers, so while they may not be pleasant, they are important. A smear test can detect early, abnormal cell changes before a cancer develops. Big Brother contestant Jade Goody died on 22 March 2009 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer The NHS invites women between the ages of 25 and 64 to attend for smears. Celebrities and campaigners have tried to encourage more women to attend but scientists are also looking at other ways to screen for the condition to improve screening uptake. Michelle Keegan vlogs about her cervical cancer screening Cervical screening: Millions missing smear tests Some pilot studies are already asking women to try out self-testing at home with a vaginal swab. Now, researchers at the University of Manchester say urine testing would be another option. They asked 104 women attending a colposcopy clinic to try the urine test and it performed just as well as conventional smears for detecting high-risk HPV,BMJ Open,externalreports. Lead researcher Dr Emma Crosbie said: ""We're really very excited by this study, which we think has the potential to significantly increase participation rates for cervical cancer screening. ""Campaigns to encourage women to attend cervical screening have helped. The brilliant campaign by the late Jade Goody increased numbers attendance by around 400,000 women. ""But sadly, the effects aren't long lasting and participation rates tend to fall back after a while. We clearly need a more sustainable solution."" She said larger trials of the urine test were still needed before it could be recommended to the NHS. Athena Lamnisos, from the Eve Appeal, said: ""Finding ways of screening that avoid the need for a physical test and use of a speculum is important. ""For women living with the impact of FGM [female genital mutilation] or those who have suffered sexual abuse or live with conditions such as vaginismus, screening in a non-invasive way could be game-changing for screening uptake. ""This research sounds like a promising early step but is some way off being rolled out through the NHS. ""In the meantime, women must continue to book their screening appointment when they're called. It's a life-saving test.""

"The US has warned that its intelligence sharing with other countries would have to be re-evaluated if those countries use Huawei to build their 5G networks. Senior US official Rob Strayer said any such role for the firm posed an ""unacceptable risk"" to security. It has been reported that the UK might allow the Chinese telecoms firm into the non-core parts of its 5G network. But opponents of the plan have raised concerns about Huawei's ties to the Chinese government. Last week, a leak from the UK's National Security Council indicatedthe government had decided to allow the Chinese telecoms firm to have a limited rolein bringing 5G to the UK. The news provoked controversy, with reports several of Prime Minister Theresa May's senior cabinet ministers had warned against the move. This video can not be played Emily Taylor from the Royal Institute of International Affairs explains what worries security experts about 5G. The US expressed serious concerns at the time, since, along with Australia and New Zealand, it belives the Chinese firm is a security risk because of its ties to the state. Responding to Mr Strayer's intervention, Mrs May's official spokesman said: ""Our position has always been that where national security concerns arise in any foreign investment the government will assess the risks and consider what course of action to take."" China's ambassador in London saidBritain should resist pressure from other nations, and that the company had a ""good track record on security"". What is 5G? Huawei: The story of a controversial company Huawei ban 'would delay 5G rollout' Beijing defends Huawei Mr Strayer, the deputy assistant secretary for cyber and international communications at the US State Department, said the US was letting other countries know that if they put ""unsecure and untrusted vendors"" into their 5G networks, ""in any place"" then it was ""going to have to consider the risk that produces to our information-sharing arrangements with them"". 5G is the next - and fifth - generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Strayer said: ""We think the stakes couldn't be higher with regard to 5G technology, because of all of the things we build out over the coming years on top of that tech. ""This is truly a monumental decision being made now... we think there's unacceptable risk in letting untrusted vendors provide that base infrastructure because they could disrupt any of those critical services. ""In addition we're concerned about the ability for a government that has the track record... that China has, to potentially have access to that massive increase in data, personal data in many cases, that could be used in nefarious ways."" Mr Strayer earlier told journalists even allowing an ""untrustworthy"" operator into the ""edges"" of the network created risks of espionage or sabotage. He added: ""We should be concerned about all parts of the 5G network. No part of the 5G network should have parts or software coming from a vendor that could be under the control of an authoritarian government."" It is understood telecoms operators who use Huawei equipment in their networks have been asked to attend a meeting with officials including Mr Strayer at the US Embassy in London on Tuesday. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. The world is going mobile and existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns, particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G is also much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average and experts say 5G - which is starting to be rolled out in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Six UK cities named as 5G pioneers Huawei was started by a former People's Liberation Army officer in 1987. The company started out making equipment for phone networks and has grown rapidly to become a global leader. It is based in Shenzhen, Guangdong, and is owned by 80,000 of its 180,000 employees. More recently it has started making smartphones as well, and Huawei has now captured about 16% of the global market, making it the world's third-largest supplier after Samsung and Apple. The US points to its founder's military background and potential interference from the Chinese government to argue it represents a risk to national security. Australia and New Zealand have blocked telecoms companiesfrom using Huawei equipment in 5G networks, citing security concerns. But the company is keen to portray itself as a firm with no ties to the Chinese government. It says it prioritises safety and security and that at least some of the hostility is because the firm poses a competitive threat. Should we be worried about Huawei?

"Victims of crimes, including those alleging rape, are to be asked to hand their phones over to police - or risk prosecutions not going ahead. Consent forms asking for permission to access information including emails, messages and photographs have been rolled out in England and Wales. It comes after a number of rape and serious sexual assault cases collapsed when crucial evidence emerged. Victim Support said the move could stop victims coming forward. But police and prosecutors say the forms can plug a gap in the law which says complainants and witnesses cannot be forced to disclose relevant content from phones, laptops, tablets or smart watches. Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill said such digital information would only be looked at where it forms a ""reasonable"" line of inquiry, with material going before a court only if it meets stringent rules. Director of public prosecutions criticised over case failures Hundreds of cases dropped over disclosure failings What is happening to rape prosecutions? Consent forms are not used in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Police Scotland says officers only seek to access someone's phone if it is deemed ""necessary and proportionate"" and that all cases are assessed individually. PSNI says its officers will only seize phones when it is deemed necessary and inaccordance with legislation.,external The digital consent forms can be used in any criminal investigations - but are most likely to be used in rape and sexual assault cases, where complainants often know the suspect, and there may be crucial evidence in their communication. The forms state that victims will be given the chance to explain why they don't want to give consent for police to access their data. But they are also told it they refuse permission ""then it may not be possible for the investigation or prosecution to continue"". One woman, who wants to remain anonymous, says she was raped in April 2016 by someone she knew and reported it two months later. ""I was willing to give the police everything they needed. I'd texted people that night about the incident. The police said they wanted to extract data from my phone. ""I was required to hand in my phone and it was only returned to me after repeated requests after two years. ""When I got my phone back, I saw that it had not even been turned on in two years. ""I might lodge a complaint at some point, but I just felt everything was so invasive at the time. ""They didn't even take the phone off the perpetrator. I gave his name and address. He's not had to face any consequences."" Another woman, Leah, who was a university student from London, was sexually assaulted on campus last summer. ""I didn't have the courage to report it straight away - but when I saw him again on campus, I had to. ""A policewoman called to organise an interview and told me she'd need my phone. I didn't see the need to hand it over. ""The whole thing was very stressful, and adding stress to what had already happened to me. I didn't think it was relevant. ""When I turned up at the interview and didn't hand over the phone, I was made to feel that I'd done something wrong. It felt so invasive. ""I got halfway through the interview and then stopped. It was almost as traumatic as the incident itself."" When investigating criminal allegations, detectives might want to access digital communications when gathering evidence for a prosecution. A screenshot of part of a consent form for 'digital device extraction', provided by the National Police Chiefs Council The move to introduce consent forms is part of the response to the disclosure scandal, whichrocked confidence in the criminal justice system. Several court cases of rape and serious sexual assault cases collapsed when crucial evidence emerged at the last minute, prompting concerns that evidence was not being disclosed early enough. One of the defendants affected was student Liam Allan, 22 at the time, who had charges dropped when critical material emerged while he was on trial. This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape The Metropolitan Police apologised to Mr Allanfor a series of errors in its handling of the case, in which he was wrongly accused of rape. It is understood messages found on the alleged victim's mobile phone included some saying what a kind person Mr Allan was and how much she loved him. There were also references to rape fantasies, Mr Allan's lawyer Simone Meerabuxconfirmed at the time. Critics of the move have said it could prevent victims, particularly teenagers, coming forward over fears they will have to hand over their mobile. Obtaining an alleged victim's mobile can pose a ""delicate balancing act"" for police, says Kama Melly, a barrister based in Leeds. They must weigh-up a person's right to privacy along with their need to diligently investigate all material. Ms Melly said complainants are more likely to hand over their phone for a day or two than if they knew they would be ""deprived of it for months"" Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Nicholas Ephgrave said he recognised it was ""inconvenient"" to hand over devices to police and admitted: ""I wouldn't relish that myself."" But he said it was sometimes necessary to get information from a phone ""with the minimum of disruption and irritation and embarrassment to the person whose phone it is that we're dealing with."" Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Dame Vera Baird said it was a ""real concern"" that people could be put off making a complaint if they expect to have to hand over their personal data. Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women's Justice, said most complainants understood why they needed to disclose any communication they had with the defendant, but not why their past sexual history would be relevant. She added: ""We seem to be going back to the bad old days when victims of rape are being treated as suspects."" The charity is already planning a legal challenge, supporting at least two women it says have been told their cases could collapse if they do not co-operate with requests for personal data. Rachel Almeida from Victim Support said letting police access personal information on their phone could add to victims' distress and ""further deter victims from coming forward"". Civil liberties charity Big Brother Watch said victims should not have to ""choose between their privacy and justice"". ""The CPS is insisting on digital strip-searches of victims that are unnecessary and violate their rights,"" the organisation added. Why do so few rape cases go to court?

"There has been strong criticism of a move to get rape victims to hand over their phones to police - or risk prosecutions not going ahead. Consent forms asking for permission to access information including emails, messages and photographs are being rolled out across England and Wales. Prosecutors say the forms make clear investigators should not go beyond ""reasonable lines of enquiry"". But Labour's Yvette Cooper said there were ""no safeguards in place at all"". Director of public prosecutions criticised over case failures Hundreds of cases dropped over disclosure failings What is happening to rape prosecutions? The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the new consent forms were not a change in policy but were intended to ""achieve consistency nationally"". The forms - which can be used for complainants in any criminal investigations - say victims will be able to explain why they don't want to give police access to their data. But they are also told if they refuse permission ""then it may not be possible for the investigation or prosecution to continue"". Ms Cooper, chairwoman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said the checks and balances to prevent inquiries being inappropriate ""were already not working"". She said that for a rape victim, it seemed as if police would be able to look into ""every aspect of your life - that any of this information could be given to the person who raped you"". Campaigners for victims' rights and civil liberties said having to share personal information, which could include unrelated sexual history, could stop victims coming forward. Sarah Green, from End Violence Against Women Coalition, said the implications of handing over a phone were ""huge"" as many people relied on them for work and they wouldn't be offered a replacement by police. One woman, who wants to remain anonymous, says she was raped in April 2016 by someone she knew and reported it two months later. ""I was willing to give the police everything they needed.

Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the issue was complex but police understood the need to balance a respect for privacy with the need to pursue ""all reasonable lines of inquiry"".

One of the defendants affected was student Liam Allan, 22 at the time, who had charges dropped when critical material emerged while he was on trial. This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape Police and prosecutors say they are now trying to plug a gap in the law which says complainants and witnesses cannot be forced to disclose relevant content from phones or other devices. Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill said such digital information would only be looked at where it forms a ""reasonable"" line of inquiry, with stringent rules so that only relevant material would go before a court. A screenshot of part of a consent form for ""digital device extraction"", provided by the National Police Chiefs Council However, Labour MP Harriet Harman shared an email she received from a young woman in her constituency, who was raped by a stranger and had all the contents of her phone examined going back five years. She said: ""The danger with this is that in trying to comply with the disclosure rules, they've gone completely over the top."" But Conservative MP Michael Fabricant said those falsely accused of rape were also victims and cited a friend of his who managed to prove his innocence using mobile phone evidence. He said: ""Justice has to be done and that includes those people who have been accused of rape when in fact they are innocent."" Civil liberties charity Big Brother Watch said victims should not have to ""choose between their privacy and justice"". ""The CPS is insisting on digital strip-searches of victims that are unnecessary and violate their rights,"" the organisation added. Silkie Carlo, of Big Brother Watch, says victims are being deterred from reporting crimes Its director Silkie Carlo, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme the organisation had seen instances of police investigating a ""stranger rape"" requesting years of data from victims, including access to their cloud storage and social media accounts. She said it was deterring some victims from reporting rapes, potentially leaving dangerous offenders at large. The Centre for Women's Justice is already planning a legal challenge, supporting at least two women it says have been told their cases could collapse if they do not co-operate with requests for personal data. Harriet Wistrich, director of the charity, said most complainants understood why they needed to disclose any communication they had with the defendant, but not why their past sexual history would be relevant. She said: ""Given the amount of personal and often very intimate data stored on such devices, particularly by young women, it is not surprising that many victims who are reporting a deeply violating offence do not wish to be further exposed.""

"This video can not be played Is this whale a Russian spy? A beluga whale found off Norway's coast wearing a special Russian harness was probably trained by the Russian navy, a Norwegian expert says. Marine biologist Prof Audun Rikardsen said the harness had a GoPro camera holder and a label sourcing it to St Petersburg. A Norwegian fisherman managed to remove it from the whale. He said a Russian fellow scientist had told him that it was not the sort of kit that Russian scientists would use. Russia has a naval base in the region. The tame beluga repeatedly approached Norwegian boats off Ingoya, an Arctic island about 415km (258 miles) from Murmansk, where Russia's Northern Fleet is based. Belugas are native to Arctic waters. Norway's public broadcaster NRK has put out a video,externalshowing the beluga's harness being released. Prof Rikardsen told the BBC that the harness ""was attached really tightly round its head, in front of its pectoral fins and it had clips"". He said there was a GoPro attachment, but no camera. ""A Russian colleague said they don't do such experiments, but she knows the navy has caught belugas for some years and trained them - most likely it's related to that,"" he said. Read more on similar topics: International outcry over Russian 'whale jail' Russia jails Norwegian for spying on submarines What makes Russiaâs new spy ship Yantar special? A Russian reserve colonel, who has written previously about the military use of marine mammals, shrugged off Norway's concern about the beluga. But he did not deny that it could have escaped from the Russian navy. Interviewed by Russian broadcaster Govorit Moskva, Col Viktor Baranets said ""if we were using this animal for spying do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'please call this number'?"" ""We have military dolphins for combat roles, we don't cover that up,"" he said. ""In Sevastopol (in Crimea) we have a centre for military dolphins, trained to solve various tasks, from analysing the seabed to protecting a stretch of water, killing foreign divers, attaching mines to the hulls of foreign ships."" The dolphin facility in Crimea used to be under Ukrainian control, but was seized by the Russian navy in 2014, when Russian forces took over the peninsula. Prof Rikardsen, who teaches at the University of Tromso, said ""belugas, like dolphins and killer whales, are quite intelligent - they are Arctic animals and quite social, they can be trained like a dog"". He said the harness was difficult to remove - the last clip was undone by attaching a hook to it and letting the whale drag the Norwegian fishing boat. ""The beluga had come to the boats repeatedly for two or three days, looking for food, with its mouth open,"" he told the BBC. ""It's a challenge now if the whale will adjust to natural food. Also it needs to find a group - if not, it will probably still come up to a boat.""

"This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has not been seen on video for five years The Islamic State group has released a video of a man it says is its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, vowing to seek revenge for its loss of territory. He has not been seen since 2014, when he proclaimed from Mosul the creation of a ""caliphate"" across parts of Syria and Iraq. In this new footage, Baghdadi acknowledges defeat at Baghuz, the group's last stronghold in the region. It is not clear when the video was recorded. IS says it was shot in April. The footage was posted on the militant group's al-Furqan media network. A US State Department spokesman said the tapes would be inspected by analysts to ascertain their authenticity, adding that the US-led coalition remains committed to ensuring any IS ""leaders who remain are delivered the justice that they deserve"". Baghdadi says that he has had pledges of allegiance from militants in Burkina Faso and Mali, and talks about the protests in Sudan and Algeria - saying jihad is the only solution to ""tyrants"". Both countries have seen their long-term rulers overthrown this month. Where is IS still active around the world? Caliphate defeated but IS remains a threat This video can not be played Journalist Michael Weiss: 'Baghdadi is sending a message he is still in charge' Baghdadi's image disappears towards the end of the video and an audio recording of him discussing the Sri Lanka Easter Sunday attacks is played instead, suggesting that this part was recorded after the main video was filmed. Baghdadi says the Sri Lanka attacks were carried out as revenge for the fall of the Syrian town of Baghuz. BBC Monitoring analystMina al-Lami points out initial IS claims regarding the Sri Lanka attacks,externalmake no reference to the town. Baghdadi has not been seen in public since this appearance in Mosul, Iraq in 2014 Baghdadi - an Iraqi whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri - was last heard from in an audio recording last August. At the time, he appeared to be trying to shift attention away from his group's crippling losses, BBC Middle East correspondent Martin Patience says. But this latest 18-minute video addresses the losses head on. ""The battle for Baghuz is over,"" he says, before adding:  ""There will be more to come after this battle."" He also reportedly says the group is fighting a ""battle of attrition"". Analysis by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner For his hardcore followers, there is almost as much symbolism in this video as there is content. The underlying message is not just one of survival against the odds. The optics here are vintage Osama Bin Laden: the jihadist leader squatting cross-legged in an anonymous room beside a short, personalised, paratrooper version of an AK assault rifle, the quasi-military fishing waistcoat, the attentive companions calmly discussing plans, and the long, prematurely ageing grey beard (he is only 47). Over the last five years, Islamic State has largely eclipsed al-Qaeda on the media front. At the same time, IS has been reaching out to potential jihadist affiliates in areas of Africa and Asia that have previously looked to al-Qaeda for support. The overriding aim of this video is clear: to show that despite its resounding military defeat IS has survived and that its leader, with a $25m bounty on his head, is still at large. At its peak, IS ruled over 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) stretching across the Iraq-Syria border. Militants carried out widespread and systematic attacks that the UN has said may amount to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The atrocities included massacres of troops and civilians, and the abduction and sexual enslavement of thousands of women and girls from Iraq's Yazidi religious minority. But by 2016 IS was in retreat. The next year, it lost Mosul in Iraq, depriving Baghdadi and his followers of the city where they had declared the caliphate's creation. In October 2017,they were driven from the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the caliphate. They continued to lose territory throughout 2018, culminating in the group retreating to Baghuz. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared they had taken control of the town, announcing the end of the ""caliphate"" in March 2019. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was born in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq. As a child he is said to have had a passion for Koranic recitation and religious law, chastising members of his own family for falling short of his stringent religious standards. But it was during his time in graduate school, when he was completing a Master's and PhD in Koranic Studies at Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies, that he became involved with hardline Islamist groups. Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? By the end of 2000 he had embraced Salafist jihadism, and would go on to become involved with al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) - from which the Islamic State militant group was born. Since his 2014 public appearance he has remained silent for long periods, punctuated only by unconfirmed reports of his death and a few unverified audio recordings.

"MPs have criticised the director of public prosecutions over failings in the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases. A number of rape trials collapsed last year after it emerged vital evidence had not been given to defence lawyers. The Justice Select Committee said,externalAlison Saunders did not recognise the severity of the issue and there was ""insufficient leadership"". Ms Saunders said addressing problems in the system was her ""top priority"". She is due to stand down from her post in October at the end of a five-year contract. Police apologise for rape case errors All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed Evidence withheld in 47 sex assault cases In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case. But the Justice Committee's report said there have been ""persistent problems with the practice of disclosure"". ""We have seen at least six reports in as many years that have highlighted issues and made recommendations,"" it said. The committee said that despite this insight, Ms Saunders failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings. Their report also said the Crown Prosecution Service may have underestimated the number of cases halted because of issues with disclosing evidence. Data from the CPS showed 841 cases in 2017/18 had to be stopped. But the committee said it knows that the true figure is higher - saying the CPS may have underestimated the number by 90%. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said the police and CPS often see the disclosure of evidence as an ""administrative headache"" - a view which was ""not acceptable"". Mr Neill, a former barrister, added: ""Disclosure failings are extremely damaging for those concerned and can have a permanent life-long impact. ""These failings have caused miscarriages of justice and - as the director of public prosecutions even admitted to us - some people have gone to prison as a result."" The committee found failings in the ""application of disclosure by police officers and prosecutors on the ground"" and called for a culture change, so it was seen as a ""core justice duty"", rather than an ""administrative add-on"". When it came to Ms Saunders, the committee said there was ""insufficient focus and leadership"" in dealing with the problem and that she ""did not sufficiently recognise the extent and seriousness"" of failures within the process. The report, published on Friday, also called on the government to look at whether there is sufficient funding for the system. Mr Neill said: ""The proliferation of electronic evidence makes disclosure ever more challenging, and we need the right skills, technology, resources and guidelines, to resolve this once and for all. ""The failings are symptomatic of a system under immense strain: without change, we cannot expect the public to have confidence in the criminal justice system."" Responding to the report, Ms Saunders said: ""I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority. ""There is an unprecedented focus on finding solutions, and extensive action has been under way over the past year to bring about the necessary change not just in how cases are handled, but in the wider culture within the CPS and policing. ""This is not a quick fix. We will evaluate the measures taken, and agree further commitments to ensure there is continuous improvement."" This video can not be played Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders tells Today it was her decision to leave The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for criminal justice, Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, defended Ms Saunders, saying she was ""fully aware of the extent and seriousness of the disclosure failures"" and ""fully committed"" to working with them. Another review into disclosure is being carried out by the attorney general and a National Disclosure Improvement Plan is being put into place. In January, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ordered a review of more than 3,600 cases in England and Wales after four cases were thrown out of court due to a lack of disclosure. The trial of Liam Allan was stopped in December at Croydon Crown Court, days before the prosecution of Isaac Itiary at Inner London Crown Court was halted. This video can not be played Liam Allan had been on bail for two years before his trial collapsed And in January, the case against Samson Makele was stopped at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, while Oxford student Oliver Mears - who had spent two years on bail - had the case against him dropped days before his trial was set to start.

"Baghdadi emerged from the shadows, appearing in Mosul in June 2014 Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri, otherwise known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was born in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, to a lower-middle class Sunni family. His family was known for its piety and his tribe claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad. As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him ""the Believer,external"" because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards. Baghdadi pursued his religious interests at university. He obtained a bachelor's degree in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad in 1996, and a Master's and PhD in Koranic studies from Iraq's Saddam University for Islamic Studies in 1999 and 2007 respectively. Until 2004, Baghdadi spent his graduate school years living in the Tobchi neighbourhood of Baghdad with his two wives and six children. He taught Koranic recitation to neighbourhood children at the local mosque, where he was also the star of its football club. During Baghdadi's time in graduate school, his uncle persuaded him to join the Muslim Brotherhood. Baghdadi quickly gravitated towards the few violent ultra-conservatives in the Islamist movement and by 2000, under their tutelage, had embraced Salafist jihadism. Within months of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, Baghdadi helped found the insurgent group Jaysh Ahl al-Sunnah wa al-Jamaah (Army of the People of the Sunnah and Communal Solidarity). In February 2004, US forces arrested Baghdadi in Falluja and sent him to a detention facility at Camp Bucca, where he remained for 10 months. While in detention, Baghdadi devoted himself to religious matters, leading prayers, preaching Friday sermons, and conducting classes for prisoners. The US held Baghdadi at a detention centre in Iraq for 10 months According to a fellow inmate, Baghdadi was taciturn but had a knack for moving between the rival factions at the facility, where former Saddam loyalists and jihadists mingled. Baghdadi formed alliances with many of them and stayed in touch when he was freed in December 2004. After his release, Baghdadi contacted a spokesman for al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), a local al-Qaeda affiliate run by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Impressed with Baghdadi's religious scholarship, the spokesman convinced Baghdadi to go to Damascus, where he was to ensure AQI's propaganda adhered to the principles of ultra-conservative Islam. Zarqawi was killed in June 2006 by a US air strike and was succeeded by an Egyptian, Abu Ayyub al-Masri. That October, Masri dissolved AQI and founded the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI). The group continued to privately pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda. Because of Baghdadi's religious credentials and his ability to bridge the divide between the foreigners who founded ISI and the local Iraqis who later joined the group, Baghdadi steadily rose through the ranks. He was appointed supervisor of the Sharia Committee and named to the 11-member Shura Council that advised ISI's emir, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi. Baghdadi exploited the chaos in Syria to gain a foothold there for Islamic State Baghdadi was later appointed to ISI's Co-ordination Committee, which oversaw communication with the group's commanders in Iraq. After the deaths of ISI's founder and its emir in April 2010, the Shura Council chose Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to be the new emir. Baghdadi set about rebuilding the organisation, which had been decimated by US special operations forces. Hoping to capitalise on growing unrest in Syria in 2011, Baghdadi ordered one of his Syrian operatives to establish a secret branch of ISI in the country, later known as al-Nusra Front. Baghdadi soon fell out with the leader of al-Nusra, Abu Mohammed al-Julani, who wanted to collaborate with the mainstream Sunni rebels fighting Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. But Baghdadi wanted to establish his own state through brute force before going after Assad. In the spring of 2013, Baghdadi announced that al-Nusra was part of ISI, which he renamed ""Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant"" (Isis/Isil). So-called Islamic State was formed in defiance of the al-Qaeda leadership When al-Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to grant al-Nusra its independence, Baghdadi refused. In February 2014, Zawahiri expelled Isis from al-Qaeda. Isis responded by fighting al-Nusra and consolidating its hold on eastern Syria, where Baghdadi imposed harsh religious laws. Its stronghold secure, Baghdadi ordered his men to expand into western Iraq. In June 2014, Isis captured Iraqi's second largest city, Mosul, and soon after, the group's spokesman proclaimed the return of the caliphate, renaming Isis ""Islamic State"". Days later, Baghdadi delivered a Friday sermon in Mosul and declared himself caliph. The media has wrongly reported Baghdadi's demise several times. But if he dies, the organisation will lose a skilled mediator, a ruthless politician, a religious scholar, and a man of noble lineage - an unusual combination for the leader of a global militant organisation, much less a proto-state.

"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says 31% of graduates are overeducated for the job they are doing. For those graduating before 1992, the number was only 22%, but this jumped to 34% for those graduating after 2007. London had the highest proportion of overeducated workers in the UK, with about 25% overqualified for their job. Graduates in arts and humanities were more likely to be under-using their education. ""We note that the incidence of overeducation does seem higher for certain age groups,"" and in particular for those aged 25 to 49 years, it said. ""The relatively high incidence of overeducation for the 35 to 49 years age group indicates that overeducation is a persistent phenomenon in the UK labour market,"" it said. The overeducation rate for all workers of about 16% for 2017 is largely unchanged since 2006. And, while it says it can not be sure, the ONS says priorities for some people over-and-above money may contribute to their below-par post-graduation earnings.  This, it says, may account for the unchanging rate of overeducation. The ONS said it assumed education was a measure of ability and did not distinguish it from skill.  It also said it assumed wages as its measure of productivity, meaning the research does not show whether overeducation has an effect on output per worker. ""A person can be overeducated if they possess more education than required for the job,"" the ONS says. But it also uses the term to mean when a worker's skills and knowledge are not being used. ""It can also be seen as a form of underemployment, hence contributing to the extent of labour market slack,"" the national stats gatherer says. However, a degree still attracts higher earnings, according to government data from earlier this month. And two degrees will yield even more. Graduate earnings figures show that up to the age of 30, postgraduates typically earn Â£9,000, or about 40%, more than those without degrees. This is double the Â£4,500 per year gap - about 21% - between those with an undergraduate degree and non-graduates. Elizabeth graduated recently from the University of Manchester with a degree in chemical engineering. She has not been able to find a degree-level job and has worked a succession of minimum wage jobs. ""I'm sad to have become one of those statistics of female graduates who never become engineers, and dread the next 50 years in minimum wage jobs, because I have no way of getting out of the situation.  I should have realised people don't want to employ women in that field,"" she said. ""I regret my choice of degree every day.  I could have been doing anything by now.  People ask me why I am a kitchen porter when I can speak languages and have a degree.  It's sad that people who are less qualified are much further on in their career than me. ""A lack of a driving licence seems to have proved a huge hindrance to my progression, and in many ways might have been more useful than the degree.""

"The stage shows have been cancelled after props and the set were stolen The production company behind children's play Dear Zoo has had to cancel all its UK shows after its tour van was stolen. The heavily-branded van containing Â£50,000 worth of props and staging was stolen in Peterborough on Saturday. Producer Chris Davis said ""thousands of children will be disappointed"" as all 56 remaining shows had been cancelled. He said five actors and the stage manager would have to be made redundant because of the cancellations. The Mercedes truck, brightly painted with the show's logo and a lion in a cage, had been parked overnight on Cecil Road in Peterborough, where the stage manager was staying following performances in the city. It wastaken at about 01:15 BST on Saturdayand its GPS tracker shows it was driven up the A1 and the A52. The truck was stolen in Peterborough and has a tracking device fitted The signal stopped transmitting at about 02:10 at Sedgebrook, near Grantham in Lincolnshire. The production company believes the tracker was disabled by the thieves. The van contained the entire set, costumes and puppet animals used in the Dear Zoo Live show - a stage production of the popular book by Rod Campbell about a child who writes to a zoo asking to be sent a pet. The book was published in 1982 and has sold more than eight million copies worldwide. Mr Davis described the theft of the van and contents as ""a tragedy"". The play is based on a children's book which has sold more than eight million copies ""It will take more than a month to replace the contents and thousands of children will be disappointed,"" he said. ""I can replace the van, but I can't replace the show."" The contents were ""worth nothing to these thieves - they're no use to anyone but us"", Mr Davis added. All remaining shows have been cancelled, including those in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, which were due to take following the Peterborough shows and had already sold out. Mr Davis said all tickets would be refunded and they hoped to be ready to tour again in September. Parents have shared messages of support for the show on social media. One woman posted on Facebook: ""Absolutely gutted for you guys! Was so looking forward to seeing you in East Grinstead, still we're looking forward to seeing you in the autumn and will appreciate it more."" Another said it was a ""really big shame"" as she had planned to take her god-daughters to see the show in Folkestone on Wednesday and the girls were ""so excited"".

"Santiago Abascal denies Vox is far-right and prefers to focus on Spanish unity When Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain's Vox party, was asked to explain its recent success, he said it was because it was ""in step with what millions of Spaniards think"". Vox has been derided as far-right and populist, anti-immigration and anti-Islam. But the 42-year-old Basque says instead it ""defends the constitutional order, constitutional reform in some areas, the unity of Spain and centralisation of the state, and wants immigration to be brought under control"". For a long time after its foundation in 2014, Vox struggled to make an impact on the Spanish political landscape. But ever since it filled a Madrid sports centre with 9,000 supporters last month, the party has been taken much more seriously. While one recent poll by Celeste-Tel gave Vox a 1% share of the electorate, five times more support than in January, another pollster, Metroscopia, put the party at just over 5% of voter intentions. That would be equivalent to a million votes. Its recent rise has coincided with Spain's newfound status as the main point of arrival for migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe and a more tolerant approach to immigration by a new Socialist government. ""Their message is a very standard right-wing one - they support law and order and they're against immigration,"" says JosÃ© Fernandez-Albertos of Spain's National Research Council (CSIC). But, he adds, ""the Catalan issue is what has most motivated their support so far"". Fighting for different futures in Catalonia Million rally for Catalonia independence Venezuelans escape to Spain and ask to return favour In recent years, the nationalist government of Catalonia has been campaigning to break away from Spain and in October 2017 the region's parliament issued a declaration of independence, before Madrid stepped in and introduced direct rule for several months. Santiago Abascal insists his party's policies are in step with how many Spaniards think The two main parties on the right, the Popular Party (PP), of which Mr Abascal used to be a member, and Ciudadanos (Citizens), have taken a firmly pro-union line against the independence movement. However, for many Spaniards they have not been tough enough and Vox has gone a step further, presenting lawsuits against the leaders of last year's failed secession bid. Many Vox policies, particularly on immigration, and its frequently voiced hostility to Islam, have drawn comparisons with far-right and populist parties elsewhere in Europe. The party proposes to ""make Spain great again"" and critics have described its ideology as a racist, nationalist throwback to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Opponents of Vox see it as a far-right party A Jesuit school which had agreed to host the Vox rally in Valencia changed its mind, apparently concerned at the party's reputation, causing the event to be moved elsewhere. Why Franco's tomb is a headache for Spain French far-right leader Le Pen ordered to take psychiatric tests Outcry at German far-right child informer scheme Some of those who attended the rally said there was a social stigma attached to expressing support for Vox. ""People call me fascist, xenophobe, loads of things,"" said hotel worker Ana Ferrer, who was one of them. ""But those who really know me know I'm not like that. My partner is a woman, for example, and I'm not Catholic. For me, [Vox] is not on the far right."" Vox has attracted big numbers to its rallies as it pulls in supporters disaffected by other parties Vox's leaders also reject the far-right label, insisting it is a party of ""extreme necessity"" rather than extremism and its overall support for Spain's membership of the EU differentiates it from many populist and far-right movements across Europe. Mr FernÃ¡ndez-Albertos believes that Vox's specific appeal to middle-class, right-wing Spaniards means it will struggle for the kind of support that cuts across society in the same way as France's National Rally, and to a lesser extent Germany's AfD. But it could still influence the national debate, even if it fails to secure many seats in the next general election. ""If they emphasise immigration, anti-Islamism, the centrality of the Catalan issue and how hard we should be on Catalan secessionists, that might affect indirectly how the PP and also maybe how Ciudadanos behave on those issues,"" he said.

"Justene Reece took her own life as a ""direct result"" of Allen's actions Police failed to link nearly half the reports of stalking about a woman's ex-partner before she killed herself. Nicholas Allenwas jailed for 10 yearsfor the manslaughter of Justene Reece, who killed herself as a ""direct result"" of his controlling behaviour. An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found Staffordshire Police officers missed the ""bigger picture"" of his offending. The force said it had improved its investigative approach to stalking. Ms Reece, 46, from Stafford, hanged herself in February 2017, leaving a note saying ""I've run out of fight"". Latest news from the West Midlands The IOPCbegan its investigation,externala month later. Between an initial report in September 2016 and Ms Reece's death, the IOPC found that, of 34 incidents reported by Ms Reece, her friends, family and other agencies, 16 were not cross-referenced with any previous reports. It said seven of the 14 incidents reported by Ms Reece herself were not cross-checked at all. Allen's trial heard he had a string of convictions for assault and harassment against other partners, and had sent Ms Reece abusive voicemails, texts and Facebook messages and stalked her. His conviction was thought to be the first manslaughter case brought in such circumstances. Nicholas Allen was jailed for 10 years in 2017 Ms Reece obtained a non-molestation order against Allen in November 2016, which he breached seven times, the IOPC said. The police watchdog said that in December 2016, a now-retired senior officer chose not to arrest Allen for a reported breach of the order, because it was felt Ms Reece had been complicit by going with him to a pub after he turned up at the home where she was staying. The IOPC said it was the responsibility of the offender and not the victim to ensure the orders were complied with, and so did not accept the officer's reasoning - finding it unsatisfactory. Seven officers and one member of police staff will receive management action, as their performance was not judged to have met expected standards over the handling of calls and not completing risk assessments. ""It is evident from our investigation that there were potential opportunities for the police to engage more robustly with Mr Allen,"" IOPC regional director Derrick Campbell said. ""The bigger picture of the level of harassment and stalking being perpetrated was not properly seen by police."" In a statement,external, Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker apologised. The force has also accepted training recommendations to improve the linking of incidents and crimes. ""Since the tragic death of Justene we have made improvements to our safeguarding and investigative approach to stalking, but we have more work to do,"" Mr Baker said. ""We are committed to ensuring officers and staff understand stalking and its devastating impact so they can better respond to incidents reported to us.""

"Detectives have found the car but want to speak to anyone who saw it on the night of the murder CCTV images of a car have been released by police investigating the murder of T2 Trainspotting actor Bradley Welsh outside his Edinburgh home. The former boxer sustained fatal injuries when he was shot in Chester Street at about 20:00 on Wednesday 17 April. Detectives have issued photographs of a grey Ford Kuga SUV which was in the area at the time. The vehicle was recovered by police but officers want to trace its movements. The Ford is known to have been in nearby William Street about 30 minutes prior to the shooting, and was then driven through the town, arriving at Kaimes Avenue in Kirknewton at about 21:00 on the same evening. The car was recovered by police on Saturday 20 April, at which time it had the registration number CX68 XVV. Police said Mr Welsh had been returning home from his Holyrood Boxing gym when he was shot. His partner and young child were inside the building at the time. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Bradley Welsh sustained fatal injuries in a shooting outside his home Anyone who saw this vehicle or has any details relating to its movements is asked to contact police immediately. Det Supt Allan Burton, of Police Scotland, said: ""We are still undertaking significant lines of inquiry in our investigation and would now like to ask for assistance from the public in helping us establish the movements of this Ford Kuga. ""We want to hear from anyone who saw the vehicle in and around Chester Street prior to the incident. This will help us identify any occupants and the route taken prior to arriving in Kirknewton.

"Pan-European ambitions at a nationalist rally in Milan (18 May 19) Nationalism has always been a feature across Europe's political spectrum but there has been a recent boom in voter support for right-wing and populist parties. It is visible from Germany, where the AfD has become the biggest opposition party in the Bundestag, to Spain, where Vox has become the third largest force in parliament. In part, voters are frustrated with the political establishment, but they also have concerns about globalisation, immigration, a dilution of national identity and the European Union. In the European Parliament, nine far-right parties have formed a new bloc, called Identity and Democracy (ID). So where in Europe's political landscape do right-wing nationalists hold sway? Italy's Matteo Salvini - leader of the League - is a key figure in Europe's nationalist scene, despite the collapse of his ruling coalition with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement in August. A surprise deal between Five Star and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) ended Mr Salvini's tenure as interior minister. The leader of Italy's right-wing League - Matteo Salvini - meets a supporter The League's popularity coincided with the aftermath of the financial crisis and a big influx ofsub-Saharan migrants from North Africa in 2016,external. As interior minister, Mr Salvini spearheaded an anti-immigration policy that barred humanitarian rescue ships from Italian ports. His party has long had a Eurosceptic reputation. It is leading the Italian opinion polls and has 28 MEPs in the new EU Parliament's 73-strong ID bloc. Can Italy's populist leader return to power? In 2017 the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the federal parliament for the first time with 12.6% of the vote, becoming Germany's biggest opposition party. From its beginnings as an anti-euro party, it has pushed for strict anti-immigration policies, embraced hostility towards Islam and broken decades-old anti-Nazi taboos. It enjoyed a surge in popularity as Germany allowed in over a million undocumented migrants. Despite attempts by Chancellor Angela Merkel to toughen her stance on immigration, the party has added to its electoral success and now has representatives in every state parliament. In October 2019the AfD came ahead of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU)in the eastern state of Thuringia - a shock to the political establishment. An AfD ""anti-Islamisation"" rally in Rostock, eastern Germany (22 Sep 18) The AfD is strongest in ex-communist eastern Germany. Its supporters chant ""Wir sind das Volk!"" (We are the People) - an emotive slogan from the anti-communist protests of 1989. How right-wing is Germany's AfD? The AfD is also Eurosceptic and Nigel Farage, leader of the UK's Brexit Party, took part in its 2017 election campaign. The Brexit Party wasthe clear winner in the UK's European electionsin May, despite its lack of seats in the UK Parliament. The party insists that the UK must leave the EU unconditionally: it argues that this was mandated by the Leave vote in the UK's 2016 referendum. One of the big political stories in Spain has been the sudden rise of the far-right Vox party. Spain held its fourth general election in four years on 10 November and Vox surged into third place, doubling its seats to 52. It only entered parliament for the first time in April. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? Vox styles itself as defending the unity of the Spanish state, with a promise to deport illegal immigrants and repeal laws against gender violence. It has made major gains by calling for a suspension of autonomy for the north-eastern Catalonia region, after separatists failed in their push for independence in October 2017. Many believed that Spaniards would never endorse a far-right party due to its history under dictator Francisco Franco, who died in 1975. Just a single seat had been won by a far-right candidate since then - in 1979. How Spain's far-right Vox party found its footing The Freedom Party (FPÃ) became the only far-right party in power in Western Europe when it joined a coalition as junior partner with conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz in 2017. His People's Party, along with the centre-left Social Democrats, have long dominated Austrian politics. As in Germany, the migrant crisis that unfolded in 2015 was also seen as key to the FPÃ's success, and an issue they long campaigned on. During its time in power the Freedom Party became caught up in a series of race rows. Then, party leader Heinz-Christian Strache and parliament group head Johann Gudenus were caught up in a scandal over a video ""sting"" filmed in Ibiza in 2017. Mr Strache resigned and the fallout led to the far-right party quitting the government and support for the FPÃ fell sharply to 16% in September elections. Deputy mayor resigns over 'racist' rat poem The young Austrian leader sharing power with the far right Despite the efforts of leader Marine Le Pen to make the far right palatable to France's mainstream, she was comprehensively defeated by Emmanuel Macron for the presidency in May 2017. Her National Front (FN) failed to break through in parliamentary elections the following month, and the party was then renamed the National Rally (Rassemblement National). Ms Le Pen's party is opposed to the euro and blames the EU for mass immigration, and she has found a common voice with other nationalist and far-right parties in Europe. Marine Le Pen renamed her National Front party as the National Rally There is evidence that the grassroots ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protest movement has attracted some activists from the far right. Theanti-establishment protests over the cost of livinghave posed probably the biggest challenge to the Macron presidency. Some gilets jaunes protestersinclude anti-Semitic abuse in their angry campaign. SD leader Jimmie Akesson has ejected extremists from the party Theanti-immigration Sweden Democrats (SD) made significant gainsin the 2018 general election, winning about 18% of the vote. The party has its roots in neo-Nazism, but it rebranded itself in recent years and first entered parliament in 2010. It opposes multiculturalism and wants strict immigration controls. As with many of the countries featured here, though, the picture is complex. Sweden has welcomed more asylum seekers per capita than any other European country and hasone of the most positive attitudes towards migrants,external. The far-right Finns Party were narrowly beaten into second place in the April 2019 general election, coming within 0.2% of the left-wing Social Democratic Party (SDP). Its success was built on two policies: opposition to immigration and a rejection of ambitious policies aimed at combating climate change. It was an extraordinary recovery for a party that had also done well in the previous vote in 2015 but had since faded in popularity because of party splits. Estonia's far-right Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) won its first seats in parliament in the 2015 election. Four years later,EKRE has more than doubled its share of the vote to nearly 18%, making it the third-largest party. It used that power to negotiate a place in government, as it joined fellow runners-up the Centre and Pro Patria parties to stop liberal leader Kaja Kallas from becoming Estonia's first woman prime minister. EKRE campaigned on an anti-immigration platform, and is also critical of same-sex marriage. Its leader, Martin Helme, once said that only white people should be allowed to move to Estonia. The far-right Confederation party got 6.8% of the vote in Poland's 2019 general election. But the main story of the election was the convincing win for conservative Law and Justice (PiS), returning to power with 43.6% of the vote. This video can not be played Tens of thousands of nationalists marched through Warsaw PiS is led by a veteran anti-communist campaigner, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, whose bedrock support is in rural Poland, with its deep-rooted Catholic traditions. The party is strong on social welfare, as well as nationalism, making it rather different from many other right-wing parties in Europe. The PiS government's controversial overhaul of Poland's judiciary has put itin dispute with the EU Commission. In 2018, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban secured a third term in office with a landslide victory in an election dominated by immigration. The victory, he said, gave Hungarians ""the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary"". Mr Orban's Fidesz party easily won the 2018 elections Mr Orban has long presented himself as the defender of Hungary and Europe against Muslim migrants, once warning of the threat of ""a Europe with a mixed population and no sense of identity"". In March 2019 Europe's mainstream centre-right grouping, the EPP, suspended Fidesz because of its anti-EU stance. Hungary has two nationalist parties - with Jobbik attempting to escape its far-right past and appeal to centrist voters - and gaining 19% of the vote in 2018. The man who thinks Europe is being invaded Europe's centre-right suspends Orban party Although it fell a long way short of a majority,the anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) was the largest party in this year's general election. The party is led by former Prime Minister Janez Jansa, a supporter of Hungary's Viktor Orban. He has said he wants Slovenia to ""become a country that will put the wellbeing and security of Slovenians first"". An anti-immigration, nationalist party called Greek Solution got 3.7% in Greece's 2019 national election, giving it 10 seats in the 300-seat parliament. The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party no longer has any seats in the parliament. Voter frustration with Greece's continuing economic malaise and the migrant crisis has not translated into a big surge for the far right. What exactly is populism?

"Kezia Dugdale's new role is based at the University of Glasgow Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale is to leave the Scottish Parliament to take up a post with a political think tank. She has been appointed as director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service, based at the University of Glasgow. Ms Dugdale will step down as an MSP for the Lothian region at Holyrood in July. She said her new role would be ""an incredibly exciting new opportunity"" to contribute to public life. Kezia Dugdaleresigned as leader of her party in Scotland in 2017, saying it was time to ""pass on the baton"" to someone else. She had previously criticised UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and faced criticism from left-wing members of her own party as a result.

""Throughout my career I have taken on tough and challenging tasks, and my next task is to help rebuild faith in our politics.

"The fire covered an area of 6 hectares (14 acres) at its height A fire has been burning overnight near woods featured in AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories. The blaze in Ashdown Forest was reported at 21:30 BST on Sunday, East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said. Gorse and undergrowth was ablaze affecting an area of up to 50 acres (20 hectares), in the Kingstanding area. At its height six fire crews were on the scene. This has now been scaled back to four fire engines and crews, a fire service spokesman said. Andrew Gausden, from the fire service, said the blaze had destroyed a valley area near Duddleswell. ""It's unusual to have a fire of this size at night. This seems to have caught hold before people noticed the fire,"" he said. ""The undergrowth was very dry in the forest, despite the recent rain, and the fire caught quite quickly. ""We had numerous calls, including from the police who have a training centre nearby."" He said the fire was not thought to have been started deliberately. Crews remain at the scene making sure it is fully out. The fire in Ashdown Forest was reported at about 21:30 BST on Sunday AA Milne created the Winnie the Pooh books in the 1920s while living in the area, near Hartfield. The woods were the inspiration for Hundred Acre Wood - home to Pooh and his friends. Chris Sutton, an Ashdown Ranger forest ranger, said bracken in the area was ""as dry as straw"", and ground-nesting birds would have seen eggs and nests destroyed. The forest is an important habitat for nightjars and Dartford warblers. ""Reptiles like adders and lizards would not have been able to move fast enough. Large animals like foxes and deer would have been able to move out of the area quite quickly,"" he said. ""All is not lost - within four weeks we'll have grass growing and in six months you probably won't know too much has gone on here."" He said animals and insects from surrounding areas would quickly repopulate the area hit by the fire. Fire crews remain on the scene on Monday morning Winnie-the-Pooh map sells for Â£430k Why China censors banned Winnie the Pooh Inspiration for Winnie the Pooh revealed Ashdown Forest is in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with heathland making up about two-thirds of its 6,500 acres (2,500 hectares). It was originally used for deer hunting in Norman times, and has been given national and international protection because of its wildlife. Two fires in February werestarted accidentally by volunteersduring planned burning. The Conservators of Ashdown Forest said ""a freak gust of wind combined with unseasonably dry conditions"" was to blame the fires on 26 February.

"Spain is still the most popular destination for holidaymakers, says Thomas Cook Fewer British holidaymakers have booked a summer holiday inside the European Union this year amid continuing Brexit uncertainty, Thomas Cook has said. The travel firm says almost half (48%) of the holidays it sold up until the end of February were to non-EU destinations, up 10% on last year. Despite this, the firm says Spain is still its most popular destination. Its findings chime with separate Post Office figures showing currency sales for long-haul destinations have jumped. Sales of the Japanese yen were up 12% so far this year compared with last, while sales of the Indonesian rupiah have increased by 9%, Post Office Travel Money said. ""Brexit has made us as a family think and for the first time we are going to Turkey,"" said Kevin Coles from Northamptonshire. ""The value of the pound there (against the lira), versus the euro (in eurozone countries) makes it a much better value holiday."" He adds: ""We will holiday in the UK in the summer and maybe look at Cyprus, Turkey or Dubai for autumn half term."" ""For us it's less to do with the travel arrangements, although the possibility of delays and long queues is in the back of your mind. "" The currency figures are based on Post Office transactions between 1 January and 23 April. The Post Office accounts for about a quarter of all UK currency transactions. It said the biggest growth in currency sales so far this year has been for the Egyptian pound, which has seen a 687% year-on-year increase. Thomas Cook - through which 19 million people book holidays each year - said after Spain, Turkey had proved the most popular destination for its holidaymakers, accounting for a quarter of its flight-only bookings so far. Thomas Cook said Tunisia was also ""faring well"" with package bookings to the country double that of last year, with flight-only bookings up four-fold. Tourism to the country fell dramatically aftera 2015 terrorism attack in the resort of Soussein which 30 British tourists and eight others were killed by a gunman with links to Islamic State. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office lifted its travel ban against the country last year, prompting British operators to renew flights to Tunisia's Mediterranean coast. Thomas Cook has made two profit warnings in the past six months following drops in holiday bookings.  In March,it detailed plansto close 21 stores across the country and cut more than 300 jobs. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said it was still too early to tell the impact on bookings of the UK's exit from the European Union being delayed to the end of October. But he said there was ""little doubt that the prolonged uncertainty around the manner and timing of Britain's exit from the European Union has led many customers to press pause on their holiday plans for this summer"".

"A ban has been put in place but no specific mention of the niqab or burka was made Sri Lanka has banned face coverings in public, following a spate of suicide attacks on Easter Sunday that killed at least 250 people and injured hundreds. President Maithripala Sirisena said he was using an emergency law to impose the restriction from Monday. Any face garment which ""hinders identification"" will be banned to ensure security, his office said. Muslim leaders criticised the move. The niqab and burka - worn by Muslim women - were not specifically named. The move is perceived as targeting those garments, however. Sri Lanka remains on high alert eight days after Islamist attacks that hit churches and hotels. Children of the Easter Sunday carnage What led to attacks? The victims Dozens of suspects have been arrested, but local officials have warned that more militants remain at large. Sri Lanka has a sizeable and centuries-old Muslim population - of the country's 21-million population, just under 10% are Muslim. Only a small number of women are thought to wear the face-covering niqab, or the burka - a one-piece garment that covers the face and body. Last week a Sri Lankan MP had proposed a ban on women wearing the burka, saying it should be outlawed on security grounds. What's the difference between niqab or burka? Muslim groups have been highly critical of the president's decision. ""It is the stupidest thing to do. Three days ago we [the Muslim community] took a voluntary decision regarding this. The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulema told all Muslim women not to wear face veils for security reasons. If they wanted to wear a veil, then they were told not to come out,"" Hilmy Ahmed, vice-president of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council, told the BBC. ""We see this as a reflection of the conflict between the president and the prime minister. We strongly criticise the decision. We will not accept the authorities interfering with the religion without consulting the religious leadership."" Several countries have permanently banned full-face veils in public places,including France, Belgium and Denmark. Chad, Gabon and the Republic of Congoin Africa also have restrictions in place. Over the weekend thousands of Sri Lankan troops stood guard on the streets, protecting churches and mosques. Sunday church services were cancelled across the country as a precaution, but worshippers in the capital gathered to pray outside St Anthony's Shrine, which was badly damaged in the attacks. The number of people arrested in connection with the bloodshed rose to 150. Authorities are also hunting for around 140 followers of the jihadist group Islamic State, which has said it was behind the bombings, but has not provided firm evidence of direct involvement. This video can not be played Sri Lankans pray and light candles, one week after a string of bombings by Islamist militants On Friday, security forces raided a safe house used by the Islamist group NTJ,which authorities have said was behind the attacks.The group was founded by Zahran Hashim, the alleged organiser of the bombings who blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo. As troops moved in on Friday, three men set off explosives, killing themselves, six children and three women. Three other people died in gunfire.

"A fraudster posed as the actor Jason Statham to cheat a woman out of hundreds of thousands of pounds A fraudster posing as Hollywood actor Jason Statham cheated a British woman out of hundreds of thousands using an online scam, the BBC has learned. It comes as police warn such crimes are at ""epidemic"" levels, with Greater Manchester Police (GMP) receiving reports of about 1,000 victims a month. Detectives fear the true figure may be up to 10 times higher as many fraud victims never come forward. Det Con Craig Moylon said: ""It's the volume crime of the 21st Century."" A recent estimate put thetotal lost to fraud each year in the UK,externalat about Â£110bn. One victim from the North West of England told BBC Radio Manchester she had lost a fortune after being targeted by a fraudster who has ""just got no feelings at all"". The woman, who asked not to be named, said she was targeted at a vulnerable time following the deaths of both her mother and fiancÃ©. ""I'm quite a strong person but obviously certain things get to you and you let your guard down,"" she said. The woman said she was first contacted online by someone posing as Mr Statham while she was on a Facebook page dedicated to the Fast and Furious star. ""I thought 'Oh, that's nice of him, talking to his fans'. I might have been star-struck then, I don't know,"" she said. The fraudster then encouraged her to use the encrypted WhatsApp service, sending her hundreds of messages over several months. Reconstruction The woman said it felt like she was building a relationship with the actor, although looking back ""I don't feel like I was in the right place myself because of what I'd been through"". The fraudster posing as Mr Statham told her he loved her and eventually asked her to help with some financial difficulties, claiming a film payment was delayed. She then made a series of payments to the fraudster, totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds. Reconstruction While the woman declined to say the exact figure she transferred, ""it was a substantial amount, which would have made a difference to my life and my family"". Eventually, she contacted GMP, whose Economic Crime Unit investigated what had taken place. ""This lady has been subject to somebody who just tricked her at a very vulnerable time in her life,"" said Mr Moylon, who was involved in the investigation. ""When you see the relentless messaging that this lady got from this person and you see the grooming and the exploitation... the impact is extraordinary,"" he said. Reconstruction The woman, who said she was now ""less trusting of people"" as a result of her ordeal, is one of about 1,000 fraud victims reported to the force every month. ""We all know it's the tip of the iceberg,"" said Mr Moylon. ""The amount of people that report fraud are probably about 5-10% of the amount of people who actually are victims. ""Fraud is an epidemic. We've got big problems that we're trying to tackle,"" he said. There were an estimated 3.6 million fraud offences in England and Wales in 2018. The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales shows it is ""much more likely for an adultâ¦to experience fraud than a violent offence"". The survey results,published by the Office for National Statistics,external, suggested 6.6% of adults, just over 3 million people, had experienced some form of fraud in the year ending December 2018.  3.6mestimated fraud offences in 2018 12%rise on previous year 613,000people did not get all their money or property back 976,000further cases of computer misuse (viruses and hacking) Widower loses Â£60k to online investment scam NHS money stolen in fraud recovered Fraud victims let down by 'inconsistent policing' GMP was unable to prosecute anyone over the fraud, with the person responsible believed to be operating from overseas. If you think that you have been the victim of online fraud or identity theft, you can report it toAction Fraud,external, the national fraud reporting service. For any other sort of cyber crime, such as stalking, harassment, or fears about sexual grooming, you are urged to contact police.

"The man lost the tips of his fingers at Colchester Police Station in May 2015 Five police officers will face a misconduct hearing after a man lost the tips of three fingers when they were trapped under a toilet rim. Essex Police officers entered the 33-year-old arrested man's cell on 1 May 2015 to remove his foot from a toilet. The police watchdog said ""a number of techniques"" were used to remove him, but he grabbed on to the rim and his fingertips were severed as officers tried to restrain him. The hearings are set to begin on 7 May. An investigation was launched by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the injuries to the man's left hand at Colchester Police Station. The watchdog said it looked at the decision making by officers ""when the man, who was a foreign national presenting mental health concerns, was booked in to custody"" and ""in relation to the techniques and force used to remove the man from the toilet"". It also investigated the first aid the man received and his ""continued detention"" after his return from hospital. As a result, an inspector, three police constables and a temporary police sergeant are due to face gross misconduct charges.

"Women who are too anxious or embarrassed to go for a smear test could instead provide a urine sample to be screened for cervical cancer, research suggests. A trial found urine testing was as good at detecting a virus called HPV that is a big risk factor for the cancer. Bigger trials are still needed but experts said self-testing could be a game-changer for women. The number of people going for smear tests is lower than ever in the UK. NHS figures show attendance is now down to 71%, meaning several million women across England have not had a smear test for at least three and a half years. Smear tests prevent 75% of cervical cancers, so while they may not be pleasant, they are important. A smear test can detect early, abnormal cell changes before a cancer develops. Big Brother contestant Jade Goody died on 22 March 2009 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer The NHS invites women between the ages of 25 and 64 to attend for smears. Celebrities and campaigners have tried to encourage more women to attend but scientists are also looking at other ways to screen for the condition to improve screening uptake. Michelle Keegan vlogs about her cervical cancer screening Cervical screening: Millions missing smear tests Some pilot studies are already asking women to try out self-testing at home with a vaginal swab. Now, researchers at the University of Manchester say urine testing would be another option. They asked 104 women attending a colposcopy clinic to try the urine test and it performed just as well as conventional smears for detecting high-risk HPV,BMJ Open,externalreports. Lead researcher Dr Emma Crosbie said: ""We're really very excited by this study, which we think has the potential to significantly increase participation rates for cervical cancer screening. ""Campaigns to encourage women to attend cervical screening have helped. The brilliant campaign by the late Jade Goody increased numbers attendance by around 400,000 women. ""But sadly, the effects aren't long lasting and participation rates tend to fall back after a while. We clearly need a more sustainable solution."" She said larger trials of the urine test were still needed before it could be recommended to the NHS. Athena Lamnisos, from the Eve Appeal, said: ""Finding ways of screening that avoid the need for a physical test and use of a speculum is important. ""For women living with the impact of FGM [female genital mutilation] or those who have suffered sexual abuse or live with conditions such as vaginismus, screening in a non-invasive way could be game-changing for screening uptake. ""This research sounds like a promising early step but is some way off being rolled out through the NHS. ""In the meantime, women must continue to book their screening appointment when they're called. It's a life-saving test.""

"More than 40,000 runners will be feeling pretty sore today after completing the London Marathon on Sunday. Elite runner Hayley Carruthers is already back at work despite crawling over the finish line. ""I started counting my steps and my head was gone, I think I lost sight in one eye,"" Hayley tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I just couldn't lift my legs at all and I just couldn't move. ""It was just petrifying."" Hayley, who's 26 and works in the NHS, says she started to feel bad just after the half-way point. ""My legs felt like lead and I felt sick. ""It gradually got worse and worse."" TV viewers and spectators on The Mall watched as Hayley approached the finish line at 26.2 miles before her legs gave way - she fell just metres before the finish. ""To get to 20 miles and think I've still got another 10km to go - I genuinely didn't think I could finish. ""It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do."" Despite crawling over the finishing line with the help of marathon marshals, Hayley still managed to beat her personal best time by three minutes, finishing in 02:33:59. She crossed the line in 18th place and says it was the toughest thing - physically and mentally - she's ever had to do. ""We started too fast and I got carried away with the excitement of being in the elite race and all the excitement of London really. ""We ran the first half far too quickly and it just ended up being a survival fest."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Two former Bishops of Lincoln failed to act at the time when informed of alleged abuse, BBC Panorama has found. The BBC investigation also revealed the names of 53 Lincoln Diocese clergy and staff were passed to police - amid concerns about the handling of past abuse allegations - years after they could have been. The eventual police investigation led to three people being convicted. Lincoln Diocese acknowledged past matters had not been handled well. It told Panorama, which carried out a joint investigation with Look North, that the diocese was committed to learning from mistakes. The Church of England's Past Cases Review was announced in 2007 but Lincolnshire Police was not told about the 53 names - some, but not all of which, related to child abuse allegations - until 2015. Detective Superintendent Rick Hatton, who led the force's Operation Redstone investigation, told Panorama: ""We whittled it down to about 25 names, whereby we either knew that they'd committed offences or there was some issue around risk to members of the public from them. ""There was the ongoing concern that actually those people were working with children. Potentially there was still a risk."" In one of the cases where a former Bishop of Lincoln failed to act, Panorama found that the late Rt Revd Kenneth Riches was told in 1969 about abuse carried out by Roy Griffiths. At the time, Griffiths was deputy head teacher at Lincoln Cathedral School. He kept his job there until the following year, when another boy complained about his abuse of pupils. Neither Lincoln Cathedral School nor Lincoln Diocese informed the police at the time, and Griffiths was able to get a job at an Anglican school in Papua New Guinea the same year. It would be another 45 years before Lincoln Diocese informed Lincolnshire Police about Griffiths. Kevin Bennington, who was abused by Griffiths as a boy, said his mother told the bishop about the teacher after learning what had happened. He told Panorama: ""It should have been dealt with right away, and the Church should have instructed the police [...] and they didn't. They just turned a blind eye and moved on."" In 2018, Griffiths admitted abusing six boys at Lincoln Cathedral School. He's now serving a prison sentence of six years and seven months. Det Supt Rick Hatton told Panorama: ""When he was sentenced, the feelings I had for the victims and what they'd been through, what came out in court, was quite heart-wrenching."" Panorama also found that another former Bishop of Lincoln, Rt Revd Robert Hardy, failed to act in the 1990s when one of his diocesan employees admitted to him he had ""touched up"" a female in the past, saying it had been a one-off. The employee, John Bailey, was director of education for Lincoln Diocese at the time, and had abused three girls between 1955 and 1982. He approached the bishop after the family of one of his victims wrote to him at the diocese, telling him of the ordeal he had caused their daughter. But Bishop Hardy did not contact her family to find out any more details. Bailey was jailed in 2017 after an investigation by Operation Redstone. He admitted 25 counts of indecent assault against the three girls. Bishop Hardy said no-one had contacted him at the time or subsequently to make a comment or complaint about Bailey. Had they done, he would have investigated it. He said his failing was to trust Bailey's word, which he deeply regrets. The Rt Rev Dr Nicholas Chamberlain, Bishop of Grantham and lead bishop for safeguarding for the Diocese of Lincoln, said: ""The Diocese of Lincoln wishes to acknowledge that past matters have not been handled well. ""The diocese is committed to learn from its mistakes. I am very sorry that it took so long for justice to be served."" The diocese said its safeguarding team has now developed an effective partnership with Lincolnshire Police, working with them to secure convictions and, where this was not an option, to make sure that risk was managed appropriately. It said there is mandatory safeguarding training and promises to offer support to anyone who contacts the diocese about issues of harm or abuse. Panorama has also seen new evidence about cases that were left out of the Past Cases Review, carried out by the Church of England between 2007 and 2010. The review concluded in 2010 that after looking at 40,000 files, only 13 cases of abuse or alleged abuse required further action to ensure everything had been done to protect children. The Church of England had told its dioceses they were not expected to examine files relating to dead clergy as part of the review, nor to talk to survivors of abuse. Three years after the review had concluded, the Archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, publicly ordered his own investigation of alleged abuse cases involving dead clergy from York Diocese. All dioceses in the Church of England were asked to do the same shortly afterwards. The York review identified 32 cases which included allegations of abuse against young boys and young girls. The Diocese of York has never made public the results, and neither have other dioceses. Dr Sentamu told Panorama that he wanted to consider the privacy of victims and the families of alleged abusers. He said lessons learned were shared within the Diocese of York. Bishop Hancock said the Church takes safeguarding very seriously Rt Revd Peter Hancock, Bishop of Bath and Wells, who leads on safeguarding for the Church of England, acknowledged it had been an oversight not to initially include dead clergy in its Past Cases Review and to not speak to survivors. While he said that had partly been done due to a pastoral concern about not re-traumatising people, he added: ""I think there was too much concern about the reputation of the Church, and there was not enough care for those who are themselves victims of abuse."" He said the Church of England now takes safeguarding matters very seriously, and that survivors of abuse need ""a response from a Church that is compassionate, that is fair, that is appropriate, and that is swift"".

"Kezia Dugdale's new role is based at the University of Glasgow Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale is to leave the Scottish Parliament to take up a post with a political think tank. She has been appointed as director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service, based at the University of Glasgow. Ms Dugdale will step down as an MSP for the Lothian region at Holyrood in July. She said her new role would be ""an incredibly exciting new opportunity"" to contribute to public life. Kezia Dugdaleresigned as leader of her party in Scotland in 2017, saying it was time to ""pass on the baton"" to someone else. She had previously criticised UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, and faced criticism from left-wing members of her own party as a result. Profile: Kezia Dugdale Ms Dugdale replaced Jim Murphy as Scottish Labour leader in August 2015, after the party lost all but one of its Westminster seats in Scotland to the SNP. Under her leadership, Labour finished third behind the SNP and Scottish Conservatives in the Scottish Parliament election - but went on to win seven seats in the snap general election in June 2017. The John Smith Centre is named after the UK Labour leader who died suddenly in May 1994. John Smith was Labour's UK leader from 1992 to 1994 Speaking of her new role, Ms Dugdale said: ""I have devoted my working life to public service, and this is an incredibly exciting new opportunity for me to lead the work of the John Smith Centre. ""Throughout my career I have taken on tough and challenging tasks, and my next task is to help rebuild faith in our politics. ""Disruptive events and the rise of populism has led to increasingly polarised and emotional politics where rational, evidence-based thinking has lost its standing. She added: ""Faith in public service, politics and the political process has to be restored and that progress must be sustainable."" Ms Dugdale became Scottish Labour leader in 2015 The centre's chairperson, Catherine Smith - who is John Smith's daughter - said the director's post had attracted many talented potential candidates. ""We are absolutely delighted that someone of Kezia's calibre will be joining us as the first full time Director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service after a rigorous and open recruitment process which attracted a strong international field,"" she said. ""We are very much looking forward to working with her as she leads our strategic, research and outreach activities and takes the Centre to the next stage of its development."" Principal of the University of Glasgow, Prof Sir Anton Muscatelli, added: ""I am extremely pleased to welcome Kezia Dugdale to the University of Glasgow as Director of the John Smith Centre for Public Service. ""Her background as one of Scotland's most prominent and respected politicians will be invaluable in making a success of this important new position and bring tremendous insights in her academic work with our students, both undergraduate and postgraduate."" The John Smith Centre is a think tank which has a role described as ""exploring contemporary attitudes, feelings and future intentions with regard to public service, citizenship and engagement"". Ms Dugdale's role will include teaching students at Glasgow University and representing the John Smith Centre on the international stage, as well as ""transforming it into one of the UK's leading think-tanks"".

"More than 40,000 runners will be feeling pretty sore today after completing the London Marathon on Sunday. Elite runner Hayley Carruthers is already back at work despite crawling over the finish line. ""I started counting my steps and my head was gone, I think I lost sight in one eye,"" Hayley tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I just couldn't lift my legs at all and I just couldn't move. ""It was just petrifying."" Hayley, who's 26 and works in the NHS, says she started to feel bad just after the half-way point. ""My legs felt like lead and I felt sick. ""It gradually got worse and worse."" TV viewers and spectators on The Mall watched as Hayley approached the finish line at 26.2 miles before her legs gave way - she fell just metres before the finish. ""To get to 20 miles and think I've still got another 10km to go - I genuinely didn't think I could finish. ""It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do."" Despite crawling over the finishing line with the help of marathon marshals, Hayley still managed to beat her personal best time by three minutes, finishing in 02:33:59. She crossed the line in 18th place and says it was the toughest thing - physically and mentally - she's ever had to do. ""We started too fast and I got carried away with the excitement of being in the elite race and all the excitement of London really.

"Justene Reece took her own life as a ""direct result"" of Allen's actions Police failed to link nearly half the reports of stalking about a woman's ex-partner before she killed herself. Nicholas Allenwas jailed for 10 yearsfor the manslaughter of Justene Reece, who killed herself as a ""direct result"" of his controlling behaviour. An investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found Staffordshire Police officers missed the ""bigger picture"" of his offending. The force said it had improved its investigative approach to stalking. Ms Reece, 46, from Stafford, hanged herself in February 2017, leaving a note saying ""I've run out of fight"". Latest news from the West Midlands The IOPCbegan its investigation,externala month later. Between an initial report in September 2016 and Ms Reece's death, the IOPC found that, of 34 incidents reported by Ms Reece, her friends, family and other agencies, 16 were not cross-referenced with any previous reports. It said seven of the 14 incidents reported by Ms Reece herself were not cross-checked at all. Allen's trial heard he had a string of convictions for assault and harassment against other partners, and had sent Ms Reece abusive voicemails, texts and Facebook messages and stalked her. His conviction was thought to be the first manslaughter case brought in such circumstances. Nicholas Allen was jailed for 10 years in 2017 Ms Reece obtained a non-molestation order against Allen in November 2016, which he breached seven times, the IOPC said. The police watchdog said that in December 2016, a now-retired senior officer chose not to arrest Allen for a reported breach of the order, because it was felt Ms Reece had been complicit by going with him to a pub after he turned up at the home where she was staying. The IOPC said it was the responsibility of the offender and not the victim to ensure the orders were complied with, and so did not accept the officer's reasoning - finding it unsatisfactory. Seven officers and one member of police staff will receive management action, as their performance was not judged to have met expected standards over the handling of calls and not completing risk assessments. ""It is evident from our investigation that there were potential opportunities for the police to engage more robustly with Mr Allen,"" IOPC regional director Derrick Campbell said. ""The bigger picture of the level of harassment and stalking being perpetrated was not properly seen by police."" In a statement,external, Deputy Chief Constable Nick Baker apologised. The force has also accepted training recommendations to improve the linking of incidents and crimes. ""Since the tragic death of Justene we have made improvements to our safeguarding and investigative approach to stalking, but we have more work to do,"" Mr Baker said. ""We are committed to ensuring officers and staff understand stalking and its devastating impact so they can better respond to incidents reported to us.""

"A major study has highlighted the scale of the obesity problem in the UK, with a significant risk of death and disease attached to weight gain. People with a body mass index (BMI) of 30-35 were at 70% higher risk of developing heart failure than their healthy weight peers (18.5-25 BMI). The study of 2.8 million adults showed even slightly overweight people were twice as likely to getType 2 diabetes,external. Public Health England said ""sustained action"" was needed to tackle obesity. The study, to be presented at the European Congress on Obesity (ECO) in Glasgow, also showed: For those with a BMI of 35-40, the risk of Type 2 diabetes was almost nine times higher, and 12 times higher for sleep apnoea People with severe obesity (BMI of 40-45) were 12 times more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes and had a risk of sleep apnoea that was 22 times greater People with a BMI of 40-45 had triple the risk of heart failure, high blood pressure, and dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of cholesterol and other fats in the blood) BMI of 40-45 was also linked to a 50% higher risk of dying prematurely from any cause The study's author, Christiane Haase, of healthcare firm Novo Nordisk which funded the work, said: ""With the number of people living with obesity almost tripling worldwide over the past 30 years (105 million people in 1975 to 650 million in 2016), our findings have serious implications for public health.""

Where a user's data is entered in imperial units, we first convert to metric and then carry out the BMI calculation. The BMI result is assigned to a standard category: Less than 18.5 - underweight 18.5 to 24.9 - healthy weight 25 to 29.9 - overweight 30 to 39.9 - obese (split into two categories for the new study) 40 and over - very obese (also known as morbidly obese) Obesity and depression linked in children Low calories 'reversed type-2 diabetes' Obesity set to overtake smoking as risk Child obesity 'far worse than thought' The research found that the risk of developing serious health problems was highly dependent on whether or not people already had issues at the start of the study. For example, having high blood pressure at the start of the study was strongly associated with developing dyslipidaemia, chronic kidney disease and Type 2 diabetes. Researchers looked at health, death and BMI data from more than 2.8 million adults between January 2000 and July 2018 from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This was linked with hospital data to estimate the risk for serious health problems. But the authors stress that their findings show observational differences, so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, and they point to a number of limitations: the study participants must have seen their doctor and had their weight measured for a reason other, unmeasured factors may have influenced the results Victoria Taylor, nutrition lead at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""More than a quarter of UK adults (28%) are obese and it's something that we urgently need action on.""

"Leading players: Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Pablo Casado, Albert Rivera, Pablo Iglesias, Santiago Abascal Spain holds its third general election in four years on Sunday, in a battle between the established parties, Catalan and Basque nationalists, and a rising far right. This time, however, the electoral game has changed. Support for the previous winner, the conservative Popular Party (PP), has collapsed amid a corruption scandal. Its main opponent, the Socialist party, has climbed to the top of the polls after taking over the prime minister's job last year. Podemos on the left and Ciudadanos (Citizens) on the right are seeing their support fall, amid a boom for the controversial far-right Vox party. The last pre-election polls suggested that up to four in 10 voters had yet to make up their minds. Opinion polls may not tell the full story, particularly with so many undecided voters. But potential outcomes for a government include: Socialists, left-wing Podemos, plus small nationalist parties Centre-right PP, liberal Ciudadanos and far-right Vox Socialists and Ciudadanos But there is a problem with each of these combinations. The Socialist and Podemos alliance of Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez's existing government needed the Basque and Catalan nationalists to support it. In the national televised debates ahead of polling day, his alliance with Catalan nationalists was used as a key weapon against him - with his opponents claiming he was linked to ""enemies of Spain"" and wanted to ""liquidate"" the country. Vox was banned from taking part in the televised debate ahead of polling day The Catalan pro-independence parties were partly responsible for the government's collapsewhen they pulled their support in February; and the crisis over the failed Catalan independence bid has made the separatists hugely unpopular in much of Spain - making negotiations with them tricky. Any Popular Party coalition with Ciudadanos would probably need the support of Vox. As the campaign came to a close, PP leader Pablo Casado appeared to open the door to a coalition with Vox. If between them they had enough seats, why would they want to block a coalition, he said, aware that many former PP voters planned to switch to Vox. But Ciudadanos voters are largely opposed to entering government with Vox.Vox was prevented from taking part in the debates by the country's electoral commission. Catalan crisis in 300 words Spain PM sets snap election for April Spain country profile Ciudadanos has also publicly said it will not form a coalition with the Socialists, and leader Albert Rivera has bitterly criticised the Socialist leader over Catalonia. During the election debates, Mr SÃ¡nchez said he had no plans to join with a party that had placed a ""cordon sanitaire"" around the Socialists. The Catalan crisis and the rise of Vox have changed the debate in Spanish politics. ""This is not an election about the economy - a different situation from what we have seen in more than 20 years,"" says Juan RodrÃ­guez Teruel, professor of political science at the University of Valencia. Despite widespread concerns about unemployment - which remains high in Spain compared with its European neighbours - it barely featured during the campaign and was raised during the debates only briefly. ""The campaign is going to remain around identity issues, and particularly around the Catalan issue... it seems that the economy is not, any more, the completely fundamental issue,"" says Prof Teruel. Before the election, Mr SÃ¡nchez had been negotiating with Catalan parties to support his budget. But those talks broke down amid a public backlash over the meeting, partly stoked by Vox's fervent opposition to any concessions on independence. As campaigning came to an end Pedro SÃ¡nchez accused his opponents of embracing the far right Despite his political problems, support for the Socialists has risen during their time in government - at the expense of coalition partner Podemos. Meanwhile, support for its tradition rival, the PP, plummeted in the wake of the corruption scandal that brought down previous leader Mariano Rajoy - leaving plenty of votes to fight for among a fragmented right. The nationalist party has set itself up in firm opposition to the separatists, despite Spain's dark history with the far right under dictator Francisco Franco. ""The rise of Vox is clearly an earthquake in Spanish politics,"" says Bonnie N Field, professor of political science at Bentley University - while warning against ""exaggerating"" the party's success. Opinion polls suggest it has around 11% support, while its leader Santiago Abascal has the lowest opinion rating of any party leader. Vox's leader Santiago Abascal is the least popular leader - but polls well among his own voters Nonetheless, she says ""Spain has gone from what political scientists Sonia Alonso and CristÃ³bal Rovira called 'no country for the populist radical right' to one where the far right could support â or less likely, join â a right-wing government"". Such an arrangement is precisely what happened in the regional government ofAndalusia - where the PP, Ciudadanos, and Vox formed a right-wing regional governmentearlier this year for the first time in 36 years. Spanish far right strikes landmark deal Rise of nationalists vowing to 'make Spain great again' This video can not be played Activists say rage over the ""wolfpack"" case ignited a feminist revolution (Video from 2019) ""If the right is in reach of a majority after the general elections, something similar may occur,"" Prof Field says. For Prof Manuel Arias Maldonado of the university of Malaga, Vox's success is partly down to its awareness of history, and ""adopting a low profile"". ""It should be noted that they do not display openly any Francoist imagery,"" he said. ""They are not making gross mistakes."" ""The big question [about the elections] is how strong will Vox be. There is the feeling that they could surpass expectations, despite the polls. ""But the main reason why Vox exists is Catalonia: it is a reaction to the unilateral secession attempt... that is where their strength comes from."" A three-party coalition of the right is not out of the question. But Prof Teruel warns that the surge for Vox is coming at the expense of other right-leaning parties - the PP or Ciudadanos. And for the first time since the 1970s, the right is ""very fragmented"" - something that could benefit opponents on the left. ""The main reason now to vote for the left-wing electorate is to avoid the potential coalition among right-wing parties,"" Prof Teruel says. Ciudadanos, meanwhile, could feasibly support a coalition with the Socialists, despite publicly dismissing the idea. ""I'm not sure they could keep this position if the numbers give the potential of a coalition,"" Prof Teruel says. ""The pressure on Ciudadanos will be very, very high."" Spain'sEl PaÃ­s newspaper, publishing its final analysis,externalof all the polls before the vote, concluded that the chances of a three-party right-leaning government was about 10%; far lower than any combination involving the Socialists.

"Felicity and Kayley say they were charged Â£50 for a three-month extension A UK university is accused of ""disadvantaging disabled students"" after charging for long-term assignment extensions due to medical needs. One University of Liverpool student was unable to afford the Â£200 ""tuition fee"", and was locked out of her student account with ""no access"" to emails or documents for her dissertation. She said the institution ""had not been accommodating or sympathetic"". The university apologised and said it was reviewing its policy. One postgraduate student, Felicity, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she provided evidence from doctors to show the extension was required for medical reasons, meaning it was granted by the university as an ""extenuating circumstance"". ""I've not extended my studies because I want to have some more time to do my work. It's because I need it,"" she explained. ""It's the one thing that would have made my life easier, given all the health problems I've got. ""I'm trying my hardest to finish my work as it is - which has been pretty difficult."" The university's policy states that students face a fee for extending their studies into a new academic year, even if they need the extra time because of personal or medical reasons - also known as extenuating circumstances. Felicity and fellow student Kayley - who have a range of mental and physical health conditions -  were charged Â£50 for a three-month extension, which rose to Â£200 when they asked to extend further. Felicity said she felt it could amount to discrimination, as such an extension could be considered ""a reasonable adjustment,"" which has to be implemented under the Equality Act 2010. The university said Felicity had ""received a number of short-term coursework extensions as reasonable adjustments"". It said Kayley was not registered as disabled with the university. It added: ""In line with university policy, a Â£50 tuition fee charge is applied for each three-month extension period, which covers access to study services as well as tuition and supervision. ""We are reviewing this policy."" The programme has also heard of wider issues surrounding disability support at the University of Liverpool. Nana, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, said her requirements were not always met. She has been scheduled into inaccessible rooms ""five or six"" times. Nana said in one lecture she was unable to see the lecturer due to frosted glass And she added that when lecture theatres were accessible, ""there tends to be something wrong with the rooms"".

For Julia, who has various health conditions that require additional support, including the hypermobility form of connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), support from the university was ""extremely inconsistent"". EDS causes her chronic pain, and even climbing stairs can cause her joints to partially or fully dislocate. Her support plan says she is supposed to have an ergonomic chair, but this did not happen during her exams. ""It was physically a test of my pain tolerance, and not my academic ability."" Julia said her exams were a test of endurance The chair she was given, she said, ""did cause my hip to move and cause my sciatic pain and other muscular pain to shoot from my toes all the way to my neck"". She said it makes her more stressed about future assessments ""because I know going into situations now that the support is probably not going to be there"". Despite having chronic fatigue syndrome and advice saying it should not happen, she said she was also scheduled to sit two exams in one day. The university said it currently had more than 3,000 disabled students and worked hard to provide them with individual support. Paul Redmond, director of student experience and enhancement, said: ""Some of these accounts show that there are occasions where we have fallen short and we apologise sincerely where this has been the case. ""We will in future be involving disabled students more regularly in our reviews and decision-making processes to help ensure the high standards we aim for are consistently maintained.""

"Police will toughen up on drivers who speed, use mobiles and who choose not to wear seatbelts Reckless drivers are to be targeted by Police Scotland after 18 people died in collisions in April alone. Motorists who speed, use mobiles or choose not to wear a seatbelt face fines and penalty points in a police campaign to promote road safety. The focus of the campaign will be on inappropriate speeds, which contribute significantly to fatal crashes, the force said. A similar initiative in February caught 1,587 offending drivers. It comes after a woman died on Sunday following atwo-vehicle crash near Forresin Moray. Official figures show a total of146 people died on Scotland's roads,externalin 2017, the most recent set of complete statistics published. Road casualties have been falling since 1970, when 758 people died in traffic incidents in Scotland. 'Keep left' campaign targets foreign tourists on Highland roads Serious road accident shuts part of A96 Driver was checking mobile phone at time of fatal crash The push will be led by Police Scotland's road policing division between Monday 29 April and Sunday 5 May. Support will be given by safety camera units which are stationed across the country. The cameras detected 1,164 driving offences during the last campaign in February, while police caught a further 423 speeding drivers. Ch Insp Mark Patterson confirmed that since the beginning of April, 18 people have died in road traffic collisions in Scotland as he announced the initiative's return. He continued: ""The heartbreak and life-long grief these untimely deaths cause is preventable, not inevitable. ""Every driver knows they have to obey the posted speed limit, to not recklessly distract themselves by using handheld devices and that wearing a seatbelt, in the front or back of a motor vehicle has been compulsory now for decades. ""Our latest campaign will focus on educating errant motorists through enforcement rather than education or warnings. ""That most likely means a monetary fine and points on the driver's licence.  For probationary drivers the risks are even greater - one mobile phone/device offence will mean a hefty fine, six penalty points and disqualification from driving until a further driving test is passed. ""With the modern communication and warning systems now present in most motor vehicles, there is simply no excuse for heedlessly exceeding speed limits, using a hand-held device or not buckling up and telling your passengers to do likewise. ""My message to all drivers is quite clear - obey the law and #drivesmart.""

"Northlink runs ferries between Aberdeen, Orkney and Shetland NorthLink has reduced the amount of plastics used on its ferry services to and from the Northern Isles by more than 200,000 items each year. Operator Serco said it made the move to reduce its environmental footprint. It is replacing 87,000 disposable cups and 28,000 lids with compostable alternatives. The company said that plastic teaspoons, food trays and portion pots for sauces would also also be removed from the services. Ferry operator to end plastic straw use CalMac to further reduce plastic waste Northlink runs ferries between Aberdeen, Kirkwall and Lerwick, as well as the route between Scrabster and Stromness. NorthLink announced a move away from plastics last year Seumas Campbell, from Serco NorthLink, said: ""Looking after the natural environment is such an important part of the service we provide. ""So we are passionate about minimising our impact on the world around us. ""The steps we have taken to remove single-use plastics are very positive and we will keep looking for more opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint."" Last year, NorthLink said it wasreplacing plastic straws with paper oneson all its sailings in an effort to tackle plastic pollution in seas and on beaches. The move follows a drive from many organisations to reduce single-use plastic consumption because of the 'Attenborough effect.' The veteran broadcaster's series, Blue Planet 2, highlighted the damaging impact plastic is having on the marine environment.

"A fraudster posed as the actor Jason Statham to cheat a woman out of hundreds of thousands of pounds A fraudster posing as Hollywood actor Jason Statham cheated a British woman out of hundreds of thousands using an online scam, the BBC has learned. It comes as police warn such crimes are at ""epidemic"" levels, with Greater Manchester Police (GMP) receiving reports of about 1,000 victims a month. Detectives fear the true figure may be up to 10 times higher as many fraud victims never come forward. Det Con Craig Moylon said: ""It's the volume crime of the 21st Century."" A recent estimate put thetotal lost to fraud each year in the UK,externalat about Â£110bn. One victim from the North West of England told BBC Radio Manchester she had lost a fortune after being targeted by a fraudster who has ""just got no feelings at all"". The woman, who asked not to be named, said she was targeted at a vulnerable time following the deaths of both her mother and fiancÃ©. ""I'm quite a strong person but obviously certain things get to you and you let your guard down,"" she said. The woman said she was first contacted online by someone posing as Mr Statham while she was on a Facebook page dedicated to the Fast and Furious star. ""I thought 'Oh, that's nice of him, talking to his fans'. I might have been star-struck then, I don't know,"" she said. The fraudster then encouraged her to use the encrypted WhatsApp service, sending her hundreds of messages over several months. Reconstruction The woman said it felt like she was building a relationship with the actor, although looking back ""I don't feel like I was in the right place myself because of what I'd been through"". The fraudster posing as Mr Statham told her he loved her and eventually asked her to help with some financial difficulties, claiming a film payment was delayed. She then made a series of payments to the fraudster, totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds. Reconstruction While the woman declined to say the exact figure she transferred, ""it was a substantial amount, which would have made a difference to my life and my family"". Eventually, she contacted GMP, whose Economic Crime Unit investigated what had taken place. ""This lady has been subject to somebody who just tricked her at a very vulnerable time in her life,"" said Mr Moylon, who was involved in the investigation. ""When you see the relentless messaging that this lady got from this person and you see the grooming and the exploitation... the impact is extraordinary,"" he said. Reconstruction The woman, who said she was now ""less trusting of people"" as a result of her ordeal, is one of about 1,000 fraud victims reported to the force every month. ""We all know it's the tip of the iceberg,"" said Mr Moylon. ""The amount of people that report fraud are probably about 5-10% of the amount of people who actually are victims. ""Fraud is an epidemic. We've got big problems that we're trying to tackle,"" he said. There were an estimated 3.6 million fraud offences in England and Wales in 2018. The latest Crime Survey for England and Wales shows it is ""much more likely for an adultâ¦to experience fraud than a violent offence"". The survey results,published by the Office for National Statistics,external, suggested 6.6% of adults, just over 3 million people, had experienced some form of fraud in the year ending December 2018.  3.6mestimated fraud offences in 2018 12%rise on previous year 613,000people did not get all their money or property back 976,000further cases of computer misuse (viruses and hacking) Widower loses Â£60k to online investment scam NHS money stolen in fraud recovered Fraud victims let down by 'inconsistent policing' GMP was unable to prosecute anyone over the fraud, with the person responsible believed to be operating from overseas. If you think that you have been the victim of online fraud or identity theft, you can report it toAction Fraud,external, the national fraud reporting service. For any other sort of cyber crime, such as stalking, harassment, or fears about sexual grooming, you are urged to contact police.

"A ban has been put in place but no specific mention of the niqab or burka was made Sri Lanka has banned face coverings in public, following a spate of suicide attacks on Easter Sunday that killed at least 250 people and injured hundreds. President Maithripala Sirisena said he was using an emergency law to impose the restriction from Monday. Any face garment which ""hinders identification"" will be banned to ensure security, his office said. Muslim leaders criticised the move. The niqab and burka - worn by Muslim women - were not specifically named. The move is perceived as targeting those garments, however. Sri Lanka remains on high alert eight days after Islamist attacks that hit churches and hotels. Children of the Easter Sunday carnage What led to attacks? The victims Dozens of suspects have been arrested, but local officials have warned that more militants remain at large. Sri Lanka has a sizeable and centuries-old Muslim population - of the country's 21-million population, just under 10% are Muslim. Only a small number of women are thought to wear the face-covering niqab, or the burka - a one-piece garment that covers the face and body. Last week a Sri Lankan MP had proposed a ban on women wearing the burka, saying it should be outlawed on security grounds. What's the difference between niqab or burka? Muslim groups have been highly critical of the president's decision. ""It is the stupidest thing to do. Three days ago we [the Muslim community] took a voluntary decision regarding this. The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulema told all Muslim women not to wear face veils for security reasons. If they wanted to wear a veil, then they were told not to come out,"" Hilmy Ahmed, vice-president of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council, told the BBC. ""We see this as a reflection of the conflict between the president and the prime minister. We strongly criticise the decision. We will not accept the authorities interfering with the religion without consulting the religious leadership."" Several countries have permanently banned full-face veils in public places,including France, Belgium and Denmark. Chad, Gabon and the Republic of Congoin Africa also have restrictions in place. Over the weekend thousands of Sri Lankan troops stood guard on the streets, protecting churches and mosques. Sunday church services were cancelled across the country as a precaution, but worshippers in the capital gathered to pray outside St Anthony's Shrine, which was badly damaged in the attacks. The number of people arrested in connection with the bloodshed rose to 150. Authorities are also hunting for around 140 followers of the jihadist group Islamic State, which has said it was behind the bombings, but has not provided firm evidence of direct involvement. This video can not be played Sri Lankans pray and light candles, one week after a string of bombings by Islamist militants On Friday, security forces raided a safe house used by the Islamist group NTJ,which authorities have said was behind the attacks.The group was founded by Zahran Hashim, the alleged organiser of the bombings who blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo. As troops moved in on Friday, three men set off explosives, killing themselves, six children and three women. Three other people died in gunfire.

"Max Hill QC takes up his role as head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the chief agency for conducting criminal prosecutions in England and Wales, at a hugely challenging time. Among the problems he faces are a 25% budget cut which has led to the loss of a third of CPS staff.  The service, sometimes referred to as ""the nation's law firm"", has also been hit by a series of cases that collapsed because of failures by the police and prosecutors to disclose critical evidence to the defence. And the number of people charged with rape in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level in a decade. Mr Hill, formerly the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, will need to boost the morale of his 6,000 staff as he gets his teeth into issues on which he and they will be judged. Disclosure is the bedrock of our fair trial system. In every criminal trial, the prosecution must disclose any evidence gathered by the police investigation which either helps the defence case or weakens its own. If that fails, miscarriages of justice can occur, and for years there have been problems with disclosure. Last December, the rape case against Liam Allan collapsed when text messages were disclosed very late - three days into the trial - which proved his alleged victim had pestered him for ""casual sex"". It was the first of a series of collapsed trials which led to reviews by the police and CPS, a National Disclosure Improvement Plan (NDIP), and, in July, a stinging report from the Justice Committee. This found that, after six reports in six years from experts including judges and lawyers highlighting the problem, Max Hill's predecessor as DPP Alison Saunders had failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings. The committee found that she was not hands-on enough and her approach permeated the CPS. This wasn't helped by CPS data which may have underestimated the number of cases stopped with disclosure errors - by around 90%. The report made clear that disclosure failings are systemic and not limited to rape and sexual assault cases. CPS data showed 841 cases in 2017-18 were stopped due to disclosure, but the committee said it knew that was less than the true figure. Police evidence failings 'harm cases' Student Liam Allan 'betrayed' after rape trial collapse If disclosure goes wrong, innocent people can go to prison. Alison Saunders told the Justice Committee that that had happened. Responding to the Justice Committee report, she said: ""Getting disclosure right is a fundamental part of a fair criminal justice system. I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority."" Max Hill is keen to be seen to be on top of the disclosure problems. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We are committed at all levels in this organisation to making sure that these errors are driven down to an absolute minimum."" Alison Saunders' tenure as DPP was a controversial one However, when asked if people were still in prison as a result of disclosure failures he said it was ""impossible to know"". Identifying disclosure problems is the easy part, fixing them is hugely complex. The NDIP has implemented a range of joint measures including: Further training of police officers and prosecutors Publication of a national standard on disclosure A protocol on handling third-party material An investigation of what technological tools might assist with the examination of the material Stronger national and local leadership and oversight of the operation of the disclosure process However, the law has hit a real problem in terms of the sheer weight of digital evidence - described as a ""digital crater"" by the Justice Committee - which now plays a part in many criminal cases. A single mobile phone can generate upwards of 20,000 pages of evidence. The right skills and technology are needed to deal with the mass of evidence from electronic devices and that has huge resource implications. It is likely that Max Hill will be making the case for greater resources here. He told the Today programme that in the lead-up to the next spending review ""we will be marshalling our arguments to say how stretched we are"". Liam Allan's trial was halted after messages undermining the case were found Current efforts to address disclosure failures will address present and future cases. There are also demands, most recently from outgoing chairman of the Criminal Cases Review Commission Richard Foster, for a targeted review of past cases where errors may have resulted in miscarriages of justice. ""In my view the only proper course now is for police and prosecutors to themselves initiate a targeted review of existing convictions, starting perhaps with those from police forces where we know from inspectorate work there are ongoing problems with the quality of their criminal investigative work,"" Mr Foster said in October. Max Hill says the CPS will look into any case ""where an issue arises"".  However, a targeted review that looks at past cases would represent a challenge for the CPS. The CPS must command public confidence. Max Hill believes that to build it people must understand the role of the CPS. He is keen that the public realises that it doesn't investigate crime, or choose which cases it considers and is not there to secure a conviction in every case. Its job is to assess whether it is appropriate to present charges for the criminal courts to consider. They, and not the CPS, decide on guilt or innocence. Public confidence will depend on CPS work being of the highest quality. Max Hill has identified a number of challenges, including the fact that the CPS is demand-led.  It obeys Parliament by prosecuting the crimes passed into law, and it responds to changing trends in crime by dealing with every case. He believes that has resource implications. In recent years, the CPS has had to respond to big shifts in the mix of cases presented to it by the police. There has been a significant increase in complex cases including child sex abuse, economic crime and terrorism. However, the new DPP accepts mistakes have been made, and says that the CPS is determined to learn from them.

"Vox, led by Santiago Abascal, will take seats in parliament for the first time After weeks of Spain's resurgent far right hogging all the headlines, didn't the centre-left just win a resounding victory? Did Spaniards have a last-minute change of heart? What does this all mean? Spain's Socialist party members will certainly have the biggest smiles on their faces this morning. But landslide victory this was not. The party improved massively on its last performance in national elections. It managed to take control of Spain's upper house of parliament too, but still lacks a majority to govern. Financial markets and the EU would ideally like to see the Socialists now jump into bed with the centre-right Citizens' party (which prefers to describe itself as ""liberal"") but a more likely Socialist party partnership is with populist left Podemos, with added support from Basque and possibly Catalan parties. Socialists battle to stop right-wing surge Pedro SÃ¡nchez: Spain's accidental PM on a roll That is something that many Spaniards - who are still smarting from Catalonia's brief but defiant declaration of independence - will resent. The recent push for Catalan independence and the perceived failure of Spain's traditional politicians to handle the situation is what suddenly drew large numbers of voters to the populist nationalist Vox party. It promised to ""make Spain great again"" - a familiar-sounding slogan, just as its tough stance on Islam, on crime and on immigration has echoes of France's Le Pen and Italy's Salvini. But unlike many of Europe's populist nationalists, Vox failed to seduce disillusioned workers traditionally voting for the left. Spain's incumbent Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez delivered a victory speech in Madrid Spain is a country that has been deeply divided between right and left since the country's civil war back in the 1930s. The idea of a far-right party in Spain's parliament - possibly even in government - for the first time since the death of fascist military dictator Francisco Franco, sickened large sections of Spanish society. You hear a number of voters saying it is not so much that they voted for the Socialists, but rather that they voted against Vox. In the end, Vox managed to win 24 parliamentary seats, roughly what polls had predicted, but the result fell far short of the political earthquake they had hoped for. Arguably their most dramatic achievement was to splinter Spain's political right, leaving the normally powerful centre-right, the now rather ironically-named Popular Party, humiliated. Spain's exhausted electorate now limps towards municipal, regional and European elections in a month's time. Deep political divisions seem to be the new normal in Europe - just take a look at France, Italy or the UK.

"MPs have criticised the director of public prosecutions over failings in the disclosure of evidence in criminal cases. A number of rape trials collapsed last year after it emerged vital evidence had not been given to defence lawyers. The Justice Select Committee said,externalAlison Saunders did not recognise the severity of the issue and there was ""insufficient leadership"". Ms Saunders said addressing problems in the system was her ""top priority"". She is due to stand down from her post in October at the end of a five-year contract. Police apologise for rape case errors All current rape cases 'urgently' reviewed Evidence withheld in 47 sex assault cases In the lead-up to criminal trials, police and prosecutors have a duty to disclose evidence or information that might either help the defence case, or harm the prosecution's case. But the Justice Committee's report said there have been ""persistent problems with the practice of disclosure"". ""We have seen at least six reports in as many years that have highlighted issues and made recommendations,"" it said. The committee said that despite this insight, Ms Saunders failed to recognise the extent and seriousness of long-term disclosure failings. Their report also said the Crown Prosecution Service may have underestimated the number of cases halted because of issues with disclosing evidence. Data from the CPS showed 841 cases in 2017/18 had to be stopped. But the committee said it knows that the true figure is higher - saying the CPS may have underestimated the number by 90%. Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said the police and CPS often see the disclosure of evidence as an ""administrative headache"" - a view which was ""not acceptable"". Mr Neill, a former barrister, added: ""Disclosure failings are extremely damaging for those concerned and can have a permanent life-long impact. ""These failings have caused miscarriages of justice and - as the director of public prosecutions even admitted to us - some people have gone to prison as a result."" The committee found failings in the ""application of disclosure by police officers and prosecutors on the ground"" and called for a culture change, so it was seen as a ""core justice duty"", rather than an ""administrative add-on"". When it came to Ms Saunders, the committee said there was ""insufficient focus and leadership"" in dealing with the problem and that she ""did not sufficiently recognise the extent and seriousness"" of failures within the process. The report, published on Friday, also called on the government to look at whether there is sufficient funding for the system. Mr Neill said: ""The proliferation of electronic evidence makes disclosure ever more challenging, and we need the right skills, technology, resources and guidelines, to resolve this once and for all. ""The failings are symptomatic of a system under immense strain: without change, we cannot expect the public to have confidence in the criminal justice system."" Responding to the report, Ms Saunders said: ""I have been very clear that addressing the long-standing problems in managing disclosure across the criminal justice system is my top priority. ""There is an unprecedented focus on finding solutions, and extensive action has been under way over the past year to bring about the necessary change not just in how cases are handled, but in the wider culture within the CPS and policing. ""This is not a quick fix. We will evaluate the measures taken, and agree further commitments to ensure there is continuous improvement."" This video can not be played Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders tells Today it was her decision to leave The National Police Chiefs' Council's lead for criminal justice, Chief Constable Nick Ephgrave, defended Ms Saunders, saying she was ""fully aware of the extent and seriousness of the disclosure failures"" and ""fully committed"" to working with them. Another review into disclosure is being carried out by the attorney general and a National Disclosure Improvement Plan is being put into place. In January, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) ordered a review of more than 3,600 cases in England and Wales after four cases were thrown out of court due to a lack of disclosure. The trial of Liam Allan was stopped in December at Croydon Crown Court, days before the prosecution of Isaac Itiary at Inner London Crown Court was halted. This video can not be played Liam Allan had been on bail for two years before his trial collapsed And in January, the case against Samson Makele was stopped at Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London, while Oxford student Oliver Mears - who had spent two years on bail - had the case against him dropped days before his trial was set to start.

"Santiago Abascal denies Vox is far-right and prefers to focus on Spanish unity When Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain's Vox party, was asked to explain its recent success, he said it was because it was ""in step with what millions of Spaniards think"". Vox has been derided as far-right and populist, anti-immigration and anti-Islam. But the 42-year-old Basque says instead it ""defends the constitutional order, constitutional reform in some areas, the unity of Spain and centralisation of the state, and wants immigration to be brought under control"". For a long time after its foundation in 2014, Vox struggled to make an impact on the Spanish political landscape. But ever since it filled a Madrid sports centre with 9,000 supporters last month, the party has been taken much more seriously. While one recent poll by Celeste-Tel gave Vox a 1% share of the electorate, five times more support than in January, another pollster, Metroscopia, put the party at just over 5% of voter intentions. That would be equivalent to a million votes. Its recent rise has coincided with Spain's newfound status as the main point of arrival for migrants crossing the Mediterranean to Europe and a more tolerant approach to immigration by a new Socialist government. ""Their message is a very standard right-wing one - they support law and order and they're against immigration,"" says JosÃ© Fernandez-Albertos of Spain's National Research Council (CSIC). But, he adds, ""the Catalan issue is what has most motivated their support so far"". Fighting for different futures in Catalonia Million rally for Catalonia independence Venezuelans escape to Spain and ask to return favour In recent years, the nationalist government of Catalonia has been campaigning to break away from Spain and in October 2017 the region's parliament issued a declaration of independence, before Madrid stepped in and introduced direct rule for several months. Santiago Abascal insists his party's policies are in step with how many Spaniards think The two main parties on the right, the Popular Party (PP), of which Mr Abascal used to be a member, and Ciudadanos (Citizens), have taken a firmly pro-union line against the independence movement. However, for many Spaniards they have not been tough enough and Vox has gone a step further, presenting lawsuits against the leaders of last year's failed secession bid. Many Vox policies, particularly on immigration, and its frequently voiced hostility to Islam, have drawn comparisons with far-right and populist parties elsewhere in Europe. The party proposes to ""make Spain great again"" and critics have described its ideology as a racist, nationalist throwback to the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Opponents of Vox see it as a far-right party A Jesuit school which had agreed to host the Vox rally in Valencia changed its mind, apparently concerned at the party's reputation, causing the event to be moved elsewhere. Why Franco's tomb is a headache for Spain French far-right leader Le Pen ordered to take psychiatric tests Outcry at German far-right child informer scheme Some of those who attended the rally said there was a social stigma attached to expressing support for Vox. ""People call me fascist, xenophobe, loads of things,"" said hotel worker Ana Ferrer, who was one of them. ""But those who really know me know I'm not like that. My partner is a woman, for example, and I'm not Catholic. For me, [Vox] is not on the far right."" Vox has attracted big numbers to its rallies as it pulls in supporters disaffected by other parties Vox's leaders also reject the far-right label, insisting it is a party of ""extreme necessity"" rather than extremism and its overall support for Spain's membership of the EU differentiates it from many populist and far-right movements across Europe. Mr FernÃ¡ndez-Albertos believes that Vox's specific appeal to middle-class, right-wing Spaniards means it will struggle for the kind of support that cuts across society in the same way as France's National Rally, and to a lesser extent Germany's AfD. But it could still influence the national debate, even if it fails to secure many seats in the next general election. ""If they emphasise immigration, anti-Islamism, the centrality of the Catalan issue and how hard we should be on Catalan secessionists, that might affect indirectly how the PP and also maybe how Ciudadanos behave on those issues,"" he said.

"Spain is still the most popular destination for holidaymakers, says Thomas Cook Fewer British holidaymakers have booked a summer holiday inside the European Union this year amid continuing Brexit uncertainty, Thomas Cook has said. The travel firm says almost half (48%) of the holidays it sold up until the end of February were to non-EU destinations, up 10% on last year. Despite this, the firm says Spain is still its most popular destination. Its findings chime with separate Post Office figures showing currency sales for long-haul destinations have jumped. Sales of the Japanese yen were up 12% so far this year compared with last, while sales of the Indonesian rupiah have increased by 9%, Post Office Travel Money said. ""Brexit has made us as a family think and for the first time we are going to Turkey,"" said Kevin Coles from Northamptonshire. ""The value of the pound there (against the lira), versus the euro (in eurozone countries) makes it a much better value holiday."" He adds: ""We will holiday in the UK in the summer and maybe look at Cyprus, Turkey or Dubai for autumn half term."" ""For us it's less to do with the travel arrangements, although the possibility of delays and long queues is in the back of your mind. "" The currency figures are based on Post Office transactions between 1 January and 23 April. The Post Office accounts for about a quarter of all UK currency transactions. It said the biggest growth in currency sales so far this year has been for the Egyptian pound, which has seen a 687% year-on-year increase. Thomas Cook - through which 19 million people book holidays each year - said after Spain, Turkey had proved the most popular destination for its holidaymakers, accounting for a quarter of its flight-only bookings so far. Thomas Cook said Tunisia was also ""faring well"" with package bookings to the country double that of last year, with flight-only bookings up four-fold. Tourism to the country fell dramatically aftera 2015 terrorism attack in the resort of Soussein which 30 British tourists and eight others were killed by a gunman with links to Islamic State. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office lifted its travel ban against the country last year, prompting British operators to renew flights to Tunisia's Mediterranean coast. Thomas Cook has made two profit warnings in the past six months following drops in holiday bookings.  In March,it detailed plansto close 21 stores across the country and cut more than 300 jobs. Chief executive Peter Fankhauser said it was still too early to tell the impact on bookings of the UK's exit from the European Union being delayed to the end of October. But he said there was ""little doubt that the prolonged uncertainty around the manner and timing of Britain's exit from the European Union has led many customers to press pause on their holiday plans for this summer"".

"Northlink runs ferries between Aberdeen, Orkney and Shetland NorthLink has reduced the amount of plastics used on its ferry services to and from the Northern Isles by more than 200,000 items each year. Operator Serco said it made the move to reduce its environmental footprint. It is replacing 87,000 disposable cups and 28,000 lids with compostable alternatives. The company said that plastic teaspoons, food trays and portion pots for sauces would also also be removed from the services. Ferry operator to end plastic straw use CalMac to further reduce plastic waste Northlink runs ferries between Aberdeen, Kirkwall and Lerwick, as well as the route between Scrabster and Stromness. NorthLink announced a move away from plastics last year Seumas Campbell, from Serco NorthLink, said: ""Looking after the natural environment is such an important part of the service we provide. ""So we are passionate about minimising our impact on the world around us. ""The steps we have taken to remove single-use plastics are very positive and we will keep looking for more opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint."" Last year, NorthLink said it wasreplacing plastic straws with paper oneson all its sailings in an effort to tackle plastic pollution in seas and on beaches. The move follows a drive from many organisations to reduce single-use plastic consumption because of the 'Attenborough effect.' The veteran broadcaster's series, Blue Planet 2, highlighted the damaging impact plastic is having on the marine environment.

"The cup that cheers... but do you really need sugar in it? It might be a ritual for many but scientists say your cup of tea does not actually need a spoonful of sugar. A study found participants were able to cut it out without their enjoyment being affected - suggesting a long-term change in behaviour was possible. Scientists said quitting in one go or reducing intake gradually were both effective strategies to reduce consumption. The authors said a bigger trial was needed to confirm their findings. A team including researchers from University College London and the University of Leeds analysed data over one month for 64 men who usually drank tea sweetened with sugar. The truth about sugar,external Listen: A short history of sugar Is sugar really bad for you? Participants were split equally into men who quit in one drastic step, those who gradually reduced sugar in their tea over four weeks and a control group who continued to drink sweetened tea. The results suggested that the groups who reduced sugar were still able to enjoy a cuppa without a spoonful of the sweet stuff. At the end of the study, 42% of those in the gradual reduction group quit sugar in tea as did 36% of those who eliminated it in one go. Six per cent of men in the control group also gave it up in their cuppa. The team concluded: ""Reducing sugar in tea doesn't affect liking, suggesting long-term behaviour change is possible."" The researchers added that similar methods could be used to reduce sugar intake in other drinks such as squash. The findings were peer-reviewed by conference officials at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow.

"This video can not be played The shooting happened at a synagogue in Poway, north of San Diego A rabbi who was injured in the deadly shooting at a synagogue near San Diego on Saturday has described the moment he faced the gunman. Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein says he lifted his hands when he saw the ""murder terrorist"". The man shot and the rabbi lost his right index finger. One woman died and two other people were injured in the attack. A 19-year-old man named as John Earnest was arrested shortly afterwards in Poway, north of the Californian city. America's gun culture in 10 charts The threat of rising anti-Semitism in US The attack comes exactly six months after ashooting in Pittsburghin which 11 people were killed, thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. Rabbi Goldstein was walking into the banquet hall at the synagogue when he heard a noise - what he thought initially was a table falling over or a congregation member collapsing. ""As soon as he saw me, he started to shoot toward me and that is when I put my hands up,"" Rabbi Goldstein said on NBC's Sunday Today programme. ""I cannot erase that face from my mind."" He held up his hands to shield himself but his fingers ""got blown away"". This video can not be played Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein speaks to reporters about Saturday's attack Rabbi Goldstein hurried through to the banquet hall where a number of children - including his granddaughter - were gathered. ""I just ran, not even knowing that my fingers were blown off and curled all the kids together and got them outside,"" he said. Lori Kaye, who helped found the synagogue with Rabbi Goldstein, was shot dead in the attack. ""Everyone in the community knew her,"" he said. ""I'm just so heartbroken and saddened by the senseless killing."" A 34-year-old man and a young girl suffered shrapnel wounds in the attack. By Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor The routine is all too familiar. Another murderous attack on a place of worship, this time in San Diego, followed by the obligatory offer of prayers. ""Thoughts and prayers to all those affected"", tweeted President Donald Trump. Then, during a brief on-camera statement, Mr Trump said it looked like a hate-crime. ""Hard to believe,"" he added. Sadly, it is not hard to believe at all. Anti-Semitic incidents in the US surged 57% in 2017 - the most recent data available - the largest year-on-year increase since the century-old Jewish advocacy group began collecting data in 1979, says the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremism in the US. The horrendous attack in San Diego follows the deadliest attack on Jews in US history at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last October. It will now be added to the ADL figures. And the numbers, to tragic results, continue to rise. Sheriff Gore said officers were called to the Chabad synagogue just before 11:30 (18:30 GMT) after the man opened fire with an ""AR-15 type"" assault rifle. He said an off-duty border patrol officer had fired at the suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle, but had not not hit him. The suspect was later arrested by another officer, said San Diego chief of police David Nisleit. ""He clearly saw the suspect's vehicle, the suspect jumped out with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" Mr Nisleit said. ""As the officer was placing this 19-year-old male into custody, he clearly saw a rifle on the front passenger seat of the suspect vehicle."" San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told reporters that investigators were reviewing the suspect's social media activity and examining a virulently anti-Semitic ""open letter"" published online. In the letter, which appeared on the online forum 8chan hours before the attack, the author - who identified himself as John Earnest - said he had been inspired by theattack on two Christchurch mosqueslast month, as well as the Pittsburgh shooting last October. The racist, anti-Semitic document that police are investigating in relation to the shooting makes 10 references to Robert Bowers - charged with killing 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh - whom the author John Earnest calls an ""inspiration"". Authorities later said Mr Earnest was under investigation in connection with a fire at a mosque last month. ""All of the Jewish community across the country is concerned,"" Joel Rubin, a Democratic Strategist and member of the Tree of Life synagogue, told Fox News on Saturday. ""My daughters go to Hebrew school and we see police cars often in front of the school, guarding it. That's not the situation in America we want to be living in."" Meanwhile, the Times of Israel published a blog post headlined,""Synagogue shootings - now a thing"",external. A message of support outside the Chabad synagogue near San Diego In the aftermath of the Pittsburgh attack, members of the US Jewish community began openly questioning whether the era of seeing the US as a safe haven was over. ""I had been dreading and expecting this day, and more like it, for two years,"" wrote the Washington Post columnist Dana Millbank, in a column titled""Trump's America is not a safe place for Jews"",external. As Pittsburgh reeled, its teenagers mobilised Mr Trump has publicly condemned anti-Semitism, and White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said it was ""outrageous"" to suggest he bore any responsibility for it, but many have accused him of using coded anti-Semitic language. The ADL publicly called on him to stop using tropes such as ""global special interests"" and ""those who control the levers of power"" - both of which he ran in an ad alongside pictures of prominent Jews - as well as his claim that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" in Charlottesville, after white nationalists chanted ""Jews will not replace us"".

"This video can not be played Cyclone Kenneth left roads looking like waterfalls The situation in northern Mozambique is worse than thought, a UN spokesman says, days after Cyclone Kenneth ravaged the country. The system struck the Africa nation on Thursday with winds of 220km/h (140mph) which flattened whole villages. Around 700,000 people are now thought to be at risk in the area as torrential rains continue. Pemba, regional capital of Cabo Delgado state, has experienced more than 2m (6.5ft) of rain and flooding. Africa Live: Update on the aftermath of Cyclone Kenneth, and other stories Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) spokesman Saviano Abreu said the situation in the towns of Macomia and Quissanga was critical, adding that there were also worries for the cut-off island of Ibo.

""We are very worried because, according to the forecasts, heavy rain is expected for the next four days,"" Deborah Nguyen, UN World Food Programme spokeswoman, told AFP news agency. ""We expect the rainfall to be twice as much as that which accompanied Cyclone Idai,"" she added. Cyclone Idai killed more than 900 people across three countries in March this year. Pemba is thought to be home to about 400,000 people, and the heavy rains have placed many in danger.

UN agencies are aiding local authorities, and Mr Guterres appealed for ""additional resources"" from the international community ""to fund the response in the immediate, medium and longer term"". Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there. That, in addition to warnings by authorities ahead of the storm, could significantly stem losses compared with Cyclone Idai.
