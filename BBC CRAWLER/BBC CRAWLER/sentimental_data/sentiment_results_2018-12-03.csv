"This video can not be played Jude Tebbutt: ""If there has been a miscarriage of justice, it needs to be investigated"" A British woman kidnapped by Somali pirates believes the man convicted in connection with the case is innocent. Jude Tebbutt and her husband David were attacked while on holiday in Kenya in 2011 - he was killed and she was held hostage in Somalia for six months. Kenyan Ali Babitu Kololo was convicted but Mrs Tebbutt has told the BBC she now believes he was made a scapegoat. Mrs Tebbutt said she did not believe Kololo had been given a ""fair trial"". The BBC has also learned that a former Metropolitan Police officer is under investigation for his role in the case - and that investigation is examining whether he may have committed a crime. Jude Tebbutt: My six months as a hostage Death penalty in Kenya tourist case Within a few days of the kidnap, a team of counter-terrorism detectives from the Metropolitan Police flew to Kenya to help with the investigation. In 2012, local man Kololo was convicted of robbery with violence in a Kenyan court and sentenced to death - later commuted to life imprisonment. Authorities in Kenya are not looking for any other suspects. The head of the Met's investigation team - Det Supt Neil Hibberd - was the prosecution's key witness. Kololo was convicted and sentenced to death - later commuted to life imprisonment At the trial, Mrs Tebbutt did not recognise Kololo as one of the kidnap gang. She said: ""I thought that there'd be someone coming through that door that was a representation of either the two men who dragged me out of bed that night, the two men - one of whom, or both of them, murdered David, the men that were in the boat, the men that kept me for over six months. ""But honestlyâ¦ it wasn't one of those men."" Kololo was accused of leading the attackers to the bungalow they were staying in but she is concerned that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Miscarriage of justice charity Reprieve, which is assisting Mr Kololo, states that he is illiterate, and was denied access to both a lawyer and a translator for most of the trial. ""Ali Kololo's initial death sentence, following a highly flawed trial, may not have happened without the involvement of British authorities,"" said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. Mrs Tebbutt was released on 21 March 2012 after being held captive for 192 days in Somalia Now Mr Hibberd is himself under investigation for possible criminal conduct and Mrs Tebbutt is supporting the appeal of the only man convicted of involvement in her husband's murder. ""I think a wrong should be righted,"" said Mrs Tebbutt. ""And when I say wrong I mean the fact that Mr Kololo didn't have a fair trial. ""I do want justice. But I don't want justice at any costâ¦ I don't want anyone sentenced and put into prison and spend seven years of his life when there is any shadow of a doubt over it."" Mrs Tebbutt, pictured now, is supporting Kololo's appeal In court proceedings, Kololo's lawyers have claimed that Mr Hibberd - who has now retired - withheld forensic evidence that undermined the case against him. They also claim he misled the court by giving selective evidence, and that he should not have taken part in a trial where the defendant faced the death penalty, and had been tortured. BBC News understands that Mr Hibberd will shortly be interviewed by the National Crime Agency, in an investigation overseen by the IOPC police watchdog. In a letter seen by BBC News, the Metropolitan Police confirmed Mr Hibberd is being investigated to see if he may have committed a criminal offence or misconduct or gross misconduct. Mr Hibberd's lawyers told the BBC that he intends to co-operate with the investigation. Mr Hibberd is under investigation for possible criminal conduct Mrs Tebbutt admitted some people might think it was surprising that she was standing up for the man convicted for his role in her husband's death but she said: ""It is the right thing to do."" Mrs Tebbutt said her husband David was an honourable man and that ""the honourable thing to do now is to hopefully get a fair trial"". She added: ""That is the least Mr Kololo deserves. ""Mr Neil Hibberd said to me that if it was the last thing that he did he would find the murderer of David and the people responsible for abducting me - and I believed him.  I really believed him. ""I think they have to take ownership of what they did back in 2011 - the team that helped to convict Mr Kololo - an innocent man.""

"Carl Beech's allegation sparked a Â£2.5m inquiry by Scotland Yard A man who claimed he was the victim of an alleged VIP paedophile ring can now be named as Carl Beech. A judge at Newcastle Crown Court has lifted an order barring publication of his name. He had previously been known by the pseudonym Nick. Mr Beech, who is 50, has been charged with 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud. He is due to stand trial next May. He made allegations against the ex-chief of the defence staff, Lord Bramall, and politicians Sir Edward Heath, Lord Brittan and Harvey Proctor. His claims led to a Â£2.5m inquiry by Scotland Yard - Operation Midland. No action resulted from his allegations and the inquiry was closed. Mr Beech was charged after Northumbria Police passed a file to the Crown Prosecution Service in September 2017. He appeared at court via video link. He will stand trial on 7 May next year.

"This video can not be played Manchester club bouncer fight ""left man with brain bleed"" Bouncers from Manchester's Factory 251 nightclub have been sacked after an 18-year-old rugby league player was assaulted outside the club. St Helens academy player Joe Sharratt suffered a serious head injury and is in a stable condition in hospital. His mother Jane Sharratt told the BBC that he had a bleed on the brain but was now ""sitting up and talking"". Video footage shows Mr Sharratt being thrown to the ground before door staff repeatedly punch his friend. Greater Manchester Police has appealed for witnesses to the attack at 03:20 GMT on Sunday. It has also asked Manchester City Council to carry out an expedited review and to suspend the nightclub's licence. Factory said it ""immediately terminated the service contract"" with the security contractor Professional Security and would be closed on Monday night. The security contractor also confirmed that it has sacked the staff involved. Joe Sharratt played just hours earlier for Lancashire Academy against Australian Schoolboys Mr Sharratt's friend Leon Cooper, 18, can be seen getting punched several times in the footage. The pharmacy student at Manchester University said they were escorted out of the club following a ""pushing"" incident inside. He said he became involved in swearing with one of the bouncers before one of the door staff ran at Mr Sharratt, and then several bouncers ""started jumping on"" him. Describing the attack, he said:  ""I tried to help him but they were just hitting me. ""I wasn't trying to attack them...I was just trying to get to my mate."" He added: ""I didn't even realise how many times I had been hit. ""You can see in the video I'm just trying to get to him [Mr Sharratt] and they're whacking me even though I'm not punching them at all."" He said he had suffered bruising to the side of his body, swelling to his head and had coughed up blood since the attack. Factory 251 nightclub which is housed in the former HQ of Factory Records A statement on the security company's website,externalstated: ""We can confirm that Professional Security has terminated the contracts of all of the security personnel involved in this incident. ""We are also working closely with the local authorities, police, and the Security Industry Authority to ensure that appropriate action is taken swiftly against all of these door supervisors."" The company said it was ""appalled by the behaviour of the door supervisors...which contradicts everything that we strive to achieve"". In adamning report,externalto the city council's licensing committee, police stated there were concerns about ""serious disorder"" and ""extreme violence"", and were concerned nobody at the club contacted police. It states the way the club dealt with the incident pointed towards a ""lack of duty of care"". The report goes on to say a member of the public was ""left with a bleed on the brain"" that could have ""ended up as a fatality"" and adds: ""The fact that the premises didn't bother to contact the police is extremely concerning. ""This would suggest either a worrying level of incompetence at best or, more seriously, a possible attempt to cover up the incident."" Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC, Mr Sharratt's parents, Jane and Brian, said their son was recovering and ""making a few jokes...which is a really good sign"". They said Joe was a ""lovely lad"" and getting the call about the incident was ""probably the worst nightmare"". A St Helens spokesman said: ""Joe is of impeccable character and is an upstanding member of our Academy system. ""He is a top academic achiever with a very bright future ahead of him alongside his rugby league prowess."" Factory, which opened in 2010, said: ""Having viewed CCTV footage and the video circulating on social media, we can only say that we are shocked by what we have seen."" The Princess Street club is housed in what was once the headquarters of the Factory Records label that represented Joy Division, New Order and Happy Mondays and The Hacienda nightclub.

"This video can not be played Michelle Obama: âMy parents saw this flame in me"" Michelle Obama has said she still feels ""impostor syndrome"", adding that ""it never goes away"". Mrs Obama was speaking during her return to Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School, an all-girls school in north London she previously visited in 2009. The former US First Lady also attended a sold-out event at London's Royal Festival Hall. There she recalled how the Queen had dismissed royal protocol as ""rubbish"" when the Obamas visited Windsor Castle. She said she was panicking about how to act but the Queen said: ""Just get in"". On Monday evening, Mrs Obama spoke to author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at the Southbank Centre to promote her new autobiography Becoming. More than 40,000 peoplehad reportedly tried to get tickets onlinewhen the event went on sale. And last month, her memoirbecame the best-selling bookreleased this year, just 15 days after being published. Mrs Obama was in conversation with Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Mrs Obama also spoke to an audience of 300 students at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School in Islington as part of her book tour. She first visited the school during the G20 summit nine years ago, when she had only been first lady for a few months. Asked how she felt to be seen as a ""symbol of hope"", Mrs Obama told students: ""I still have a little [bit of] impostor syndrome, it never goes away, that you're actually listening to me. ""It doesn't go away, that feeling that you shouldn't take me that seriously. What do I know? I share that with you because we all have doubts in our abilities, about our power and what that power is. ""If I'm giving people hope then that is a responsibility, so I have to make sure that I am accountable.

Impostor syndrome is a term used to describe feelings of insecurity or self-doubt, despite there being no evidence to support such a belief. During the event at the Southbank Centre, Mrs Obama also recalled her and President Barack Obama's visit to meet the Queen. This video can not be played When Michelle Obama hugged the Queen ""I had all this protocol buzzing in my head and I was like 'don't trip down the stairs and don't touch anybody, whatever you do'. ""And so the Queen says 'just get in, sit wherever' and she's telling you one thing and you're remembering protocol and she says 'Oh it's all rubbish, just get in'."" Mr Obama served two terms in the White House. Mrs Obama is a lawyer and has led charity initiatives including Let Girls Learn, to promote education for girls around the world. Mrs Obama also described her experience of black women being caricatured, saying: ""The size of our hips, our style, our swag, it becomes co-opted but then we are demonised. ""My advice to young women in that you have to start by getting those demons out of your head. The questions I ask myself - 'am I good enough?' - that haunts us, because the messages that are sent from the time we are little is: maybe you are not, don't reach too high, don't talk too loud."" The former first lady said this was true for women and working-class people, and ""profound for women of colour"", as people in power tried to make them feel they did not ""belong"". ""Here is the secret,"" she added. ""I have been at probably every powerful table that you can think of, I have worked at non-profits, I have been at foundations, I have worked in corporations, served on corporate boards, I have been at G-summits, I have sat in at the UN; they are not that smart.""

"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough addressing the climate change conference in Poland. The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has said climate change is humanity's greatest threat in thousands of years. The broadcaster said it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of ""much of the natural world"". He was speaking at the opening ceremony of United Nations-sponsored climate talks in Katowice, Poland. The meeting is the most critical on climate change since the 2015 Paris agreement. Sir David said: ""Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. ""If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon."" The naturalist is taking up the ""People's Seat"" at the conference, called COP24. He is supposed to act as a link between the public and policy-makers at the meeting. ""The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,"" he said. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"" for many countries. He explained that the world is ""nowhere near where it needs to be"" on the transition to a low-carbon economy. But the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to ""right the ship"" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps. Meanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? 'Trump effect' limits action on climate This video can not be played Climate activist: 'It's high time that Poland phased out coal' This Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)reporton limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October. The IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030. Buta recent studyshowed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years. In an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action. They say ""decisive action in the next two years will be crucial"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider. So urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start. Yes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting. The number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment. But for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical. They will want to show that international co-operation can still work even in the age of President Trump. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Rather than spending all their time working on how to increase ambitions to cut carbon, conference delegates are likely to focus on trying to finalise the technical rules of how the Paris agreement will work. A collage of children's drawing about climate change laid out on a glacier in Switzerland While the agreement was ratified in record time by more than 180 countries in 2016, it doesn't become operational until 2020. Before then, delegates must sort out common rules on measuring, reporting and verifying (checking to avoid the misreporting of) greenhouse gas emissions, and on how climate finance is going to be provided. ""The rulebook is the thing that will absorb most of the negotiators' capacity at this year's COP,"" said Camilla Born, from the climate change think tank, E3G. ""It's no surprise, as agreeing the Paris rules is both technically and politically a complicated task - but it is worth it!"" What is in the Paris climate agreement? Last four years are 'world's hottest' Race to pull greenhouse gases from air Right now, that rule book runs to several hundred pages with thousands of brackets, indicating areas of dispute. Under the Paris agreement, each country decides for itself the actions it will take when it comes to cutting carbon. Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action. ""We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,"" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF. ""Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast."" There is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians. Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24 ""Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,"" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues. ""Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture."" Others involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world. ""We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,"" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme. Many developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement. Some are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting. ""A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,"" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. Yes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many. The Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia. This bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some. ""Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,"" said SÃ©bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law. Although the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24. However, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels.A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect. In graphics:Seven charts that show the rate of warming Advice:What can I do to help?

"This video can not be played President Trump visits George HW Bush's coffin lying in state at the US Capitol US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania have paid their respects to President George HW Bush as he lies in state at the US Capitol. Mr Trump made a brief visit to the rotunda, where the public can visit the coffin until the funeral on Wednesday. Mr Trump has in the past clashed with the Bush family but will attend the funeral service. Mr Bush, who died on Friday aged 94, will later be buried in his home state of Texas, alongside his wife, Barbara. His coffin had earlier left Texas to a 21-gun salute and was carried to Washington on board Air Force One - temporarily renamed Special Air Mission 41 in homage to the late president. The making of a president A life in pictures Service dog Sully pays touching last tribute Mr Bush, who served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, had been receiving treatment for a form of Parkinson's disease and had been admitted to hospital with a blood infection in April. BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher, Capitol Hill Three hours after an assemblage of officials, dignitaries, family and friends welcomed the coffin of President George HW Bush to the US Capitol, the current president and first lady made a mid-evening visit to pay their respects. The motorcade took only a few minutes to travel down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. At 20:30 (01:30 GMT on Tuesday) Donald and Melania Trump arrived inside what was now a relatively empty Capitol rotunda. Members of the five branches of the US military continued to stand to attention, as the two approached the flag-draped coffin. The president gave an extended salute and the first lady put her hand over her heart. The only sound in the massive, marbled room - where 32 people, including 12 presidents, have lain in state - was the steady whirr of press cameras. Mr and Mrs Trump then turned and left. In all, the president was away from the White House less than half an hour, without a word to the public or press. The president tweeted that he was ""looking forward"" to seeing the ""wonderful Bush family"" at a presidential guest house on Tuesday. He added that Mrs Trump would be giving former First Lady Laura Bush a tour of the White House Christmas decorations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ex-tennis champion Boris Becker has dropped his claim to have diplomatic immunity from bankruptcy. The three-time Wimbledon winner had said his appointment as a Central African Republic (CAR) diplomat gave him protection from any legal claims. Declared bankrupt in 2017 over money owed to bank Arbuthnot Latham, he was being pressed for ""further assets"". After a hearing in London, Mr Becker abandoned his case and his bankruptcy has been extended indefinitely. His withdrawal means a planned auction of his trophies and memorabilia will go ahead. The items for sale, which are worth an estimated Â£200,000, include a certificate commemorating his men's doubles gold medal win with Michael Stich in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and a lot containing a sweater, wristbands and socks. The conflict-ridden CAR is one of the world's poorest countries. It made Mr Becker a sport and culture attache to the EU in April 2018. CAR has bigger problems than Boris Becker The country where teachers have disappeared Should diplomats still have immunity? Mr Becker was declared bankrupt after Arbuthnot Latham claimed he owed them a large sum for more than two years. However lawyers acting for the bankruptcy trustees told a specialist insolvency court on Monday that Mr Becker had written in an email that he had ""no alternative but to abandon the claim for diplomatic immunity"". The tennis star, who did not attend the hearing and was not represented by lawyers, also wrote that he was ""not in a position"" financially to pursue any part of his case. The bankruptcy was due to be discharged in June but was put on hold to allow further investigation of Mr Becker's claim of diplomatic immunity. At the time, Mr Becker said: ""This order relates to one disputed loan which I was due to repay in full in one month's time."" But a court registrar said Mr Becker gave the impression of""a man with his head in the sand"".

He won it again in 1986 and 1989 among the 64 ATP Tour titles he claimed during a 15-year career. After his retirement he became a pundit for the BBC.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I went to the G20 with a clear message that Britain is open for business"" The UK is committed to doing trade deals beyond Europe as soon as possible after Brexit, Theresa May has said. The PM told MPs she had had discussions at last week's G20 summit on ambitious economic partnerships with Australia, Chile, Canada and Japan among others. She said she had also had a positive conversation with Donald Trump. But Jeremy Corbyn said the US President had rejected her Brexit deal ""because it did not put America First"" and her plan was based on ""vague assumptions"". During a Commons statement on the two-day gathering in Buenos Aires, the two leaders also clashed over the PM's meeting with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad Bin Salman. Live: May statement on G20 Rifts laid bare as G20 leaders meet Mrs May said she had had a ""frank and open"" conversation with him about the need for a thorough and transparent inquiry into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and for the perpetrators to be held to account. But the Labour leader said all Mrs May had done was offer ""warm words"" when firm action was needed in response to the killing, and to Saudi Arabia's role in the bloody conflict in the Yemen. He asked Mrs May when the UK would follow the lead of other countries by ending all arms sales to the Saudi regime. ""Rather than be robust, as she promised, we learned the prime minister told the dictator 'please don't use the weapons we are selling you in the war you're waging' and asked him nicely to investigate the murder he allegedly ordered,"" he said. ""Leaders should not just offer warm words against human rights atrocities but back up their words with action."" This video can not be played Corbyn: G20 'too slow' to respond to financial crash On trade, Mrs May said the UK's proposed withdrawal agreement from the EU, which MPs will vote on next week, would allow it to negotiate, sign and ratify new trade deals from the moment it leaves next March. Although any deals cannot be implemented until the end of the transition period, due to end on 31 December 2020, she suggested aspects of them could be ""brought into practice"" before then. Mr Trump has cast doubt on the proposed Brexit deal, suggesting it would tie the UK too closely to EU rules, and could hamper a future bilateral trade deal with the US. But Mrs May said the US President, who is involved in trade disputes with China, Canada and the European Union, had made it clear that it was his ambition to secure a deal with the UK. ""I was clear with him that we can indeed do a trade deal with the United States of America with the (Brexit) deal that is on the table with the European Union,"" she said. Veteran Conservative MP Ken Clarke questioned what access the US was prepared to give to UK firms in areas such as financial services and public procurement and whether, in return, the UK would have to compromise in areas such as food standards.

"A Gloucestershire village has been treated to the unusual sight of three rainbows. BBC Weather Watcher Gordon photographed the rainbows in the village of Frampton on Severn. He described the sight as ""amazing"", adding: ""I've never seen such a thing before."" A regular rainbow happens when sunlight is refracted through water droplets, usually rain drops, splitting the light into the spectrum of colours. By Matt Taylor, BBC Weather Double rainbows, which follow the same arc as each other, occur when sunlight is internally reflected as it passes through the raindrops. Effectively another arc of light emerges but the resulting secondary bow is less bold in its colouring and the colours are reversed. You can see this in Gordon's Weather Watcher picture. So what of the third bow? This is known as a reflection bow. Whilst rare, a reflection rainbow mainly occurs when the sun is lower on the horizon behind you (i.e. late afternoon/evening) and when you are near to a large body of water, such as a river, lake or sea inlet. Sunlight reflects off the surface of the water and through raindrops, but at a different angle to the direct beam of sunlight. This secondary beam of sunlight causes the centre of the rainbow arc to be higher in the sky, roughly the same distance above the horizon as the centre of the original rainbow below. This is why, on Gordon's picture, our third bow is at a different angle and crosses over the other rainbows. On rare occasions rays of light are reflected three times within a rain drop and a triple rainbow is produced. There have only been five scientific reports of triple rainbows in 250 years, says international scientific body the Optical Society. Your pictures: Rainbows Is this the longest-lasting rainbow?

"MPs continued debating the government's Brexit deal, ahead of vote next Tuesday Thursday's debate focused on the economic impact of the agreement Commons business began with questions to Brexit ministers House of Lords also debated the Brexit deal this afternoon Sophie Morris, Ryan Brown and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. Sir Graham Brady ""would welcome"" a delay in the Brexit vote if it would help resolve MPs' concerns. House of CommonsParliament That's it for our coverage today, as MPs complete their third day of debate on the withdrawal agreement. Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire is now introducing his adjournment debate on the illegal trade in seahorses in the UK. MPs are due to continue their debate on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament International Trade Secretary Liam Fox says the ""status quo has never been on offer"" as the EU ""wants an ever closer union"". ""We have to find a compromise that makes this workable,"" he says, adding: ""the withdrawal agreement achieves just that, and is the only deal on the table"". DUP MP Ian Paisley intervenes to says the ""gallows are being built"" for the deal ahead of Tuesday's planned vote - and asks if there have been discussions about delaying it. Liam Fox replies says ministers will ""continue to make the case"" for the deal, but adds: ""the government will want to talk to members, of course it will want to look to ways to give a reassurance"". He says ""I understand why MPs have concerns about the backstop, but it is clear that it is there to be a temporary measure"". Liam Fox says Labour is ""playing politics at a time of great national decision-making"", and their Brexit policy is ""ill-researched and delusional"". He says that by agreeing to hold to the referendum, Parliament ""sub-contracted its sovereignty"" to voters, and MPs must now ""live up to our side of the bargain"".  Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up the debate for Labour, shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner says the government has ""tried to exclude Parliament from the process at all stages"". ""This is a deal that members on all sides now believe is not in the best interest of the country,"" he says. Mr Gardiner says the UK will be ""much poorer than we otherwise would be"" under the government's agreement. He calls on Liam Fox to be ""yet more flexible still"" on the next steps for Brexit, and ""recall his own words"" given to a Sunday newspaper in 2012. Back then, he says, Mr Fox called for the UK to renegotiate a ""new relationship"" with the EU, based on ""an economic partnership involving a customs union and the single market in goods and services"". ""The secretary of state may not like it, but it sounds an awful lot like Labour party policy to me"", he adds. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Like other MPs today, the DUP's Jim Shannon picks up on the proposed 'backstop' plan for the Irish border in the government's deal. He says there is ""no legal form for leaving this international treaty without consent"", adding that this is ""not acceptable"". He says the people of Northern Ireland must stand up for themselves and he has ""a mistrust for the government at this time"". ""The government have voted for Northern Ireland to become a voiceless victim of the UK,"" he concludes. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Next up this evening is Labour MP Karen Lee - who was a Remainer in 2016 but her constituency of Lincoln voted to leave. She ""sincerely believes"" there is a Brexit deal that will benefit her constituents, she says. ""But this deal will not protect jobs, workplace rights or environmental standards, and it will inhibit business by failing to ensure frictionless trade"", she adds. ""We can renegotiate with the EU - or better still, hold a general election"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Vicky Ford - who used to be member of the European Parliament and voted Remain - says MPs need to respect the vote to leave. ""A second referendum would be even more divisive and no more decisive,"" she adds. Ms Ford says leaving the EU with no deal poses ""a huge risk"" and the withdrawal agreement helps real businesses remain secure and offers time to develop a future framework. She calls Labour's plan of ""a close relationship with the single market without being in it"" a ""fantasy land"". Ms Ford says the backstop plan is not a ""practical risk"", as remaining in the arrangement permanently ""is not in the EU's interest"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Andrew Bowie says many of his colleagues on the Conservative benches are still ""struggling to come to a conclusion"" on which way they will vote. He adds that he voted to leave the EU ""and supports the deal"". Mr Bowie says he backs the agreement ""as it is the best for business, his constituents and Scotland"". ""I believe this deal is better than what we have now,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman says the deal provides no certainty and there is no guarantee that a better one could be negotiated. Leaving without a deal on the other hand is not an option, she adds. The only other option is that MPs go back to the people and tell them the truth that ""we cannot leave the club and expect to keep all the benefits"". ""That is mission impossible"", she says. ""It is time for a people's vote"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Lee Rowley says ""we are arguing over commas in this deal, when whole paragraphs of it do not work"", and for this reason he will not be backing the deal. ""I did not come to this place to make people poorer,"" he says. ""I cannot go back to my constituents and say this deal gives them Brexit - it does not"". He says he disagrees with the deal as it is ""a failure of nerve and ambition"", and calls for it to be stopped. Mr Rowley calls on the government ""to move the UK out of its shadow"" and ""get Brexit back on track"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi says the Brexitlegal advicepublished this week shows Northern Ireland ""has been sold out"". The Brexit process has been ""blurred, botched and bungled from the very start"", he adds. Mr Singh Dhesi says the prime minister is ""not up to the task"" and ""has created division and discord"". The Conservatives must ""stand aside"" to allow a general election, he concludes. House of LordsParliament The debate on the government's Brexit deal has ended - and business in the House of Lords for today comes to an end. Peers will resume the debate on Monday. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of LordsParliament Wrapping up the Lords debate, Tory peer Lord Horam says the referendum result was ""a wake up call"". He says the withdrawal agreement is ""surprisingly good in the circumstances"", but Brexit is not the answer to the ""fundamental social problems"" that triggered the vote to leave. He does not expect the agreement to win Parliament's approval, he says, warning that if the decision is to be returned to the people the Remain side must do better. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative MP Maggie Throup says she will be supporting the government's Brexit deal next week ""if it stays the same"". She says another referendum would be ""undemocratic"". She calls for MPs to ""end the political games, and reflect on what the consequences of rejecting this deal will be"". ""This deal is in the public interest,"" she says. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Giles Watling, who voted Remain, says he was re-elected in his leave-voting constituency because his party pledged to ""deliver on their wishes"". The government's Brexit deal ""does tick so many of the boxes"", he says - but he adds that he still has ""serious concerns"" about the backstop. ""What has been the point of the last two years of uncertainty and pain"" he asks, if the UK is ""still under the dominion the European Court of Justice"". ""Best endeavours"" to negotiate a future relationship deal are ""not cast iron"", he concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mr Ratelband maintained he has the body of a 40-something and a young age is part of his identity A Dutchman who wanted to change his date of birth to boost dating prospects has lost his legal battle to do so. Emile Ratelband, still aged 69, wanted to change his birth date by 20 years to avoid what he called discrimination. ""We live in a time when you can change your name and change your gender. Why can't I decide my own age?"" he said. But the court disagreed, highlighting that many rights in law are based on a person's age, and changing it at will could cause many problems. There was no legal basis to make such a change, it said. ""Mr Ratelband is at liberty to feel 20 years younger than his real age and to act accordingly,"" the judges said, but changing his legal documents would have ""undesirable legal and societal implications"". Mr Ratelband, who calls himself a ""positivity trainer"", made headlines around the world with his unusual request. Ahead of the hearing, he made TV and other press appearances, saying he felt discriminated against in both employment and on the popular dating app Tinder - and said his doctors had told him he had the body of someone in their 40s. ""If I'm 49, then I can buy a new house, drive a different car. I can take up more work,"" he said. ""When I'm on Tinder and it says I'm 69, I don't get an answer. When I'm 49, with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position."" Man told he was too old for job Man, 67, denied job because of age bias Alongside the widespread media attention, he was criticised by some for comparing his bid to the position of people in the transgender community. This video can not be played The Dutch pensioner who wants to be 20 years younger. In court, Mr Ratelband argued that the date on his birth certificate was a mistake - even though he was born on that day, 11 March 1949. The court agreed with him that age is part of a person's identity. But unlike a person's gender or name, which Mr Ratelband sought to draw comparisons to, it had further complications. ""Rights and obligations are also attached to age...  for example, the right to vote, the right to marry, the opportunity to drink alcohol and to drive a car,"" the court said. It found that the possibility of declaring oneself younger could open the door to the opposite - becoming older. In its judgement, the court said that granting the request would cause ""all kinds of legal problems"" by effectively erasing 20 years of events. It pondered what would happen to qualifications obtained in that time, or a driving licence issued, or a marriage solemnised. It also said that while changes to the law to allow a person to change their gender took place following a global debate on such issues, no widespread advocacy for the change existed, except for Mr Ratelband's lone case. If he felt discriminated against, the ruling said, there were other ways to resolve that under the law.

An 80-year-old woman has died after being hit by a tear gas canister at her window during Saturday's fuel protests in the French city of Marseille. The woman, who lived in an apartment near to where the protests were taking place, was hit in the face while closing the shutters. Protests over fuel tax have grown into general anger at higher living costs. The woman was taken to hospital, but died during an operation after suffering shock, local media report. Three other people have been killed in the protests since demonstrations started more than two weeks ago, police said on Sunday. France's interior ministry says about 136,000 people took part in the protests nationwide on Sunday, showing widespread support for the movement known as the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vests), who complain about a sharp increase in fuel taxes. They are so called because they have taken to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow clothing that is required to be carried in every vehicle by French law. Ball in Macron's court after violent protests Jobseeker: Macron should help me find work Will Macron face down French fuel protesters? Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, told French media she estimates that Saturday's protests have caused between â¬3-4m (Â£2.7- Â£3.6m; $3.4-$4.5m) worth of damage. The group has cancelled a planned meeting with Prime Minister Edouard Philippe scheduled for Tuesday. The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says more moderate members of the movement who said they would be prepared to talk are being shouted down by more extreme elements, and have been receiving death threats. A spokesperson for the ""yellow vest"" movement, Christophe ChalenÃ§on, called for the government to resign on Monday, to be replaced by what he termed ""a true commander, like Gen de Villiers"". Gen Pierre de Villiers is a former head of the French armed forces who quit after a clash with President Emmanuel Macron over budget cuts. The French president held an urgent security meeting earlier on Monday. Ministers said that while no options had been ruled out, imposing a state of emergency had not been discussed during the talks. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe also spoke with leaders of the opposition on Monday. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who was at the meeting, warned that Mr Macron could become the first president to give the order to open fire on his own people in 50 years. She said he should scrap increases in fuel duty, lower gas and electricity prices and end a freeze on the minimum wage and minimum pension. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire met with business representatives to assess the damage caused to businesses over the weekend. ""The impact is severe and ongoing,"" Mr Le Maire told the AFP news agency. Some retailers had seen sales drop by around 20-40% during the demonstrations, while some restaurants had lost 20-50% of their takings, he added. Protests have continued into Monday. About 50 ""yellow vests"" blocked access to a major fuel depot in the port of Fos-sur-Mer, near Marseille, and petrol stations across the country have run out of fuel. Restrictions have been put in place in Brittany on the amount of petrol motorists are allowed to buy. Students in about 100 secondary schools across the country held demonstrations against educational and exam reforms. Changes affecting ambulance drivers are part of a raft of reforms by French President Emmanuel Macron Also on Monday, French private ambulance drivers staged further demonstrations against a range of social security and healthcare reforms they say could affect their services. Dozens of trucks formed a blockade from Paris's Place de la Concorde to the French National Assembly. One protester told the Reuters news agency: ""[The reforms] will bludgeon us financially and destroy our companies. We're going to have to fire people, that's for sure."" It is unclear whether the groups of students and health workers have directly aligned themselves with the ""yellow vests"". One member of the movement, a man in his 20s, is in a critical condition in hospital in Toulouse. Newspapers speak of a ""national political crisis"" ByBBC Monitoring There is shock and anger in the mainstream French press after ""yellow vest"" protesters ran riot in Paris neighbourhoods, burning cars and looting shops. Left-wing daily LibÃ©ration says: ""Paris has undoubtedly experienced the most violent rallies since the events of May '68."" The paper notes the ""heterogeneity"" of the protesters - from nationalists and far-right student groups to hard-left militants and anarchists. In an editorial entitled ""National emergency"", centre-right daily Le Figaro says that 1 December will ""remain a collective injury for the nation"". It comments that ""in the face of this explosion of inexcusable violence"", the whole country ""had the feeling of witnessing the collapse of the state"". Business daily Les Echos says in its headline that President Emmanuel Macron ""is facing chaos"". ""After the violent scenes on Saturday, the ElysÃ©e is still looking for a strong political response,"" the paper notes. Centre-left daily Le Monde speaks of a ""major political crisis"" and notes that after returning from Argentina, President Macron immediately went to the Arc de Triomphe in central Paris which was a ""scene of violence"".

"Asteroid Bennu: Osiris-Rex's home for the next couple of years The American space agency's Osiris-Rex probe has drawn up alongside Asteroid Bennu after a two-year, two-billion-km journey from Earth. The mission will spend 2.5 years at the 500m-wide rock, mapping its surface and studying its composition. In mid-2020, scientists will directOsiris-Rex,externalto drop down to the object and grab at least 60g of regolith, or ""top soil"". This will be packed away in a sterile capsule to be returned home in 2023. Asteroid probe begins seven-year quest Japan puts another 'rover' on asteroid Artwork: Osiris-Rex will extend a robotic arm and ""high five"" Bennu with its collection device Controllers commanded the robotic probe on Monday to fire its thrusters for 20 seconds. This enabled Osiris-Rex to match Bennu's velocity through space, and bring it to about 20km from the rock at closest approach. Heather Enos, the Osiris-Rex deputy principal investigator, was in the spacecraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin's control room in Littleton, Colorado, when completion of the thruster burn was confirmed. ""My heart-rate is three times faster than normal but I'm super-excited. Watching the team celebrate such an amazing milestone brings personal joy to me in so many ways I can't even explain,"" the University of Arizona, Tucson, researcher said. Monster black hole merger detected Climate change 'greatest threat', UN told In the coming days, Osiris-Rex will get a little closer to begin its preliminary survey. ""We're going to go over the North Pole three times, then over the equator and the South Pole,"" explained flight navigator Coralie Adam. ""That allows us to not only estimate the mass, the gravity, of Bennu, which will help us design our future orbits downstream; but it also allows us to map the whole surface and build landmarks that we're going to use to navigate once we get into orbit."" Bennu will become the smallest object ever orbited by a probe. This should occur in the New Year. Operating in such a limited gravity field will be a challenge for the probe, and its navigators back on Earth. Just the heat of the Sun on the side of the spacecraft will cause the probe to emit thermal energy that will change its trajectory ever so slightly, but enough that it must be factored into controllers' calculations as they plan manoeuvres.

Asteroids are left-overs from the original building blocks of the Solar System. As such, they should still retain clues to the events that brought the Sun and the planets into being. Engineers have developed a collection device for Osiris-Rex that will extend on a robotic arm and ""high five"" the surface of Bennu. On contact, this mechanism will deliver a burst of gas to kick up loose fragments that should then settle in a holding chamber prior to being packed away in the return capsule. ""Other probes have brought back samples, for example... the Hayabusa mission from Japan brought back a small sample from its asteroid. But ours will be by far the largest sample collection by a robotic spacecraft,"" explained Nasa project manager Rich Burns. Possibly up to 2kg if the retrieval system works well. Not since Apollo at the Moon has so great a mass of material been retrieved from another planetary body. On Monday, Osiris-Rex and Bennu were about 120 million km from Earth,external ""We've been slowly creeping up to Bennu and in that time we've been taking the opportunity to snap images... and it's really given us an opportunity to have a sneak peek of what we're about to embark on,"" said Dr Enos. ""We can see the surface has a lot of boulders, craters - a lot of diversity. So, it's been really exciting. We're also getting images which are giving us insight to potential sample sites that we will start to explore more thoroughly over the next year and a half."" Preliminary scientific findings from the approach images are due to be released at next week's American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting in Washington DC. Osiris-Rex - Mission to Asteroid Bennu It's been a two-year journey to Bennu, arriving 3 December 2018 After a period of mapping, sampling should occur in July 2020 Osiris-Rex will have up to three attempts to grab surface material The probe will leave Bennu most likely in March 2021 Its sample capsule should land on Earth on 24 September 2023 Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"This video can not be played Michael Stirling's custody interview with Staffordshire Police The ""callous"" killer who murdered midwife Samantha Eastwood comforted her sister just hours after burying her body in a shallow grave. Michael Stirling, 32, admitted killing Ms Eastwood, from Stoke-on-Trent, with whom he had been having a three-year-long affair. He buried the 28-year-old with tape around her eyes and head at Caverswall, Staffordshire, in August. Stirling was sentenced to life with a minimum term of almost 17 years. Ms Eastwood was smothered and strangled at her home hours after finishing a nightshift at Royal Stoke University Hospital on 27 July. Her body was discovered beside a country lane eight days later, wrapped in a duvet cover, with tapecovering her eyes and mouth. This video can not be played Samantha Eastwood skydive before her murder Married Stirling, who is the brother-in-law of Ms Eastwood's ex-fiancÃ© John Peake, joined in the search to find his victim. The landscape gardener comforted her family and sent messages from her phone so people would think she was still alive. Police compared him to murderer Ian Huntley - who was convicted of the 2002 murders of two 10-year-old girls in Soham, Cambridgeshire - who took part in several public appeals for information after the killings. Samantha Eastwood was missing for more than a week before her body was found in a shallow grave Stirling's lawyer, Charles Miskin QC, said on the day of Ms Eastwood's death she had been in the bedroom with her killer. According to the police, the lovers would meet regularly after she finished her nightshifts at the hospital. There was an argument between the pair about the future of their relationship and ""he then lost all his self-control"", Mr Miskin added. Judge Mrs Justice Sue Carr said after Stirling had strangled her, he ""picked her up but she was dead"". She continued: ""You did not want to leave her with her eyes and mouth open and wanted her face to be protected from the consequences of burial so you covered her face, eyes and mouth with tape. ""You put her body into the back of your van and drove off. ""With chilling sang-froid, you texted your wife an affectionate message saying that you would meet her at your parents' house, as you duly did, enjoying a family meal.  Your wife describes you as fine and cheerful.  Samantha's body lay all the while in your van parked opposite."" Stirling went to his parents' house for dinner with Ms Eastwood's body in his van In sentencing, the judge said Stirling had ""lied over and over again"". In a victim impact statement read to the court, Ms Eastwood's sister, Gemma, said Stirling gave her a hug the day after her sibling went missing. He had gone to Ms Eastwood's home on the pretence of helping the family - in fact, he had buried her just hours earlier. Gemma Eastwood said that moment would ""forever haunt her"". Miss Eastwood's sister Gemma Eastwood said she had ""lost my best friend and sister"" Police described Stirling as ""cold"", ""callous"" and ""remorseless"" in murdering the woman he had conducted a ""full-on and intimate"" affair with. Telephone records showed that during July, Stirling had bombarded Ms Eastwood with 128 phone calls. She had called him 25 times. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Det Insp Dan Ison, who led the investigation, said the day after the killing, the murderer used Ms Eastwood's phone to message family members, giving them false hope she was still alive. In the exchange of text messages that morning, Gemma Eastwood texted to her sister asking her to get in touch. Stirling replied, posing as her sister, asking to be ""left alone"". He continued to exchange messages with Gemma, claiming her sister was having ""a massive breakdown about stuff"" and resisting her increasingly desperate appeals for her to talk with her. This video can not be played Det Insp Dan Ison compares Stirling to Soham murderer Ian Huntley The judge described the texting as an act of ""breath-taking cruelty"". Stirling was arrested and released by police before Ms Eastwood remains were found. Officers discovered his phone and his van had been in the same area twice late at night on the day of her disappearance. He was undone six days later when he returned to the burial site by bicycle while he was under surveillance. Speaking outside court, Gemma Eastwood said: ""No matter the outcome, nothing could bring my sister back.

"This video can not be played Jude Tebbutt: ""If there has been a miscarriage of justice, it needs to be investigated"" A British woman kidnapped by Somali pirates believes the man convicted in connection with the case is innocent. Jude Tebbutt and her husband David were attacked while on holiday in Kenya in 2011 - he was killed and she was held hostage in Somalia for six months. Kenyan Ali Babitu Kololo was convicted but Mrs Tebbutt has told the BBC she now believes he was made a scapegoat. Mrs Tebbutt said she did not believe Kololo had been given a ""fair trial"". The BBC has also learned that a former Metropolitan Police officer is under investigation for his role in the case - and that investigation is examining whether he may have committed a crime. Jude Tebbutt: My six months as a hostage Death penalty in Kenya tourist case Within a few days of the kidnap, a team of counter-terrorism detectives from the Metropolitan Police flew to Kenya to help with the investigation. In 2012, local man Kololo was convicted of robbery with violence in a Kenyan court and sentenced to death - later commuted to life imprisonment. Authorities in Kenya are not looking for any other suspects. The head of the Met's investigation team - Det Supt Neil Hibberd - was the prosecution's key witness. Kololo was convicted and sentenced to death - later commuted to life imprisonment At the trial, Mrs Tebbutt did not recognise Kololo as one of the kidnap gang. She said: ""I thought that there'd be someone coming through that door that was a representation of either the two men who dragged me out of bed that night, the two men - one of whom, or both of them, murdered David, the men that were in the boat, the men that kept me for over six months. ""But honestlyâ¦ it wasn't one of those men."" Kololo was accused of leading the attackers to the bungalow they were staying in but she is concerned that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Miscarriage of justice charity Reprieve, which is assisting Mr Kololo, states that he is illiterate, and was denied access to both a lawyer and a translator for most of the trial. ""Ali Kololo's initial death sentence, following a highly flawed trial, may not have happened without the involvement of British authorities,"" said Maya Foa, director of Reprieve. Mrs Tebbutt was released on 21 March 2012 after being held captive for 192 days in Somalia Now Mr Hibberd is himself under investigation for possible criminal conduct and Mrs Tebbutt is supporting the appeal of the only man convicted of involvement in her husband's murder. ""I think a wrong should be righted,"" said Mrs Tebbutt. ""And when I say wrong I mean the fact that Mr Kololo didn't have a fair trial. ""I do want justice. But I don't want justice at any costâ¦ I don't want anyone sentenced and put into prison and spend seven years of his life when there is any shadow of a doubt over it."" Mrs Tebbutt, pictured now, is supporting Kololo's appeal In court proceedings, Kololo's lawyers have claimed that Mr Hibberd - who has now retired - withheld forensic evidence that undermined the case against him. They also claim he misled the court by giving selective evidence, and that he should not have taken part in a trial where the defendant faced the death penalty, and had been tortured. BBC News understands that Mr Hibberd will shortly be interviewed by the National Crime Agency, in an investigation overseen by the IOPC police watchdog. In a letter seen by BBC News, the Metropolitan Police confirmed Mr Hibberd is being investigated to see if he may have committed a criminal offence or misconduct or gross misconduct. Mr Hibberd's lawyers told the BBC that he intends to co-operate with the investigation. Mr Hibberd is under investigation for possible criminal conduct Mrs Tebbutt admitted some people might think it was surprising that she was standing up for the man convicted for his role in her husband's death but she said: ""It is the right thing to do."" Mrs Tebbutt said her husband David was an honourable man and that ""the honourable thing to do now is to hopefully get a fair trial"". She added: ""That is the least Mr Kololo deserves. ""Mr Neil Hibberd said to me that if it was the last thing that he did he would find the murderer of David and the people responsible for abducting me - and I believed him.  I really believed him. ""I think they have to take ownership of what they did back in 2011 - the team that helped to convict Mr Kololo - an innocent man.""

"Ryan's earnings have doubled since last year A seven-year-old boy who reviews toys has been revealed as YouTube's highest-earning star, raking in $22m (Â£17.3m). Theestimate by Forbes magazine,externalfound that Ryan ofRyan ToysReview,externalpipped Jake Paul by $500,000 for the 12 months to June. Videos are posted most days and one promoting ablue giant mystery egg,externalbearing Ryan's face has had more than a million views since Sunday. The Dude Perfect channel was in third place, making $20m, Forbes said. Ryan's earnings, which do not include tax or fees charged by agents or lawyers, have doubled compared with the previous year. Asked by NBC,externalwhy kids liked watching his videos, Ryan - who is now eight - replied: ""Because I'm entertaining and I'm funny."" Since the channel was set up by Ryan's parents in March 2015, its videos have had almost 26 billion views and amassed 17.3 million followers. Forbes said all but $1m of the $22m total is generated by advertising shown before videos, with the remainder coming from sponsored posts. The amount generated by sponsored posts is small compared with other top YouTubers,Forbes writes,external. It is ""the result not only of how few deals Ryan (or his family) chooses to accept, but also the fact that his pint-sized demographic isn't exactly all that flush"". The toys featured in one of the channel's videos can sell out instantly. In August, Walmart began selling an exclusive range of toys and clothing called Ryan's World, and a video showing Ryan and his parents searching for his own toys at a Walmart store has had 14 million views in three months. The revenues from the Walmart deal are set to substantially increase Ryan's total earnings next year. As he is still a child, 15% of Ryan's earnings are put into a bank account that he can only access when he becomes a legal adult. Ryan's twin sisters haven't been left out of the fun either: they feature in some videos on a related YouTube channel called Ryan's Family Review. A video titled ""Top 10 Science Experiments you can do at home for kids"" starring the three children has had more than 26 million views: Daniel Middleton, the Minecraft gamer who topped the 2017 list with earnings of $16.5m, has slipped to fourth place. While Jake Paul moved up six places to second, his brother Logan Paul has tumbled down the Forbes rankings this year to 10th place with $14.5m - still $3m more than 2017. Logan Paul apologised in January aftershowing the body of an apparent suicide victimin Japan in one of his videos. Google, which owns YouTube,removed Paul's channelsfrom its Google Preferred programme, where brands sell ads on the platform's top 5% of content creators, in the wake of the controversy.

Russia posed a threat through hybrid warfare - including cyber attacks, he said, but warned that Moscow should not underestimate the UK's capabilities. MI6 boss 'perplexed' over Hedges case MI6 will continue to strengthen ties in Europe, he said, and it had been involved in disrupting terrorist attacks against France and Germany. In a wide-ranging speech and discussion, Mr Younger said the UK's adversaries had been probing its institutions and defences in ways that fall short of traditional warfare. These adversaries regarded themselves as in ""a state of perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. Russia's actions included the poisoning of Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent in Salisbury in March this year. The former Russian spy had come to the UK in a spy swap after being pardoned by Russia. ""To the extent that we assumed that had meaning, that is not an assumption we will make again,"" Mr Younger said. The aim of the UK's response to that poisoning had been to make the Russian state conclude its activities were not worth the risk. This video can not be played Alex Younger warned Russia ""not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities"" The expulsion of Russian intelligence officers by the UK and allies had significantly degraded Russian intelligence capability, he said. He urged Russia ""not to underestimate our determination or capabilities, or those of our allies. We can do this to any opponent at any time."" He said that even though the Russian state sought to destabilise the UK, 'we do not seek to destabilise Russia.' If that country responds positively, then so would the UK. ""We do not seek an escalation,"" he said. Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Russian TV crew sparks military alert What do Russians actually think of the UK? Since his last speech two years ago, Mr Young said MI6 and its sister agencies disrupted multiple attack plans linked to so-called Islamic State (ISIS). MI6 ""will always work with our sister agencies to strengthen our indispensable security ties with Europe"". UK intelligence agencies, he said, have played ""an important contribution"" in helping European countries, particularly France and Germany, prevent terrorist attacks in their countries or against their citizens. On thekilling of Jamal KhashoggiMr Younger said: ""It was an appalling attack - shocking. ""We have made it very clear to the Saudis that we expect to see a transparent effective investigation. And much will hang on the results of that investigation."" Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document The MI6 chief - known as ""C"" - was speaking at St Andrews University, where he studied economics and computer science as an undergraduate. It was only his second public lecture since he arrived. In the speech, Mr Younger revealed details of his own career and background that had not been publicly known before. After graduating from St Andrews he said he joined the Scots Guards Regiment and then MI6. His first job was penetrating an organisation ""intent on genocide"" in the Balkans in the mid-1990s. He said carrying out that mission involved travelling under a false identity and ""many nights drinking obscure homemade alcohol"" to create the relationships needed to provide intelligence. Certain aspects of the intelligence world had not changed and would not change, he said, with MI6 still trying to understand the motivations, intentions and aspiration of people in other countries. ""Even in the era of artificial intelligence you need human intelligence,"" he said. But there had been significant changes. Mr Younger is ""perplexed"" over why the UAE jailed British academic Matthew Hedges The impact of technology was a major focus of his remarks. MI6 was ""pioneering a fourth generation of espionage"" to make sure technology worked to its advantage. Data analytics has made the world more transparent with implications for spies. That was evident by the way that a non-governmental investigative group - Bellingcat - was able to expose the Russian military intelligence officers involved in the Salisbury attack. That was a sign that the traditional ""cover"" used by spies - travelling around the world under false identities - does not stand up to scrutiny in a way it did in the past. The data age posed a potentially ""existential challenge"" to traditional ways of operating. ""Our task now is to master covert action in the data age,"" he said. Mr Younger was asked about the role of China in building new 5G communications networks. There have been concerns that this could open the way for some kind of intercepting of communications or even sabotage. New Zealandhas just announcedit would not allow the Chinese company Huawei to be involved. Huawei has been involved in previous UK communications infrastructure projects. ""We have got some decisions to take here,"" Mr Younger said. ""We need to decide the extent to which we are going to be comfortable with Chinese ownership of these technologies and these platforms in an environment where some of our allies have taken a quite definite position. ""We need to have a conversation. It's not wholly straightforward."" Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? Cyber was now the fastest growing directorate of MI6, he said, and the service was increasingly working with the private sector tech community. Mr Younger stressed that a priority was ensuring the broadest possible range of people considered coming to work for MI6 including those who had never thought about it in the past.

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid tells Today he was ""punched to the ground"" because he was Asian Sajid Javid has revealed that he was a victim of racist bullying at school. The home secretary said he had been targeted and ""punched to the ground"" at the age of 11 because he was Asian. He said he had been ""reminded"" of his ordeal by an attack on a 15-year old Syrian boy in West Yorkshire, footage of which emerged last week. ""Obviously I hated it and I thought how that young boy must feel,"" Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Those memories flooded back for me."" Video images of the Syrian refugee, identified in newspaper reports as Jamal, being pushed to the ground and having water poured in his face in a school playground were widely shared on social media. The video, filmed in a lunch break at Almondbury Community School, in Huddersfield, on 25 October, has been condemned by leading politicians, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Javid said he had been upset by the footage and dismayed that racist bullying of the kind he had experienced nearly 40 years ago was still going on in British society. This video can not be played Video shows ""assault"" on boy at Huddersfield school ""I saw the video like anyone else and part of me I was clearly absolutely outraged and, to be frank, it reminded of an incident I had myself when I was 11 at school."" ""That's the immediate memories that came back to me. And obviously I hated it and I thought how that young boy must feel."" He said his first reaction to the attack had been ""How can this kind of thing still be going on in our country?"" he said. Mr Javid, whose parents emigrated to the UK from Pakistan in the early 1960s, said he had been involved in a ""very similar"" incident shortly after he had started at a comprehensive school in Bristol, where he grew up. ""Those memories flooded back for me,"" he said. ""Because I was Asian, I was punched to the ground."" An online fundraising page set up to help the 15-year-old boy and his family has so far raised more than Â£50,000. Mr Javid said the public's response to the attack had been ""heart-warming"". He said he had written to the boy's family to express his sympathy and hoped to arrange a meeting in future. A 16-year-old older boy is to be charged with assault in connection with the incident. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will appear at youth court ""in due course"".

He accused the government of ""playing for time, hoping that the contempt proceedings take longer than the timetable for the meaningful vote"". Mr Bercow told the MPs he would deliver a verdict on whether they would be granted a debate and a vote on whether the government was in contempt later on Monday or ""at the earliest opportunity tomorrow"". Mr Cox mounted an impassioned defence of his decision not to publish the full advice, insisting it would not be ""in the national interest"" to break a longstanding convention that law officers' advice to ministers is confidential. He said he would answer all MPs' questions and there was no cover-up, adding: ""There is nothing to see here."" He angrily told MPs calling for it to be published to ""grow up and get real"", prompting Green MP Caroline Lucas to accuse him of indulging in ""amateur dramatics"" and turning the debate into a ""farce"".

The Northern Ireland ""backstop"" is a last-resort plan designed to prevent a return to a visible border on the island of Ireland, with both the UK and the EU saying they want to avoid anything which puts the peace process at risk.

Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop It would keep the whole of the UK tied to EU customs rules, unless the two sides come up with another way of avoiding border checks. Under the EU withdrawal agreement, neither side can unilaterally withdraw from it - but it is meant to be temporary. Geoffrey Cox told MPs: ""We are indefinitely committed to it if it came into force. There is no point in my trying any more than the government trying to disguise that fact. He said he would have preferred to see a clause inserted into the EU withdrawal agreement that allowed the UK to exit the backstop if negotiations ""had irretrievably broken down"". But he added: ""I am prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we are likely to be entrapped in it permanently."" He said Theresa May's deal ""represents a sensible compromise"". ""It has unattractive elements, unsatisfactory elements for us,"" he went on, but MPs had to ""weigh it against other risks"" such as the ""chaos"" of a no-deal Brexit or no Brexit. He urged MPs to ""take the key of the cell door and get out on 29 March - and this deal is the best way of doing that"". Please upgrade your browser MPs will have five days of debate on the proposed Brexit deal, starting on Tuesday.  They will decide whether to accept or reject the package in a vote on 11 December. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019. The UK and the EU have agreed a detailed plan for how Brexit happens, with a draft outline of how they want the future relationship to work. But the plan has to be backed by both the UK and EU parliaments before 29 March, if the UK is to leave under these terms. If it is not ratified then the UK would be on course to leave the EU without any deal - although a delay to Brexit to allow either a renegotiated deal or a further referendum have been floated as alternatives.

"Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin famously refuses to show his full face in photos Shares in Ted Baker have hit a three-year low in London after allegations of ""forced hugging"" about the fashion group's founder and boss, Ray Kelvin. Stock in the firm, which issues a trading update on Thursday, closed down 15%, or Â£2.76, at Â£15.50, on Monday. A petition, launched by employees, accuses 62-year-old Mr Kelvin of inappropriate comments and behaviour. The firm says a ""thorough independent investigation"" will be conducted into the allegations, which it disputes. The petition on the workplace website Organise says that more than ""200 Ted Baker staff are breaking the silence"",  and speaking out about ""50 recorded incidents of harassment at Ted Baker"". ""It is part of a culture that leaves harassment unchallenged,"" the petition claims. But the company says hugs are ""part of Ted Baker's culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon"". It said Mr Kelvin greeted many people with a hug, ""be it a shareholder, investor, supplier, partner, customer or colleague"". Staff claim that as well as engaging them in unwelcome embraces, the brand's founder asked young female members of staff to sit on his knee, cuddle him, or let him massage their ears. They also allege that millionaire Mr Kelvin, who launched Ted Baker more than 30 years ago, regularly uses sexual innuendo. But Ted Baker says that the matters raised in the petition were ""at odds with the values of our business and those of our CEO"". Another complaint made in the petition is that previous complaints have been ignored. ""Please set up a way of reporting harassment to an independent, external body - HR has done nothing with the reports of harassment to date,"" says the petition. In response, the company said there were ""very clear and robust HR policies in place to provide all employees with a wide range of reporting options for any issues that they might encounter, including a completely confidential and anonymous, 24/7 helpline"". Ted Baker, named after a fictitious alter ego of Mr Kelvin, opened its first store in Glasgow in 1988 and now has 544 outlets worldwide selling fashion and accessories.

"Mike Ashley has called for a new tax on online retailers to help revive ailing town centres. The Sports Direct owner told MPs that the ""internet is killing the High Street"". His answer is taxing all retailers that make more than 20% of their turnover online - and not just online-only operators. Mr Ashley said a tax would hit his own Â£400m online operation, but give retailers a reason to keep stores open. ""I want to make it crystal clear: the mainstream High Street as we think about it today - not the Oxford Streets and the Westfields - are already dead. They can't survive,"" he told the Housing and Local Government Committee. ""We have to realise the High Street won't make 2030 - it's not going to be there unless you do something really radical and grab the bulls by the horns. It won't be there."" All parties, including landlords and the government bodies responsible for setting business rates, had to play a part in helping to save the High Street, Mr Ashley told the MPs. Who is Mike Ashley? Mike Ashley's high street plan Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said taxing online retail revenues was not an alternative to ""urgent support in the form of fundamental business rates reform"". Revo, which represents landlords, retailers and local authorities in the retail property sector, said it had been calling for a fairer tax system. Ed Cooke, Revo chief executive, said: ""It is hard to disagree with Mike Ashley's comments that a massive electric shock is needed to revive high streets that are flatlining."" Earlier this year, Sports Directbought House of Fraser for Â£90mafter the department store chain collapsed into administration. Many such stores were stuck with ""prehistoric rents"" set before the rise of online shopping, Mr Ashley said. That meant landlords ""have to take their share of the pain"", he argued. In combative exchanges with MPs, the ""tracksuit tycoon"" said some buildings now had more value for purposes other than retailing. However, most landlords wanted to ""sit down and work something out"", Mr Ashley said, adding: ""I'm not Father Christmas - I try and be fair and I try and be balanced"". Given the obstacles facing the retail sector, managing to keep 80% of House of Fraser stores open would be a ""god-like performance"", he said. That meant he could not guarantee all House of Fraser workers would keep their jobs. ""It doesn't make sense... the High Street has to change what it offers the consumers."" Mr Ashley has vowed to make the chain the ""Harrods of the High Street"" and take it more upmarket. He also hinted a long-suggested tie-up between Debenhams, in which Sports Direct has a 29.7% stake, and House of Fraser could still be on the cards: ""I told them to work together. They should work together."" What is Mike Ashley's plan for the High Street? Mike Ashley: Who is the founder of Sports Direct?

"This video can not be played Daniela Tejada says she is ""elated"" at the news Matthew Hedges has been pardoned The leader of the UK's MI6 intelligence service has said he is ""perplexed"" over why the United Arab Emirates jailed British academic Matthew Hedges. Alex Younger said he ""genuinely can't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to"". Mr Hedges was accused of spying for MI6 and jailed in the UAE last month, but he was later pardoned. In a rare speech, Mr Younger also warned Russia ""not to underestimate our capabilities"". He described how MI6 exposed the perpetrators of the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury and warned that Britain's adversaries view themselves as being in a state of ""perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. British academic pardoned by UAE Russian reporter denies trying to enter Army base Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Last month, an Abu Dhabi court found Mr Hedges guilty of ""spying for or on behalf of"" the UK government, and he was jailed for life. Prosecutors said Mr Hedges had admitted the charges but the 31-year-old denied spying and said he had been researching the country's security strategy as part of his PhD studies at Durham University. A week later, the UAE issued the pardon as part of a series of orders on the country's National Day anniversary and Mr Hedges was freed. In the second public speech by the man known as ""C"" in the four years since his appointment, Mr Younger addressed the case. ""We are perplexed by what has happened,"" he said, speaking at St Andrews University. ""There are some frank conversations ahead of us but we need to make sure that partnership works."" Alex Younger said he ""genuinely can't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to"" Mr Younger also spoke of the need for ""fourth-generation espionage"", fusing human skills with technical innovation. He encouraged students to consider joining MI6, saying tackling modern adversaries who use new technology to probe UK institutions and defences will require ""a mindset that mobilises diversity and empowers the young"". Mr Younger re-emphasisedthe importance of strengthening security ties in Europe. He said Britain's spies have thwarted multiple Islamic State plots originating overseas, often in partnership with European allies. UK intelligence agencies have played ""an important contribution"" in helping European countries, particularly France and Germany, prevent terrorist attacks in their countries or against their citizens, he said. This video can not be played Alex Younger warned Russia ""not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities"" Mr Younger also spoke about facing ""adversaries who regard themselves as being in a state of perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. He said: ""I urge Russia or any other state intent on subverting our way of life not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities, or those of our allies."" The expulsion of Russian intelligence officers by the UK, following the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury, had significantly reduced Russian intelligence capability, Mr Younger said. The speech comes at a time of heightened tensions between the UK and Russia. In the most recent incident on Saturday, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson called on the public to report suspicious activity near military sites, after a Russian TV crew prompted an alert at an Army base. Earlier this year, GCHQ chief Jeremy Fleming said Moscow posed a ""real"" and ""active"" threat to the international community in the wake of theSalisbury poisoning. Russia denies any involvement.

"Mr Ratelband maintained he has the body of a 40-something and a young age is part of his identity A Dutchman who wanted to change his date of birth to boost dating prospects has lost his legal battle to do so. Emile Ratelband, still aged 69, wanted to change his birth date by 20 years to avoid what he called discrimination. ""We live in a time when you can change your name and change your gender. Why can't I decide my own age?"" he said. But the court disagreed, highlighting that many rights in law are based on a person's age, and changing it at will could cause many problems. There was no legal basis to make such a change, it said. ""Mr Ratelband is at liberty to feel 20 years younger than his real age and to act accordingly,"" the judges said, but changing his legal documents would have ""undesirable legal and societal implications"". Mr Ratelband, who calls himself a ""positivity trainer"", made headlines around the world with his unusual request. Ahead of the hearing, he made TV and other press appearances, saying he felt discriminated against in both employment and on the popular dating app Tinder - and said his doctors had told him he had the body of someone in their 40s. ""If I'm 49, then I can buy a new house, drive a different car. I can take up more work,"" he said. ""When I'm on Tinder and it says I'm 69, I don't get an answer. When I'm 49, with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position."" Man told he was too old for job Man, 67, denied job because of age bias Alongside the widespread media attention, he was criticised by some for comparing his bid to the position of people in the transgender community. This video can not be played The Dutch pensioner who wants to be 20 years younger. In court, Mr Ratelband argued that the date on his birth certificate was a mistake - even though he was born on that day, 11 March 1949. The court agreed with him that age is part of a person's identity. But unlike a person's gender or name, which Mr Ratelband sought to draw comparisons to, it had further complications. ""Rights and obligations are also attached to age...  for example, the right to vote, the right to marry, the opportunity to drink alcohol and to drive a car,"" the court said. It found that the possibility of declaring oneself younger could open the door to the opposite - becoming older. In its judgement, the court said that granting the request would cause ""all kinds of legal problems"" by effectively erasing 20 years of events. It pondered what would happen to qualifications obtained in that time, or a driving licence issued, or a marriage solemnised. It also said that while changes to the law to allow a person to change their gender took place following a global debate on such issues, no widespread advocacy for the change existed, except for Mr Ratelband's lone case. If he felt discriminated against, the ruling said, there were other ways to resolve that under the law.

"This video can not be played Daniela Tejada says she is ""elated"" at the news Matthew Hedges has been pardoned The leader of the UK's MI6 intelligence service has said he is ""perplexed"" over why the United Arab Emirates jailed British academic Matthew Hedges. Alex Younger said he ""genuinely can't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to"". Mr Hedges was accused of spying for MI6 and jailed in the UAE last month, but he was later pardoned. In a rare speech, Mr Younger also warned Russia ""not to underestimate our capabilities"". He described how MI6 exposed the perpetrators of the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury and warned that Britain's adversaries view themselves as being in a state of ""perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. British academic pardoned by UAE Russian reporter denies trying to enter Army base Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Last month, an Abu Dhabi court found Mr Hedges guilty of ""spying for or on behalf of"" the UK government, and he was jailed for life. Prosecutors said Mr Hedges had admitted the charges but the 31-year-old denied spying and said he had been researching the country's security strategy as part of his PhD studies at Durham University. A week later, the UAE issued the pardon as part of a series of orders on the country's National Day anniversary and Mr Hedges was freed. In the second public speech by the man known as ""C"" in the four years since his appointment, Mr Younger addressed the case. ""We are perplexed by what has happened,"" he said, speaking at St Andrews University. ""There are some frank conversations ahead of us but we need to make sure that partnership works."" Alex Younger said he ""genuinely can't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to"" Mr Younger also spoke of the need for ""fourth-generation espionage"", fusing human skills with technical innovation. He encouraged students to consider joining MI6, saying tackling modern adversaries who use new technology to probe UK institutions and defences will require ""a mindset that mobilises diversity and empowers the young"". Mr Younger re-emphasisedthe importance of strengthening security ties in Europe. He said Britain's spies have thwarted multiple Islamic State plots originating overseas, often in partnership with European allies. UK intelligence agencies have played ""an important contribution"" in helping European countries, particularly France and Germany, prevent terrorist attacks in their countries or against their citizens, he said. This video can not be played Alex Younger warned Russia ""not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities"" Mr Younger also spoke about facing ""adversaries who regard themselves as being in a state of perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. He said: ""I urge Russia or any other state intent on subverting our way of life not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities, or those of our allies."" The expulsion of Russian intelligence officers by the UK, following the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury, had significantly reduced Russian intelligence capability, Mr Younger said. The speech comes at a time of heightened tensions between the UK and Russia. In the most recent incident on Saturday, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson called on the public to report suspicious activity near military sites, after a Russian TV crew prompted an alert at an Army base. Earlier this year, GCHQ chief Jeremy Fleming said Moscow posed a ""real"" and ""active"" threat to the international community in the wake of theSalisbury poisoning. Russia denies any involvement.

"This video can not be played Jordi Casamitjana campaigns to encourage others to become vegans A tribunal is to be asked to decide whether veganism is a ""philosophical belief"" akin to a religion, in a landmark legal action. Jordi Casamitjana says he was sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports after disclosing it invested pension funds in firms involved in animal testing. He claims he was discriminated against, and the tribunal will now decide if veganism should be protected in law. The League Against Cruel Sports says he was dismissed for gross misconduct. It denies the sacking was because of his veganism. Mr Casamitjana says he is an ""ethical"" vegan. ""Some people only eat a vegan diet but they don't care about the environment or the animals, they only care about their health,"" he told the BBC. ""I care about the animals and the environment and my health and everything. ""That's why I use this term 'ethical veganism' because for me veganism is a belief and affects every single aspect of my life."" Dietary vegans and ethical vegans both eat a plant-based diet. However, ethical vegans try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation, for instance avoiding wearing or buying clothing made from wool or leather, or toiletries from companies that carry out animal testing. They may refer to ""companion animals"" rather than ""pets"", and will avoid zoos or other environments where they consider animals are exploited. Mr Casamitjana worked for the animal welfare charity the League Against Cruel Sports and claims that, to his surprise, he discovered it was investing its pension funds in companies that carried out animal testing. He says he drew this to the attention of his managers. When nothing changed, he informed other employees and was sacked as a result. He is now bringing a legal case, claiming he was discriminated against on the basis of his vegan belief. In a statement, the League Against Cruel Sports said: ""Mr Casamitjana was dismissed from his position because of gross misconduct. ""To link his dismissal with issues pertaining to veganism is factually wrong. ""Mr Casamitjana is seeking to use his veganism as the reason for his dismissal. We emphatically reject this claim."" Mr Casamitjana supports a range of ethical and animal rights causes However, in a hearing next March, an employment tribunal will, for the first time, determine whether veganism is a ""philosophical belief"" protected by law. If the tribunal decides that it is, the discrimination claim will proceed to a full trial. ""Religion or belief"" is one of nine ""protected characteristics"" covered by theEquality Act 2010,external. The others, all ranked equally, are: age disability gender reassignment marriage and civil partnership pregnancy and maternity race sex sexual orientation It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate directly, by treating an employee less favourably than others because of their religion or belief. Harassment and victimisation on grounds of religion or belief are also unlawful, as is indirect discrimination, by applying a criterion or practice that disadvantages employees of a particular religion or belief unless there is an objective justification. To qualify as a philosophical belief, veganism must: be genuinely held be a belief as to a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behaviour attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance be worthy of respect in a democratic society, not be incompatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others be a belief, not an opinion or viewpoint based on the present state of information available If Mr Casamitjana succeeds in his hearing, the consequences for vegans could be life-changing. His solicitor, Peter Daly, of Bindmans LLP, said:  ""If we are successful, we will achieve a judgment which formally recognises the protected status of ethical veganism and which could then be used as the basis to combat discrimination against vegans in employment, in the provision of goods and services, and in education. ""This is therefore a landmark case."" But Nick Spencer, from the think tankTheos, which stimulates debate about religion in society,external, warns of dangers in unrestricted recognition and legal protection of people's beliefs. ""The irony in all this is that rights are intended to be liberating but if we're all turned into rights bearers, my rights clashing with your rights, we end up having to appeal to the courts to sort out our differences and that can become oppressive for everybody,""  he said. Clashing rights could become ""oppressive"", warns Nick Spencer, of Theos Figures from the Vegan Society, which supports Mr Casamitjana, suggest veganism is on the rise. The society saysthere are currently 600,000 vegans in Britain,external, up from about 150,000 in 2014. It bases its estimate onsurveys from the Food Standards Agency, Ipsos Mori and the National Centre for Social Science Research.,external ""For many people, veganism is a deeply held belief,"" says Louise Davies, Vegan Society head of campaigns, policy and research. ""This could be a landmark ruling that will not only recognise the validity and importance of veganism but also confirm that the needs of vegans in their employment and their everyday lives must be taken seriously."" Mr Casamitjana says he has been discriminated against many times because of his vegan beliefs. He said: ""It is important for all the vegans to know that if they want to talk about veganism, they are protected and no-one will say 'Shut up'. ""It is important that the law protects vegans.""

"Qabid escaped injury after becoming stuck in the tyre A rhino had to be rescued by firefighters after becoming stuck in a tyre at Edinburgh Zoo for about two hours. Qabid, a two-year-old male rhino, managed to get his head and leg trapped. Firefighters who were called out on Sunday evening used cutting gear to free the stricken mammal. A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokeswoman said: ""One zookeeper said the fire service were their last hope."" SFRS group manager John Hanlin said: ""The crew did a great job in a very unusual situation. ""The rhino was stuck tight in the tyre and had to be sedated by the zoo vets as he was becoming distressed. ""Edinburgh Zoo staff informed me that this event wasn't the first time he had got himself stuck but he usually manages to get himself out - he very clearly wasn't so nimble or lucky on this occasion."" He added: ""Once the firefighters managed to cut the tyre and free Qabid, the zoo vets gave him a drug to counteract the sedative and bring him round - and he was quickly back to his mischievous self. ""It's not every day that our crews come into contact with such a beautiful animal."" Darren McGarry, head of living collections at Edinburgh Zoo, said: ""Our greater one-horned rhino Qabid loves to play with his tyre, it's one of his favourite things to do. ""He managed to get his head and a leg stuck while playing and we had to contact the fire service for assistance to use their specialist cutting equipment. ""The tyre was safely removed and Qabid is doing fine. We would like to thank the fire service for their help."" In 2016, firefighters were called to the zoo tohelp another rhino which had toothache.

"A number of roads in the area, including Haydons Road, have been closed by police A man has been shot by police during a planned operation into a robbery of a cash van. A witness said he saw two men trying to rob a van outside a Sainsbury's in Wimbledon, south-west London, when officers ""swarmed out of the bushes"". The Met Police said the 23-year-old was taken to hospital after the shooting in Lacock Close at about 08:10 GMT. He has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rob, along with another 23-year-old man. The Met said the condition of the shot man was not life-threatening. The witness, who did not want to be named, said he saw two men raiding the van before armed police ""bounded on them"". ""Seven shots were fired. The cops were waiting for them,"" he added. The witness said one of the men then ran up the street holding a gun and ""when he saw he was turning into a cul-de-sac he turned and fired on the cops, then they returned fire"". Forensic officers have been carrying out searches outside the nearby pub The Met said the man was shot during an operation into cash in transit robberies. The operation involved officers from the force's Flying Squad who were supported by armed colleagues, the force confirmed. A suspected stolen car has been recovered at the scene. London Ambulance Service said paramedics ""treated a person at the scene and took them as a priority to a major trauma centre"". A Sainsbury's spokesperson said that an ""incident took place outside our Haydons Road Local"" and they were ""supporting the police with their investigation"". The operation the involved the force's Flying Squad who were being assisted by armed colleagues Haydon's Road has been cordoned off by police between Quicks Road and South Park Road, and North Road is also shut while investigations take place. The Independent Office for Police Conduct has launched an independent investigation into the shooting. A spokesperson said the Met had ""referred itself to us, as is normal for all incidents involving police shootings and we have sent our investigators to the scene"". London violence 'to take 10 years to solve' Targeting knife crime on London's streets The city curing violence like a disease The Met's internal Directorate of Professional Standards has also been informed. The Flying Squad is a branch of the Met's Serious and Organised Crime Command who investigate armed robberies with detectives trained in firearms and covert surveillance roles. Some of their most famous investigations include The Great Train Robbery and the Brinks-Mat security depot robbery. The number of police firearms operations in England and Wales has risen over the past three years reaching 18,746 in the year ending March 2018. However, this is an overall decrease from its peak in 2008-09 (when comparable records began) when there were 23,181 operations. Despite the large number of operations, the number of incidents when firearms have been discharged by police is low - just 12 in 2017-18.

"Ryan's earnings have doubled since last year A seven-year-old boy who reviews toys has been revealed as YouTube's highest-earning star, raking in $22m (Â£17.3m). Theestimate by Forbes magazine,externalfound that Ryan ofRyan ToysReview,externalpipped Jake Paul by $500,000 for the 12 months to June. Videos are posted most days and one promoting ablue giant mystery egg,externalbearing Ryan's face has had more than a million views since Sunday. The Dude Perfect channel was in third place, making $20m, Forbes said. Ryan's earnings, which do not include tax or fees charged by agents or lawyers, have doubled compared with the previous year. Asked by NBC,externalwhy kids liked watching his videos, Ryan - who is now eight - replied: ""Because I'm entertaining and I'm funny."" Since the channel was set up by Ryan's parents in March 2015, its videos have had almost 26 billion views and amassed 17.3 million followers. Forbes said all but $1m of the $22m total is generated by advertising shown before videos, with the remainder coming from sponsored posts. The amount generated by sponsored posts is small compared with other top YouTubers,Forbes writes,external. It is ""the result not only of how few deals Ryan (or his family) chooses to accept, but also the fact that his pint-sized demographic isn't exactly all that flush"". The toys featured in one of the channel's videos can sell out instantly. In August, Walmart began selling an exclusive range of toys and clothing called Ryan's World, and a video showing Ryan and his parents searching for his own toys at a Walmart store has had 14 million views in three months. The revenues from the Walmart deal are set to substantially increase Ryan's total earnings next year. As he is still a child, 15% of Ryan's earnings are put into a bank account that he can only access when he becomes a legal adult. Ryan's twin sisters haven't been left out of the fun either: they feature in some videos on a related YouTube channel called Ryan's Family Review. A video titled ""Top 10 Science Experiments you can do at home for kids"" starring the three children has had more than 26 million views: Daniel Middleton, the Minecraft gamer who topped the 2017 list with earnings of $16.5m, has slipped to fourth place. While Jake Paul moved up six places to second, his brother Logan Paul has tumbled down the Forbes rankings this year to 10th place with $14.5m - still $3m more than 2017. Logan Paul apologised in January aftershowing the body of an apparent suicide victimin Japan in one of his videos. Google, which owns YouTube,removed Paul's channelsfrom its Google Preferred programme, where brands sell ads on the platform's top 5% of content creators, in the wake of the controversy.

"This video can not be played Michael Stirling's custody interview with Staffordshire Police The ""callous"" killer who murdered midwife Samantha Eastwood comforted her sister just hours after burying her body in a shallow grave. Michael Stirling, 32, admitted killing Ms Eastwood, from Stoke-on-Trent, with whom he had been having a three-year-long affair. He buried the 28-year-old with tape around her eyes and head at Caverswall, Staffordshire, in August. Stirling was sentenced to life with a minimum term of almost 17 years. Ms Eastwood was smothered and strangled at her home hours after finishing a nightshift at Royal Stoke University Hospital on 27 July. Her body was discovered beside a country lane eight days later, wrapped in a duvet cover, with tapecovering her eyes and mouth. This video can not be played Samantha Eastwood skydive before her murder Married Stirling, who is the brother-in-law of Ms Eastwood's ex-fiancÃ© John Peake, joined in the search to find his victim. The landscape gardener comforted her family and sent messages from her phone so people would think she was still alive. Police compared him to murderer Ian Huntley - who was convicted of the 2002 murders of two 10-year-old girls in Soham, Cambridgeshire - who took part in several public appeals for information after the killings. Samantha Eastwood was missing for more than a week before her body was found in a shallow grave Stirling's lawyer, Charles Miskin QC, said on the day of Ms Eastwood's death she had been in the bedroom with her killer. According to the police, the lovers would meet regularly after she finished her nightshifts at the hospital. There was an argument between the pair about the future of their relationship and ""he then lost all his self-control"", Mr Miskin added. Judge Mrs Justice Sue Carr said after Stirling had strangled her, he ""picked her up but she was dead"". She continued: ""You did not want to leave her with her eyes and mouth open and wanted her face to be protected from the consequences of burial so you covered her face, eyes and mouth with tape. ""You put her body into the back of your van and drove off. ""With chilling sang-froid, you texted your wife an affectionate message saying that you would meet her at your parents' house, as you duly did, enjoying a family meal.  Your wife describes you as fine and cheerful.  Samantha's body lay all the while in your van parked opposite."" Stirling went to his parents' house for dinner with Ms Eastwood's body in his van In sentencing, the judge said Stirling had ""lied over and over again"". In a victim impact statement read to the court, Ms Eastwood's sister, Gemma, said Stirling gave her a hug the day after her sibling went missing. He had gone to Ms Eastwood's home on the pretence of helping the family - in fact, he had buried her just hours earlier. Gemma Eastwood said that moment would ""forever haunt her"". Miss Eastwood's sister Gemma Eastwood said she had ""lost my best friend and sister"" Police described Stirling as ""cold"", ""callous"" and ""remorseless"" in murdering the woman he had conducted a ""full-on and intimate"" affair with. Telephone records showed that during July, Stirling had bombarded Ms Eastwood with 128 phone calls. She had called him 25 times. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Det Insp Dan Ison, who led the investigation, said the day after the killing, the murderer used Ms Eastwood's phone to message family members, giving them false hope she was still alive. In the exchange of text messages that morning, Gemma Eastwood texted to her sister asking her to get in touch. Stirling replied, posing as her sister, asking to be ""left alone"". He continued to exchange messages with Gemma, claiming her sister was having ""a massive breakdown about stuff"" and resisting her increasingly desperate appeals for her to talk with her. This video can not be played Det Insp Dan Ison compares Stirling to Soham murderer Ian Huntley The judge described the texting as an act of ""breath-taking cruelty"". Stirling was arrested and released by police before Ms Eastwood remains were found. Officers discovered his phone and his van had been in the same area twice late at night on the day of her disappearance. He was undone six days later when he returned to the burial site by bicycle while he was under surveillance. Speaking outside court, Gemma Eastwood said: ""No matter the outcome, nothing could bring my sister back.

"This video can not be played John Brailsford has been made redundant five times John Brailsford lost his job at Carpetright, in Wigan, after the chain decided to close nearly a quarter of its 400 shops. It was his fifth redundancy in a 40-year retail career, which has meant he's often had to take a demotion to find another job. He's one of an estimated 40,000 people who have been affected this year by upheaval on the High Street, according to BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money, which has been tracking the raft of business failures and shop closures since January. ""The first time it happened was an absolute disaster and I just learned to take a step back, find myself another job, and carry on. Since then I've been made redundant four more times,"" said Mr Brailsford. ""The very first thought [with Cartpetright] was, here we go again. It came completely out of the blue. Having been through it so many times before it was just a case of - CV, update it, get it out there and see what happens."" 'Politicians should do more to save our High Streets' Is the shopping centre ready to check out? High Street crisis: How do we spend our money? Mr Brailsford has since found another job with the furniture retailer Abitare. But a Lancaster University study of official labour market statistics found two-thirds of redundant retail workers went on to work in other sectors, such as hospitality and manufacturing. The high-profile demise of big names such as Maplin, Toys R Us and Poundworld has been followed by a string of store closures at High Street stalwarts such as Marks & Spencer, Carphone Warehouse and New Look. Sluggish sales, online competition, and rising costs have been blamed for the changing landscape. Bricks and mortar shopping has come under pressure from online outlets Nearly 20,000 jobs have been lost so far, and a further 4,000 redundancies are expected in the coming months through planned closures at the likes of Homebase and Evans Cycles. A further 16,000 jobs are under threat at House of Fraser and Debenhams. House of Fraser went into administration in August with 6,000 employees and 10,000 concession staff.  It was bought by Sports Direct which said it wants to keep 47 of the 59 stores open. It is currently negotiating new terms with store landlords, and so far about 20 have been saved, protecting 4,000 jobs, while 11 are closing. Meanwhile, Debenhams wants to close 50 stores in the coming years, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. Paddy Lillis, general secretary of shopworkers' union Usdaw, said: ""The biggest issue for workers is job security. We have a change in shopping habits, we're seeing more online versus bricks and mortar - as we call traditional town centres - and that's difficult. ""We've been calling for some time for a strategy for the politicians, employers and communities to look in more detail at what we can do to secure the High Street, look at the changing habits in retail, but also get this message across: retail is a real job, there are nearly three million employees in the UK. The government unveiled an official plan to save UK retailing ""It's a huge piece of the economy,"" Mr Lillis said. The government unveiled an official plan for the High Street in the October Budget. It included business rates relief for half a million small retailers, Â£675m to help pay for improvements, and a consultation on planning reform to make it simpler to turn empty buildings into homes. As well as all the shop closures, there's also been a shake-out in the casual-dining sector with Prezzo, Jamie's Italian, and Byron all closing restaurants. In total nearly 2,000 shops and restaurants run by major chains have either shut or are at risk of closure. To put that into context, a broader study across 3,000 locations by the Local Data Company found there were 24,200 closures in the first half of the year - up 17% - and 19,800 openings, leading to a net loss of 4,400. The upheaval on the High Street has filtered through to the jobs market with fewer vacancies for permanent traditional retail jobs, such as cashiers and shop managers, compared to other sectors. That's according to the Recruitment and Employment Confederation's (REC) monthly jobs report, which suggests demand for these jobs was lower than in other professions for 10 of the last 12 months. The picture is slightly brighter for temporary staff, although demand was lower than in any other sector in seven of the last 12 months. Retail workers may want to think about how they could transfer to other sectors Sophie Wingfield, REC head of policy, said: ""With stores closing or downsizing, and online retail filling the gaps in market, there simply aren't many traditional retail jobs available, either for permanent or temporary staff. ""However, with demand for staff high in other areas such as IT and hospitality, retail workers may want to think about how their skills could transfer to other areas.""

"Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said deportees can ring the Windrush helpline or visit the government website Campaigners have accused the Home Office of a lack of ""decency"" after it emerged dozens of people deported to Commonwealth countries have not been contacted by the Windrush task force. Ministers said ""no specific attempt"" had been made to approach 49 people deported to Ghana and Nigeria in 2017. The Home Office says it is up to Commonwealth citizens to seek information about their status. MPs said it showed the government had learned nothing from the scandal. TheWindrush scandalwas uncovered earlier this year, after many people from Commonwealth countries who had legally lived in Britain for decades were wrongly classed as illegal immigrants and deported. They had been encouraged by the UK government to settle in Britain from the late 1940s until 1973. However, although they had been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK, some immigrants did not have formal paperwork confirming their residency status. It meant when the Home Office embarked on its so-called ""hostile environment"" policy designed to make staying in the UK more difficult, some Commonwealth immigrants were wrongly deported. Their problems were compounded by a Home Office decision, in 2010, to destroy their landing cards - often the only record of their immigration status. Following a public outcry, the government set up a task force to help people formalise their right to remain in the UK. Thousands of people have now contacted the task force and received documents confirming their right to stay in Britain. Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush scandal: A lawyer's advice for victims Tory calls on Windrush official to resign However, following parliamentary questions from Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, Home Office ministers  now admit there are 49 people who have still not been informed by the government that the task force exists. The 49 were deported to Ghana and Nigeria between March and September 2017 - before the Windrush scandal erupted. Satbir Singh, the chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: ""If the Home Office has the capacity to deny somebody their rights, to separate them from their loved ones and remove them from the country, surely it has the capacity to find them, to apologise and to help them come home. ""But this isn't a question of capacity alone, it's a question of decency, and yet another example of a department going out of its way to avoid doing the right thing. ""As a country surely we can do so much better than this."" Campaigner Zita Holbourne, who founded anti-austerity organisation Black Activists Rising Against Cuts and is the vice president of trade union PCS, called it ""a disgrace"". Ms Lucas, who is MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""It doesn't seem much to ask for the government to tell people they've kicked out of the country that the Windrush task force exists. ""Ministers know their treatment of the Windrush generation is a national disgrace. That they haven't bothered to contact people who've been deported suggests the government hasn't learned anything from the public backlash against their hostile environment."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said this most recent case showed how ""reckless and incompetent"" the Home Office's immigration policy was. ""People from almost every Commonwealth country have been treated badly under this Government's hostile environment,"" she said. ""It's clear these injustices will continue if ministers don't even know what's going on."" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey said anyone who may have been wrongly deported should be contacted and told how to apply to return and receive compensation. ""In these cases, the Home Office seems to be waiting around for people to contact them - even though they may not have the means or information to do so. That's an utter disgrace."" This video can not be played Windrush scandal: A lawyer's advice for victims Home Office minister Ms Nokes, in her written ministerial answer to Ms Lucas' question, said: ""The Home Office has not made a specific attempt to inform those 49 people of the Windrush taskforce. ""The Home Office announcements relating to Commonwealth citizens can be found atwww.gov.uk/windrush.,external ""This website is regularly updated with information about how individuals who believe they qualify under the Windrush criteria can apply for status under the Windrush Settlement Scheme. ""Assistance is also available through the Windrush Taskforce helpline on freephone 0800678 1925 or by email at commonwealthtaskforce@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Any individual who believes they are protected under the provisions of the 1971 Immigration Act is able to contact the Windrush Taskforce, who will help to identify their current status. ""We have always been clear that the Windrush Scheme is not restricted to the Windrush generation or people from the Caribbean, but it is right that applicants for citizenship need to satisfy the good character and residence requirements.""

"This video can not be played Manchester club bouncer fight ""left man with brain bleed"" Bouncers from Manchester's Factory 251 nightclub have been sacked after an 18-year-old rugby league player was assaulted outside the club. St Helens academy player Joe Sharratt suffered a serious head injury and is in a stable condition in hospital. His mother Jane Sharratt told the BBC that he had a bleed on the brain but was now ""sitting up and talking"". Video footage shows Mr Sharratt being thrown to the ground before door staff repeatedly punch his friend. Greater Manchester Police has appealed for witnesses to the attack at 03:20 GMT on Sunday. It has also asked Manchester City Council to carry out an expedited review and to suspend the nightclub's licence. Factory said it ""immediately terminated the service contract"" with the security contractor Professional Security and would be closed on Monday night. The security contractor also confirmed that it has sacked the staff involved. Joe Sharratt played just hours earlier for Lancashire Academy against Australian Schoolboys Mr Sharratt's friend Leon Cooper, 18, can be seen getting punched several times in the footage. The pharmacy student at Manchester University said they were escorted out of the club following a ""pushing"" incident inside. He said he became involved in swearing with one of the bouncers before one of the door staff ran at Mr Sharratt, and then several bouncers ""started jumping on"" him. Describing the attack, he said:  ""I tried to help him but they were just hitting me. ""I wasn't trying to attack them...I was just trying to get to my mate."" He added: ""I didn't even realise how many times I had been hit. ""You can see in the video I'm just trying to get to him [Mr Sharratt] and they're whacking me even though I'm not punching them at all."" He said he had suffered bruising to the side of his body, swelling to his head and had coughed up blood since the attack. Factory 251 nightclub which is housed in the former HQ of Factory Records A statement on the security company's website,externalstated: ""We can confirm that Professional Security has terminated the contracts of all of the security personnel involved in this incident. ""We are also working closely with the local authorities, police, and the Security Industry Authority to ensure that appropriate action is taken swiftly against all of these door supervisors."" The company said it was ""appalled by the behaviour of the door supervisors...which contradicts everything that we strive to achieve"". In adamning report,externalto the city council's licensing committee, police stated there were concerns about ""serious disorder"" and ""extreme violence"", and were concerned nobody at the club contacted police. It states the way the club dealt with the incident pointed towards a ""lack of duty of care"". The report goes on to say a member of the public was ""left with a bleed on the brain"" that could have ""ended up as a fatality"" and adds: ""The fact that the premises didn't bother to contact the police is extremely concerning.

"John proposed to girlfriend Daniella in New York - but a short while later they lost the engagement ring Be it fate, or a stroke of good luck, Daniella Anthony and John Drennan are soon to be reunited with their precious piece of jewellery. ""We are so happy, we can't believe it,"" the young couple said after discovering their lost engagement ringhad been found. The pair, from Peterborough, had flown to New York to celebrate their 10-year dating anniversary. Mr Drennan said he'd put a lot of thought into the proposal. Speaking to BBC News on Sunday evening, he said he had carried the ring around in his pocket for two days before finding the right moment. ""I want to clarify that I did not propose over a grate in Times Square - that's where we lost it,"" Mr Drennan said. NYPD find UK couple who lost ring in drain Lost gold ring found on carrot Man told to repay ex for engagement rings The momentous occasion had taken place in Central Park a few hours earlier. ""The time was right. There were autumn leaves everywhere and not many people."" Daniella said yes straight away but they both knew the ring wasn't the right size. ""I tried to tell John it was too big, but he insisted I wear it,"" Ms Anthony said. ""I told her it was fine. I was just so happy to finally call her my fiancÃ©e after all this time,"" Mr Drennan added. The happy couple decided to grab a bite to eat and see the Christmas Spectacular in Times Square when the ring escaped. ""We were walking back to the hotel. I can still visualise the ring. Bouncing onceâ¦ bouncing twice and then it was gone,"" Mr Drennan said. Daniella and John called police straight away and officers were able to jar the grate open with a crow bar. They looked underneath, with the aid of torches, for at least two hours But it was to no avail. ""We just presumed it was gone. In the end, we had no choice but to walk away and try to enjoy the rest of our weekend,"" Mr Drennan said. Daniella was inconsolable and so they left without leaving their names with police, feeling hopeless. They arrived home on Sunday and said they were planning on going straight to the jewellery store to buy another ring. ""I couldn't stand the thought of her being without one,"" Mr Drennan said. But just moments after they touched down at the airport, a friend alerted them to the social media campaign being driven by the New York Police Department. Police had posted the CCTV footage of the couple trying to get the ring from the grate and used Twitter to appeal to find them. Allow Twitter content?

""We don't use Twitter - we had absolutely no idea this was going on. But we are so happy."" ""We are so thankful to everyone - especially the New York Police Department and everyone who shared our story,"" the couple said. They also wanted to send a heartfelt thank you to everyone who stopped to help look at the scene. There was one family in particular that stayed on for moral support. ""They had a little girl who gave Daniella a big hug and told her not to worry,"" Mr Drennan said. ""At the time, that hug meant everything.""

"Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said deportees can ring the Windrush helpline or visit the government website Campaigners have accused the Home Office of a lack of ""decency"" after it emerged dozens of people deported to Commonwealth countries have not been contacted by the Windrush task force. Ministers said ""no specific attempt"" had been made to approach 49 people deported to Ghana and Nigeria in 2017. The Home Office says it is up to Commonwealth citizens to seek information about their status. MPs said it showed the government had learned nothing from the scandal. TheWindrush scandalwas uncovered earlier this year, after many people from Commonwealth countries who had legally lived in Britain for decades were wrongly classed as illegal immigrants and deported. They had been encouraged by the UK government to settle in Britain from the late 1940s until 1973. However, although they had been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK, some immigrants did not have formal paperwork confirming their residency status. It meant when the Home Office embarked on its so-called ""hostile environment"" policy designed to make staying in the UK more difficult, some Commonwealth immigrants were wrongly deported. Their problems were compounded by a Home Office decision, in 2010, to destroy their landing cards - often the only record of their immigration status. Following a public outcry, the government set up a task force to help people formalise their right to remain in the UK. Thousands of people have now contacted the task force and received documents confirming their right to stay in Britain. Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush scandal: A lawyer's advice for victims Tory calls on Windrush official to resign However, following parliamentary questions from Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, Home Office ministers  now admit there are 49 people who have still not been informed by the government that the task force exists. The 49 were deported to Ghana and Nigeria between March and September 2017 - before the Windrush scandal erupted. Satbir Singh, the chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: ""If the Home Office has the capacity to deny somebody their rights, to separate them from their loved ones and remove them from the country, surely it has the capacity to find them, to apologise and to help them come home. ""But this isn't a question of capacity alone, it's a question of decency, and yet another example of a department going out of its way to avoid doing the right thing. ""As a country surely we can do so much better than this."" Campaigner Zita Holbourne, who founded anti-austerity organisation Black Activists Rising Against Cuts and is the vice president of trade union PCS, called it ""a disgrace"". Ms Lucas, who is MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""It doesn't seem much to ask for the government to tell people they've kicked out of the country that the Windrush task force exists. ""Ministers know their treatment of the Windrush generation is a national disgrace. That they haven't bothered to contact people who've been deported suggests the government hasn't learned anything from the public backlash against their hostile environment."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said this most recent case showed how ""reckless and incompetent"" the Home Office's immigration policy was. ""People from almost every Commonwealth country have been treated badly under this Government's hostile environment,"" she said. ""It's clear these injustices will continue if ministers don't even know what's going on."" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey said anyone who may have been wrongly deported should be contacted and told how to apply to return and receive compensation. ""In these cases, the Home Office seems to be waiting around for people to contact them - even though they may not have the means or information to do so. That's an utter disgrace."" This video can not be played Windrush scandal: A lawyer's advice for victims Home Office minister Ms Nokes, in her written ministerial answer to Ms Lucas' question, said: ""The Home Office has not made a specific attempt to inform those 49 people of the Windrush taskforce.

""Assistance is also available through the Windrush Taskforce helpline on freephone 0800678 1925 or by email at commonwealthtaskforce@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Any individual who believes they are protected under the provisions of the 1971 Immigration Act is able to contact the Windrush Taskforce, who will help to identify their current status.

"A number of roads in the area, including Haydons Road, have been closed by police A man has been shot by police during a planned operation into a robbery of a cash van. A witness said he saw two men trying to rob a van outside a Sainsbury's in Wimbledon, south-west London, when officers ""swarmed out of the bushes"". The Met Police said the 23-year-old was taken to hospital after the shooting in Lacock Close at about 08:10 GMT. He has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rob, along with another 23-year-old man. The Met said the condition of the shot man was not life-threatening. The witness, who did not want to be named, said he saw two men raiding the van before armed police ""bounded on them"". ""Seven shots were fired. The cops were waiting for them,"" he added. The witness said one of the men then ran up the street holding a gun and ""when he saw he was turning into a cul-de-sac he turned and fired on the cops, then they returned fire"". Forensic officers have been carrying out searches outside the nearby pub The Met said the man was shot during an operation into cash in transit robberies. The operation involved officers from the force's Flying Squad who were supported by armed colleagues, the force confirmed. A suspected stolen car has been recovered at the scene. London Ambulance Service said paramedics ""treated a person at the scene and took them as a priority to a major trauma centre"". A Sainsbury's spokesperson said that an ""incident took place outside our Haydons Road Local"" and they were ""supporting the police with their investigation"". The operation the involved the force's Flying Squad who were being assisted by armed colleagues Haydon's Road has been cordoned off by police between Quicks Road and South Park Road, and North Road is also shut while investigations take place. The Independent Office for Police Conduct has launched an independent investigation into the shooting.

"Hughes had a 13.6% win rate in the league at Southampton Mark Hughes has been sacked as Southampton manager after eight months in charge. The Saints, who drew with Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday, are 18th in the table. Southampton confirmed the move in a statement, adding: ""The search for a new manager to take the club forward is already under way."" First-team assistant coach Kelvin Davis will take charge of the team for the game against Tottenham on Wednesday. BBC Sport understands Southampton are set to approach former RB Leipzig manager Ralph Hasenhuttl about the manager's job. The 51-year-old Austrian has been out of work since leaving Leipzig in May. Hughes, who also had a spell at the south coast club during his playing career,joined Southamptonin March, two months after beingsacked by Stoke City. The club were one point above the relegation zone at the time and the 55-year-old led them to safety last season by securing two wins from their last four games. However, they have struggled again this season and, across his spell, have won just three of their 22 league games. Before the draw against Manchester United, Southampton were beaten 3-2 by relegation rivals Fulham and knocked out of the EFL Cup on penalties by Leicester. Along with Hughes, assistant first-team manager Mark Bowen and coach Eddie Niedzwiecki have also left the club. Did Twitter predict Mark Hughes' exit? It's tweets of the week Phil McNulty, BBC Sport chief football writer Southampton's hierarchy were never going to make the same mistake as last season when they almost left it too late to sack Mauricio Pellegrino as they dropped towards relegation. It meant added pressure on Mark Hughes, who presided over their survival, and his dismal win record of three wins from 22 league games made this decision inevitable. Hughes has told regular hard luck stories this season but eventually the script becomes tired when performances, even though they were decent enough on occasions, simply do not get results. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but Southampton may now reflect on their decision to give Hughes a three-year contract in the afterglow of retaining their Premier League status, rather than thanking him for his efforts and returning to the drawing board. Saints' vice-chairman Les Reed and technical director Martin Hunter have already gone and the sweep has continued with Hughes' sacking. These are changing times at St Mary's. As for Hughes, it is hard to see where he will go next after successive sackings at Stoke and Southampton in so short a time. He now joins other old managerial heads like Sam Allardyce, David Moyes and Alan Pardew on the margins. Adam Blackmore, sports editor of BBC Radio Solent, said Hughes ""has paid the price for results"", but he added ""the problems that are afflicting Southampton at the moment cannot all be laid at his door"". ""The football of late has been improving but individual defensive mistakes have riddled the season, and that opens up the whole debate about bad recruitment over a period of two years now,"" he explained. ""Hughes did well to keep them up last season, but after a summer of making signings that have deepened the squad, not improved the team, Saints have effectively damaged themselves by losing their golden touch in the transfer market, and not adding match-winners to a squad who narrowly avoided relegation last season. ""Saints fans have been crying out for a return to the high-tempo, high-pressing game that saw them get great success under Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman, and if as expected they appoint Ralph Hasenhuttl, the 'Alpen Klopp', later this week, they may get their wish. ""The Saints board need to get this one right, because from now, they themselves are the only ones left to blame for the club's current state.""

"President Donald Trump's words and actions are restricting global efforts to cut carbon, according to a new study. The analysis says the withdrawal by the US from the Paris climate agreement has created the political cover for others to go slow on their commitments. The author says the world is in denial about President Trump's true impact. The study comes as delegates begin two weeks of UN-led talks here on the future of the Paris pact. Climate chiefs warn 'world at crossroads' Trump: Climate scientists have 'agenda' Dire warning on US climate change impacts Trump dismisses US climate change report President Trump has justified pulling his country out of the landmark climate agreement by asserting that he was elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh and not Paris. However, other international leaders promised that there would be no going back, and that the US pull-out would galvanise efforts to cut carbon. The sense of unity was underlined in November 2017 when Syria signed the Paris agreement, leaving the US alone in the world as the only country rejecting the deal. This video can not be played UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres: ""Climate change is a global issue, we are all failing."" But this new report, from the Institute of International and European Affairs, suggests that President Trump's words and deeds are causing ""very real damage"" to the Paris agreement. The author outlines three key areas where the Trump effect is having an impact. Under the president, US federal environmental regulations on oil, gas and coal have been rolled back and, as a result, some of the dirtiest fossil fuel projects have become more attractive to investors. The author says that the US withdrawal from Paris has created the ""moral and political cover for others to follow suit"", citing the examples of Russia and Turkey - which have both declined to ratify the Paris deal. The US pull-out has also ""severely damaged goodwill at international negotiations"", something that's crucial to progress in these talks here in Poland. When it comes to fossil fuels, the author cites the example of investments in the coal sector by 36 US banks, which saw a decline of 38% in 2016 after the Paris agreement was signed, but which rose by 6% in 2017 after President Trump was sworn in. ""This is not a coincidence, there is something underpinning these trends and that's political signals,"" said Joseph Curtin, a senior fellow at the IIEA. ""The Paris agreement sent a shiver down the spine of institutional investors globally and made them question if they were exposed to stranded assets and whether these political leaders were really serious about climate change."" President Trump made support for the coal industry a key election promise ""There's absolutely no doubt that the Trump effect has created a sense of uncertainty in terms of the political commitment to achieve anything close to a two degree C target."" The switch to coal and oil investments has hurt renewable energy investment in the US and this has had a global knock-on effect, the author says. On the political front, Russia, Turkey, Australia and Brazil have all cited the example of President Trump to limit their actions on climate change. Russia and Turkey have said they will not ratify the agreement. The newly elected President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has sent mixed messages about climate change. But in recent days, his government has ruled out hosting next year's major climate conference. The impact of populist governments on the climate change agenda was also highlighted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, speaking recently to the BBC. ""It is clear to me that the world is more polarised, we have more and more nationalist approaches being popular and winning elections or having strong election results,"" he said. ""We see the trust between public opinion and institutions and also international organisations being eroded and this has led, in my opinion, to a lack of the necessary political will."" While the EU, China and India have promised to take more ambitious steps to bolster the Paris agreement, study author Joseph Curtin believes they will be reluctant to take major steps without the participation of the US. ""There's no way that the big player will upgrade their ambition without some sort of quid pro quo from the US,"" he told BBC News. ""The likelihood that they will take on more ambitious pledges in the short term has certainly been damaged."" However, some of those involved in the UN climate process argue that to focus on the impacts of Trump is mistaken. ""It's not just about political leaders in Brazil and the US,"" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme. ""The world has seven billion people and over 190 nations, so they are not the entire story - there has been extraordinary leadership on this issue by India and China, countries that 10 years ago were being pilloried for not acting on climate change."" The author of the new study says that the Paris deal will survive in the short term. ""But in the longer term, without US support, the Paris agreement won't ultimately be effective and we should be honest about that.""

"This video can not be played An undercover reporter gained first-hand experience of how SRN operates The recruitment tactics of a far right group have been exposed after it was infiltrated by an undercover reporter. System Resistance Network (SRN) preaches zero tolerance to non-whites, Jewish and Muslim communities and says homosexuality is a disease. The group has been targeting Welsh communities to recruit members. There are now calls for membership of SRN, which wants expulsion of minorities and a white revolution, to be made illegal. The group is believed to have been inspired by the now-banned far right group National Action and has inspired its followers to carry out arson and vandalism in Welsh cities. After creating a fake online profile, a BBC Wales Investigates undercover reporter gained first-hand experience of how SRN operates. He communicated with the group for months and gained their trust enough to be asked to carry out acts on their behalf - putting up SRN posters at night and taking pictures of them to prove he had done it. He was also told to read Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf and other extremist literature. ""They talk about smashing the establishment,"" he said. ""They want me to break the law - to get their name in the headlines - they don't care who gets hurt."" One of National Action's founders, Swansea-based Alex Davies, has been giving his support for the group on Neo-Nazi radio station, Radio Aryan. He was a student when he first created National Action in 2013. His media man, Ben Raymond moved from Bognor Regis to live in Swansea as the group's numbers and infamy grew. National Action was considered the most dangerous far right organisation in Britain and wasoutlawed in December 2016after glorifying the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. National Action was founded by Ben Raymond (pictured) and Alex Davies in 2013 Just over a year ago Mr Davies and Mr Raymond were both arrested on suspicion of continued membership of National Action, something they deny. They have not been charged. Police say their investigations are continuing. BBC Wales Investigates listened to Mr Davies on neo-Nazi station Radio Aryan, where he said he was encouraged by racist posters and graffitidaubed on walls in Cardiffearlier this year. ""As long as there's some signs of resistance then there's hope,"" he said. ""It's like a fire. As long as you've got some embers burning all you need is to put some fuel on that fire and it can turn into something big very quickly."" Mr Raymond has also made appearances on the station asking for support for far right supporters who have been jailed, in particular to send them reading material. Alex Davies was forced out of Warwick university for his far right political activities BBC Wales approached the man who runs Radio Aryan, who calls himself Sven Longshanks. He declined to be interviewed but contacted the programme by e-mail to deny any wrongdoing and said the station was for nationalists to listen to in the privacy of their own homes. He added that he was not responsible for anything that Ben Raymond or Alex Davies say on his programmes. National Action first right wing group to be banned in UK UKIP AIM quits over 'far right move' Logo of far right group System Resistance Network Ten people have been convicted this year of continued membership of National Action. Counter-terror police said they maintained their links and took the group underground. Earlier this year, Christopher Lythgoe and Matthew Hankinsonwere jailed for a total of 14 yearsafter being found guilty of being members of the group after a six-week trial. Fellow National Action members Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas,who named their baby after Adolf Hitler,and Daniel Bogunovic, were also found guilty of National Action membership and will be sentenced later this month. One National Action member decided Wales was fertile ground not only to spread the far right message but to set up white enclaves. Mikko Vehvilainen was a lance corporal and fitness instructor in the Royal Anglian regiment. His neighbours in the village of Llansilin in Powys had no idea of his Nazi sympathies until a dramatic police raid in September 2017. Counter-terrorism officers discovered he was still an active member of National Action - and was linked to other members of the now underground group in the Midlands. Mikko Vehvilainen gives a Nazi salute In Vehvilainen's home, and his military accommodation at Sennybridge Camp, officers found Nazi paraphernalia, weapons and messages he had been exchanging with fellow far right sympathisers via encrypted apps. In one message he sent to a fellow far right sympathiser using an encrypted app the true extent of his hatred for other races was laid bare. The Afghanistan veteran said black people were not worthy of life and added: ""I could shoot their children and feel nothing. I didn't kill any Muslims up close, but when I was involved in killing them it didn't bother me one bit. Maybe some of my shots killed them. I hope so."" Vehvilainen was jailed for eight years for being a member of National Action after the prosecution at his trial successfully argued he had been trying to recruit fellow soldiers into the group. The trial heard he bought the house in Llansilin as part of a plan to set up an all-white enclave in mid Wales. Vehvilainen managed to infiltrate the British Army despite his extreme views, but in his native Finland his sympathies were well known. BBC Wales Investigates travelled to the Baltic state to meet Esa Holappa, a former neo Nazi who turned his back on the movement where he had been in regular dialogue with Vehvilainen. ""Mikko was a very hateful person, willing to fight and struggle for his ideas and maybe take another step,"" he said. ""It was very, very clear that according to MV's ideas and the ideology he followed... certain people could be exterminated and killed in order to achieve a white revolution, the white victory."" Esa was not surprised that Vehvilainen joined the Army and said it was a known tactic for racist groups. Hitler's Mein Kampf The Army told BBC Wales Investigates it vets recruits for convictions or links to extremist groups and has robust measures to ensure those showing extremist views are not tolerated or permitted to serve. Stephen Doughty, MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, said SRN - like National Action - should be outlawed. He also wants the police to investigate Radio Aryan and comments made on it by Alex Davies and Ben Raymond. Ben Raymond denied any wrongdoing and declined to be interviewed. The programme also made repeated attempts to reach Alex Davies but he did not respond. They believe they have a right to their views and free speech. ""This is free speech that is too damaging for the rights of others,"" said Mr Doughty. ""You cannot have liberty to impinge on the liberty of others and a lot of these organisations hide behind that when in reality they are allowing disgusting and hateful content to exist. ""It is also about the penalties for technology and internet companies that continue to host this content when it has been reported to the authorities."" Assistant Chief Constable Jon Drake, of South Wales Police, told BBC Wales Investigates the police were working with communities across Wales to detect and prevent radicalisation, both online and elsewhere ""The ideology and intention has not changed - it's the tools that are available for criminality in all its forms to exploit,"" he said. ""What I'd say though is it's also an opportunity for us to investigate and it doesn't matter whether people are trying to radicalise online or offline, if the offence is there we will investigate and bring people to justice."" Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""The government will not hesitate to proscribe any organisation that poses a threat and work is underway with tech companies to combat extremist propaganda online."" He added that new proposals to combat the threat of online radicalisation are due to be published this winter.

"This video can not be played Daniela Tejada says she is ""elated"" at the news Matthew Hedges has been pardoned The leader of the UK's MI6 intelligence service has said he is ""perplexed"" over why the United Arab Emirates jailed British academic Matthew Hedges. Alex Younger said he ""genuinely can't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to"". Mr Hedges was accused of spying for MI6 and jailed in the UAE last month, but he was later pardoned. In a rare speech, Mr Younger also warned Russia ""not to underestimate our capabilities"". He described how MI6 exposed the perpetrators of the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury and warned that Britain's adversaries view themselves as being in a state of ""perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. British academic pardoned by UAE Russian reporter denies trying to enter Army base Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Last month, an Abu Dhabi court found Mr Hedges guilty of ""spying for or on behalf of"" the UK government, and he was jailed for life. Prosecutors said Mr Hedges had admitted the charges but the 31-year-old denied spying and said he had been researching the country's security strategy as part of his PhD studies at Durham University. A week later, the UAE issued the pardon as part of a series of orders on the country's National Day anniversary and Mr Hedges was freed. In the second public speech by the man known as ""C"" in the four years since his appointment, Mr Younger addressed the case. ""We are perplexed by what has happened,"" he said, speaking at St Andrews University. ""There are some frank conversations ahead of us but we need to make sure that partnership works."" Alex Younger said he ""genuinely can't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to"" Mr Younger also spoke of the need for ""fourth-generation espionage"", fusing human skills with technical innovation. He encouraged students to consider joining MI6, saying tackling modern adversaries who use new technology to probe UK institutions and defences will require ""a mindset that mobilises diversity and empowers the young"". Mr Younger re-emphasisedthe importance of strengthening security ties in Europe. He said Britain's spies have thwarted multiple Islamic State plots originating overseas, often in partnership with European allies. UK intelligence agencies have played ""an important contribution"" in helping European countries, particularly France and Germany, prevent terrorist attacks in their countries or against their citizens, he said. This video can not be played Alex Younger warned Russia ""not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities"" Mr Younger also spoke about facing ""adversaries who regard themselves as being in a state of perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. He said: ""I urge Russia or any other state intent on subverting our way of life not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities, or those of our allies."" The expulsion of Russian intelligence officers by the UK, following the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury, had significantly reduced Russian intelligence capability, Mr Younger said. The speech comes at a time of heightened tensions between the UK and Russia. In the most recent incident on Saturday, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson called on the public to report suspicious activity near military sites, after a Russian TV crew prompted an alert at an Army base. Earlier this year, GCHQ chief Jeremy Fleming said Moscow posed a ""real"" and ""active"" threat to the international community in the wake of theSalisbury poisoning. Russia denies any involvement.

"Beijing will ""reduce and remove"" the 40% tariffs it places on US cars imported into China, US President Donald Trump has said. China has declined to confirm President Trump's announcement, which he made on Twitter without providing details. The move, if confirmed, would be welcomed by a car industry unsettled by the escalating US-China trade war. President Trump and Xi Jinping have now agreed to a temporary truce in the bitter dispute. Over dinner at the G20 summit, they agreed to not increase tariffs for 90 daysto allow for talks. Failure to strike a deal would have seen tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods rise from 10% to 25% at the start of next year, and would have opened the way for tariffs on additional Chinese goods. President Trump was in ebullient mood after the developments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, China's foreign ministry said the presidents of China and the US had instructed their economic teams to ""intensify talks"" towards removing all tariffs following the G20 meeting, However, it did not say if that was a plan with specific goals or something that was merely desirable. Asian markets rallied after news of the trade war truce. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite index jumped 2.6%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1%. The gains spread to Europe, with the UK's FTSE 100 index, the Cac 40 in France and Germany's Dax index all up by about 2%. The trade war has seen the US and China hit each other with escalating tariffs in an attempt to make their domestically made goods more competitive. The US says its tariff policy is a response to China's ""unfair"" trade practices and accuses it of intellectual property theft. Since July, the US has hit China with tariffs on $250bn (Â£195.9bn) worth of goods. China has retaliated with duties on some $110bn of US goods over the same period. Trade war truce: A win for the US or China? US-China trade row: What has happened so far? A quick guide to the US-China trade war As part of this, the US imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese cars, on top of the 2.5% already in place. In July, China, which is the world's largest market for cars, imposed a 40% tariff on US vehicle imports. The rate is much higher than the 15% it places on other trading partners and forced many carmakers to raise prices. In his tweet, President Trump said Beijing had ""agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US"". He did not provide a new level for the Chinese tariffs, and Beijing did not immediately confirm the statement. In a statement, the White House said US tariffs on Chinese goods would remain unchanged for 90 days, but added: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US manufactures cars for export to China, the world's largest car market The US said China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", according to the White House. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". Yes. The truce prevents raising tariffs as planned on $200bn worth of Chinese goods. But it does not remove tariffs that apply to a total of $250bn of Chinese goods targeted since July. The truce also does not affect the existing duties China has imposed on $110bn of US goods in a tit for tat retaliation. While the result of the G20 meeting was better than expected, it is unclear how the two countries will manage to resolve their underlying differences. ""There should be no wishful thinking that the truce would end the trade war between the world's two largest economies,"" DBS strategist Philip Wee wrote in a research note. Trade wars and protectionism explained He said it ""remains to be seen if real progress could be achieved during this narrow window to resolve the contentious issues, not just on trade, but also intellectual property"". Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said while the agreement itself was ""positive"" the next steps remained unclear. ""Whether we will see further de-escalation or whether it is temporary reprieve continues to be very much up to a political decision in Washington DC - that will continue to make this uncertain,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics said.

"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough addressing the climate change conference in Poland. The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has said climate change is humanity's greatest threat in thousands of years. The broadcaster said it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of ""much of the natural world"". He was speaking at the opening ceremony of United Nations-sponsored climate talks in Katowice, Poland. The meeting is the most critical on climate change since the 2015 Paris agreement. Sir David said: ""Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. ""If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon."" The naturalist is taking up the ""People's Seat"" at the conference, called COP24. He is supposed to act as a link between the public and policy-makers at the meeting. ""The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,"" he said. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"" for many countries. He explained that the world is ""nowhere near where it needs to be"" on the transition to a low-carbon economy. But the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to ""right the ship"" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps. Meanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? 'Trump effect' limits action on climate This video can not be played Climate activist: 'It's high time that Poland phased out coal' This Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)reporton limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October. The IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030. Buta recent studyshowed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years. In an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action. They say ""decisive action in the next two years will be crucial"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider. So urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start. Yes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting. The number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment. But for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical. They will want to show that international co-operation can still work even in the age of President Trump. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Rather than spending all their time working on how to increase ambitions to cut carbon, conference delegates are likely to focus on trying to finalise the technical rules of how the Paris agreement will work. A collage of children's drawing about climate change laid out on a glacier in Switzerland While the agreement was ratified in record time by more than 180 countries in 2016, it doesn't become operational until 2020. Before then, delegates must sort out common rules on measuring, reporting and verifying (checking to avoid the misreporting of) greenhouse gas emissions, and on how climate finance is going to be provided. ""The rulebook is the thing that will absorb most of the negotiators' capacity at this year's COP,"" said Camilla Born, from the climate change think tank, E3G. ""It's no surprise, as agreeing the Paris rules is both technically and politically a complicated task - but it is worth it!"" What is in the Paris climate agreement? Last four years are 'world's hottest' Race to pull greenhouse gases from air Right now, that rule book runs to several hundred pages with thousands of brackets, indicating areas of dispute. Under the Paris agreement, each country decides for itself the actions it will take when it comes to cutting carbon. Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action. ""We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,"" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF. ""Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast."" There is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians. Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24 ""Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,"" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues. ""Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture."" Others involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world. ""We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,"" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme. Many developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement. Some are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting. ""A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,"" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. Yes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many. The Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia. This bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some. ""Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,"" said SÃ©bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law. Although the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24. However, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels.A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect. In graphics:Seven charts that show the rate of warming Advice:What can I do to help?

"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough addressing the climate change conference in Poland. The naturalist Sir David Attenborough has said climate change is humanity's greatest threat in thousands of years. The broadcaster said it could lead to the collapse of civilisations and the extinction of ""much of the natural world"". He was speaking at the opening ceremony of United Nations-sponsored climate talks in Katowice, Poland. The meeting is the most critical on climate change since the 2015 Paris agreement. Sir David said: ""Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate change. ""If we don't take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon."" The naturalist is taking up the ""People's Seat"" at the conference, called COP24. He is supposed to act as a link between the public and policy-makers at the meeting. ""The world's people have spoken. Their message is clear. Time is running out. They want you, the decision-makers, to act now,"" he said. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said climate change was already ""a matter of life and death"" for many countries. He explained that the world is ""nowhere near where it needs to be"" on the transition to a low-carbon economy. But the UN Secretary-General said the conference was an effort to ""right the ship"" and he would convene a climate summit next year to discuss next steps. Meanwhile, the World Bank has announced $200bn in funding over five years to support countries taking action against climate change. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts What is climate change? 'Trump effect' limits action on climate This video can not be played Climate activist: 'It's high time that Poland phased out coal' This Conference of the Parties (COP) is the first to be held since the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)reporton limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C came out in October. The IPCC stated that to keep to the 1.5C goal, governments would have to slash emissions of greenhouse gases by 45% by 2030. Buta recent studyshowed that CO2 emissions are on the rise again after stalling for four years. In an unprecedented move, four former UN climate talks presidents issued a statement on Sunday, calling for urgent action. They say ""decisive action in the next two years will be crucial"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, the gap between what countries say they are doing and what needs to be done has never been wider. So urgent is the task that some negotiators began their meetings on Sunday, a day before the official start. Yes, some 29 heads of state and government are due to give statements at the opening of the meeting. The number is way down on the stellar cast that turned up in Paris in 2015, which perhaps indicates that many are seeing this as more a technical stage on the road to tackling climate change than a big bang moment. But for the likes of China and the EU, the meeting is critical. They will want to show that international co-operation can still work even in the age of President Trump. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Rather than spending all their time working on how to increase ambitions to cut carbon, conference delegates are likely to focus on trying to finalise the technical rules of how the Paris agreement will work. A collage of children's drawing about climate change laid out on a glacier in Switzerland While the agreement was ratified in record time by more than 180 countries in 2016, it doesn't become operational until 2020. Before then, delegates must sort out common rules on measuring, reporting and verifying (checking to avoid the misreporting of) greenhouse gas emissions, and on how climate finance is going to be provided. ""The rulebook is the thing that will absorb most of the negotiators' capacity at this year's COP,"" said Camilla Born, from the climate change think tank, E3G. ""It's no surprise, as agreeing the Paris rules is both technically and politically a complicated task - but it is worth it!"" What is in the Paris climate agreement? Last four years are 'world's hottest' Race to pull greenhouse gases from air Right now, that rule book runs to several hundred pages with thousands of brackets, indicating areas of dispute. Under the Paris agreement, each country decides for itself the actions it will take when it comes to cutting carbon. Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action. ""We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,"" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF. ""Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast."" There is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians. Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24 ""Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,"" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues. ""Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture."" Others involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world. ""We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,"" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme. Many developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement. Some are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting. ""A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,"" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. Yes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many. The Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia. This bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some. ""Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,"" said SÃ©bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law. Although the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24. However, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels.A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect. In graphics:Seven charts that show the rate of warming Advice:What can I do to help?

"UKIP leader Gerard Batten has survived a vote of no confidence held by the party's National Executive Committee. Mr Batten had been criticised by some in the party - including former leader Nigel Farage - for appointing far-right activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser. UKIP said its ruling body had voted ""overwhelmingly"" against a motion of no confidence. However it said  it did not endorse Mr Robinson's appointment. He was barred from membership ""through his associations"", it added. UKIP AMs say Robinson should not get membership Gerard Batten on Tommy Robinson Former EDL leader Mr Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - was jailed for 13 months in May for contempt of court, although his conviction was later quashed over procedural concerns. The case has since been referred to the attorney general. It was his third spell in prison since January 2013, having served sentences for mortgage fraud and a passport offence. However, after appointing Mr Robinson to advise on rape gangs and prison reform,Mr Batten said: ""He's a good person to have on side, a lot of people respect his stand on things and his courage."" Mr Robinson is expected to feature in a Brexit march in London on 9 December. UKIP said it had not organised the event, although members were ""free to attend"". UKIP's former deputy leader Suzanne Evans has quit the party over what she described as the ""perverse direction"" in which Mr Batten was taking it. She said she had hoped ""sense would prevail"" at the NEC meeting, but had been disappointed by the outcome. ""I feel I have no option but to join the thousands of other good, decent former UKIP members in walking out of the door in disgust at the radical change in UKIP's direction,"" she said in a Facebook post. The former Conservative councillor said she had joined UKIP as a ""Brexit party"", but added: ""I would never have joined UKIP as it stands today, obsessed as it is with becoming a successor to the BNP and the EDL"".

"This video can not be played An undercover reporter gained first-hand experience of how SRN operates The recruitment tactics of a far right group have been exposed after it was infiltrated by an undercover reporter. System Resistance Network (SRN) preaches zero tolerance to non-whites, Jewish and Muslim communities and says homosexuality is a disease. The group has been targeting Welsh communities to recruit members. There are now calls for membership of SRN, which wants expulsion of minorities and a white revolution, to be made illegal. The group is believed to have been inspired by the now-banned far right group National Action and has inspired its followers to carry out arson and vandalism in Welsh cities. After creating a fake online profile, a BBC Wales Investigates undercover reporter gained first-hand experience of how SRN operates. He communicated with the group for months and gained their trust enough to be asked to carry out acts on their behalf - putting up SRN posters at night and taking pictures of them to prove he had done it. He was also told to read Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf and other extremist literature. ""They talk about smashing the establishment,"" he said. ""They want me to break the law - to get their name in the headlines - they don't care who gets hurt."" One of National Action's founders, Swansea-based Alex Davies, has been giving his support for the group on Neo-Nazi radio station, Radio Aryan. He was a student when he first created National Action in 2013. His media man, Ben Raymond moved from Bognor Regis to live in Swansea as the group's numbers and infamy grew. National Action was considered the most dangerous far right organisation in Britain and wasoutlawed in December 2016after glorifying the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox. National Action was founded by Ben Raymond (pictured) and Alex Davies in 2013 Just over a year ago Mr Davies and Mr Raymond were both arrested on suspicion of continued membership of National Action, something they deny. They have not been charged. Police say their investigations are continuing. BBC Wales Investigates listened to Mr Davies on neo-Nazi station Radio Aryan, where he said he was encouraged by racist posters and graffitidaubed on walls in Cardiffearlier this year. ""As long as there's some signs of resistance then there's hope,"" he said. ""It's like a fire. As long as you've got some embers burning all you need is to put some fuel on that fire and it can turn into something big very quickly."" Mr Raymond has also made appearances on the station asking for support for far right supporters who have been jailed, in particular to send them reading material. Alex Davies was forced out of Warwick university for his far right political activities BBC Wales approached the man who runs Radio Aryan, who calls himself Sven Longshanks. He declined to be interviewed but contacted the programme by e-mail to deny any wrongdoing and said the station was for nationalists to listen to in the privacy of their own homes. He added that he was not responsible for anything that Ben Raymond or Alex Davies say on his programmes. National Action first right wing group to be banned in UK UKIP AIM quits over 'far right move' Logo of far right group System Resistance Network Ten people have been convicted this year of continued membership of National Action. Counter-terror police said they maintained their links and took the group underground. Earlier this year, Christopher Lythgoe and Matthew Hankinsonwere jailed for a total of 14 yearsafter being found guilty of being members of the group after a six-week trial. Fellow National Action members Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas,who named their baby after Adolf Hitler,and Daniel Bogunovic, were also found guilty of National Action membership and will be sentenced later this month. One National Action member decided Wales was fertile ground not only to spread the far right message but to set up white enclaves. Mikko Vehvilainen was a lance corporal and fitness instructor in the Royal Anglian regiment. His neighbours in the village of Llansilin in Powys had no idea of his Nazi sympathies until a dramatic police raid in September 2017. Counter-terrorism officers discovered he was still an active member of National Action - and was linked to other members of the now underground group in the Midlands. Mikko Vehvilainen gives a Nazi salute In Vehvilainen's home, and his military accommodation at Sennybridge Camp, officers found Nazi paraphernalia, weapons and messages he had been exchanging with fellow far right sympathisers via encrypted apps. In one message he sent to a fellow far right sympathiser using an encrypted app the true extent of his hatred for other races was laid bare. The Afghanistan veteran said black people were not worthy of life and added: ""I could shoot their children and feel nothing. I didn't kill any Muslims up close, but when I was involved in killing them it didn't bother me one bit. Maybe some of my shots killed them. I hope so."" Vehvilainen was jailed for eight years for being a member of National Action after the prosecution at his trial successfully argued he had been trying to recruit fellow soldiers into the group. The trial heard he bought the house in Llansilin as part of a plan to set up an all-white enclave in mid Wales. Vehvilainen managed to infiltrate the British Army despite his extreme views, but in his native Finland his sympathies were well known. BBC Wales Investigates travelled to the Baltic state to meet Esa Holappa, a former neo Nazi who turned his back on the movement where he had been in regular dialogue with Vehvilainen. ""Mikko was a very hateful person, willing to fight and struggle for his ideas and maybe take another step,"" he said. ""It was very, very clear that according to MV's ideas and the ideology he followed... certain people could be exterminated and killed in order to achieve a white revolution, the white victory."" Esa was not surprised that Vehvilainen joined the Army and said it was a known tactic for racist groups. Hitler's Mein Kampf The Army told BBC Wales Investigates it vets recruits for convictions or links to extremist groups and has robust measures to ensure those showing extremist views are not tolerated or permitted to serve. Stephen Doughty, MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, said SRN - like National Action - should be outlawed. He also wants the police to investigate Radio Aryan and comments made on it by Alex Davies and Ben Raymond. Ben Raymond denied any wrongdoing and declined to be interviewed. The programme also made repeated attempts to reach Alex Davies but he did not respond. They believe they have a right to their views and free speech. ""This is free speech that is too damaging for the rights of others,"" said Mr Doughty. ""You cannot have liberty to impinge on the liberty of others and a lot of these organisations hide behind that when in reality they are allowing disgusting and hateful content to exist. ""It is also about the penalties for technology and internet companies that continue to host this content when it has been reported to the authorities."" Assistant Chief Constable Jon Drake, of South Wales Police, told BBC Wales Investigates the police were working with communities across Wales to detect and prevent radicalisation, both online and elsewhere ""The ideology and intention has not changed - it's the tools that are available for criminality in all its forms to exploit,"" he said. ""What I'd say though is it's also an opportunity for us to investigate and it doesn't matter whether people are trying to radicalise online or offline, if the offence is there we will investigate and bring people to justice."" Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""The government will not hesitate to proscribe any organisation that poses a threat and work is underway with tech companies to combat extremist propaganda online."" He added that new proposals to combat the threat of online radicalisation are due to be published this winter.

"This video can not be played Daniela Tejada says she is ""elated"" at the news Matthew Hedges has been pardoned The leader of the UK's MI6 intelligence service has said he is ""perplexed"" over why the United Arab Emirates jailed British academic Matthew Hedges. Alex Younger said he ""genuinely can't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to"". Mr Hedges was accused of spying for MI6 and jailed in the UAE last month, but he was later pardoned. In a rare speech, Mr Younger also warned Russia ""not to underestimate our capabilities"". He described how MI6 exposed the perpetrators of the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury and warned that Britain's adversaries view themselves as being in a state of ""perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. British academic pardoned by UAE Russian reporter denies trying to enter Army base Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Last month, an Abu Dhabi court found Mr Hedges guilty of ""spying for or on behalf of"" the UK government, and he was jailed for life. Prosecutors said Mr Hedges had admitted the charges but the 31-year-old denied spying and said he had been researching the country's security strategy as part of his PhD studies at Durham University. A week later, the UAE issued the pardon as part of a series of orders on the country's National Day anniversary and Mr Hedges was freed. In the second public speech by the man known as ""C"" in the four years since his appointment, Mr Younger addressed the case. ""We are perplexed by what has happened,"" he said, speaking at St Andrews University. ""There are some frank conversations ahead of us but we need to make sure that partnership works."" Alex Younger said he ""genuinely can't understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to"" Mr Younger also spoke of the need for ""fourth-generation espionage"", fusing human skills with technical innovation. He encouraged students to consider joining MI6, saying tackling modern adversaries who use new technology to probe UK institutions and defences will require ""a mindset that mobilises diversity and empowers the young"". Mr Younger re-emphasisedthe importance of strengthening security ties in Europe. He said Britain's spies have thwarted multiple Islamic State plots originating overseas, often in partnership with European allies. UK intelligence agencies have played ""an important contribution"" in helping European countries, particularly France and Germany, prevent terrorist attacks in their countries or against their citizens, he said. This video can not be played Alex Younger warned Russia ""not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities"" Mr Younger also spoke about facing ""adversaries who regard themselves as being in a state of perpetual confrontation"" with the UK. He said: ""I urge Russia or any other state intent on subverting our way of life not to underestimate our determination and our capabilities, or those of our allies."" The expulsion of Russian intelligence officers by the UK, following the Novichok poisoning in Salisbury, had significantly reduced Russian intelligence capability, Mr Younger said. The speech comes at a time of heightened tensions between the UK and Russia. In the most recent incident on Saturday, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson called on the public to report suspicious activity near military sites, after a Russian TV crew prompted an alert at an Army base. Earlier this year, GCHQ chief Jeremy Fleming said Moscow posed a ""real"" and ""active"" threat to the international community in the wake of theSalisbury poisoning. Russia denies any involvement.

""The rulebook is the thing that will absorb most of the negotiators' capacity at this year's COP,"" said Camilla Born, from the climate change think tank, E3G. ""It's no surprise, as agreeing the Paris rules is both technically and politically a complicated task - but it is worth it!"" What is in the Paris climate agreement? Last four years are 'world's hottest' Race to pull greenhouse gases from air Right now, that rule book runs to several hundred pages with thousands of brackets, indicating areas of dispute. Under the Paris agreement, each country decides for itself the actions it will take when it comes to cutting carbon. Some observers believe that the changed mood and the urgency of the science will prompt action. ""We are hoping that at COP24, countries will make declarations of how they will raise their ambitions by 2020. This is a very important moment,"" said Fernanda Carvalho with campaign group WWF. ""Two years is a short time span for that to happen. Countries need to act fast."" There is much frustration with the snail-like pace, especially among some campaigners who feel that the scale of the threat posed by rising temperatures hasn't been fully grasped by politicians. Greta Thunberg, who has refused to go to school in Sweden in protest over climate change, will be attending COP24 ""Governments across the world have completely failed to protect their citizens,"" said a spokesperson for Extinction Rebellion, the social movement that pushes for radical change on climate issues. ""Instead, they have pursued quick profit and big business. We need this to change. At COP24, we want to ensure that the focus is not just on getting the technical Paris rulebook as robust as possible, but also that governments do not lose sight of the bigger picture."" Others involved in the UN process say that real progress is being made in tackling one of the most complex problems ever faced by the world. ""We have a $300bn renewable energy economy at work today - it's not peanuts; it's an energy revolution that has unfolded on the back of, yes, a sometimes sticky climate negotiation process,"" said Achim Steiner, who heads the United Nations Development Programme. Many developing countries see progress on issues around finance to be critical to moving forward. They have been promised $100bn every year from 2020 as part of the Paris agreement. Some are sceptical about what they see as foot-dragging and obfuscation by richer countries when it comes to handing over the cash. Negotiators say that moving forward on finance is the lynchpin of progress in this meeting. ""A key finding of the recent IPCC report, and one that has often been overlooked, is that without a dramatic increase in the provision of climate finance, the possibility of limiting warming to 2C (to say nothing of the safer 1.5C goal) will irretrievably slip away,"" said Amjad Abdulla, chief negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States. Yes - among government negotiators and observers alike. The fact that the conference is taking place in a strong coal region, in a city that is home to the biggest coal company in the EU, is troubling to many. The Polish government says that it is sticking with the fuel, and has announced that it is planning to invest next year in the construction of a new coal mine in Silesia. This bullish approach has drawn condemnation from some. ""Unfortunately, this week's announcement by the [meeting's] Polish presidency that it will include coal companies as sponsors of the COP sends a very worrisome signal before the conference even begins,"" said SÃ©bastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law. Although the US has withdrawn from the Paris agreement, it cannot leave until 2020, so its negotiators have been taking part in meetings and have not obstructed the process. America is expected to participate in COP24. However, given the President's well known love of coal, it has been reported that the White House will once again organise a side event promoting fossil fuels.A similar event at the last COP provoked outrage from many delegates. The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect. In graphics:Seven charts that show the rate of warming Advice:What can I do to help?

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel meets Australian PM Scott Morrison at the G20 Summit As Australia's fifth prime minister since 2013, Scott Morrison could probably forgive German Chancellor Angela Merkel for doing some quick study before their first meeting. As the pair sat down together at the G20 summit, cameras captured Mrs Merkel reading an apparent briefing note about Mr Morrison. It also carried his image. Many watching on from afar were amused, not least people in Australia. Its government denied that the incident was embarrassing for either nation. ""Angela Merkel's department, no doubt... was simply ensuring that the chancellor was properly briefed,"" Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said on Monday. Mrs Merkel's notes featured a picture of Mr Morrison Mr Birmingham said it was common for such briefing notes to feature a picture alongside a biography. However, many noted that the scene appeared a bit awkward. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Vox leader Santiago Abascal said he wanted to build ""a patriotic alternative"" for Spain After decades without making an impact on Spanish politics, the far-right has made huge gains in the country's general election, becoming the third force in parliament. The Vox party took 52 seats in Congress on Sunday, outstripping most forecasts and representing a major increase on the 24 seats it held previously. Before Vox made its debut in parliament following the last election in April, many believed Spain was electorally immune to the far right because of memories of life under a fascist dictatorship. Also, the conservative Popular Party (PP) had covered the political spectrum from centrist moderates to the hard right. But some within the PP felt the party was drifting too far to the centre. Among them was Santiago Abascal, 43, who left the conservatives to form Vox in 2014 and remains the party's leader. For a long time, Vox struggled to find its footing. But an increase in the numbers of migrants arriving on Spanish shores from Africa helped raise the party's profile in 2018, as it campaigned for tougher controls on immigration. Its anti-immigration stance aligns it with many right-wing nationalist parties across Europe. It has also sought to roll back legislation aimed at protecting women from gender violence, claiming it discriminates against men. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? Arguably the biggest issue driving support for Vox is territorial. The party takes a hard-line stance on the issue of Catalan nationalism and as the crisis in the north-eastern region has flared up recently, so Vox's support has surged. Catalonia crisis in 300 words In December 2018, it gained representation in a regional parliament, winning 12 seats in Andalusia. That made it key in the formation of a new right-wing regional government there, as the PP and Ciudadanos (Citizens) relied on its support. The three parties have also worked together in the regional parliaments of Madrid and Murcia. Besides gender politics, immigration and Catalonia, Vox also took a strident line in opposingthe government's recent transferral of the body of dictator Francisco Francofrom his mausoleum to a low-key cemetery. ""In 11 months, not only have we changed the political map of Spain, we have also led a political and cultural change, because we have opened up all the prohibited issues of debate,"" Mr Abascal told supporters on Sunday night. ""The left don't have any moral superiority,"" he added. ""We have the same right as them to defend our ideas without being insulted or stigmatised."" Rise of nationalists vowing to 'make Spain great again' Is Europe seeing a nationalist surge? Unlike some of its European counterparts, Vox does not appeal specifically to the economically marginalised. According to information from a study by Spain's National Research Centre (CIS), a typical Vox voter is male, middle-aged and middle class and has voted previously for the PP or Ciudadanos. Vox has now overtaken Ciudadanos as the second party on the right, behind the PP. The two parties' contrasting fortunes were highlighted on Monday, when the leader of Ciudadanos, Albert Rivera, resigned due to his party's disastrous election results. Founded in 2014, Vox has been derided as far-right and populist, anti-immigrant and anti-Islam. Mr Abascal, however, says his party is ""in step with what millions of Spaniards think"". He rejects the far-right label, insisting Vox is a party of ""extreme necessity"" rather than extremism, and says its overall support for Spain's membership of the EU differentiates it from many populist and far-right movements across Europe. Vox has a plan to deport migrants legally entitled to be in Spain if they have committed an offence, and wants to prevent any migrant who comes in illegally from staying. The party, which proposes to ""make Spain great again"", opposes abortion and same-sex marriage. Critics see it as a nationalist throwback to the era of dictator Francisco Franco. Vox's success in April was seen as a turning point for the far right, which had not won seats in parliament since the death of Franco in 1975 and the subsequent restoration of democracy (with the sole exception of a single seat in the first parliament of 1979-1982).

"UKIP leader Gerard Batten has survived a vote of no confidence held by the party's National Executive Committee. Mr Batten had been criticised by some in the party - including former leader Nigel Farage - for appointing far-right activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser. UKIP said its ruling body had voted ""overwhelmingly"" against a motion of no confidence. However it said  it did not endorse Mr Robinson's appointment. He was barred from membership ""through his associations"", it added. UKIP AMs say Robinson should not get membership Gerard Batten on Tommy Robinson Former EDL leader Mr Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - was jailed for 13 months in May for contempt of court, although his conviction was later quashed over procedural concerns. The case has since been referred to the attorney general. It was his third spell in prison since January 2013, having served sentences for mortgage fraud and a passport offence. However, after appointing Mr Robinson to advise on rape gangs and prison reform,Mr Batten said: ""He's a good person to have on side, a lot of people respect his stand on things and his courage."" Mr Robinson is expected to feature in a Brexit march in London on 9 December. UKIP said it had not organised the event, although members were ""free to attend"". UKIP's former deputy leader Suzanne Evans has quit the party over what she described as the ""perverse direction"" in which Mr Batten was taking it. She said she had hoped ""sense would prevail"" at the NEC meeting, but had been disappointed by the outcome. ""I feel I have no option but to join the thousands of other good, decent former UKIP members in walking out of the door in disgust at the radical change in UKIP's direction,"" she said in a Facebook post. The former Conservative councillor said she had joined UKIP as a ""Brexit party"", but added: ""I would never have joined UKIP as it stands today, obsessed as it is with becoming a successor to the BNP and the EDL"".

"Yemen has been gripped by conflict since early 2015 when Houthi rebels seized control Fifty wounded Houthi rebels have been flown from Yemen to neighbouring Oman for treatment, paving the way for planned peace talks after nearly four years of civil war. The medical evacuation on Monday, involving a UN plane, was approved by the Saudi-led military coalition. UN-sponsored talks between the rebels and the Saudi-backed government are expected to start in the coming days. The war has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis in recent times. In nearly four years of conflict in Yemen, thousands of people have been killed in fighting and millions have been pushed to the brink of starvation. Will peace talks mean more violence in Yemen? Why battle for Yemen's Hudaydah matters Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? On Monday, the UN charter flight left Sanaa at about 18:00 local time (15:00 GMT), AFP news agency reports, citing sources. The UN had appealed to the Saudis to allow the evacuation. A coalition spokesman said overnight that the move had been requested by the UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, and had been agreed as a confidence-building measure ahead of discussions in Sweden. This video can not be played The UN says Yemen is on the brink of the world's worst famine in 100 years if the war continues The UN has been trying to revive talks between the government led by President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and the Iranian-backed Houthis who control much of the north. A previous round in Geneva collapsed in September when the Houthis failed to show up. Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in early 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. There has been widespread concern for the plight of thousands of civilians trapped in the rebel-held port of Hudaydah. At least 6,660 civilians have been killed and 10,560 injured in the fighting, according to the United Nations. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. The World Health Organization warned in October that about 10,000 new suspected cases of cholera were now being reported every week.

"Matilde is not married at the moment but she lives with her partner Media strategist Matilde SuescÃºn believes that the fairytale aspiration of a big expensive engagement ring is damaging for women. She believes this fantasy should be stopped, and writes forBBC 100 Womenabout why things need to change. I have been married twice in the past, and may marry again, but I have never had or wanted an engagement ring. I believe engagement rings are anti-feminist. They symbolise an attitude which is in complete antithesis to the idea of an independent woman - signifying that the woman with the ring belongs to another person. They are also a way of signifying status: the bigger the diamond, the greater apparent value they give to the woman wearing it. Why did women only get one day to propose? Do people spend a month's salary on a ring? All of my friends here in the US disagree with me. Most of them have diamond engagement rings, some bigger than others. And they usually show them off on social media and when we meet up and make fun of me. And it's not just my generation who find my ideas odd - my daughter makes fun of me too. She dreams of having a showy engagement ring. I try to understand her because I know it is part of the cultural context in which she was born, but I don't agree at all with that mentality. In fact, the whole ritual of proposing marriage bothers me. The pantomime of a man kneeling down and asking for a woman's hand seems absurd to me. It puts her in a passive role, and asking her in a very public way - such as live on stage or in front of cameras - makes her even more vulnerable.  It really is an eccentric act. Marrying someone is not just a romantic gesture - it is a mutual agreement. It has economic and legal implications. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre. One of our projects this year is the Freedom Trash Can. In 1968 feminist protestors encouraged women to throw their ""items of oppression"" in the bin, so we'll be asking our audiences what they would throw away as women today. If my ex-husbands had proposed I would have started laughing. But it never happened because it was more of a conversation - it was a mutual decision in both cases. Although women can of course take the lead and propose marriage themselves,it still rarely happens that way,external. Matilde was born in Colombia, where she says the culture is different I am concerned that society and the media seems to educate girls to dream, from when they are young, about the man who, to quote Beyonce, will ""Put a ring on it"". And those girls then grow up with this idea that married life will then solve all their problems. Instead of just aspiring to marriage and a ring, I think girls should aspire to be independent, to study and develop, to seek happiness for themselves. When I wrote something similar in my blog for El Tiempo, a newspaper in my native Colombia, readers called me a radical feminist and accused me of killing romance. But that is not true - I am a very romantic person. What I don't find romantic at all is waiting for a ""brave prince"" to come into my life with a ring. What I actually do find romantic is the idea that if I do get married at my age, it's simply a reflection of a profound commitment of loyalty and love to the other person.

"Nargis now campaigns for women's education in her home country When Nargis Taraki became the fifth girl born to her parents in Afghanistan, her parents were told they should swap her with another baby in the village. Now 21, she has made it her life ambition to prove they were right to keep her. Nargis now campaigns for women's education and empowerment in her home country, and is one of theBBC's 2018 100 Women. In 1997 I opened my eyes to the world as my parents' fifth child, and their fifth girl. My father's sister, and other relatives, immediately put pressure on my mum to agree to my father taking a second wife. Taking a second or even third wife is not uncommon in Afghanistan, and is sometimes done because they believe a new wife could mean a new chance to have a male child. When she refused, they suggested that my father swap me for a boy. They even found a family in the village who was willing to give their boy away and take me. Swapping children is not something that is part of our culture, and I haven't heard of it happening before, but boys are more valued in Afghan society as the traditional family breadwinners. Nargis credits her father's support for her ability to get an education People deliberately said things to upset my mother and make her feel inferior for not having a son. Despite her refusal to part ways with me, some elders still kept approaching my father. But he had a completely different mentality. He told them he loved me, and he would one day prove to them that a daughter can achieve everything a son can. It was not an easy time for my father. He had a military background and a history of service in the previous Soviet-backed regime, and my native district at the time was controlled by people with religious or fundamentalist tendencies. So certain people in the village used to detest him and did not socialise with us. But my father believed in what he said, and he always stood by his word. Although there was pressure on my parents to swap me because I was a girl, it was a man who had the most positive impact on my character. Things got worse for us after Taliban militants took control of our district.  In 1998 my father had to flee to Pakistan and soon after that we joined him there. Jolie spotlights Afghan girls' plight 10 toughest places for girls to go to school Life there was not easy - but he managed to get work as a manager in a shoe factory. Perhaps the best thing to happen to my parents whilst in Pakistan was that they finally had a son, followed by my fifth sister. Nargis (left) with one of her sisters and younger brother In 2001, we all returned to Kabul after the Taliban regime was toppled. We didn't have a house of our own and had to live with my uncles. My sisters and I managed to keep going to school despite conservatism in our culture. I went on to study public policy and administration at Kabul University and graduated two years ago with the highest marks for that year. Throughout that time my father never stopped supporting me. A couple of years ago I went to watch a cricket game in Kabul with my sister. There weren't many women in the stadium and our photographs and videos were circulated on social media. People started criticising us and leaving negative comments, saying we were shameless to be in a stadium amongst men. Others said we were trying to spread adultery and were being paid by the Americans. Afghanistan women's football is 'life or death' From Afghan refugee to Man City striker When my father saw some of the comments on Facebook, he looked at me and said: ""My dear. You have done the right thing. I am glad you have annoyed some of these idiots. Life is short. Enjoy it as much as you can."" My father died of cancer earlier this year. In him, I lost someone whose constant support made me into the person that I am today, and I know he will always be with me. Nargis presenting a talk at a Forward Together Afghanistan event Three years ago I tried to open a school for girls in my native village in Ghazni. I talked to my father about it and he said it would be almost impossible because of cultural boundaries, and even boys have difficulties because of the security situation. My father thought giving it a name of a religious madrassa might have improved our chances. In the end I was unable to travel to my native village because it was simply too dangerous. One of my sisters and I still hope to achieve this goal one day. In the meantime, I volunteered for several years for NGOs in that part of the world, working for women's education, health and empowerment. I've also presented talks on a girl's right to go to school, university and to get a job. I've always dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford one day. When I look at international university rankings I always find Oxford in first or second position, and when I compare that with Kabul University I feel a bit sad - although that's not to say I'm not thankful I was able to go. Nargis has given talks on the importance of education I love to read in my spare time - an average of two to three books a week - and Paolo Coelho is my favourite author. In terms of marriage, I would like to choose someone myself and my family have given me permission to marry someone of my own choice. It would be great if I can find someone who has the same qualities as my father. I would want to spend the rest of my life with someone who has a similar attitude - who can support me and stand by my choices. Family is also important - sometimes you marry the best man out there but then you cannot adapt to his family. They will have to support me in what I want to do in my life. If they resist then I will try and change their minds. I believe in what I want to achieve in life and will not compromise.

"Beijing will ""reduce and remove"" the 40% tariffs it places on US cars imported into China, US President Donald Trump has said. China has declined to confirm President Trump's announcement, which he made on Twitter without providing details. The move, if confirmed, would be welcomed by a car industry unsettled by the escalating US-China trade war. President Trump and Xi Jinping have now agreed to a temporary truce in the bitter dispute. Over dinner at the G20 summit, they agreed to not increase tariffs for 90 daysto allow for talks. Failure to strike a deal would have seen tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods rise from 10% to 25% at the start of next year, and would have opened the way for tariffs on additional Chinese goods. President Trump was in ebullient mood after the developments. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, China's foreign ministry said the presidents of China and the US had instructed their economic teams to ""intensify talks"" towards removing all tariffs following the G20 meeting, However, it did not say if that was a plan with specific goals or something that was merely desirable. Asian markets rallied after news of the trade war truce. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 2.5% and the Shanghai Composite index jumped 2.6%. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1%. The gains spread to Europe, with the UK's FTSE 100 index, the Cac 40 in France and Germany's Dax index all up by about 2%. The trade war has seen the US and China hit each other with escalating tariffs in an attempt to make their domestically made goods more competitive. The US says its tariff policy is a response to China's ""unfair"" trade practices and accuses it of intellectual property theft. Since July, the US has hit China with tariffs on $250bn (Â£195.9bn) worth of goods. China has retaliated with duties on some $110bn of US goods over the same period. Trade war truce: A win for the US or China? US-China trade row: What has happened so far? A quick guide to the US-China trade war As part of this, the US imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese cars, on top of the 2.5% already in place. In July, China, which is the world's largest market for cars, imposed a 40% tariff on US vehicle imports. The rate is much higher than the 15% it places on other trading partners and forced many carmakers to raise prices. In his tweet, President Trump said Beijing had ""agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the US"". He did not provide a new level for the Chinese tariffs, and Beijing did not immediately confirm the statement. In a statement, the White House said US tariffs on Chinese goods would remain unchanged for 90 days, but added: ""If at the end of this period of time, the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent."" The US manufactures cars for export to China, the world's largest car market The US said China agreed to ""purchase a not yet agreed upon, but very substantial, amount of agricultural, energy, industrial, and other products from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries"". Both sides also pledged to ""immediately begin negotiations on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfer, intellectual property protection, non-tariff barriers, cyber intrusions and cyber theft"", according to the White House. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters after the talks that ""the principal agreement has effectively prevented further expansion of economic friction between the two countries"". Yes. The truce prevents raising tariffs as planned on $200bn worth of Chinese goods. But it does not remove tariffs that apply to a total of $250bn of Chinese goods targeted since July. The truce also does not affect the existing duties China has imposed on $110bn of US goods in a tit for tat retaliation. While the result of the G20 meeting was better than expected, it is unclear how the two countries will manage to resolve their underlying differences. ""There should be no wishful thinking that the truce would end the trade war between the world's two largest economies,"" DBS strategist Philip Wee wrote in a research note. Trade wars and protectionism explained He said it ""remains to be seen if real progress could be achieved during this narrow window to resolve the contentious issues, not just on trade, but also intellectual property"". Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics, said while the agreement itself was ""positive"" the next steps remained unclear. ""Whether we will see further de-escalation or whether it is temporary reprieve continues to be very much up to a political decision in Washington DC - that will continue to make this uncertain,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at Oxford Economics said.

"Timur Siraziev's report from outside the Berkshire base was broadcast on Russia's Channel One A Russian TV reporter who sparked a security alert has denied trying to infiltrate a British Army base. Timur Siraziev, of Channel One, was seen outside 77 Brigade's Berkshire base with a camera crew, theMail on Sunday reported,external. It led to an urgent warning at every base in the country not to approach Mr Siraziev if alone, but to contact police, the paper said. The 77 Brigade works in social media and psychological operations. Mr Siraziev told the RIA Novosti news agency the crew had been operating openly, on public land, and ""did not try to penetrate the base"". He said: ""I came to the checkpoint, introduced myself, that I was Timur Siraziev, a journalist for Channel One, said that we wanted to talk."" Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Inside Army 'psy-ops' headquarters The MoD said Mr Siraziev's ""suspicious"" behaviour was monitored by the base's security systems throughout. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson also urged the public to report suspicious activity near military sites. Mr Williamson said: ""We take the security of our bases and personnel incredibly seriously. ""If a member of the public sees anyone acting suspiciously in or around a military base it should be reported to the police as a matter of urgency."" Russia's Channel One later broadcast Mr Siraziev's report, which contained footage apparently filmed from a vehicle as it passed the barracks in Hermitage on 21 November. He is also shown speaking on camera as he walks close to an entrance to the base. The BBC's Russian service said that, in his report, Mr Siraziev claimed that the building of the 77 Brigade was being used to ""attack social networks"" with ""fake news"". With UK-Russian relations frosty in the wake of theSalisbury Novichok poisoning, GCHQ chief Jeremy Fleming warned earlier this year that Moscow posed a ""real"" and ""active"" threat to the international community. Last month, the head of the Army, Gen Mark Carleton-Smith, described Russia as a ""far greater threat"" to UK security than the Islamic State group. Mr Siraziev is listed on the Russian Embassy's website as Channel One's bureau chief. When set up in 2015,77 Brigade was touted as a unitthat would help the UK to fight wars in the ""information age"" by helping to win hearts and minds. It includes both regular troops and reservists. Head of the Army at the time, Gen Sir Nick Carter, said the move was about trying to operate ""smarter"".

The demonstration at the Miss America beauty pageant in New Jersey sparked off the iconic - and mythical - image of the ""bra-burning feminist"".

"Matilde is not married at the moment but she lives with her partner Media strategist Matilde SuescÃºn believes that the fairytale aspiration of a big expensive engagement ring is damaging for women. She believes this fantasy should be stopped, and writes forBBC 100 Womenabout why things need to change. I have been married twice in the past, and may marry again, but I have never had or wanted an engagement ring. I believe engagement rings are anti-feminist. They symbolise an attitude which is in complete antithesis to the idea of an independent woman - signifying that the woman with the ring belongs to another person. They are also a way of signifying status: the bigger the diamond, the greater apparent value they give to the woman wearing it. Why did women only get one day to propose? Do people spend a month's salary on a ring? All of my friends here in the US disagree with me. Most of them have diamond engagement rings, some bigger than others. And they usually show them off on social media and when we meet up and make fun of me. And it's not just my generation who find my ideas odd - my daughter makes fun of me too. She dreams of having a showy engagement ring. I try to understand her because I know it is part of the cultural context in which she was born, but I don't agree at all with that mentality. In fact, the whole ritual of proposing marriage bothers me. The pantomime of a man kneeling down and asking for a woman's hand seems absurd to me. It puts her in a passive role, and asking her in a very public way - such as live on stage or in front of cameras - makes her even more vulnerable.  It really is an eccentric act. Marrying someone is not just a romantic gesture - it is a mutual agreement. It has economic and legal implications. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre. One of our projects this year is the Freedom Trash Can. In 1968 feminist protestors encouraged women to throw their ""items of oppression"" in the bin, so we'll be asking our audiences what they would throw away as women today. If my ex-husbands had proposed I would have started laughing. But it never happened because it was more of a conversation - it was a mutual decision in both cases. Although women can of course take the lead and propose marriage themselves,it still rarely happens that way,external. Matilde was born in Colombia, where she says the culture is different I am concerned that society and the media seems to educate girls to dream, from when they are young, about the man who, to quote Beyonce, will ""Put a ring on it"". And those girls then grow up with this idea that married life will then solve all their problems. Instead of just aspiring to marriage and a ring, I think girls should aspire to be independent, to study and develop, to seek happiness for themselves. When I wrote something similar in my blog for El Tiempo, a newspaper in my native Colombia, readers called me a radical feminist and accused me of killing romance. But that is not true - I am a very romantic person. What I don't find romantic at all is waiting for a ""brave prince"" to come into my life with a ring. What I actually do find romantic is the idea that if I do get married at my age, it's simply a reflection of a profound commitment of loyalty and love to the other person.

"Caroline Nokes, immigration minister, said deportees can ring the Windrush helpline or visit the government website Campaigners have accused the Home Office of a lack of ""decency"" after it emerged dozens of people deported to Commonwealth countries have not been contacted by the Windrush task force. Ministers said ""no specific attempt"" had been made to approach 49 people deported to Ghana and Nigeria in 2017. The Home Office says it is up to Commonwealth citizens to seek information about their status. MPs said it showed the government had learned nothing from the scandal. TheWindrush scandalwas uncovered earlier this year, after many people from Commonwealth countries who had legally lived in Britain for decades were wrongly classed as illegal immigrants and deported. They had been encouraged by the UK government to settle in Britain from the late 1940s until 1973. However, although they had been granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK, some immigrants did not have formal paperwork confirming their residency status. It meant when the Home Office embarked on its so-called ""hostile environment"" policy designed to make staying in the UK more difficult, some Commonwealth immigrants were wrongly deported. Their problems were compounded by a Home Office decision, in 2010, to destroy their landing cards - often the only record of their immigration status. Following a public outcry, the government set up a task force to help people formalise their right to remain in the UK. Thousands of people have now contacted the task force and received documents confirming their right to stay in Britain. Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush scandal: A lawyer's advice for victims Tory calls on Windrush official to resign However, following parliamentary questions from Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, Home Office ministers  now admit there are 49 people who have still not been informed by the government that the task force exists. The 49 were deported to Ghana and Nigeria between March and September 2017 - before the Windrush scandal erupted. Satbir Singh, the chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: ""If the Home Office has the capacity to deny somebody their rights, to separate them from their loved ones and remove them from the country, surely it has the capacity to find them, to apologise and to help them come home. ""But this isn't a question of capacity alone, it's a question of decency, and yet another example of a department going out of its way to avoid doing the right thing. ""As a country surely we can do so much better than this."" Campaigner Zita Holbourne, who founded anti-austerity organisation Black Activists Rising Against Cuts and is the vice president of trade union PCS, called it ""a disgrace"". Ms Lucas, who is MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: ""It doesn't seem much to ask for the government to tell people they've kicked out of the country that the Windrush task force exists. ""Ministers know their treatment of the Windrush generation is a national disgrace. That they haven't bothered to contact people who've been deported suggests the government hasn't learned anything from the public backlash against their hostile environment."" Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said this most recent case showed how ""reckless and incompetent"" the Home Office's immigration policy was. ""People from almost every Commonwealth country have been treated badly under this Government's hostile environment,"" she said. ""It's clear these injustices will continue if ministers don't even know what's going on."" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Ed Davey said anyone who may have been wrongly deported should be contacted and told how to apply to return and receive compensation. ""In these cases, the Home Office seems to be waiting around for people to contact them - even though they may not have the means or information to do so. That's an utter disgrace."" This video can not be played Windrush scandal: A lawyer's advice for victims Home Office minister Ms Nokes, in her written ministerial answer to Ms Lucas' question, said: ""The Home Office has not made a specific attempt to inform those 49 people of the Windrush taskforce. ""The Home Office announcements relating to Commonwealth citizens can be found atwww.gov.uk/windrush.,external ""This website is regularly updated with information about how individuals who believe they qualify under the Windrush criteria can apply for status under the Windrush Settlement Scheme. ""Assistance is also available through the Windrush Taskforce helpline on freephone 0800678 1925 or by email at commonwealthtaskforce@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""Any individual who believes they are protected under the provisions of the 1971 Immigration Act is able to contact the Windrush Taskforce, who will help to identify their current status. ""We have always been clear that the Windrush Scheme is not restricted to the Windrush generation or people from the Caribbean, but it is right that applicants for citizenship need to satisfy the good character and residence requirements.""
