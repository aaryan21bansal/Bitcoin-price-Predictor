"Senior figures at Manchester City knew about sexual abuse happening at the club, a victim giving evidence against former football coach Barry Bennell has said in court. Mr Bennell, who worked as a coach for various youth teams, denies sexually abusing 11 boys between 1979 and 1990. He has admitted one count of indecent abuse of the same victim, who played for a junior Manchester City team. The victim told Liverpool Crown Court he wanted the club to apologise. He said in his evidence that he thought chief scout Ken Barnes knew about the alleged abuse. Mr Barnes played for City between 1950 and 1961. He died in 2010. The man, the fifth complainant to give evidence against Mr Bennell in the trial, also named Mike Grimsley, who managed a Manchester City youth team, as another staff member he believed was aware of claims made against Mr Bennell. He claimed he was abused more than 100 times by Mr Bennell, who is now known as Richard Jones, over a period of four years. He said: ""I want an apology off Manchester City and anyone else, if possible,"" adding that he had asked a specialist lawyer to help him investigate the club. When cross-examined by defence lawyer, Eleanor Laws, the man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - denied seeking compensation. ""If you think I am going to put myself through this, talk about being raped over 100 times, put myself through two-and-a-half years of this for damages, you are wrong,"" he said. He also denied speaking to other alleged victims about seeking compensation, saying they spoke to each other for support. ""It's almost like a suicide watch,"" he added. Ms Laws asked the alleged victim if he had called an NSPCC helpline, set up in November 2016, to tell them Dario Gradi, former manager of Crewe Alexandra where Mr Bennell was a coach, had been aware of the abuse. He told the court that he could not recall doing so. A further witness giving evidence in the trial, who also cannot be named, said he knew of four people who had worked with Mr Bennell who then went on to take their own lives. He added: ""Whether they have taken their lives due to Barry solely I don't know but all I know is how it's had an impact on me and how it could impact on other people."" He said one of the four people who had taken their own lives was Gary Speed, the former Wales manager who hanged himself in 2011. He said he had tried to contact Mr Speed's parents, because he had read in a newspaper that they had not been able to get closure because they had no explanation for his death. Mr Bennell is appearing in court via videolink due to illness. The trial is expected to last eight weeks.

"The body of Megan Bills was found 18 days after she was seen on CCTV entering Ashley Foster's room A man who strangled a 17-year-old girl and hid her body in a clingfilm-wrapped wardrobe, hours after meeting her, has been jailed for her murder. Ashley Foster, 24, used his shirt to strangle Megan Bills and left her body to decompose for 18 days at an ex-offenders' hostel in the West Midlands. The judge said Foster's conduct after the killing was ""beyond belief"". Foster was given a life sentence and ordered to serve at least 26 years behind bars. Midlands Live: GP guilty of sex assault; young children found alone in street During the trial, he admitted preventing Megan's lawful burial but denied murder. Foster came to the hostel, which provides housing for former offenders, three days after being released from prison for battery and witness intimidation. Megan's body was foundwrapped in a curtain inside the wardrobe by hostel staff after reports of a smelland was identified through dental records. Jurors deliberated for six hours before finding Ashley Foster guilty of murder Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how Foster told his mother in a letter that he had concealed the teenager's body after accidentally throttling her during consensual sex. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said Foster had ""seemed his normal self"" as he enjoyed a roast dinner in the aftermath of the murder and said he had smirked at a relative when asked why he needed to buy clingfilm. Judge James Burbidge QC said after the killing, Foster had celebrated his birthday as normal and boasted about his sex life. He said: ""Megan was vulnerable. Instead of acting in a compassionate, human and decent manner, you not only failed to ring the authorities, you bundled her body in a curtain or bedding and then placed her body in a wardrobe. ""You left her body there to be discovered by others. That in itself is shocking."" This video can not be played CCTV footage shows Ashley Foster and Megan Bills going into a local shop Megan was placed into foster care aged four and found a home with her adoptive parents aged seven. Her parents said she had gone through a ""turbulent"" period and had left the family home before her murder but was in the process of returning. In a statement, Megan's family paid tribute to the teenager, who they described as ""bubbly, caring and lively"". They said her death was ""painful beyond words"" and her murder ""demonstrates an evil cruelty beyond any decent comprehension"". Megan Bills was described by her family as ""bubbly, caring and lively"" Anjuli Shergill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Foster had deliberately hidden Megan's body for weeks, ""so that forensic evidence would be destroyed"". ""Foster took Megan's life for his own sexual gratification. He continued with his life as if nothing had happened."" Det Insp Caroline Corfield, from West Midlands Police, said: ""[Megan] was a vulnerable young lady who would never have imagined the dangerous lair she was walking into when she entered Foster's room. ""Foster had an unnatural obsession with deviant sexual activity and he disposed of Megan's young life to satisfy his own twisted desires.""

"The ""reunited"" flag symbolises aspirations in both the North and South to end the nearly seven decades of division North and South Korea have agreed to march together under a single ""unified Korea"" flag at next month's Winter Olympics in the South. They also agreed to field a joint women's ice hockey team in rare talks at the truce village of Panmunjom. These are the first high-level talks between the countries in more than two years. It marks a thaw in relations that began in the new year when North Korea offered to send a team to the games. The games will take place between 9 and 25 February in Pyeongchang in South Korea. If the plans are realised, a hundreds-strong North Korean delegation - including 230 cheerleaders, 140 orchestral musicians and 30 taekwondo athletes - could cross into the South via the land border to attend the Winter Olympics. It will mean the opening of the cross border road for the first time in almost two years. The two countries have also agreed to field a joint team for the sport of women's ice hockey. It would be the first time athletes from both Koreas have competed together in the same team at an Olympic Games. The North has also agreed to send a smaller, 150-member delegation to the Paralympics in March. The agreement will have to be approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday, because North Korea has missed registration deadlines or failed to qualify. South Korea will also need to find ways to host the North Korean delegation without violating UN Security Council sanctions outlawing cash transfers to Pyongyang and blacklisting certain senior North officials. Winter Olympics: How good is North Korea at sport? North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive North Korea crisis in 300 words South Korea's hockey coach and conservative newspapers have expressed concern about the prospect of a united hockey team, saying it could damage South Korea's chances of winning a medal. Tens of thousands of people are said to have signed online petitions urging President Moon Jae-in to scrap the plan. But the liberal leader told South Korean Olympic athletes on Wednesday that the North's participation in the Games would help improve inter-Korean relations. Japan has viewed the latest detente with suspicion, with Foreign Minister Taro Kono saying the world should not be blinded by Pyongyang's recent ""charm offensive"". ""It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,"" Mr Kono said, according to Reuters news agency. ""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working."" North and South met for the first high-level talks in two years - against a backdrop of mounting military tension Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent The Olympic embrace between North and South Korea represents a rare moment of hope in a crisis that at times has appeared to be steadily moving towards another war on the Korean peninsula. But is this a brief respite from the bluster and war-like words exchanged between Pyongyang and President Donald Trump, Seoul's main ally? Or does it really offer a platform for a diplomatic route out of this crisis? The enormity of an armed conflict is clear to all - even President Trump. However, the Olympic detente does not alter the realities of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Both programmes need more testing to demonstrate a true inter-continental capability. And with Mr Trump insisting that this is a capability that the North will not be allowed to obtain, it is hard to see this developing into a Korean spring, let alone a definitive resolution of the nuclear dispute. The talks which resulted in this agreement came after tensions on the Korean peninsula reached their highest point in decades. This is because North Korea has made rapid advances in its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes in recent years. Its latest ballistic missile test, on 28 November, sparked a series of fresh sanctions from the UN targeting petrol shipments and travel. Soon afterwards North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was ""open to dialogue"". In a New Year speech, he said he was considering sending a team to the Winter Olympics. South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome. Then, on 9 January, the two countries made the breakthrough announcement that the North would be sending a delegation. It was also agreed that a military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, would be reinstated. President Moon Jae-in has said the Olympic agreement could pave the way for the nuclear issue to be addressed and lead to dialogue between the North and the US, according to Yonhap news agency in Seoul.

"Bosses and directors of Carillion will not get bonuses or severance payments, the government has said. The Insolvency Service said no such payments had been made since the construction firm collapsed on Monday. The announcement comes as work on Carillion's public sector construction sites is paused pending decisions about their future. However, work on most of its private sector service contracts, such as catering and cleaning, will carry on. Carillion's customers want existing services to continue until new suppliers can be found and will provide funding to retain staff for the moment. Several former executives of the firm would have received pay and benefits this year. Carillion had agreed to keep paying former chief executive Richard Howson a Â£660,000 salary and Â£28,000 in benefits until October as part of his departure deal. Former finance chief Zafar Khan, who left Carillion in September, was due to receive Â£425,000 in base salary for 12 months Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane was due to be paid his Â£750,000 salary until July, despite being due to leave next month. On Wednesday, Business Secretary Greg Clark met representatives of some banks to seek assurances that they would support small businesses affected by the Carillion collapse. Afterwards, he said UK lenders were ready to give ""tailored support"" and flexibility when it came to repayments. About 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector face an uncertain future and are waiting to learn whether they will be able to get hold of money owed to them. HMRCsaid it will also help affected contractors,external, offering them more time to pay tax bills and providing workers with cash support through the tax credits system. Mapping Carillion's biggest construction projects Carillion was left with just Â£29m before going bankrupt 'Sites are silent and virtually deserted' Carillion apprentices among casualties At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the ""wildly excessive"" bonuses paid to Carillion directors. He also accused the government of negligence, saying it awarded contracts to Carillion even when it became clear the company had problems. Mr Corbyn also called on the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services. Mrs May said a third of government contracts with Carillion were agreed by the previous Labour administration, adding she wanted to provide ""good quality public services, delivered at best value to the taxpayer"". Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict Earlier GMB union boss Tim Roache had said the government's response to the Carillion crisis had been ""inadequate and inept"". He said that his union had called on Mr Clark to set up a task force to help private sector companies and employees affected by Carillion's collapse. He called on other private sector companies to take on affected workers without a change in their terms and conditions - a process that he admitted would not be a short one.

He toldBBC 5 live Breakfastthey had withdrawn the cleaner they had working full-time in a local prison. ""We'd been chasing them for money, we hadn't been paid since July and when we heard the rumours about a week-and-a-half ago that Carillion were in a lot of trouble, we really pressed. ""Fortunately for ourselves, we did actually get paid the money that was owed to us for the work that she'd done between August and November. ""We've pulled our cleaner out at the moment and we're just still waiting to hear from them what's happening next before we send her back in again. ""It looks like we are going to lose the December invoice money that we've sent them and obviously the first two weeks of January. ""It's been an ongoing battle since we've been in there to get paid and we're not prepared to take the risk while they're in liquidation. ""Until we see something in black and white saying that, 'Yes, you will get paid on these set terms,' then we will consider sending our cleaner back in again."" Carillion went into liquidation on Monday after rescue talks with its lenders and the government failed to reach a deal. The UK's second-biggest construction company ran into trouble after losing money on big contracts and running up debt of about Â£1.5bn. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, including 20,000 in the UK, and the government has said staff and contractors working on public sector contracts will continue to be paid.

"The NHS is ""haemorrhaging"" nurses with one in 10 now leaving the NHS in England each year, figures show. More than 33,000 walked away last year, piling pressure on understaffed hospitals and community services. The figures - obtained by the BBC from NHS Digital - represent a rise of 20% since 2012-13, and mean there are now more leavers than joiners. Nurse leaders said it was a ""dangerous and downward spiral"", but NHS bosses said the problem was being tackled. Video: How nursing has changed over time Jobs you never knew nurses did The figures have been compiled as part of an in-depth look at nursing by the BBC. We can reveal: More than 10% of the nursing workforce have left NHS employment in each of the past three years The number of leavers would be enough to staff more than 20 average-sized hospital trusts More than half of those who walked away in the last year were under the age of 40 Leavers outnumbered joiners by 3,000 last year, the biggest gap over the five-year period examined by the BBC Brexit may have had an impact. Since the referendum the NHS has gone from EU joiners outnumbering leavers to the reverse - more leavers than joiners Nurses are being pulled off research work, special projects and admin roles to plug the gaps Other parts of the UK are also experiencing problems retaining nurses. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, the leaver rates are rising. In the most recent years, 7.5% of nurses left NHS employment in Northern Ireland and 7.2% did so in Scotland. But in both nations, the number of joiners outnumbered leavers. In Wales there were more leavers than joiners, according to Freedom of Information reports. This video can not be played Mary Trevelyan quit the NHS two-and-a-half years after graduating One of the nurses who has left the NHS is Mary Trevelyan. She was working as a staff nurse in a London hospital, but quit last year after the pressures of the job left her stressed and depressed. She had only worked in the NHS for two-and-a-half years. ""I want to be a great nurse and I want to give my patients my best, but I feel that I can't do that at the moment because we're just too short-staffed, too busy, there are far too many things for us to be doing. ""I want to work for the NHS, it's such a brilliant thing, [but] I don't think I can."" She is now living with her family in Cornwall. She says she has not decided what to do next, but is considering moving abroad. ""A few of my friends have gone. I think they've just got a better quality of life nursing overseas, which is very sad."" The figures do not show where these nurses went, although the BBC has been told the private sector, including agencies, drug firms and hospitals, is particularly popular. But the figures will also include those moving abroad or leaving nursing altogether to pursue other careers. A fifth of leavers in the past year were over 55 - the age at which nurses can start retiring on a full pension. Royal College of Nursing head Janet Davies said: ""The government must lift the NHS out of this dangerous and downward spiral. ""We are haemorrhaging nurses at precisely the time when demand has never been higher. ""The next generation of British nurses aren't coming through just as the most experienced nurses are becoming demoralised and leaving."" She said nurses needed a pay rise and more support if the vacancy rate - currently running at one in nine posts - was not to increase further. ""Most patient care is given by NHS nurses and each time the strain ratchets up again they are the ones who bear the brunt of it,"" she added. It also says more must be done to support younger nurses at the start of their careers. The chief nursing officer for England, professor Jane Cummings, admitted there was a problem - but said changes were being made to highlight the value of the NHS to new talent and retain current staff. ""We do lose people that need to be encouraged. We're in the process of bringing in lots of nurse ambassadors that are going to be able to talk about what a great role it is, to be able to tell their story, so we can really encourage people to enter the profession and for those in the profession, to stay in it,"" she said. The regulator, NHS Improvement, is rolling out a retention programme to help the health service reduce the number of leavers. More than half of hospitals and all mental health trusts are getting direct support. Master classes are also being organised for all directors of nursing and HR leads. The support is prompting hospitals to adopt a range of initiatives. Some have introduced internal ""transfer"" systems, allowing nurses to move jobs more easily, and mentoring schemes have been started for newly qualified nurses, while in some places, staff can ask for ""itchy feet"" interviews where they get the opportunity to talk to bosses about why they might leave. Others have introduced staff awards and worked with local businesses to offer workers discounts and benefits at shops and gyms. England's chief nurse Prof Jane Cummings acknowledged there was a ""workforce problem"" and it was becoming more of a challenge retaining nurses. But she said the NHS was learning by making nursing more attractive. ""We are beginning to see some fantastic good practice giving people flexible, rewarding careers. The key is getting it everywhere."" She also said in the future the number of joiners should rise. The government is increasing the number of nurse training places by 5,000 this year - a rise of 25%. But it will be three years before these nurses graduate. The Department of Health and Social Care in England has been quick to point out that the number of nurses employed by the NHS has risen. They have picked May 2010 - the point when the coalition government was formed - as the starting point, claiming there are ""11,700 more nurses on our wards"". That relates to the rise in hospital nurses - up from 162,500 full-time equivalents. But if you look at the entire nursing workforce, the numbers have only risen by just under 3,000 to 283,853 on the latest count - a rise of 1%. The population will have grown by 5% during this period, according to the Office for National Statistics. And if you look at nearly any measure of NHS demand - from GP referrals and diagnostic tests to emergency admissions and A&E visits - the increase is somewhere between 10% and 20%. What is more, if you take the last 12 months, the number of nurses has started falling and the number of vacant posts is rising. Even taking into account the rising number of nurses in training, the health service will only be able to ensure it has enough nurses by tackling retention.

"The Queen was given a Christmas decoration containing Enigma machine paper to mark her visit to the National Cyber Security Centre Glitterballs and lollipops were among the gifts given to members of the Royal Family last year, the Palace has revealed. Other presents included a falcon hood, and a union jack worn on the spacesuit of British astronaut Major Tim Peake. The gifts were,externalpresented by, among others, the King and Queen of Spain and the Sultan of Brunei. Rules state that gifts can be used but belong to the nation rather than being the personal property of the recipient. Food presents can be eaten and perishable items worth less than Â£150 can be given to charity or staff. The Queen received Christmas decorations including glitterballs and an ornament containing paper from the World War Two code-breaking Enigma machine. British astronaut Major Tim Peake presented the Queen with the flag from his spacesuit. The Duke of Edinburgh was given a traditional Spanish cloak complete with standing collar, crimson velvet lining and a silver Salamanca-style clasp by the King and Queen of Spain. Major Tim Peake gave the Queen the Union flag worn on his spacesuit With Prince George and Princess Charlotte starting school and nursery in the past few months, their parents  may have been pleased with the collection of educational flashcards received. Not all presents were as instructive. During a visit to Poland and Germany the princess and her brother Prince George received 59 presents including a toy pram, a waistcoat and, from the mayor of Gdansk, two lollipops. In Antigua and Barbuda the Prince of Wales was presented with 12 bottles of hot sauce and a steel drum. The Sultan of Brunei gifted the Duchess of Cornwall a handbag and in India she received, among other presents, a USB stick. Prince Harry and his fiancee Meghan Markle were given two jackets, two leather holdall bags, two leather belt-bags, two zipped pouches, two passport holders and two baseball caps. Prince George and Princess Charlotte joined their parents on a visit to Poland and Germany Horse ornaments and pet food products were among the Princess Royal's gifts. Princess Anne was also sent a falcon hood. The rules on presents received by the Royal Family were tightened following the Peat Inquiry in 2003. The inquiry was set up, following the collapse of the Paul Burrell trial, to look at allegations of misconduct in the royal household. Sir Michael Peat found that some gifts had been sold and that there were no procedures in place as to what should happen to unwanted gifts. It is now made clear that gifts belong to the Royal Collection, held in trust by the Queen for her successors and for the nation as a whole. What do you buy for the Queen?

A crowdfunding page has been set up to raise Â£10,000 towards the legal costs, supported by the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ). The Parole Board has previously said ""correct procedures were followed"". The victim was drugged and sexually assaulted by Worboys in 2007. A second woman involved in the legal challenge says the former black cab driver attacked her in 2003, although her complaints never reached court. Rapist's jail move bid refused in 2015 Why was Worboys released now? A ""letter before claim"", which has been sent to the Parole Board, says Worboys' ""deeply entrenched, deliberate and carefully formulated"" behaviour is unlikely to change. It also questioned why the rapist was denied a move from high-security Category A Wakefield Prison, in West Yorkshire, to a lower security open prison in 2015 but has now been granted parole. The first woman said: ""My heart freezes when I hear his name. He's ruining my life all over again."" The second woman added: ""Since hearing the news I have been in a state of complete shock and panic. I am convinced he will reoffend."" This video can not be played John Worboys' sentence is ""an insult to his victimsâ, says Zac Goldsmith calling on the PM to back a judicial review The letter also asks to push back Worboys' release pending the outcome of legal proceedings. The Â£10,000 will only cover the initial costs of legal proceedings, and the women will raise more if the case develops. Solicitor Harriet Wistrich, who is director of the CWJ, said it would be ""an unprecedented legal challenge"". ""On the basis of all the known facts in this case, the decision to release Worboys appears to be so irrational,"" she added. ""If we get access to the reasons then we can explore grounds for challenging a decision which has caused so much alarm and is horrific for all the victims concerned."" Worboys drugged and assaulted women in his black cab Worboys, 60, was given an indefinite sentence and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail in 2009. Altogether, he has spent 10 years in custody including a period on remand. Justice Secretary David Gauke has asked for legal adviceon whether November's decision to free Worboys can be contested in a judicial review. If a judge finds the Parole Board did not follow the correct process or reached its decision on the wrong basis, the move would be quashed and Worboys would have to make a fresh application for parole. The Parole Board has previously said it was ""confident"" Worboys would not reoffend.

"A future generation of MPs will seek to ""improve or undo"" Brexit if it does not work for young people, a former cabinet minister has said. Justine Greening - who quit as education secretary in last week's reshuffle - said MPs had a duty to make sure Brexit was ""sustainable"". She was speaking as the Commons debated the government's EU (Withdrawal) Bill. MPs have now voted to back the bill which means it moves to the House of Lords. Tusk: UK can still change its mind EU bill 'an assault on devolution' Ms Greening resigned from government last week after refusing the move from education to the Department for Work and Pensions she was offered by Prime Minister Theresa May. Speaking for the first time from the backbenches, the Putney MP said: ""I represent a very young constituency here in London. ""The bottom line is that looking ahead, if Brexit doesn't work for young people in our country in the end it will not be sustainable. ""When they take their place here they will seek to improve or undo what we've done and make it work for them. ""So we do absolutely have a duty in this House to look ahead and ensure that whatever we get is sustainable and works for them."" Asked about Ms Greening's comment, Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister is clear that she is determined to deliver a Brexit which works for all sections of society. Of course that would include young people."" The draft EU bill has already been the subject of highly charged debate in the Commons, facing hundreds of attempts to change its wording and suffering one government defeat. Ministers were not expected to lose Wednesday evening's third reading vote, and it passed by 324 votes to 295. But there have been warnings of trouble further ahead when the House of Lords takes over. The government can seek to overturn any changes inflicted by the Lords. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is a key part of the government's Brexit strategy. It aims to end the supremacy of EU law, which would be copied into UK law in order to ensure a smooth transition on Brexit day. Much has been said about Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, under which the UK gave formal notice of Brexit in March. But now the head of the European Commission has said the UK could always reapply to join - using Article 49. Article 49 sets out the procedure for new countries wanting to join the EU. On Tuesday EU Council chief Donald Tusk suggested the UK would be welcome to stay in the EU if it changed its mind about leaving - comments that were dismissed by Brexit campaigners. Speaking at the European Parliament on Wednesday, Mr Juncker said: ""We are not throwing the British out, we would like the British to stay, and if they so wish, they should be allowed to do so. ""In London, there was a rather irritated response to this proposal (to stay in the EU), but note that even if the British leave according to Article 50 then Article 49 would allow them to accede again and I would be happy to facilitate that.""

"Mo Ahmed was given a suspended sentence at Exeter Crown Court A jealous husband phoned false bomb alerts into a Wetherspoon pub to try and stop his wife having a night out, a court has heard. The Duke of Wellington in Minehead, Somerset, was forced to close early on 25 November, losing Â£840 in takings. Mo Ahmed, 42, admitted making two hoax calls and was given a suspended sentence at Exeter Crown Court. The court heard he was angry she was going out while he worked two jobs to make ends meet. More Devon and Cornwall stories here The couple had opened a gift shop in August but by November it was only taking about Â£20 a day, a probation report said. Ahmed, of The Parade, Minehead, had taken a second job at a restaurant in Tiverton, Devon, to pay the rent and bills and was upset when he learned his partner was going out to the pub at midnight. Police evacuated 25 overnight guests and 130 bar customers at 01:00 (GMT). The probation report said: ""He felt annoyed she was spending money while he was having to work away to pay the bills. When he learned she was going to Wetherspoons, he was angry and frustrated and wanted to ruin her night. ""He did not consider the effect it would have on the pub or the emergency services."" Ahmed was sentenced to six months imprisonment, suspended for a year; ordered to pay Â£840 compensation and to do 120 hours unpaid community work. Judge Geoffrey Mercer told him: ""These calls were bound to be traced because they were made from your own mobile phone. I am told you are thoroughly ashamed and so you should be. ""It was a bizarre way of thinking. It was an extraordinary thing to do.""

"A satellite image shows half the UK under snow and cloud Drivers have been urged to stay off major roads unless absolutely necessary as a new snow storm approaches southern Scotland and northern England. A Met Office amber ""be prepared"" alert is now in place from 21:00 on Wednesday until 05:00 on Thursday. Scotland's Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said the authorities would be ""tested to our limit"". An estimated 40,000 children missed classes as about 300 schools were shut across Scotland on Wednesday. This video can not be played ""We were on the road for 12 hours"" The travel warning came after hundreds of drivers were stranded on Tuesday night on the main route between Scotland and England. Many drivers were stuck for up to 11 hours on the M74 in South Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway after HGVs blocked the lanes. More of your photos of snow from around Scotland Pictures of animals in the Scottish snow Snow roller - nature's own snowball Snow disruption in Northern Ireland Runaway lorry slides down icy street How cold is it where you are? Have you seen Sir Andy Flurry? Mountain rescue teams were sent to help drivers trapped in cars at Millbank and Beattock, checking they were warm and had adequate supplies. Elsewhere,a lorry rolled down a hill in North Lanarkshire, smashing into other vehicles and a fence,after two workmen got out to help clear the road. No-one was injured. This video can not be played A runaway lorry ploughed into cars before crashing on a snowy street. In a statement in the Scottish Parliament Mr Yousaf apologised to anyone who had been stuck on the M74 but said it was as a result of ""extremely challenging conditions"", with persistent snow at a level that had not been seen for a number of years. He also announced that police were upgrading their travel warning from level three to level four. ""That in practice means that all travel should be avoided on those parts of the trunk road affected by the amber warning, namely south and south-west Scotland for the duration of the amber warning,"" he said. Stein Connolly from Traffic Scotland said the evening commute began relatively smoothly on Wednesday. He told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive programme: ""The M74 is black, it's running OK. You can see quite a substantial snowfall on the fields next to the 74 and even along the centre but the actual road is clear right now."" He said he believed the level four ""do not travel"" warning had only been issued once before, in the high winds of January 2013. ""We really hope that after last night people do listen to us. Avoid the area. We don't want a repeat of last night. ""If you do go out there, you're putting yourself at risk and other people at risk."" Travel conditions are graded at four levels by police and transport officials depending on the severity of the weather. Level 1:Normaloperations - no severe weather. Level 2: Travel withcaution- police advise people that conditions for road travel may be hazardous. Level 3:High riskof disruption for road journeys - police advise that there is a high risk of disruption for road journeys. Travellers are likely to experience significant delays. Level 4:Avoidtravelling on the roads - journeys should be avoided. Severe delays expected. The Met Office has predicted persistent heavy snow, with travel delays likely on roads and a risk that some vehicles and passengers could become stranded. Delays or cancellations are likely to rail and air travel. Some rural communities are likely to become cut off and power cuts are ""probable"". Less severe yellow warnings remain in place with snow and ice forecast until Friday evening, with Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England likely to be affected. The amber warning extends until 05:00 on Thursday On Wednesday, thousands of pupils missed lessons as about 300 Scottish schools or nurseries were shut or partially closed as a result of the weather. Scottish Borders Council said no schools would open in its area on Wednesday or Thursday, with 15,000 pupils missing lessons and 26 schools were also shut in Dumfries and Galloway, affecting 4,000 students. In the Highland Council area, nearly 150 schools and nurseries were shut or partially closed, affecting 15,000 pupils. Nearly 30 schools and nurseries were closed in South Lanarkshire and there are also a number of schools shut in East Ayrshire, Stirling, Falkirk and Perth and Kinross. This video can not be played Video released by a Dumfries and Galloway rescue team shows difficult driving conditions Overnight travel on the M74 was particularly difficult around junction 12 in South Lanarkshire southbound and between junctions 14 and 15 northbound. One driver stuck on the northbound carriageway of the M74, Fergus McCann, said the impatience of other drivers had made things worse. He told the BBC: ""There's been a fair bit of impatient driving going on. ""People are in one queue, then people are cutting out and trying to go down lanes that clearly are not for driving on. ""It's not a surprise that you're getting a few hundred yards down the road and you're seeing them facing the wrong way."" Steve Harris became stranded on the M74 at 17:30 GMT and was still stuck between junctions 11 and 12 more than eight hours later. ""I've not moved really in the last four hours,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live at about 03:00 GMT. ""I've managed to get out of my car a couple of times to stretch my legs. The snow is probably between four and six inches deep around the cars.""

"Chrissy Chambers, seen on the left, makes YouTube music and comedy videos with her fiancee Bria Kam A US YouTube personality has been awarded damages from a British ex-boyfriend who posted videos onto the internet of them having sex. Chrissy Chambersbecame a leading ""revenge porn"",externalcampaigner after she was alerted to the clips. The High Court in London heard that the accused - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had accepted liability for his unlawful activity. He also agreed to pay an undisclosed sum as well as to cover legal costs. Ms Chambers' lawyers have described the sum as ""substantial"". ""[This] should serve as a severe warning to those who seek to extort and harm with revenge porn: you cannot do this with impunity, and you will be held accountable for your actions,"" said Ms Chambers following the case. ""To every victim of this insidious kind of attack, I am here to say: You can fight back, and win. You will heal and move on - and you will not have to take those steps alone."" The singer and comedian celebrated her successful civil claim by proposing to her girlfriend and YouTube co-star, Bria Kam, on the steps of the court. Ms Kam said yes. England and Wales made ""revenge porn"" a criminal offence in 2015, but Ms Chambers said she had been unable to take advantage of this as the law does not apply retrospectively.

Some of the clips' titles contained Ms Chambers' name and her age at the time, which was 18. Ms Chambers, who is now 26, said that she had not been aware that she was being filmed at the time, and only learned of the videos' existence in June 2013, 19 months after they had been posted. Since the accused owned the copyright to the clips, Ms Chambers said she was unable to force the site to remove them. She said they had been copied and shared to dozens more sites since.

"Celine Dookhran was found dead in an empty house in Kingston Upon Thames A builder kidnapped, raped and cut the throats of two women before putting one of their bodies in a deep freezer, a court has heard. Mujahid Arshid, 33, is charged with the rape and murder of 20-year-old Celine Dookhran. She was found on 19 July last year in an empty house in Kingston, south London. He is also accused of the rape and attempted murder of a woman in her 20s who cannot be identified. Mr Arshid and co-defendant Vincent Tappu are jointly charged with the kidnap of Ms Dookhran and the second woman, conspiracy to falsely imprison both women, and possessing a firearm with intent, namely a Taser. They deny the charges. Mujahid Arshid (left) and Vincent Tappu are charged with the kidnap of Ms Dookhran and the second woman Crispin Aylett QC, opening the case, told jurors the evidence was ""simply horrific"" and ""you will have to steel yourselves for what is to come"". The Old Bailey heard that Mr Arshid was obsessed with his niece Ms Dookhran, who worked in a bank. He had spent weeks planning to abduct and kill both women in a plot that was as ""bizarre as it is terrible"", Mr Aylett said. ""To that end he considered either putting them in acid or else concealing them in a deep freezer."" The court heard there had been unhappiness in Ms Dookhran's family about a relationship she was in and that she had been staying at a property occupied by Mr Arshid after leaving home. The evening before the murder there had been a family meeting attended by Mr Arshid during which pressure was placed on Ms Dookhran and her boyfriend to end their association, jurors heard. The next morning - 19 July - Mr Arshid took advantage of the ""uncertainty surrounding Celine's position"" in order to kidnap her, the jury was told. It is alleged that the balaclava-clad defendants, wielding a Taser, kidnapped the women after stuffing socks in their mouths and wrapping them in dustsheets. The women were put in the boot of a vehicle and driven to an empty six-bedroom house to which Mr Arshid had access in his capacity as a builder, the court heard. The women were put in the boot of a vehicle and driven to an empty six-bedroom house in Kingston The court heard Mr Tappu, 28, of Spencer Road, Acton, west London, was recruited by Mr Arshid to help abduct the pair and his alleged involvement ended during the journey to Kingston. Jurors were told that Mr Arshid raped both women at the property before cutting Ms Dookhran's throat and putting her body in a deep freezer he had installed two days earlier. He also cut the second woman's throat, but she managed to escape death and raise the alarm by persuading him they could be together, the court heard. According to the account of the surviving victim, Mr Arshid raped Ms Dookhran and then ordered her to climb into the freezer, but changed his mind and let her out. ""If he had originally intended to leave Celine to freeze to death, he must now have decided that he would have to kill her with the knife and then, only once she was dead, put her body in the freezer"", Mr Aylett said. Mr Arshid (right) abandoned his car at a nearby railway station and was later arrested in a hotel in Folkestone, Kent Later, the woman said she heard more screams as Mr Arshid allegedly killed Ms Dookhran. The woman refused to get into the freezer as well, and Mr Arshid allegedly told her: ""I'm this close to slitting your wrist and getting this rope and tying it round your neck and just killing you here right now."" The court heard he went on to cut the woman's neck, chest and stomach and bang her head against the floor before sexually assaulting her. As she tried to talk him around, the defendant described himself as a ""nasty, horrible, evil person"", the jury were told. The defendant abandoned his car at a nearby railway station and was later arrested in a hotel in Folkestone, Kent. Mr Arshid, of no fixed address, is further charged with sexual assault and assault by penetration against the second female between 2008 and 2010. The trial continues.

"The Bayeux Tapestry is 70m (230ft) long The Bayeux Tapestry is set to be displayed in the UK after France agreed it could leave its shores for the first time in 950 years, the BBC understands. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce the loan during his visit to the UK on Thursday. He has said the tapestry - which depicts the Norman Conquest of England - would not be transferred before 2020. The Times said the loan was subject to the outcome of tests,externalto make sure the 11th Century artwork was safe to move. The tapestry tells the story of the future William I's conquest of England, culminating in the Battle of Hastings and the defeat of Harold in 1066. Bayeux Tapestry gets new ending The end of Saxon-ruled England The tapestry reimagined It is on permanent display at a museum in the town of Bayeux, in Normandy, and has very rarely been moved. However, President Macron is expected to announce the proposed loan at a meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May in the UK this week. The Times said the agreement was made after ""months of talks between culture department officials in London and Paris"" but it has not yet been decided where in the UK the tapestry will be displayed. Historians have long debated the origins of the tapestry, which is 70m (230ft) long and 50cm high. The earliest written reference to it is an inventory from Bayeux Cathedral in 1476, but little is known about how or why it was created. According to Reading Museum, which houses a replica of the tapestry,,externalit was ""probably commissioned"" in the 1070s by the half-brother of William the Conqueror - the Bishop Odo of Bayeux. Some say it was created by teams of nuns across England - not France - possibly in Canterbury, Kent. In 2012,a PhD researcher at the University of Manchestersaid the artwork's needlework was ""consistent throughout"", suggesting one group of specialist embroiderers worked on it, in the same place at the same time. The tapestry shows the events leading up to the Norman takeover of England. It starts with Edward the Confessor, who became king in 1042, on the throne and tells the story of his death and the questions over who was the rightful heir. In 1066, on the day of Edward's funeral, his brother-in-law Harold was crowned king. News of his appointment reached France and William of Normandy, who claimed he should be king as Edward had promised him the throne of England. Harold is crowned king after the death of Edward the Confessor On 14 October 1066, William I and King Harold II came to loggerheads at the Battle of Hastings - one of the most famous battles in English history. It is likely both sides had between 5,000 and 7,000 men each when they met in battle at a hilltop near Hastings. Thousands of soldiers were killed in a day of a fighting, which ended in King Harold II's death. It was a turning point in history as it ended the Anglo-Saxons's long reign of more than 600 years. When you can (and can't) eat carbs for dinner Is it time to stop hating the rat? 'Superheroes don't work 90-hour weeks' The tapestry shows a soldier being killed by an arrow in his eye, which could be King Harold Napoleon put the tapestry on display in Paris in 1804, while he was planning an invasion of England. It was then exhibited in Paris for the second time in 1944, during World War II, before it was returned to Bayeux. Mr Macron's offer comes after previous attempts to bring the tapestry to Britain failed. One request is thought to have been made ahead of the Queen's Coronation in 1953, while another was made for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings, in 1966. Some have suggested the tapestry could be relocated to the British Museum if it gets the go ahead to come to the UK. Dr Michael Lewis of the museum told the Victoria Derbyshire programme 1066 was a date ""we all know"" from being at school so it would be ""amazing"" if children could go and see the tapestry. ""For the wider public, people will be amazed about how long it is, and it definitely has a real impact when you see this work of art,"" he added. Tests will decide if the tapestry can be moved safely and get to the UK in one piece. BBC History magazine's Dr David Musgrove says its size, age and obvious fragility makes moving it a concern. But he told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme moving it would also present an opportunity to conduct some interesting historical research on its dyes and fabrics. Allow Twitter content?

The story that Harold was killed by an arrow in the eye is thought to have come from the tapestry. However, earlier sources dispute this and claim he was hacked to death by four Norman knights. Dr Levi Roach, a medieval historian at the University of Exeter, said the tapestry was confiscated for military use, for covering weapons, during the French Revolution, before a lawyer saved it. Tom Tugenhadt, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said the UK should ""definitely"" consider it. ""This is an opportunity for us to cement the relationship,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""One of the interesting items we might perhaps think about lending... is the Rosetta stone, which was discovered in Egypt."" According to the British Museum, it is likely that the stone was found by Napoleon Bonaparte's soldiers,externalwhile on a mission to threaten Britain's hold on India.

"This video can not be played Dylan Farrow: ""Why shouldn't I want to bring him down?"" Dylan Farrow says she feels ""outrage"" after ""years of being ignored, disbelieved and tossed aside"". Woody Allen's adopted daughter has appeared on CBS This Morning to talk about her sexual assault claim against the director. In what is her first TV interview, Farrow says she is ""hurt"" and ""angry"". The 32-year-old has repeatedly accused Allen of molesting her when she was seven - claims the director has always denied. Farrow expressed anger at the suggestion she was simply caught up in the Hollywood#metoocampaign, saying: ""Why shouldn't I want to bring him down? Why shouldn't I be angry? Why shouldn't I be hurt? ""Why shouldn't I feel some sort of outrage... after all these years of being ignored, disbelieved and tossed aside?"" The excerpt, in which Farrow was visibly emotional, was a preview of a longer interview, which will be aired on Thursday. Farrow, now 32, was adopted by Mia Farrow when she was two weeks old The interview was filmed on Monday at Farrow's home in Bridgewater, Connecticut. Farrow discussed why it was the right time for her to do a television interview after years of claiming Allen had abused her. ""All I can do is speak my truth and hope - hope that somebody will believe me rather than just hearing,"" she said. Allen was investigated over a 1992 claim by Farrow that he sexually assaulted her at the family's Connecticut home. Prosecutors did not charge the film-maker and he has always denied the allegations, which he claims had been fabricated by his former partner Mia Farrow. In 2014, Dylan Farrow wrote an open letter alleging she had been molested by Allen - but he responded to the claims calling them ""untrue and disgraceful"". More recently, in a series of tweets posted ahead of last week's Golden Globes award ceremony, Dylan Farrow reiterated her claims that Allen was a ""predator"". Chalamet said he would donate his salary to charities including Time's Up A number of actors have distanced themselves from Allen as Hollywood's sexual harassment scandal continues. They include Timothee Chalamet,who announced this weekhe will give his salary for appearing in Allen's next film, A Rainy Day in New York, to charity. Chalamet claimed: ""I don't want to profit from my work on the film."" His co-star, Rebecca Hall, also donated her fee to charity and said she ""regretted"" her decision to appear in the film. However, Alec Baldwin, who worked with Allen on Alice, Blue Jasmine and To Rome With Love, said the ""renunciation of him and his work"" was ""unfair and sad"". ""Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states"" - New York and Connecticut - ""and no charges were filed,""he tweeted on Tuesday.,external Sexual misconduct in the film industry has been a hot topic since last October, when a number of women came forward to accuse producer Harvey Weinstein of harassment and rape.

"Arthur Collins admitted one charge of possessing a prohibited item while in prison A man jailed for throwing acid across a packed nightclub has been sentenced to a further eight months for using a smuggled mobile phone while in prison. Arthur Collins, 25, hid the Nokia phone in a crutch and used it to call his reality TV star ex-girlfriend Ferne McCann from his cell at HMP Thameside. He was handed the eight-month sentence at Woolwich Crown Court on Wednesday. Collins injured 22 people by throwing acid across a London nightclub and was jailed for 20 years in December. Later that month, he admitted one charge of possessing a prohibited item while in prison. The eight-month prison term, consecutive to Collins' current sentence, will add an extra four months on to his earliest release date, meaning he will serve at least 13 years and eight months. Collins hid the phone, two Sim cards and two memory sticks in the crutch while awaiting trial over the acid attack, which left 16 people with chemical burns and three people temporarily blinded. He claimed he had used the device to make private calls to then pregnant Ms McCann, who gave birth to their baby daughter Sunday in November. Arthur Collins (right) previously appeared in court in crutches with co-accused Andre Phoenix who was cleared over the acid attack His barrister Rebecca Randall said: ""His girlfriend at the time was heavily pregnant with his first child. ""That child is now two months old and occasionally visits him with its mother and his sister."" Prosecutor Arizuna Asante told the court that an analysis of the device confirmed Collins used it to contact his family and friends. Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Heathcote Williams said: ""The presence of a mobile phone or component part such as a Sim card has many implications, not only for the prison establishment, but also the wider environment. ""It provides a prisoner or prisoners with an opportunity to communicate they would otherwise not have. ""This therefore allows them to act in a way prison is supposed to prevent them from doing."" The court heard the items were found on 10 September when a prison officer removed the rubber stopper from the bottom of the crutch in his private shower during a cell search. Collins, from Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, was injured trying to evade police while on the run for the acid attack in Mangle E8 in Dalston. He took part in the hearing via video link from the high-security Belmarsh Prison and showed no emotion as he was sentenced.

"The body of Megan Bills was found 18 days after she was seen on CCTV entering Ashley Foster's room A man who strangled a 17-year-old girl and hid her body in a clingfilm-wrapped wardrobe, hours after meeting her, has been jailed for her murder. Ashley Foster, 24, used his shirt to strangle Megan Bills and left her body to decompose for 18 days at an ex-offenders' hostel in the West Midlands. The judge said Foster's conduct after the killing was ""beyond belief"". Foster was given a life sentence and ordered to serve at least 26 years behind bars. Midlands Live: GP guilty of sex assault; young children found alone in street During the trial, he admitted preventing Megan's lawful burial but denied murder. Foster came to the hostel, which provides housing for former offenders, three days after being released from prison for battery and witness intimidation. Megan's body was foundwrapped in a curtain inside the wardrobe by hostel staff after reports of a smelland was identified through dental records. Jurors deliberated for six hours before finding Ashley Foster guilty of murder Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how Foster told his mother in a letter that he had concealed the teenager's body after accidentally throttling her during consensual sex. Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said Foster had ""seemed his normal self"" as he enjoyed a roast dinner in the aftermath of the murder and said he had smirked at a relative when asked why he needed to buy clingfilm. Judge James Burbidge QC said after the killing, Foster had celebrated his birthday as normal and boasted about his sex life. He said: ""Megan was vulnerable. Instead of acting in a compassionate, human and decent manner, you not only failed to ring the authorities, you bundled her body in a curtain or bedding and then placed her body in a wardrobe. ""You left her body there to be discovered by others. That in itself is shocking."" This video can not be played CCTV footage shows Ashley Foster and Megan Bills going into a local shop Megan was placed into foster care aged four and found a home with her adoptive parents aged seven. Her parents said she had gone through a ""turbulent"" period and had left the family home before her murder but was in the process of returning. In a statement, Megan's family paid tribute to the teenager, who they described as ""bubbly, caring and lively"". They said her death was ""painful beyond words"" and her murder ""demonstrates an evil cruelty beyond any decent comprehension"". Megan Bills was described by her family as ""bubbly, caring and lively"" Anjuli Shergill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said Foster had deliberately hidden Megan's body for weeks, ""so that forensic evidence would be destroyed"". ""Foster took Megan's life for his own sexual gratification. He continued with his life as if nothing had happened."" Det Insp Caroline Corfield, from West Midlands Police, said: ""[Megan] was a vulnerable young lady who would never have imagined the dangerous lair she was walking into when she entered Foster's room. ""Foster had an unnatural obsession with deviant sexual activity and he disposed of Megan's young life to satisfy his own twisted desires.""

"Ri Se-gwang winning gold for North Korea in the vault at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro For all the buzz and political intrigue, North Korea's participation at next month's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang will live up to the old saying: ""It's the taking part that counts"". Their representation at the Games is still to be confirmed, but may be limited to two figure skaters. Perhaps surprisingly, there are sports North Korea is pretty good at and in some cases even dominates. Take the summer Olympics. They have won far more medals than bigger countries like India and Nigeria - 54 in total. Most of their Olympic glory has come in weightlifting and their athletes hold three world and two Olympic records. At the last summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, they won seven medals, including two golds, putting them about halfway up the table. Ri Kyong-Hyang playing in white for North Korea against South Korea at the Kim Il-Sung stadium in April 2017 North Korea's women's football team is ranked 11th in the world by FIFA. And although they were surprisingly knocked out of qualifying for the 2019 World Cup, they won the East Asia Football Federation Championship in December last year. That success followed winning the under-20s World Cup in 2016. The team's reputation had taken a hit in 2011 after five players tested positive for banned substances. North Korea to send orchestra to Winter Olympics The coach who helped North Korea's skaters qualify for the Olympics North Korea to send team to Winter Olympic Games North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy While the men's football team has only taken part in two World Cups, and is ranked a lowly 126th, they are fondly remembered for a good performance at the 1966 Finals in England, reaching the quarter finals. They put in another good display against Brazil at the 2010 tournament, narrowly losing 2-1, but they also slumped to a 7-0 defeat by Portugal. In their most recent fixture, North Korea drew 1-1 with China under the stewardship of their Norwegian manager Jorn Andersen. Schoolchildren are encouraged to take part in sporting competitions like this tug of war in Pyongyang North Korea is expected to send a taekwondo demonstration team to the Winter Olympics and that is not a surprise because it's a sport where they dominate. Well, at least one branch of it. Unfortunately it's not the branch chosen by the Olympics, or by South Korea, but a version under rules governed by the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF). At a recent major international competition held in Pyongyang, North Korea won 22 gold medals and the next best performing country was Russia, with seven. North Korea have invested heavily in the sport and built two ""majestic"" taekwondo facilities, says long-time ITF member and taekwondo historian George Vitale. A North Korean taekwondo demonstration team are said to be performing at next month's Winter Olympics For taekwondo and other sports, the North Korean government has a system for identifying sporting talent at an early age. Time and money is spent on turning these youngsters into proper athletes and selected children attend special sports schools. Udo Merkel, an expert on sport in North Korea who has visited the facilities there, says despite the general levels of poverty, top-level athletes train in impressive, modern facilities. BBC Sport Winter Olympics news Guide to sports at the 2018 Games Most ordinary North Koreans take part in some sporting or physical activity, which is common in communist countries. Competitions are organised through the military, state organisations or labour unions. In the 1980s, the central government launched public campaigns to train people in defence and combat sports like boxing, taekwondo and rifle marksmanship. The regime thrives, says Michael Madden, founder of the website NK Leadership Watch, when it keeps the population busy with organised activity. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"North Korean cheerleaders at the 2003 World Students Games Sport often brings a certain degree of drama - but perhaps never more so than when it comes to the two rival Koreas. North Korea has agreed to send a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games - after the first high-level talks between the countries in two years. But sport does not always lead to warmer ties. In the past, North Korea has launched deadly attacks on the South during, or in the run up to, major global sporting events being held in South Korea. North Korea crisis in 300 words A history of North Korea at the Olympics Korea talks: Finally, a bit of optimism North Korea boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul In 1987, two North Korean agents planted a bomb on Korean Airlines Flight 858 travelling from Baghdad in Iraq to Seoul, South Korea. During a stopover in Abu Dhabi, they got off. Hours later over the Andaman Sea, the bomb blew up, killing all 115 people on board. At the time, South Korea was preparing to host the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul - and North Korea was determined to stop it. In an interview with BBC, one of the agents, Kim Hyun-hui said: ""I was told by a senior officer that before the Seoul Olympics we would take down a South Korean airliner. ""He said it would create chaos and confusion in South Korea. The mission would strike a severe blow for the revolution."" Families of the victims have demanded the government re-investigate the case The 2002 Fifa World Cup co-hosted by South Korea and Japan was a major turning point for South Korean football. Previously, South Korea had never won a match at the World Cup. But at this tournament, they won against strong teams including Poland, the United States, Portugal, Italy and Spain - and made it to the semi-finals. The 2002 Fifa World Cup was a big moment for South Korea Their sporting success, and photos of South Koreans cheering their team, dressed in red and celebrating in the streets of downtown Seoul, made headlines around the world. But during the third-place play-off match against Turkey, on 29 June, North Korea struck. Pyongyang's patrol boats opened fire on a South Korean navy ship near Yeonpyeong island, after allegedly crossing the Northern Limit Line, a disputed maritime boundary in the Yellow Sea. Six South Koreans died and at least nine were injured in the bloody naval battle. Families of the victims pay tribute last year, making the 15th anniversary of the battle The UN designated the Northern Limit Line (NLL) as the maritime border between the two sides after the Korean War. But the North does not recognise the border, making waters around the line a long-time flash point. Despite the maritime clash, North Korea took part in the Asian Games in South Korea's Busan later that year. It sent a 606-member delegation, including 184 athletes, 288 cheerleaders and 134 officers to the Games. The North agreed to family reunions for some relatives separated by the Korean War, as Seoul prepared to host the Asian Games in Incheon. Millions of people were from loved ones by the physical division of the Korean peninsula after the war - and family reunions are one of the very few ways they can meet again. The reunions are often emotional events - with relatives seeing each other for the first time in over 60 years. Millions of people were separated by the Korean War Between 2000 and 2007, the two Koreas held reunions about twice a year. But they only occurred twice from 2007-2013, as ties between Lee Myung-bak's conservative government in Seoul and the regime in Pyongyang soured. As a result, the February 2014 reunion - the first in more than three years - generated considerable excitement. What we know of the Koreas' red and green phones The human drama of Korean family reunions But ties also became strained between the North and South. As the Asian Games neared, North Korea threatened to pull out - before eventually sending a delegation of 273 athletes and officials. It sent three of its most powerful military and political figures - Hwang Pyong-so, Choe Ryong-hae and Kim Yang-gon - but cancelled plans to send a cheerleading squad. Hwang Pyong-so (L), Choe Ryong-hae (C) and Kim Yang-gon at the Asian Games in Incheon in 2014 Family reunion events have not taken place since 2015. These are the first high-level Korea talks in two years The 2018 Winter Olympics will come after a period of heightened Korea tensions. In 2017, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test, and several missile tests. As a result, some South Koreans have prepared for the worst - buying ""war survival bags"" in anticipation of a possible nuclear attack. But then came North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's ""olive branch"", when he announced in his New Year's speech that the North could send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February. And both sides appear keen to talk. Whereas previous high-level meetings have been difficult to set up and involved various power struggles - with disputes over the venue, dates and attendees - this time it took just one week for the two Koreas to agree on the specifics of the talks. On 9 January, the talks began on a friendly note. President Moon Jae-in's liberal government in the South is hoping that the discussions could mark the beginning of something bigger, of something beyond just sport.

"Bannon recently upset President Trump with reported comments to author Michael Wolff Steve Bannon, ex-chief strategist to US President Donald Trump, has refused to answer a broad range of questions at a committee hearing probing alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr Bannon was called to testify to the House Intelligence Committee about his time working for Mr Trump. He was questioned behind closed doors on Tuesday in a 10-hour meeting. Mr Bannon's lawyer relayed questions to the White House, and was told when not to respond, AP news agency reports. A Democrat on the committee said Mr Bannon was under a White House ""gag order"". Representative Adam Schiff said that Mr Bannon's lawyer had cited ""executive privilege"" - which allows the president to keep information from the public. He said that Mr Bannon had refused to answer questions related to his time at the White House, or the transition to the new administration. ""Steve Bannon and his attorney asserted a remarkably broad definition of executive privilege,"" Jim Himes, a Democratic member of the committee, told CNN. The panel issued a subpoena to compel him to return for a second round. His first appearance was voluntary. Mr Bannon's representatives have made no comment. The rise and fall of Steve Bannon Asked if the White House had told him not to answer certain questions, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: ""No-one has encouraged him to be anything but transparent."" She said Congress had to consult with the White House prior to obtaining confidential material. Bannon has said his comments about Donald Trump Jr (R) were misquoted Republican member Mike Conaway told the press that Mr Bannon was ""not an executive"", and the committee was ""going to resolve the issues to get the answers''. Earlier on Tuesday, it was reported that Mr Bannon had been issued with another subpoena, this time from former FBI director Robert Mueller, who is leading the inquiry into alleged Russian collusion during the 2016 election campaign. Mr Bannon ""intends to fully cooperate with Mueller"", a source told Axios, a Washington DC political news outlet. All you need to know about the Trump-Russia story US grand juries explained Mr Mueller's grand jury and the Congressional panel are separate investigations. FBI agents went to Mr Bannon's home in Washington DC last week to serve him with the grand jury subpoena, according to NBC News. But the agents were unaware that he had retained a lawyer, William Burck, who is also representing two other ex-Trump officials that have been questioned as part of the Mueller probe. The agents then delivered the order to Mr Burck instead, the networks reports. He helped shape Mr Trump's ""America First"" election campaign message and served as one of his closest aides before being pushed out of his role in August. He recently fell out with Mr Trump publicly after reportedly making comments about the president and his family in a newly published book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, by Michael Wolff. He was quoted as calling a meeting in June 2016 between Mr Trump's son Donald Jr and a group of Russians ""treasonous"". The House Intelligence Committee is one of four investigations being conducted by Congress into the alleged collusion, with others launched by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee. Four people have been charged: Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Rick Gates, a campaign aide, pleaded not guilty to all charges including allegations of money laundering unrelated to the 2016 election George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to the Trump administration, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over meetings he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak This video can not be played Trump voters grade president's first year Has Trump made the world more dangerous?

"The ""reunited"" flag symbolises aspirations in both the North and South to end the nearly seven decades of division North and South Korea have agreed to march together under a single ""unified Korea"" flag at next month's Winter Olympics in the South. They also agreed to field a joint women's ice hockey team in rare talks at the truce village of Panmunjom. These are the first high-level talks between the countries in more than two years. It marks a thaw in relations that began in the new year when North Korea offered to send a team to the games. The games will take place between 9 and 25 February in Pyeongchang in South Korea. If the plans are realised, a hundreds-strong North Korean delegation - including 230 cheerleaders, 140 orchestral musicians and 30 taekwondo athletes - could cross into the South via the land border to attend the Winter Olympics. It will mean the opening of the cross border road for the first time in almost two years. The two countries have also agreed to field a joint team for the sport of women's ice hockey. It would be the first time athletes from both Koreas have competed together in the same team at an Olympic Games. The North has also agreed to send a smaller, 150-member delegation to the Paralympics in March. The agreement will have to be approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday, because North Korea has missed registration deadlines or failed to qualify. South Korea will also need to find ways to host the North Korean delegation without violating UN Security Council sanctions outlawing cash transfers to Pyongyang and blacklisting certain senior North officials. Winter Olympics: How good is North Korea at sport? North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive North Korea crisis in 300 words South Korea's hockey coach and conservative newspapers have expressed concern about the prospect of a united hockey team, saying it could damage South Korea's chances of winning a medal. Tens of thousands of people are said to have signed online petitions urging President Moon Jae-in to scrap the plan. But the liberal leader told South Korean Olympic athletes on Wednesday that the North's participation in the Games would help improve inter-Korean relations. Japan has viewed the latest detente with suspicion, with Foreign Minister Taro Kono saying the world should not be blinded by Pyongyang's recent ""charm offensive"". ""It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,"" Mr Kono said, according to Reuters news agency. ""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working."" North and South met for the first high-level talks in two years - against a backdrop of mounting military tension Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent The Olympic embrace between North and South Korea represents a rare moment of hope in a crisis that at times has appeared to be steadily moving towards another war on the Korean peninsula. But is this a brief respite from the bluster and war-like words exchanged between Pyongyang and President Donald Trump, Seoul's main ally? Or does it really offer a platform for a diplomatic route out of this crisis? The enormity of an armed conflict is clear to all - even President Trump. However, the Olympic detente does not alter the realities of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Both programmes need more testing to demonstrate a true inter-continental capability. And with Mr Trump insisting that this is a capability that the North will not be allowed to obtain, it is hard to see this developing into a Korean spring, let alone a definitive resolution of the nuclear dispute. The talks which resulted in this agreement came after tensions on the Korean peninsula reached their highest point in decades. This is because North Korea has made rapid advances in its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes in recent years. Its latest ballistic missile test, on 28 November, sparked a series of fresh sanctions from the UN targeting petrol shipments and travel. Soon afterwards North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was ""open to dialogue"". In a New Year speech, he said he was considering sending a team to the Winter Olympics. South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome. Then, on 9 January, the two countries made the breakthrough announcement that the North would be sending a delegation. It was also agreed that a military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, would be reinstated. President Moon Jae-in has said the Olympic agreement could pave the way for the nuclear issue to be addressed and lead to dialogue between the North and the US, according to Yonhap news agency in Seoul.

"Sara Dalby is a nurse who performs surgeries From the running of general practices to carrying out surgical operations, the role of nurses is changing. So what are some of the things modern nurses do? Surgery for skin cancer and carpal tunnel syndrome are probably operations you would expect a surgeon to do, but nurse Sara Dalby performs these and other procedures routinely. A surgical care practitioner, a senior nurse with specialist training who works under the supervision of a surgeon, she also assists in theatre for major operations. But when she qualified as a nurse, in 2003, she had not considered the prospect of doing such work. ""I didn't even think I'd go into theatre, necessarily,"" Ms Dalby, who works at Aintree University Hospital, in Liverpool, told the BBC. ""But when I started going into theatre and I saw the practices and I thought how interesting it was, and then the opportunities came to be able to develop to do that myself, that's what I went into."" Ms Dalby has also co-developed modules for university students and people training to become surgical care practitioners. ""One of the most fantastic things about nursing as a profession is the variety of roles and the different scope of practice you can do,"" she said. ""I think what's really nice about being an advanced practitioner is that you get to develop but you still stay on the front line. ""You still deliver care to patients every day rather than perhaps going into a management position or an education role."" Cuckoo Lane is one of the few nurse-led general practices in the UK Cuckoo Lane Practice in Ealing, west London, is similar in many ways to other general practices. It is a bustling surgery at full capacity, serving more than 5,500 patients. But there is one key difference - it is one of the few practices in the UK to be nurse-led, rather than run by GPs. Not only is the practice run by two nurses, most of the appointments are carried out by nurses, too. These nurses have received extra training so they can do most of the work normally done by GPs, such as prescribing medication. The practice also employs two GPs, particularly for patients with ""especially complex medical needs"". It has been awarded an ""outstanding"" rating by the Care Quality Commission - the only one out of 79 practices in the borough. Julie Belton, one of the two directors of the practice, said patients appreciated the care they received from the nurses. ""This is stuff that nurses are good at - their care, their compassion, and they're clever,"" she said. ""There's this assumption, 'I can't do this - I'm not a doctor,' but actually with the right training and the right set up the world's your oyster."" Colm Darby said more young men were now willing to say they wanted to be nurses Colm Darby, from Belfast, works in an area of healthcare more commonly associated with women - neonatal nursing. For seven years he has worked with newborn babies who require intensive care. And in December he was awarded the title UK Neonatal Nurse of the Year. Mr Darby said he now saw more men either working in paediatric nursing or studying to join the profession. He said: ""A lot of young men are willing to say, 'Yeah, I want to do that role, typically a woman's, but I'm happy to say I want to do it,' without the fear of being judged for it."" Mr Darby said it was important that men took up more nursing roles because they offered a different, often more ""analytical perspective and one that in some cases will appeal more to other men"". ""In nursing, it's good to have a variety of opportunities for patients to be able to feel they can talk to whoever they want to,"" he said. ""It's important that we offer not just a multi-disciplinary team in relation to health professionals but in our makeup of people."" You need a degree in nursing and must be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council You will need to choose one of the four nursing specialisms (adult, children, mental health, or learning disability) Visit the NHS Careers website to find a university offering nursing degrees in England or in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales Each university sets its own requirements, but it is usually about five GCSEs plus two A-levels or equivalent From August last year, new students in England on most nursing and midwifery courses no longer get an NHS bursary and instead have to pay tuition fees like other students Source: Royal College of Nursing FollowAlex on Twitter,external.

"Bosses and directors of Carillion will not get bonuses or severance payments, the government has said. The Insolvency Service said no such payments had been made since the construction firm collapsed on Monday. The announcement comes as work on Carillion's public sector construction sites is paused pending decisions about their future. However, work on most of its private sector service contracts, such as catering and cleaning, will carry on. Carillion's customers want existing services to continue until new suppliers can be found and will provide funding to retain staff for the moment. Several former executives of the firm would have received pay and benefits this year. Carillion had agreed to keep paying former chief executive Richard Howson a Â£660,000 salary and Â£28,000 in benefits until October as part of his departure deal. Former finance chief Zafar Khan, who left Carillion in September, was due to receive Â£425,000 in base salary for 12 months Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane was due to be paid his Â£750,000 salary until July, despite being due to leave next month. On Wednesday, Business Secretary Greg Clark met representatives of some banks to seek assurances that they would support small businesses affected by the Carillion collapse. Afterwards, he said UK lenders were ready to give ""tailored support"" and flexibility when it came to repayments. About 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector face an uncertain future and are waiting to learn whether they will be able to get hold of money owed to them. HMRCsaid it will also help affected contractors,external, offering them more time to pay tax bills and providing workers with cash support through the tax credits system. Mapping Carillion's biggest construction projects Carillion was left with just Â£29m before going bankrupt 'Sites are silent and virtually deserted' Carillion apprentices among casualties At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the ""wildly excessive"" bonuses paid to Carillion directors. He also accused the government of negligence, saying it awarded contracts to Carillion even when it became clear the company had problems. Mr Corbyn also called on the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services. Mrs May said a third of government contracts with Carillion were agreed by the previous Labour administration, adding she wanted to provide ""good quality public services, delivered at best value to the taxpayer"". Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict Earlier GMB union boss Tim Roache had said the government's response to the Carillion crisis had been ""inadequate and inept"". He said that his union had called on Mr Clark to set up a task force to help private sector companies and employees affected by Carillion's collapse. He called on other private sector companies to take on affected workers without a change in their terms and conditions - a process that he admitted would not be a short one.

""Until we see something in black and white saying that, 'Yes, you will get paid on these set terms,' then we will consider sending our cleaner back in again."" Carillion went into liquidation on Monday after rescue talks with its lenders and the government failed to reach a deal.

"A satellite image shows half the UK under snow and cloud Drivers have been urged to stay off major roads unless absolutely necessary as a new snow storm approaches southern Scotland and northern England. A Met Office amber ""be prepared"" alert is now in place from 21:00 on Wednesday until 05:00 on Thursday. Scotland's Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said the authorities would be ""tested to our limit"". An estimated 40,000 children missed classes as about 300 schools were shut across Scotland on Wednesday. This video can not be played ""We were on the road for 12 hours"" The travel warning came after hundreds of drivers were stranded on Tuesday night on the main route between Scotland and England.

In a statement in the Scottish Parliament Mr Yousaf apologised to anyone who had been stuck on the M74 but said it was as a result of ""extremely challenging conditions"", with persistent snow at a level that had not been seen for a number of years. He also announced that police were upgrading their travel warning from level three to level four. ""That in practice means that all travel should be avoided on those parts of the trunk road affected by the amber warning, namely south and south-west Scotland for the duration of the amber warning,"" he said. Stein Connolly from Traffic Scotland said the evening commute began relatively smoothly on Wednesday. He told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive programme: ""The M74 is black, it's running OK. You can see quite a substantial snowfall on the fields next to the 74 and even along the centre but the actual road is clear right now."" He said he believed the level four ""do not travel"" warning had only been issued once before, in the high winds of January 2013. ""We really hope that after last night people do listen to us. Avoid the area. We don't want a repeat of last night. ""If you do go out there, you're putting yourself at risk and other people at risk."" Travel conditions are graded at four levels by police and transport officials depending on the severity of the weather. Level 1:Normaloperations - no severe weather. Level 2: Travel withcaution- police advise people that conditions for road travel may be hazardous. Level 3:High riskof disruption for road journeys - police advise that there is a high risk of disruption for road journeys. Travellers are likely to experience significant delays. Level 4:Avoidtravelling on the roads - journeys should be avoided. Severe delays expected. The Met Office has predicted persistent heavy snow, with travel delays likely on roads and a risk that some vehicles and passengers could become stranded. Delays or cancellations are likely to rail and air travel. Some rural communities are likely to become cut off and power cuts are ""probable"". Less severe yellow warnings remain in place with snow and ice forecast until Friday evening, with Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England likely to be affected. The amber warning extends until 05:00 on Thursday On Wednesday, thousands of pupils missed lessons as about 300 Scottish schools or nurseries were shut or partially closed as a result of the weather. Scottish Borders Council said no schools would open in its area on Wednesday or Thursday, with 15,000 pupils missing lessons and 26 schools were also shut in Dumfries and Galloway, affecting 4,000 students. In the Highland Council area, nearly 150 schools and nurseries were shut or partially closed, affecting 15,000 pupils. Nearly 30 schools and nurseries were closed in South Lanarkshire and there are also a number of schools shut in East Ayrshire, Stirling, Falkirk and Perth and Kinross.

One driver stuck on the northbound carriageway of the M74, Fergus McCann, said the impatience of other drivers had made things worse. He told the BBC: ""There's been a fair bit of impatient driving going on. ""People are in one queue, then people are cutting out and trying to go down lanes that clearly are not for driving on. ""It's not a surprise that you're getting a few hundred yards down the road and you're seeing them facing the wrong way."" Steve Harris became stranded on the M74 at 17:30 GMT and was still stuck between junctions 11 and 12 more than eight hours later. ""I've not moved really in the last four hours,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live at about 03:00 GMT. ""I've managed to get out of my car a couple of times to stretch my legs.

"A museum in Banksy's home city has been caught selling a hugely popular print of one his artworks without permission. Bristol Museum and Art Gallery - which was once ""taken over"" by the elusive street artist - had been doing aroaring trade in its Â£5 prints of the Angel Bust, selling a copy every minute at one point. But a buyer contacted Banksy's agent on Monday to find they were unauthorised. The museum has since apologised and withdrawn the prints from sale. Steve Hall, a Banksy fan from Asheville, North Carolina, USA, was disappointed to learn his purchase was unauthorised and cancelled his order. He said: ""I sent an email to Banksy's website to find out if the Angel Bust print sold by Bristol Museum was authorised by Banksy. ""This was their response: 'Absolutely not, they were printed without our permission.'"" Banksy, an anonymous street artist from Bristol, created the angel sculpture with a tin of pink paint tipped over it for a takeover of the museum in 2009. Hundreds of thousands of people queued to see Banksy versus Bristol Museum after the artist transformed it into a menagerie of ""unnatural history"". He left the statue when the exhibition closed. The print was available for some time but sales surged after it went on sale in the US and Japan - with as many as 1,000 sold in a single day. A spokesman for Bristol City Council, which runs the museum, said: ""We own the artwork in question and had been granted permission to produce the image in our guide to the art gallery published last autumn. ""It was assumed that this would allow us to produce prints, however, having contacted Banksy's management we were told that this was not the case. ""As a result we have taken the decision to withdraw all prints from sale and offered full refunds to any customers. ""We have apologised to Banksy and would like to offer our apologies to any customers who felt misled by this sale."" Banksy print breaks records.

"Tesco is delaying a cut to its biggest Clubcard rewards after it faced a backlash from customers. The supermarket announced on Monday that the value of its reward vouchers was changing immediately, provoking an angry response on social media. It has now pushed back a drop in the most generous rewards until June. Shoppers collect points for money spent with the supermarket and these become vouchers, which can be used for things such as days out or restaurant meals. Under thechanges announced on Monday, vouchers worth four times their face value were cut to three times their value. But Tesco has now agreed to delay that change until 10 June to give shoppers more time to spend them. The company said it had ""listened to customers' feedback"" on the timetable. Martin Lewis, founder of the Money Saving Expert website, said it seemed that Tesco had responded to ""all the anger that's been out there and the campaigning"". ""They've done the right thing and they're giving those people who have been saving up to get their four-times vouchers some time to redeem them,"" he told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours. Pizza Express, Cafe Rouge and London Zoo are among the places that accept four-time vouchers, according to Money Saving Expert. Tesco said it would inform customers about the change over the next few days. Customers who redeemed such vouchers at three times their face value will be refunded, the supermarket said.

"Bitcoin came close to crossing $20,000 in December Bitcoin has traded below $10,000 for the first time since early December. The value of one bitcoin fell to $9,958 (Â£7,222) before making a slight recovery, according to aprice index run by the news site Coindesk,external. However, it later fell again dipping just below $9,200. That represents a drop of more than 53% since it peaked close to $19,800 five weeks ago. Other crypto-currencies have also experienced steep falls, including Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. There has been concern among some experts that a bubble had been forming in the market as casual investors piled into an asset they did not fully understand. It is notoriously difficult to be certain of what causes moves in Bitcoin's value - the asset has been much more volatile than most traditional currencies and commodities to date - but speculation that regulators may be about to restrict trade has been causing concern. In particular, South Korea has suggested that it might soon take action. ""The government stance is that it needs to regulate crypto-currency investment as it is a largely speculative investment,"" its finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said in a radio interview on Tuesday. ""The shutdown of virtual currency exchanges is still one of the options [that the government has]."" Earlier this week, the Bloomberg news agency reported that the Chinese authoritieswere planning to restrict local access,externalto crypto-currency trading platforms, having already taken steps to curb Bitcoin mining - the process that validates transactions. Investors may also have been spooked by Bitconnect's announcement that it was closing down its lending and exchange platform on Tuesday. The business had centred on its own digital token - the Bitconnect Coin - which crashed in value following the announcement, despite the firm saying it would still be supported. Bitconnect said it had faced ""continuous bad press"" - including claims it had been running a Ponzi scheme -  and had received cease-and-desist letters from two US watchdogs. Last Wednesday, the influential investor Warren Buffett predicted further trouble ahead, although he was vague about the timing. Mr Buffett said he had never made a Bitcoin-related investment on behalf of his Berkshire Hathaway fund ""In terms of crypto-currencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending,""he told CNBC,external.

"This video can not be played Dylan Farrow: ""Why shouldn't I want to bring him down?"" Dylan Farrow says she feels ""outrage"" after ""years of being ignored, disbelieved and tossed aside"". Woody Allen's adopted daughter has appeared on CBS This Morning to talk about her sexual assault claim against the director. In what is her first TV interview, Farrow says she is ""hurt"" and ""angry"". The 32-year-old has repeatedly accused Allen of molesting her when she was seven - claims the director has always denied. Farrow expressed anger at the suggestion she was simply caught up in the Hollywood#metoocampaign, saying: ""Why shouldn't I want to bring him down? Why shouldn't I be angry? Why shouldn't I be hurt? ""Why shouldn't I feel some sort of outrage... after all these years of being ignored, disbelieved and tossed aside?"" The excerpt, in which Farrow was visibly emotional, was a preview of a longer interview, which will be aired on Thursday. Farrow, now 32, was adopted by Mia Farrow when she was two weeks old The interview was filmed on Monday at Farrow's home in Bridgewater, Connecticut. Farrow discussed why it was the right time for her to do a television interview after years of claiming Allen had abused her. ""All I can do is speak my truth and hope - hope that somebody will believe me rather than just hearing,"" she said. Allen was investigated over a 1992 claim by Farrow that he sexually assaulted her at the family's Connecticut home. Prosecutors did not charge the film-maker and he has always denied the allegations, which he claims had been fabricated by his former partner Mia Farrow. In 2014, Dylan Farrow wrote an open letter alleging she had been molested by Allen - but he responded to the claims calling them ""untrue and disgraceful"". More recently, in a series of tweets posted ahead of last week's Golden Globes award ceremony, Dylan Farrow reiterated her claims that Allen was a ""predator"". Chalamet said he would donate his salary to charities including Time's Up A number of actors have distanced themselves from Allen as Hollywood's sexual harassment scandal continues. They include Timothee Chalamet,who announced this weekhe will give his salary for appearing in Allen's next film, A Rainy Day in New York, to charity. Chalamet claimed: ""I don't want to profit from my work on the film."" His co-star, Rebecca Hall, also donated her fee to charity and said she ""regretted"" her decision to appear in the film. However, Alec Baldwin, who worked with Allen on Alice, Blue Jasmine and To Rome With Love, said the ""renunciation of him and his work"" was ""unfair and sad"". ""Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states"" - New York and Connecticut - ""and no charges were filed,""he tweeted on Tuesday.,external Sexual misconduct in the film industry has been a hot topic since last October, when a number of women came forward to accuse producer Harvey Weinstein of harassment and rape.

"An ECJ decision would affect all British nationals living in the EU Five UK nationals are going to court in the Netherlands in a campaign to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. They want a Dutch judge to press the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify their rights. The ECJ, if it decides to make a ruling, could guarantee such rights as freedom of movement after the UK leaves the European Union. An ECJ decision would affect all British nationals living in the European Union. The European court could rule that all member states must guarantee the rights of Brits in the respective states where they reside - under European law. About 42,500 British nationals live in the Netherlands. The interim deal thrashed out between the UK and Brussels in December does outline some of the rights British citizens in Europe will keep after Brexit, such as the ability to live and work on the continent. But some vital questions, like free movement, still swirl around. Some of the group of five say they have been disheartened by the confusion and speculation about what their life will be like after Brexit. Stephen Huyton, left, with his family, is among those taking legal action in the Netherlands ""Just because the UK voted to leave, it shouldn't be able to force citizens to give up their rights,"" says Stephen Huyton, one of the Brits taking the court action on Wednesday. The Netherlands does not currently allow foreigners to have dual nationality, in most cases. EU citizenship is described in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and includes the rights to: Travel and live anywhere in the EU Vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections in another EU country Get diplomatic protection and consular help from any other EU country in another part of the world Read more: Brexit: Could UK get âassociate EU citizenshipâ? Would Brexit violate UK citizens' rights? Mr Huyton, the European director of a US firm, has been living in the Netherlands for 24 years and has three children, with the youngest at university in the UK. Like other Brits who have been living outside the UK for more than 15 years, he was not eligible to vote in the EU referendum. ""My children are confronted by choices I don't think are fair or reasonable,"" he says. ""In the Brexit breakup, it feels as though they're just making up the rules as they go along. We feel as though we've been forgotten, so at least now people are noticing us."" The Dutch judge has the power to ask the ECJ for clarity on a point of law. It is then up to the ECJ to decide whether it needs to provide this. Many Brexit supporters resent the ECJ's power to overrule British court decisions on citizens' rights. Laywer Christiaan Alberdingk Thijm told the BBC his aim in the Dutch case was to establish the grounds under which Brits could lose their European citizenship. ""Can it be taken away from them?"" He added: ""Theresa May said, 'Brexit means Brexit' now we are trying to work out on behalf of these people, what that actually means. ""We know how important it is to so many people."" British barrister Jolyon Maugham QC, who is funding the legal action and has been behind other Brexit challenges, said the case raised ""a profoundly important question"", which would affect not only Brits living abroad. ""If the case is successful, all of us will continue to benefit from EU citizenship rights after Brexit."" But this could be ""politically awkward"" for the remaining 27 member states. ""It would take out of their hands the question of what rights UK citizens would enjoy after Brexit. ""Those rights would no longer be a matter of political gift - EU law would continue to guarantee EU citizenship rights to those who are UK citizens at the date of Brexit. It would, potentially, weaken their position at the negotiating table."" This is a small case relating to one specific group. But if their action is successful, they hope it will benefit some of the 1.2 million British nationals across the continent. Brexit: Could UK get âassociate EU citizenshipâ?

"Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill - led by Labour MP Karen Buck Justice Secretary David Gauke statement at 11am: parole board: transparency and victim support Kristiina Cooper House of CommonsParliament And that's where our live coverage ends today. We'll be back on Monday afternoon at 2.30pm when the Commons and the Lords start work. House of CommonsParliament The Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill is give a second reading by MPs. There are no dissenting voices at all. That means it can proceed to the detailed - committee stage - scrutiny.  The Housing Minister, Heather Wheeler, restates the government's support for the Bill, saying that everyone deserves a ""decent and safe place to live"". She says the government wants to support good landlord and avoid further regulation but it recognises there are a small number of ""criminal, rogue landlords"". She says the procedure in the bill for seeking redress is designed to be straightforward with most tenants able to represent themselves. And for complex cases, she says, legal aid will be available in certain circumstances. Calling it ""an excellent bill"" she has ""every confidence"" that it will continue as it approaches the committee stage. House of CommonsParliament A Conservative Eddie Hughes notes he wasn't an MP when the bill was blocked by Conservatives on previous occasions. He declares: ""I am a keen, enthusiastic advocate for the bill in its present form."" He speaks up for landlords, saying it ""wasn't always easy being a landlord"". He calls himself an ""accidental landlord"" as his wife held on to her property when they got married and it's now let to tenants. He says many landlords do not have sufficient expertise.  House of CommonsParliament Several MPs relate the stories of families in their constituencies living in squalid conditions. Labour MP for Canterbury, Rosie Duffield, tells the Commons about one constitutency case in which the children are ""exposed to mould and fungi growing around beds, clothes and toys"". She says she is disgusted at the way the family has been housed - so much so that she has posted video of their accommodation on her social media sites. ""Please go and see. You will be horrified,"" she says. The statement on the John Worboys cases finishes and MPs returns to the debate on the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill. Shadow Housing Secretary, John Healey gets things underway by praising the Labour MP Karen Buck for ""building a coalition"" to get behind her bill. There's also praise for the government for backing the bill. Acrowdfunding campaignhas been launched by a victim to mount a legal challenge against the Parole Board's decision to release Worboys from jail. Referring to the campaign, Labour MP Jo Stevens suggests providing legal aid for judicial review. David Gauke replies that as there's a review under way, he didn't intend to say anything on that issue until it had been completed.  Allow Twitter content?

A Conservative Philip Hollobone says the best way to protect the public is for violent offenders to be ""kept behind bars"". ""If an offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment they should serve that term in prison in full."" And he wonders who is held to account in the parole board if people  released early reoffend. The Justice Secretary replies that the priority ""for all us is that people who are dangerous are not released"".  House of CommonsParliament For Labour, Imran Hussain agrees that many people will be disappointed at the Minister's decision. And he recalls how many people were shocked that some of the victims found out about the Parole Board's decision on Worboys through the media He says victims had a right, from the outset, to participate in the Parole Board process.  The Justice Secretary tells MPs that he has taken a close personal interest in the case, saying that ""on a personal level"" he shares concern about it. ""I can reassure the House and public that Worboys will not be released until his licence conditions have been finalised."" He adds that he fully supports the right of victims to challenge the decision to release him. The approach he is taking, he says, ""does not mean that others are precluded from taking action"". House of CommonsParliament The Justice Secretary David Gauke tells MPs he will not be challenging the parole board's direction for sex offender John Worboys to be released. He says he took advice on whether there were grounds to challenge the decision. In the end, he decided it would ""not be appropriate for me as Secretary of State to proceed with such a case"". He adds: ""I know this will disappoint the victims in this case"". House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Rupa Huq recalls a previous attempt by Karen Buck to introduce her Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill. On that occasion, she says, it was ""talked out' by Conservative MPs. That's a parliamentary device used by opponents of legislation to ensure there's no time to vote on a bill, thereby preventing it from making any progress. In the light of that experience, she admits Labour MPs were ""getting a bit jittery' when the Conservative Bob Blackman ""got a bit loquacious"". She adds: I'm glad they have seen the error of their ways."" At 11am the Justice Secretary David Gauke will make a statement
in the Commons ""on the transparency of parole board and victims'
support"". It comes amid controversy over the Parole Board's
direction that notorious sex offender John Worboys should be freed after a decade in
prison. House of CommonsParliament There are birthday wishes all round for the Speaker John Bercow, who is chairing today's debates. A Conservative Bob Blackman thanks him for sitting in the chair on his birthday when ""you could be off enjoying yourself in another way"". To laughter, he adds hastily: ""I am sure you're going to enjoy our debate this morning, Mr Speaker."" House of CommonsParliament A day of harmony in the Commons with cross-party support for the bill. A Conservative Lucy Allan declares that she wants to see the bill deliver on its objective ""to ensure everyone can live in a decent home"". She describes how in her Telford constituency homes in the private rental sector have ""long been neglected"". She adds: ""It's a catalyst for a spiral of decline."" She does sound one note of caution that tenants worst affected by poor housing standards may be the least able to complain to the authorities.  The excellent House of Commons Library has producedan in-depth analysis of the bill,external, including some background on the law surrounding housing. There have been longstanding concerns about property standards in the private rented sector (PRS). The PRS houses more households in England than the social rented sector but has some of the poorest property standards."" House of Commons Library Karen Buck explains the old housing laws have become ""obsolete"". The purpose of her bill, she says, it to revive and update them. She points out that there has been a  strong breadth of report for her legislation, including the Residential Landords Association. ""I am genuinely thrilled to have goverment support this time round,"" she adds. She tells MPs that today they have the chance to progress legislation to give tenants more powers to hold landlords to account.  Welcome to our live coverage of the
House of Commons. 
Friday is a day for private members' bills - legislation introduced by an
individual MP. 
First up today is the Homes Fit for Human Habitation Bill, which would make it
easier for tenants to ensure landlords keep their properties in good condition.

The bill is being introduced by the Labour MP Karen Buck. 
It has government support but - due to the arcane parliamentary procedures
around private members' bills, it could still be blocked. The afternoon in the Commons was devoted to
marking Holocaust Memorial Day, with some moving speeches from MPs. Holocaust Memorial Day is on 27 January,
commemorating the day in 1945 that soldiers fighting the Germans took over the largest
Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and freed surviving prisoners. Conservative Bob Blackman recalled visiting Auschwitz-Birkenau with a group of
young people, observing: ""It brings home to everyone what can happen if
you stand idly by,"" while Labour's Alex Sobel shared memories of survivors in his family. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.30597657

However, it later fell again dipping just below $9,200. That represents a drop of more than 53% since it peaked close to $19,800 five weeks ago. Other crypto-currencies have also experienced steep falls, including Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin Cash. There has been concern among some experts that a bubble had been forming in the market as casual investors piled into an asset they did not fully understand. It is notoriously difficult to be certain of what causes moves in Bitcoin's value - the asset has been much more volatile than most traditional currencies and commodities to date - but speculation that regulators may be about to restrict trade has been causing concern. In particular, South Korea has suggested that it might soon take action. ""The government stance is that it needs to regulate crypto-currency investment as it is a largely speculative investment,"" its finance minister Kim Dong-yeon said in a radio interview on Tuesday. ""The shutdown of virtual currency exchanges is still one of the options [that the government has]."" Earlier this week, the Bloomberg news agency reported that the Chinese authoritieswere planning to restrict local access,externalto crypto-currency trading platforms, having already taken steps to curb Bitcoin mining - the process that validates transactions. Investors may also have been spooked by Bitconnect's announcement that it was closing down its lending and exchange platform on Tuesday. The business had centred on its own digital token - the Bitconnect Coin - which crashed in value following the announcement, despite the firm saying it would still be supported. Bitconnect said it had faced ""continuous bad press"" - including claims it had been running a Ponzi scheme -  and had received cease-and-desist letters from two US watchdogs. Last Wednesday, the influential investor Warren Buffett predicted further trouble ahead, although he was vague about the timing. Mr Buffett said he had never made a Bitcoin-related investment on behalf of his Berkshire Hathaway fund ""In terms of crypto-currencies, generally, I can say with almost certainty that they will come to a bad ending,""he told CNBC,external. ""When it happens or how or anything else, I don't know."" However, photography firm Kodakhas seen its stock price soarsince last Tuesday when it announced its involvement with two crypto-currency-related ventures. How does South Korea sway Bitcoin prices?

"The ""reunited"" flag symbolises aspirations in both the North and South to end the nearly seven decades of division North and South Korea have agreed to march together under a single ""unified Korea"" flag at next month's Winter Olympics in the South. They also agreed to field a joint women's ice hockey team in rare talks at the truce village of Panmunjom. These are the first high-level talks between the countries in more than two years. It marks a thaw in relations that began in the new year when North Korea offered to send a team to the games. The games will take place between 9 and 25 February in Pyeongchang in South Korea. If the plans are realised, a hundreds-strong North Korean delegation - including 230 cheerleaders, 140 orchestral musicians and 30 taekwondo athletes - could cross into the South via the land border to attend the Winter Olympics. It will mean the opening of the cross border road for the first time in almost two years. The two countries have also agreed to field a joint team for the sport of women's ice hockey. It would be the first time athletes from both Koreas have competed together in the same team at an Olympic Games. The North has also agreed to send a smaller, 150-member delegation to the Paralympics in March. The agreement will have to be approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Saturday, because North Korea has missed registration deadlines or failed to qualify. South Korea will also need to find ways to host the North Korean delegation without violating UN Security Council sanctions outlawing cash transfers to Pyongyang and blacklisting certain senior North officials. Winter Olympics: How good is North Korea at sport? North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive North Korea crisis in 300 words South Korea's hockey coach and conservative newspapers have expressed concern about the prospect of a united hockey team, saying it could damage South Korea's chances of winning a medal. Tens of thousands of people are said to have signed online petitions urging President Moon Jae-in to scrap the plan. But the liberal leader told South Korean Olympic athletes on Wednesday that the North's participation in the Games would help improve inter-Korean relations. Japan has viewed the latest detente with suspicion, with Foreign Minister Taro Kono saying the world should not be blinded by Pyongyang's recent ""charm offensive"". ""It is not the time to ease pressure or to reward North Korea,"" Mr Kono said, according to Reuters news agency. ""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working."" North and South met for the first high-level talks in two years - against a backdrop of mounting military tension Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent The Olympic embrace between North and South Korea represents a rare moment of hope in a crisis that at times has appeared to be steadily moving towards another war on the Korean peninsula. But is this a brief respite from the bluster and war-like words exchanged between Pyongyang and President Donald Trump, Seoul's main ally? Or does it really offer a platform for a diplomatic route out of this crisis? The enormity of an armed conflict is clear to all - even President Trump. However, the Olympic detente does not alter the realities of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. Both programmes need more testing to demonstrate a true inter-continental capability. And with Mr Trump insisting that this is a capability that the North will not be allowed to obtain, it is hard to see this developing into a Korean spring, let alone a definitive resolution of the nuclear dispute. The talks which resulted in this agreement came after tensions on the Korean peninsula reached their highest point in decades. This is because North Korea has made rapid advances in its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes in recent years. Its latest ballistic missile test, on 28 November, sparked a series of fresh sanctions from the UN targeting petrol shipments and travel. Soon afterwards North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was ""open to dialogue"". In a New Year speech, he said he was considering sending a team to the Winter Olympics. South Korea's Olympics chief had said last year that the North's athletes would be welcome. Then, on 9 January, the two countries made the breakthrough announcement that the North would be sending a delegation. It was also agreed that a military hotline between the nations, suspended for nearly two years, would be reinstated. President Moon Jae-in has said the Olympic agreement could pave the way for the nuclear issue to be addressed and lead to dialogue between the North and the US, according to Yonhap news agency in Seoul.

He declares: ""I am a keen, enthusiastic advocate for the bill in its present form."" He speaks up for landlords, saying it ""wasn't always easy being a landlord"". He calls himself an ""accidental landlord"" as his wife held on to her property when they got married and it's now let to tenants. He says many landlords do not have sufficient expertise.

"Jon Flanagan has been handed a 12-month community order Liverpool footballer Jon Flanagan has been sentenced to 40 hours of unpaid work and a community order for assaulting his girlfriend. The 25-year-old defenderpleaded guilty to common assault by beating of Rachael Wallat an earlier hearing. Liverpool Magistrates' Court heard he ""slammed"" his partner against the wall and kicked her ""while she was on the floor"" in Liverpool on 22 December. Flanagan has made more than 50 first-team appearances for the club. A club spokesman condemned ""in the strongest possible terms, the player's actions"" and said the club will now begin considering ""any internal disciplinary action"". The 12-month community order will include 15 rehabilitation activity days, 40 hours of unpaid work, Â£85 costs and an Â£85 victim surcharge. The court was shown CCTV footage of Flanagan hitting his partner, pushing her against a wall twice and then kicking her in Duke Street in the city centre at about 03:20 GMT. Alan Currums, prosecuting, said a witness stated he had ""seen the male throw the female against the wall and then kick her while she was on the floor"". He said the man saw Flanagan place one hand on Ms Wall's neck and one on her throat before he ""slammed her against the wall"". The witness said he shouted from his balcony to Flanagan that he was ""out of order"" and the footballer replied with offensive language that he would ""come and knock you out"". Jon Flanagan admitted assault when he appeared before magistrates Sentencing the Liverpool-born player, District Judge Wendy Lloyd said it was ""undoubtedly sad"". ""It was a matter of this lady going to the floor twice and you used your foot on her on one occasion,"" she said. ""The lady was seen to have injuries but of course she said she does not attribute those injuries to you."" Lionel Greig, mitigating, said Flanagan ""deeply regrets his behaviour"" and ""there is genuine remorse"". Mr Greig said both parties were under the influence of alcohol at the time and there was no suggestion there had been any previous violence in the relationship. ""They are back together and working very hard at the relationship and supporting one another,"" he added. A Liverpool FC spokesman said: ""It leaves his own reputation damaged and, through association, he has severely let down the club he had previously represented with distinction."" He said the club has ""expressed to him our disappointment and anger that he has failed to live up to"" its values and the internal process of ""deciding on or implementing any internal disciplinary action"" will now begin. Flanagan, who made his debut for Liverpool aged 18, has only played once for the club this season and spent last season on loan at Burnley after a 20-month injury lay off. He was a standby for England's 2014 World Cup squad and has one England cap.

"Arthur Collins admitted one charge of possessing a prohibited item while in prison A man jailed for throwing acid across a packed nightclub has been sentenced to a further eight months for using a smuggled mobile phone while in prison. Arthur Collins, 25, hid the Nokia phone in a crutch and used it to call his reality TV star ex-girlfriend Ferne McCann from his cell at HMP Thameside. He was handed the eight-month sentence at Woolwich Crown Court on Wednesday. Collins injured 22 people by throwing acid across a London nightclub and was jailed for 20 years in December. Later that month, he admitted one charge of possessing a prohibited item while in prison. The eight-month prison term, consecutive to Collins' current sentence, will add an extra four months on to his earliest release date, meaning he will serve at least 13 years and eight months. Collins hid the phone, two Sim cards and two memory sticks in the crutch while awaiting trial over the acid attack, which left 16 people with chemical burns and three people temporarily blinded. He claimed he had used the device to make private calls to then pregnant Ms McCann, who gave birth to their baby daughter Sunday in November. Arthur Collins (right) previously appeared in court in crutches with co-accused Andre Phoenix who was cleared over the acid attack His barrister Rebecca Randall said: ""His girlfriend at the time was heavily pregnant with his first child. ""That child is now two months old and occasionally visits him with its mother and his sister."" Prosecutor Arizuna Asante told the court that an analysis of the device confirmed Collins used it to contact his family and friends. Sentencing, Judge Nicholas Heathcote Williams said: ""The presence of a mobile phone or component part such as a Sim card has many implications, not only for the prison establishment, but also the wider environment. ""It provides a prisoner or prisoners with an opportunity to communicate they would otherwise not have. ""This therefore allows them to act in a way prison is supposed to prevent them from doing."" The court heard the items were found on 10 September when a prison officer removed the rubber stopper from the bottom of the crutch in his private shower during a cell search. Collins, from Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, was injured trying to evade police while on the run for the acid attack in Mangle E8 in Dalston. He took part in the hearing via video link from the high-security Belmarsh Prison and showed no emotion as he was sentenced.

"Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill - led by Labour MP Karen Buck Justice Secretary David Gauke statement at 11am: parole board: transparency and victim support Kristiina Cooper House of CommonsParliament And that's where our live coverage ends today. We'll be back on Monday afternoon at 2.30pm when the Commons and the Lords start work. House of CommonsParliament The Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill is give a second reading by MPs. There are no dissenting voices at all. That means it can proceed to the detailed - committee stage - scrutiny.  The Housing Minister, Heather Wheeler, restates the government's support for the Bill, saying that everyone deserves a ""decent and safe place to live"". She says the government wants to support good landlord and avoid further regulation but it recognises there are a small number of ""criminal, rogue landlords"". She says the procedure in the bill for seeking redress is designed to be straightforward with most tenants able to represent themselves. And for complex cases, she says, legal aid will be available in certain circumstances. Calling it ""an excellent bill"" she has ""every confidence"" that it will continue as it approaches the committee stage. House of CommonsParliament A Conservative Eddie Hughes notes he wasn't an MP when the bill was blocked by Conservatives on previous occasions. He declares: ""I am a keen, enthusiastic advocate for the bill in its present form."" He speaks up for landlords, saying it ""wasn't always easy being a landlord"". He calls himself an ""accidental landlord"" as his wife held on to her property when they got married and it's now let to tenants. He says many landlords do not have sufficient expertise.  House of CommonsParliament Several MPs relate the stories of families in their constituencies living in squalid conditions. Labour MP for Canterbury, Rosie Duffield, tells the Commons about one constitutency case in which the children are ""exposed to mould and fungi growing around beds, clothes and toys"". She says she is disgusted at the way the family has been housed - so much so that she has posted video of their accommodation on her social media sites. ""Please go and see. You will be horrified,"" she says. The statement on the John Worboys cases finishes and MPs returns to the debate on the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Bill. Shadow Housing Secretary, John Healey gets things underway by praising the Labour MP Karen Buck for ""building a coalition"" to get behind her bill. There's also praise for the government for backing the bill. Acrowdfunding campaignhas been launched by a victim to mount a legal challenge against the Parole Board's decision to release Worboys from jail. Referring to the campaign, Labour MP Jo Stevens suggests providing legal aid for judicial review. David Gauke replies that as there's a review under way, he didn't intend to say anything on that issue until it had been completed.  Allow Twitter content?

House of Commons. 
Friday is a day for private members' bills - legislation introduced by an
individual MP. 
First up today is the Homes Fit for Human Habitation Bill, which would make it
easier for tenants to ensure landlords keep their properties in good condition.

The bill is being introduced by the Labour MP Karen Buck. 
It has government support but - due to the arcane parliamentary procedures
around private members' bills, it could still be blocked. The afternoon in the Commons was devoted to
marking Holocaust Memorial Day, with some moving speeches from MPs. Holocaust Memorial Day is on 27 January,
commemorating the day in 1945 that soldiers fighting the Germans took over the largest
Nazi concentration camp, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and freed surviving prisoners. Conservative Bob Blackman recalled visiting Auschwitz-Birkenau with a group of
young people, observing: ""It brings home to everyone what can happen if
you stand idly by,"" while Labour's Alex Sobel shared memories of survivors in his family. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"YouTube creators will need to have more than 1,000 subscribers to earn money YouTube is introducing tougher requirements for video publishers who want to make money from its platform. In addition, it has said staff will manually review all clips before they are added to a premium service that pairs big brand advertisers with popular content. The moves follow a series of advertiser boycotts and a controversial vlog that featured an apparent suicide victim. One expert said that the Google-owned service had been slow to react. ""Google presents the impression of acting reactively rather than proactively,"" said Mark Mulligan, from the consultancy Midia Research. ""It needs to get better at acting faster."" The first part of the new strategy involves a stricter requirement that publishers must fulfil before they can make money from their uploads. Clips will no longer have adverts attached unless the publisher meets two criteria - that they have: at least 1,000 subscribers more than 4,000 hours of their content viewed by others within the past 12 months YouTube said that this represented a ""higher standard"" than the previous requirement of 10,000 lifetime views, which was introduced nine months ago. It blogged that thisshould help it combat,external""spammers, impersonators, and other bad actors"" as well as to prevent ""potentially inappropriate videos from monetising, which can hurt revenue for everyone"". This video can not be played WATCH: YouTube faced criticism for its ad crackdown last year YouTube faceda backlash from many of its creators, dubbed the ""adpocalypse"", last year when itprevented videos about some topicsbeing able to include adverts. This was in response to more than 200 major brands pulling campaigns over concern their ads had been attached to clips featuring hate speech and other extremist content. YouTube punishes Logan Paul over Japan suicide video Predatory comments prompt YouTube suspension YouTube tweaks advertising algorithm YouTube star criticises video site's leaders Mr Mulligan suggested the latest change should prove less controversial. ""In terms of impact on creators, this makes taking that first step to commercial status that bit harder to reach,"" he told the BBC. ""But given how much the platform is growing, higher benchmarks will be easier to meet now than they were a few years ago."" The second part of the effort focuses on theGoogle Preferred programme,external. This lets brands pay extra to attach their adverts to the top 5% of videos most popular with 18- to 34-year-olds. Until now, the process was automated. ButYouTube said it would manually review,externalall relevant content by the end of March. In theory, this process would have alerted YouTube to a controversial clip by vlogger Logan Paulat an earlier stage. At the end of last year, the 22 year-old American featured what appeared to be a dead man's body hanging from a tree in Japan's Aokigahara forest in one of his videos. Logan Paul is one of YouTube's most popular vloggers Mr Paul - who has more than 15 million subscribers - was excluded from Google Preferred last week as a consequence. YouTube had previously announced,externalthat it planned to have more than 10,000 workers reviewing clips in general on the service by the end of 2018. It appears to acknowledge that further steps will be necessary to prevent a similar scandal in the future, and said it intended to ""schedule conversations with our creators in the months ahead"" to discuss ways to address the problem. But Mr Mulligan suggested that YouTube still faced a fundamental problem. ""The Logan Paul experience highlights the risk that young creators like Logan have been shorn of the structure that their peers in traditional media have: the people to advise, guide and mentor them,"" he said. Manually and proactively reviewing videos on its most popular channels opens up a whole range of potential issues, even if that stipulation will apply only to those on its Google Preferred programme. Most notably, it removes YouTube's ability to duck behind its ""as soon as we were made aware"" defence when removing inappropriate content. Much like a traditional media company, it will need to make decency judgements, and the most skilled team in the world won't get it right 100% of the time. And when these hard decisions are made, don't expect YouTubers to like what the moderation team decides. Whether justified or not, YouTube will find itself accused of political bias, discrimination, racism and homophobia at various stages of this process. By reducing the number of channels able to monetise, YouTube shifts its moderation task from impossible to merely incredibly difficult. YouTube will be watching its algorithms closely. It will analyse how often the algorithms miss something, and if it becomes a sufficiently rare occurrence, expect this human moderation layer to be removed as soon as YouTube feels it's ready to take the risk.

"Bosses and directors of Carillion will not get bonuses or severance payments, the government has said. The Insolvency Service said no such payments had been made since the construction firm collapsed on Monday. The announcement comes as work on Carillion's public sector construction sites is paused pending decisions about their future. However, work on most of its private sector service contracts, such as catering and cleaning, will carry on. Carillion's customers want existing services to continue until new suppliers can be found and will provide funding to retain staff for the moment. Several former executives of the firm would have received pay and benefits this year. Carillion had agreed to keep paying former chief executive Richard Howson a Â£660,000 salary and Â£28,000 in benefits until October as part of his departure deal. Former finance chief Zafar Khan, who left Carillion in September, was due to receive Â£425,000 in base salary for 12 months Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane was due to be paid his Â£750,000 salary until July, despite being due to leave next month. On Wednesday, Business Secretary Greg Clark met representatives of some banks to seek assurances that they would support small businesses affected by the Carillion collapse. Afterwards, he said UK lenders were ready to give ""tailored support"" and flexibility when it came to repayments. About 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector face an uncertain future and are waiting to learn whether they will be able to get hold of money owed to them. HMRCsaid it will also help affected contractors,external, offering them more time to pay tax bills and providing workers with cash support through the tax credits system. Mapping Carillion's biggest construction projects Carillion was left with just Â£29m before going bankrupt 'Sites are silent and virtually deserted' Carillion apprentices among casualties At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the ""wildly excessive"" bonuses paid to Carillion directors. He also accused the government of negligence, saying it awarded contracts to Carillion even when it became clear the company had problems. Mr Corbyn also called on the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services. Mrs May said a third of government contracts with Carillion were agreed by the previous Labour administration, adding she wanted to provide ""good quality public services, delivered at best value to the taxpayer"". Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict Earlier GMB union boss Tim Roache had said the government's response to the Carillion crisis had been ""inadequate and inept"". He said that his union had called on Mr Clark to set up a task force to help private sector companies and employees affected by Carillion's collapse. He called on other private sector companies to take on affected workers without a change in their terms and conditions - a process that he admitted would not be a short one.

He toldBBC 5 live Breakfastthey had withdrawn the cleaner they had working full-time in a local prison. ""We'd been chasing them for money, we hadn't been paid since July and when we heard the rumours about a week-and-a-half ago that Carillion were in a lot of trouble, we really pressed. ""Fortunately for ourselves, we did actually get paid the money that was owed to us for the work that she'd done between August and November. ""We've pulled our cleaner out at the moment and we're just still waiting to hear from them what's happening next before we send her back in again. ""It looks like we are going to lose the December invoice money that we've sent them and obviously the first two weeks of January. ""It's been an ongoing battle since we've been in there to get paid and we're not prepared to take the risk while they're in liquidation. ""Until we see something in black and white saying that, 'Yes, you will get paid on these set terms,' then we will consider sending our cleaner back in again."" Carillion went into liquidation on Monday after rescue talks with its lenders and the government failed to reach a deal. The UK's second-biggest construction company ran into trouble after losing money on big contracts and running up debt of about Â£1.5bn. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, including 20,000 in the UK, and the government has said staff and contractors working on public sector contracts will continue to be paid.

"Jerry Chun Shing Lee began working for the CIA in 1994, the US justice department says A former CIA officer has been arrested in the US on charges of retaining classified information in a case thought to be linked to the crippling of the agency's spy operation in China. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, a naturalised US citizen, was held at New York's JFK airport on Monday, the US justice department said. He worked for the CIA between 1994 and 2007, when he left for Hong Kong. In 2012 the FBI began investigating the disappearance of CIA agents in China. In the two years before, some 20 informants had been killed or jailed - one of the most disastrous failures of US intelligence in recent years. But officials did not know at the time whether to blame a mole or data hack. China crippled CIA by killing US sources, says New York Times US media, quoting sources close to the inquiry, say investigators now suspect Mr Lee of helping China. Chinese police guard the US embassy in the capital, Beijing 2010:Information gathered by the US from sources deep inside the Chinese government bureaucracy start to dry up 2011:Informants begin to disappear. It is not clear whether the CIA has been hacked or whether a mole has helped the Chinese to identify agents 2012:FBI begins investigation May 2014:Five Chinese army officers are charged with stealing trade secrets and internal documents from US companies. Later that same month, China says it has been a main target for US spies 2015:CIA withdraws staff from the US embassy in Beijing, fearing data stolen from government computers could expose its agents April 2017:Beijing offers hefty cash rewards for information on foreign spies May 2017:Four former CIA officials tell the New York Times that up to 20 CIA informants were killed or imprisoned by the Chinese between 2010 and 2012 June 2017:Former US diplomatic officer Kevin Mallory is arrested and charged with giving top-secret documents to a Chinese agent January 2018:Former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee is arrested Mr Lee, also known as Zhen Cheng Li, served in the US Army from 1982-86, say court documents. He began his CIA career in 1994 as a case officer trained in covert communications, surveillance detection, recruitment, and the handling and payment of assets (agents or informants), among other duties. He was given top secret clearance and signed several non-disclosure agreements. When Mr Lee left the CIA in 2007,""those who knew him said he left the agency disgruntled after his career plateaued"", reported the New York Times.,external Mr Lee remained in Hong Kong and only returned to America in 2012 to live in northern Virginia, the court documents say - according to one report lured by a fake job offer. The FBI's investigation into why the US was losing so many informants in China was by this point in full swing. FBI agents searched his hotel rooms,externalin Hawaii and Virginia and found two small books with secret records, the US justice department says. They contained handwritten notes on details such as ""true names and phone numbers of assets and covert CIA employees"". Mr Lee left the US in 2013 after being questioned on five occasions by FBI agents. He never mentioned his possession of the books containing classified information, say the court documents. He has only now been detained while on another visit. It's unclear whether he knew he was still under suspicion. The justice department says that Mr Lee, 53, has been charged ""with unlawful retention of national defence information and faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, if convicted"". He has not been charged with espionage, which can carry the death penalty - with some reports suggesting the US may not want to reveal secret information in court or that the FBI has struggled to gather the quality of evidence required to make a case for such a charge. The court documents make no mention of any covert link between Mr Lee and the Chinese state, but sources close to the investigation say this is the suspicion. Mr Lee appeared in Brooklyn federal court on Tuesday after being arrested at JFK. He is being held there while awaiting transfer to Virginia, where a federal court has brought the charges against him. If Washington's reported suspicions are correct, this case has had enormous repercussions. Some 18-20 informants may have been killed as part of China's attempts to dismantle the US intelligence operation on its soil. But it's only the latest chapter in a long saga of espionage and counter-espionage between the US and China - one, say analysts, that should not be eclipsed by the focus on Russian covert activities. Tech giants have been banned from both countries amid concerns about industrial espionage. In more recent years, concerns about cyber hacking have come to the fore. In May 2014,five Chinese army officers were charged with hacking into US companies in a bid for competitive advantage. Just a week later,China accused the US of using the internet to spy on its leaders and leading institutions. Earlier that year, former CIA contractor Edward Snowden claimed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was hacking thousands of Chinese computer networks.

"This video can not be played Dr Jackson on President Trump: 'He has incredible genes' US President Donald Trump has shown no abnormal signs following a cognitive exam and is in excellent health, his White House doctor says. ""I have no concerns about his cognitive ability or neurological functions,"" Ronny Jackson said on Tuesday. Last week,Mr Trump, 71, had a three-hour examination,externalin his first medical check-up since becoming US president. It comes after the release of a controversial book fuelled speculation about the president's mental health. Speaking to reporters during a White House briefing on Tuesday, Dr Jackson said that the president's overall health was ""excellent"". Quiz: Could you pass Trump's brain test? ""All data indicates the president is healthy and will remain so for the duration of his presidency,"" he said. ""He continues to enjoy the significant long-term cardiac and overall health benefits that come from a lifetime of abstinence from tobacco and alcohol,"" he added. When asked by a reporter how a man who consumes fried chicken and Diet Coke and does not exercise could be in good shape, Dr Jackson replied: ""It's called genetics... He has incredible genes."" However, Dr Jackson added that Mr Trump could benefit from a lower-fat diet and more exercise. Trump's medical: The checklist The debate over Trump's mental health Did Trump forget the national anthem? On Friday, the president was examined by military doctors at the Walter Reed Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, in tests that were said to have gone ""exceptionally well"". Among them was Dr Jackson, whose official title is Physician to the President. A rear admiral in the US Navy,he also tended to Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.,external To check for possible cognitive dysfunction, the US Department of Veterans Affairs uses the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) neuropsychological test. The MoCA test assesses an individual's attention and concentration, memory, language, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation - among other functions. Questions have been raised about the president's cognitive ability, particularly with the publication of Michael Wolff's book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. Some neurological experts had compared earlier clips of Mr Trump speaking with more recent instances in which he had used fewer words and appeared to ramble. Wolff has alleged the president is intellectually incapable of carrying out his role and questioned his mental fitness. He claimedall of the president's White House aides saw him as a ""child"" who needed ""immediate gratification"". Mr Trump responded by saying Wolff's book was ""full of lies"", while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson dismissed suggestions the president's mental health was failing. In December 2015, Mr Trump's own long-time doctor, Harold Bornstein, declared in a pre-election assessment that his client would be the ""healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency"".

"Ben Bradley became the MP for Mansfield in June 2017 A Conservative MP has apologised for a 2012 blog post in which he suggested benefit claimants should have vasectomies. In the post Ben Bradley, made Tory vice-chairman for youth in last week's reshuffle, hit out at what he called a ""vast sea of unemployed wasters"". Apologising, he said he had matured since writing the now-deleted remarks, which were highlighted byBuzzfeed,external. Labour attacked him over the ""repulsive comments"". Young MP wants to 'fix Tory image problem' The 28-year-old Mansfield MP had been writing in support of the benefits cap. ""Sorry but how many children you have is a choice; if you can't afford them, stop having them! Vasectomies are free,"" his post read. ""Families who have never worked a day in their lives having four or five kids and the rest of us having one or two means it's not long before we're drowning in a vast sea of unemployed wasters that we pay to keep!"" After they were highlighted by Buzzfeed, he said: ""I apologise for these posts. My time in politics has allowed me to mature and I now realise that this language is not appropriate."" Cat Smith, Labour's shadow minister for youth affairs, said: ""These repulsive comments expose the Tories' disgraceful attitude to unemployed people. ""That they come from a man Theresa May chose as a vice chair of her party speaks volumes. The nasty party is alive and well."" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said it ""beggars belief that someone who has shown such contempt for young people who are out of work has been tasked by the prime minister to improve her party's appeal with young voters"". Mr Bradley became the first person in the newly-created role when he was promoted last week.

"YouTube creators will need to have more than 1,000 subscribers to earn money YouTube is introducing tougher requirements for video publishers who want to make money from its platform. In addition, it has said staff will manually review all clips before they are added to a premium service that pairs big brand advertisers with popular content. The moves follow a series of advertiser boycotts and a controversial vlog that featured an apparent suicide victim. One expert said that the Google-owned service had been slow to react. ""Google presents the impression of acting reactively rather than proactively,"" said Mark Mulligan, from the consultancy Midia Research. ""It needs to get better at acting faster."" The first part of the new strategy involves a stricter requirement that publishers must fulfil before they can make money from their uploads. Clips will no longer have adverts attached unless the publisher meets two criteria - that they have: at least 1,000 subscribers more than 4,000 hours of their content viewed by others within the past 12 months YouTube said that this represented a ""higher standard"" than the previous requirement of 10,000 lifetime views, which was introduced nine months ago. It blogged that thisshould help it combat,external""spammers, impersonators, and other bad actors"" as well as to prevent ""potentially inappropriate videos from monetising, which can hurt revenue for everyone"". This video can not be played WATCH: YouTube faced criticism for its ad crackdown last year YouTube faceda backlash from many of its creators, dubbed the ""adpocalypse"", last year when itprevented videos about some topicsbeing able to include adverts. This was in response to more than 200 major brands pulling campaigns over concern their ads had been attached to clips featuring hate speech and other extremist content. YouTube punishes Logan Paul over Japan suicide video Predatory comments prompt YouTube suspension YouTube tweaks advertising algorithm YouTube star criticises video site's leaders Mr Mulligan suggested the latest change should prove less controversial. ""In terms of impact on creators, this makes taking that first step to commercial status that bit harder to reach,"" he told the BBC. ""But given how much the platform is growing, higher benchmarks will be easier to meet now than they were a few years ago."" The second part of the effort focuses on theGoogle Preferred programme,external. This lets brands pay extra to attach their adverts to the top 5% of videos most popular with 18- to 34-year-olds. Until now, the process was automated. ButYouTube said it would manually review,externalall relevant content by the end of March. In theory, this process would have alerted YouTube to a controversial clip by vlogger Logan Paulat an earlier stage. At the end of last year, the 22 year-old American featured what appeared to be a dead man's body hanging from a tree in Japan's Aokigahara forest in one of his videos. Logan Paul is one of YouTube's most popular vloggers Mr Paul - who has more than 15 million subscribers - was excluded from Google Preferred last week as a consequence. YouTube had previously announced,externalthat it planned to have more than 10,000 workers reviewing clips in general on the service by the end of 2018. It appears to acknowledge that further steps will be necessary to prevent a similar scandal in the future, and said it intended to ""schedule conversations with our creators in the months ahead"" to discuss ways to address the problem. But Mr Mulligan suggested that YouTube still faced a fundamental problem. ""The Logan Paul experience highlights the risk that young creators like Logan have been shorn of the structure that their peers in traditional media have: the people to advise, guide and mentor them,"" he said. Manually and proactively reviewing videos on its most popular channels opens up a whole range of potential issues, even if that stipulation will apply only to those on its Google Preferred programme. Most notably, it removes YouTube's ability to duck behind its ""as soon as we were made aware"" defence when removing inappropriate content. Much like a traditional media company, it will need to make decency judgements, and the most skilled team in the world won't get it right 100% of the time. And when these hard decisions are made, don't expect YouTubers to like what the moderation team decides. Whether justified or not, YouTube will find itself accused of political bias, discrimination, racism and homophobia at various stages of this process. By reducing the number of channels able to monetise, YouTube shifts its moderation task from impossible to merely incredibly difficult. YouTube will be watching its algorithms closely. It will analyse how often the algorithms miss something, and if it becomes a sufficiently rare occurrence, expect this human moderation layer to be removed as soon as YouTube feels it's ready to take the risk.

"This video can not be played The station was evacuated and trains were cancelled A severe blaze which gutted part of a railway station could have been over within an hour if sprinklers had been installed, a fire chief has said. The fire at Nottingham station burned for 12 hours after a new section of the station caught fire on Friday. Incident commander Bryn Coleman said sprinklers could have halted the rapid spread of the blaze and limited the damage caused. Network Rail said it was ""inappropriate to comment"" during investigations. Mr Coleman, of Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue, told the BBC: ""There were no sprinklers going off and I don't believe that there are any sprinklers in the building. ""If it had been a fire contained to the toilet block you would be looking at probably an hour for a single room fire. ""The damage would have been less, the impact to the wider community would have been less because we wouldn't have had to close the rail station, the roads wouldn't have been closed, and we probably would have dealt with it with two fire appliances."" Firefighters arrived within minutes but the fire was already ""well developed"" by then A three-year refurbishment of the station was completed in 2014 at a cost of Â£60m. Keith Rhodes, from Nationwide Fire Sprinklers, said a sprinkler system would have cost about Â£70,000 for a pump room and water tank, then another Â£15 for every square metre of the building to be protected. Fire protection consultant Stewart Kidd said there is no legal requirement to fit sprinklers at railway stations, but he believes they should have been fitted at Nottingham. ""I think sprinklers are the simplest solution to fire safety problems,"" said Mr Kidd, a former director of the national safety body the Fire Protection Association. He said toilets are a ""favourite arson point"" and it is important to have sprinklers in vulnerable areas such as these. ""Typically it's paper towels or toilet paper being stacked up and set on fire. If that happens then one sprinkler head would have opened,"" he said. ""It would have kicked out about 70 or 80 litres of water a minute which would have either extinguished the fire completely or certainly suppressed it and stopped it spreading."" Most of the fire damage is to the new Southern Concourse part of the station Mr Coleman described the spread of the fire on Friday as ""rapid"" and 12 appliances were at the station at the height of the 12-hour blaze. The fire, which is being treated as arson, started in a women's toilet block in a new part of the station called the Southern Concourse. Nottingham station fire: What do we know? Nottingham railway station reopens after huge fire Nottingham rail station fire being treated as arson The initial two fire crews got there within minutes of being called at about 06:30 GMT, as the fire station is only 500 metres (0.3 miles) away from the railway station. However, by then the fire was already ""well developed"", Mr Coleman said. ""It had been a rapidly developing fire and the reasons behind that are still under investigation between ourselves and British Transport Police,"" said Mr Coleman. ""Our fire protection team will be working with Network Rail's engineers to look at the build, to look at the building construction and how it's all been put together."" The fire started spreading along a wooden bridge that goes across some of the platforms Network Rail, which owns the building, has previously declined to tell the BBC whether or not sprinklers had been fitted, or give details of other fire safety measures. Mr Coleman said: ""If sprinklers would have been fitted that would have been part of our operational tactics and they [the building's owners] would have made us aware of that. ""Sprinklers undoubtedly save lives and limit fire damage and that's why the National Fire Chiefs Council promote them, but of course there's an impact and cost to businesses from installing them. ""It's a bit like having an insurance policy. Nobody likes paying for an insurance policy until they have an incident or a fire, and then they wish they had installed them. ""We can't legislate for them, unfortunately, because we're a fire and rescue service and not the government.""

"Bannon recently upset President Trump with reported comments to author Michael Wolff Steve Bannon, ex-chief strategist to US President Donald Trump, has refused to answer a broad range of questions at a committee hearing probing alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mr Bannon was called to testify to the House Intelligence Committee about his time working for Mr Trump. He was questioned behind closed doors on Tuesday in a 10-hour meeting. Mr Bannon's lawyer relayed questions to the White House, and was told when not to respond, AP news agency reports. A Democrat on the committee said Mr Bannon was under a White House ""gag order"". Representative Adam Schiff said that Mr Bannon's lawyer had cited ""executive privilege"" - which allows the president to keep information from the public. He said that Mr Bannon had refused to answer questions related to his time at the White House, or the transition to the new administration. ""Steve Bannon and his attorney asserted a remarkably broad definition of executive privilege,"" Jim Himes, a Democratic member of the committee, told CNN. The panel issued a subpoena to compel him to return for a second round. His first appearance was voluntary. Mr Bannon's representatives have made no comment. The rise and fall of Steve Bannon Asked if the White House had told him not to answer certain questions, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: ""No-one has encouraged him to be anything but transparent."" She said Congress had to consult with the White House prior to obtaining confidential material. Bannon has said his comments about Donald Trump Jr (R) were misquoted Republican member Mike Conaway told the press that Mr Bannon was ""not an executive"", and the committee was ""going to resolve the issues to get the answers''. Earlier on Tuesday, it was reported that Mr Bannon had been issued with another subpoena, this time from former FBI director Robert Mueller, who is leading the inquiry into alleged Russian collusion during the 2016 election campaign. Mr Bannon ""intends to fully cooperate with Mueller"", a source told Axios, a Washington DC political news outlet. All you need to know about the Trump-Russia story US grand juries explained Mr Mueller's grand jury and the Congressional panel are separate investigations. FBI agents went to Mr Bannon's home in Washington DC last week to serve him with the grand jury subpoena, according to NBC News. But the agents were unaware that he had retained a lawyer, William Burck, who is also representing two other ex-Trump officials that have been questioned as part of the Mueller probe. The agents then delivered the order to Mr Burck instead, the networks reports. He helped shape Mr Trump's ""America First"" election campaign message and served as one of his closest aides before being pushed out of his role in August. He recently fell out with Mr Trump publicly after reportedly making comments about the president and his family in a newly published book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, by Michael Wolff. He was quoted as calling a meeting in June 2016 between Mr Trump's son Donald Jr and a group of Russians ""treasonous"". The House Intelligence Committee is one of four investigations being conducted by Congress into the alleged collusion, with others launched by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee. Four people have been charged: Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Rick Gates, a campaign aide, pleaded not guilty to all charges including allegations of money laundering unrelated to the 2016 election George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign adviser, admitted lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to the Trump administration, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over meetings he had with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak This video can not be played Trump voters grade president's first year Has Trump made the world more dangerous?

"A minister for loneliness, a project first started by the late MP Jo Cox, has been announced by Downing Street. Tracey Crouch said she was proud to take on the ""generational challenge"" to tackle an issue affecting about nine million UK people, young and old. The 42-year-old said she would work across political parties in the role. The Commission on Loneliness was first set up by Ms Cox,who was killed before the EU referendum. A 2017 report said loneliness was asharmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. UK must tackle loneliness, says report Cold and loneliness 'lethal in winter' Young women get lonely too Is modern life making us lonely? In a statement, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Jo Cox recognised the scale of loneliness across the country and dedicated herself to doing all she could to help those affected."" She said the new ministerial role would continue Ms Cox's legacy, with the post holder working with the commission, businesses and charities to create a government strategy. Ms Crouch, MP for Chatham and Aylesford since 2010, told BBC Breakfast a multi-million pound fund would help her pull together existing work being carried out on loneliness to create a framework for the future. Asked whether part of the problem lay with local authority cuts leading to library and day centre closures, she said these were all challenges and would be looked at, and stressed there was no single solution. Tracey Crouch says she's ""hugely proud"" to be given the role In December 2017 NHS England's chief nursing officer, Prof Jane Cummings, said cold weather andloneliness could be lethal in the winter months. She said ""simple acts of companionship"" could make all the difference. An estimated half of people aged 75 and over live alone - about two million people across England - with many saying they can go days, even weeks, with no social interaction at all. Ms Crouch said: ""This is an issue that Jo cared passionately about and we will honour her memory by tackling it, helping the millions of people across the UK who suffer from loneliness."" Jo Cox's husband,Brendan, tweeted:,external""One of the awful things about losing Jo is knowing how much difference she would have made in the world."" He said he would tell his children that even though she's not here, she's ""still making the world a better place"". Start a conversation. Stop and talk. Don't hurry them.

"This video can not be played The station was evacuated and trains were cancelled A severe blaze which gutted part of a railway station could have been over within an hour if sprinklers had been installed, a fire chief has said. The fire at Nottingham station burned for 12 hours after a new section of the station caught fire on Friday. Incident commander Bryn Coleman said sprinklers could have halted the rapid spread of the blaze and limited the damage caused. Network Rail said it was ""inappropriate to comment"" during investigations. Mr Coleman, of Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue, told the BBC: ""There were no sprinklers going off and I don't believe that there are any sprinklers in the building. ""If it had been a fire contained to the toilet block you would be looking at probably an hour for a single room fire. ""The damage would have been less, the impact to the wider community would have been less because we wouldn't have had to close the rail station, the roads wouldn't have been closed, and we probably would have dealt with it with two fire appliances."" Firefighters arrived within minutes but the fire was already ""well developed"" by then A three-year refurbishment of the station was completed in 2014 at a cost of Â£60m. Keith Rhodes, from Nationwide Fire Sprinklers, said a sprinkler system would have cost about Â£70,000 for a pump room and water tank, then another Â£15 for every square metre of the building to be protected. Fire protection consultant Stewart Kidd said there is no legal requirement to fit sprinklers at railway stations, but he believes they should have been fitted at Nottingham. ""I think sprinklers are the simplest solution to fire safety problems,"" said Mr Kidd, a former director of the national safety body the Fire Protection Association. He said toilets are a ""favourite arson point"" and it is important to have sprinklers in vulnerable areas such as these. ""Typically it's paper towels or toilet paper being stacked up and set on fire. If that happens then one sprinkler head would have opened,"" he said. ""It would have kicked out about 70 or 80 litres of water a minute which would have either extinguished the fire completely or certainly suppressed it and stopped it spreading."" Most of the fire damage is to the new Southern Concourse part of the station Mr Coleman described the spread of the fire on Friday as ""rapid"" and 12 appliances were at the station at the height of the 12-hour blaze. The fire, which is being treated as arson, started in a women's toilet block in a new part of the station called the Southern Concourse. Nottingham station fire: What do we know? Nottingham railway station reopens after huge fire Nottingham rail station fire being treated as arson The initial two fire crews got there within minutes of being called at about 06:30 GMT, as the fire station is only 500 metres (0.3 miles) away from the railway station. However, by then the fire was already ""well developed"", Mr Coleman said. ""It had been a rapidly developing fire and the reasons behind that are still under investigation between ourselves and British Transport Police,"" said Mr Coleman. ""Our fire protection team will be working with Network Rail's engineers to look at the build, to look at the building construction and how it's all been put together."" The fire started spreading along a wooden bridge that goes across some of the platforms Network Rail, which owns the building, has previously declined to tell the BBC whether or not sprinklers had been fitted, or give details of other fire safety measures. Mr Coleman said: ""If sprinklers would have been fitted that would have been part of our operational tactics and they [the building's owners] would have made us aware of that. ""Sprinklers undoubtedly save lives and limit fire damage and that's why the National Fire Chiefs Council promote them, but of course there's an impact and cost to businesses from installing them. ""It's a bit like having an insurance policy. Nobody likes paying for an insurance policy until they have an incident or a fire, and then they wish they had installed them. ""We can't legislate for them, unfortunately, because we're a fire and rescue service and not the government."" Mr Coleman said the investigation would look at whether or not the railway station complied with regulations. The older part of the station, shown here on the day of the fire, has ""largely escaped unscathed"" Network Rail said in a statement: ""Every station is assessed for fire safety and regularly reviewed. ""If there is anything we can learn from the official investigations we will, of course, do so but it is inappropriate to comment on detail while those investigations are ongoing.""

"An ECJ decision would affect all British nationals living in the EU Five UK nationals are going to court in the Netherlands in a campaign to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. They want a Dutch judge to press the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify their rights. The ECJ, if it decides to make a ruling, could guarantee such rights as freedom of movement after the UK leaves the European Union. An ECJ decision would affect all British nationals living in the European Union. The European court could rule that all member states must guarantee the rights of Brits in the respective states where they reside - under European law. About 42,500 British nationals live in the Netherlands. The interim deal thrashed out between the UK and Brussels in December does outline some of the rights British citizens in Europe will keep after Brexit, such as the ability to live and work on the continent. But some vital questions, like free movement, still swirl around. Some of the group of five say they have been disheartened by the confusion and speculation about what their life will be like after Brexit. Stephen Huyton, left, with his family, is among those taking legal action in the Netherlands ""Just because the UK voted to leave, it shouldn't be able to force citizens to give up their rights,"" says Stephen Huyton, one of the Brits taking the court action on Wednesday. The Netherlands does not currently allow foreigners to have dual nationality, in most cases. EU citizenship is described in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and includes the rights to: Travel and live anywhere in the EU Vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections in another EU country Get diplomatic protection and consular help from any other EU country in another part of the world Read more: Brexit: Could UK get âassociate EU citizenshipâ? Would Brexit violate UK citizens' rights? Mr Huyton, the European director of a US firm, has been living in the Netherlands for 24 years and has three children, with the youngest at university in the UK. Like other Brits who have been living outside the UK for more than 15 years, he was not eligible to vote in the EU referendum. ""My children are confronted by choices I don't think are fair or reasonable,"" he says. ""In the Brexit breakup, it feels as though they're just making up the rules as they go along. We feel as though we've been forgotten, so at least now people are noticing us."" The Dutch judge has the power to ask the ECJ for clarity on a point of law. It is then up to the ECJ to decide whether it needs to provide this. Many Brexit supporters resent the ECJ's power to overrule British court decisions on citizens' rights. Laywer Christiaan Alberdingk Thijm told the BBC his aim in the Dutch case was to establish the grounds under which Brits could lose their European citizenship. ""Can it be taken away from them?"" He added: ""Theresa May said, 'Brexit means Brexit' now we are trying to work out on behalf of these people, what that actually means. ""We know how important it is to so many people."" British barrister Jolyon Maugham QC, who is funding the legal action and has been behind other Brexit challenges, said the case raised ""a profoundly important question"", which would affect not only Brits living abroad. ""If the case is successful, all of us will continue to benefit from EU citizenship rights after Brexit."" But this could be ""politically awkward"" for the remaining 27 member states. ""It would take out of their hands the question of what rights UK citizens would enjoy after Brexit. ""Those rights would no longer be a matter of political gift - EU law would continue to guarantee EU citizenship rights to those who are UK citizens at the date of Brexit. It would, potentially, weaken their position at the negotiating table."" This is a small case relating to one specific group. But if their action is successful, they hope it will benefit some of the 1.2 million British nationals across the continent. Brexit: Could UK get âassociate EU citizenshipâ?

"The Bayeux Tapestry is 70m (230ft) long The Bayeux Tapestry is set to be displayed in the UK after France agreed it could leave its shores for the first time in 950 years, the BBC understands. French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce the loan during his visit to the UK on Thursday. He has said the tapestry - which depicts the Norman Conquest of England - would not be transferred before 2020. The Times said the loan was subject to the outcome of tests,externalto make sure the 11th Century artwork was safe to move. The tapestry tells the story of the future William I's conquest of England, culminating in the Battle of Hastings and the defeat of Harold in 1066. Bayeux Tapestry gets new ending The end of Saxon-ruled England The tapestry reimagined It is on permanent display at a museum in the town of Bayeux, in Normandy, and has very rarely been moved. However, President Macron is expected to announce the proposed loan at a meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May in the UK this week. The Times said the agreement was made after ""months of talks between culture department officials in London and Paris"" but it has not yet been decided where in the UK the tapestry will be displayed. Historians have long debated the origins of the tapestry, which is 70m (230ft) long and 50cm high. The earliest written reference to it is an inventory from Bayeux Cathedral in 1476, but little is known about how or why it was created. According to Reading Museum, which houses a replica of the tapestry,,externalit was ""probably commissioned"" in the 1070s by the half-brother of William the Conqueror - the Bishop Odo of Bayeux. Some say it was created by teams of nuns across England - not France - possibly in Canterbury, Kent. In 2012,a PhD researcher at the University of Manchestersaid the artwork's needlework was ""consistent throughout"", suggesting one group of specialist embroiderers worked on it, in the same place at the same time. The tapestry shows the events leading up to the Norman takeover of England. It starts with Edward the Confessor, who became king in 1042, on the throne and tells the story of his death and the questions over who was the rightful heir. In 1066, on the day of Edward's funeral, his brother-in-law Harold was crowned king. News of his appointment reached France and William of Normandy, who claimed he should be king as Edward had promised him the throne of England. Harold is crowned king after the death of Edward the Confessor On 14 October 1066, William I and King Harold II came to loggerheads at the Battle of Hastings - one of the most famous battles in English history. It is likely both sides had between 5,000 and 7,000 men each when they met in battle at a hilltop near Hastings. Thousands of soldiers were killed in a day of a fighting, which ended in King Harold II's death. It was a turning point in history as it ended the Anglo-Saxons's long reign of more than 600 years. When you can (and can't) eat carbs for dinner Is it time to stop hating the rat? 'Superheroes don't work 90-hour weeks' The tapestry shows a soldier being killed by an arrow in his eye, which could be King Harold Napoleon put the tapestry on display in Paris in 1804, while he was planning an invasion of England. It was then exhibited in Paris for the second time in 1944, during World War II, before it was returned to Bayeux. Mr Macron's offer comes after previous attempts to bring the tapestry to Britain failed. One request is thought to have been made ahead of the Queen's Coronation in 1953, while another was made for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings, in 1966. Some have suggested the tapestry could be relocated to the British Museum if it gets the go ahead to come to the UK. Dr Michael Lewis of the museum told the Victoria Derbyshire programme 1066 was a date ""we all know"" from being at school so it would be ""amazing"" if children could go and see the tapestry. ""For the wider public, people will be amazed about how long it is, and it definitely has a real impact when you see this work of art,"" he added. Tests will decide if the tapestry can be moved safely and get to the UK in one piece. BBC History magazine's Dr David Musgrove says its size, age and obvious fragility makes moving it a concern. But he told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme moving it would also present an opportunity to conduct some interesting historical research on its dyes and fabrics. Allow Twitter content?

The story that Harold was killed by an arrow in the eye is thought to have come from the tapestry. However, earlier sources dispute this and claim he was hacked to death by four Norman knights. Dr Levi Roach, a medieval historian at the University of Exeter, said the tapestry was confiscated for military use, for covering weapons, during the French Revolution, before a lawyer saved it. Tom Tugenhadt, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said the UK should ""definitely"" consider it. ""This is an opportunity for us to cement the relationship,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""One of the interesting items we might perhaps think about lending... is the Rosetta stone, which was discovered in Egypt."" According to the British Museum, it is likely that the stone was found by Napoleon Bonaparte's soldiers,externalwhile on a mission to threaten Britain's hold on India.

An estimated 40,000 children missed classes as about 300 schools were shut across Scotland on Wednesday. This video can not be played ""We were on the road for 12 hours"" The travel warning came after hundreds of drivers were stranded on Tuesday night on the main route between Scotland and England. Many drivers were stuck for up to 11 hours on the M74 in South Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway after HGVs blocked the lanes.

Elsewhere,a lorry rolled down a hill in North Lanarkshire, smashing into other vehicles and a fence,after two workmen got out to help clear the road. No-one was injured. This video can not be played A runaway lorry ploughed into cars before crashing on a snowy street. In a statement in the Scottish Parliament Mr Yousaf apologised to anyone who had been stuck on the M74 but said it was as a result of ""extremely challenging conditions"", with persistent snow at a level that had not been seen for a number of years. He also announced that police were upgrading their travel warning from level three to level four. ""That in practice means that all travel should be avoided on those parts of the trunk road affected by the amber warning, namely south and south-west Scotland for the duration of the amber warning,"" he said. Stein Connolly from Traffic Scotland said the evening commute began relatively smoothly on Wednesday. He told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive programme: ""The M74 is black, it's running OK. You can see quite a substantial snowfall on the fields next to the 74 and even along the centre but the actual road is clear right now."" He said he believed the level four ""do not travel"" warning had only been issued once before, in the high winds of January 2013. ""We really hope that after last night people do listen to us. Avoid the area. We don't want a repeat of last night. ""If you do go out there, you're putting yourself at risk and other people at risk."" Travel conditions are graded at four levels by police and transport officials depending on the severity of the weather. Level 1:Normaloperations - no severe weather. Level 2: Travel withcaution- police advise people that conditions for road travel may be hazardous. Level 3:High riskof disruption for road journeys - police advise that there is a high risk of disruption for road journeys. Travellers are likely to experience significant delays. Level 4:Avoidtravelling on the roads - journeys should be avoided. Severe delays expected. The Met Office has predicted persistent heavy snow, with travel delays likely on roads and a risk that some vehicles and passengers could become stranded. Delays or cancellations are likely to rail and air travel. Some rural communities are likely to become cut off and power cuts are ""probable"". Less severe yellow warnings remain in place with snow and ice forecast until Friday evening, with Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England likely to be affected. The amber warning extends until 05:00 on Thursday On Wednesday, thousands of pupils missed lessons as about 300 Scottish schools or nurseries were shut or partially closed as a result of the weather. Scottish Borders Council said no schools would open in its area on Wednesday or Thursday, with 15,000 pupils missing lessons and 26 schools were also shut in Dumfries and Galloway, affecting 4,000 students. In the Highland Council area, nearly 150 schools and nurseries were shut or partially closed, affecting 15,000 pupils. Nearly 30 schools and nurseries were closed in South Lanarkshire and there are also a number of schools shut in East Ayrshire, Stirling, Falkirk and Perth and Kinross. This video can not be played Video released by a Dumfries and Galloway rescue team shows difficult driving conditions Overnight travel on the M74 was particularly difficult around junction 12 in South Lanarkshire southbound and between junctions 14 and 15 northbound. One driver stuck on the northbound carriageway of the M74, Fergus McCann, said the impatience of other drivers had made things worse. He told the BBC: ""There's been a fair bit of impatient driving going on. ""People are in one queue, then people are cutting out and trying to go down lanes that clearly are not for driving on. ""It's not a surprise that you're getting a few hundred yards down the road and you're seeing them facing the wrong way."" Steve Harris became stranded on the M74 at 17:30 GMT and was still stuck between junctions 11 and 12 more than eight hours later. ""I've not moved really in the last four hours,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live at about 03:00 GMT. ""I've managed to get out of my car a couple of times to stretch my legs. The snow is probably between four and six inches deep around the cars.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May: A plan to 'nurture' environment Three-fifths of new cars must be electric by 2030 to meet greenhouse gas targets, ministers have been warned. Homes also need to be built to a higher standard, the Committee on Climate Change - the official watchdog - says. The government says the UK is cutting emissions faster than any other G7 nation - and the committee agrees there has been a big shift under Theresa May. However, it says the UK will fall short of its ambitions unless ministers do more to turn pledges into reality. The warning comes less than a week afterthe prime minister launched a 25-year plan to protect the environment,including eradicating all avoidable plastic waste by 2042. The committee agrees the government's recently-published Clean Growth Plan is a big improvement, and says the UK has been a world leader in cutting emissions so far. But it argues that the plan still doesn't offer detailed policies to meet legal carbon targets. Petrol and diesel car ban: How will it work? Reality Check: Does pollution cut short 40,000 lives a year? Have the Tories blown hot and cold on the environment? Carbon capture from industry must be made to happen, it says, and wood and plastics should be banned from landfill in order to re-use them. More trees should be planted to soak up carbon dioxide, with a view to creating 70,000 hectares (173,000 acres) of new woodland by 2025, and farming must do more to cut emissions. Industry, too, is urged to take greater responsibility. The committee's chairman Lord Deben, told BBC News: ""If you're going to sell an electric car your dealers have got to understand these things, so training dealers is essential. ""If you're running a big fossil fuel company, you have to start thinking about the realities of when, not if, because it is not if any longer, we use a lot less fossil fuels."" He also criticised construction firms for only doing the ""absolute minimum"" required on building energy efficient homes. The committee points out that better insulated homes would cut people's bills as well as tackle climate change, and calls for more incentives to encourage ""able to pay"" households to install efficiency measures. Lord Deben said the Clean Growth Strategy had ""changed the tone"" of the government on the issue. ""These issues have been put into the centre of government policy - that's a major change."" Why switching to fully electric cars will take time Electric cars and cups of tea: Can we have both? But, he said, ambitions alone are not enough. ""The strategy doesn't deliver enough action to meet emissions targets in the 2020s and 2030s,"" he said. ""The government's policies will need to be firmed up as a matter of urgency and supplemented with additional measures if the UK is to deliver on legal commitments and secure its position as an international climate change leader."" He added: ""All departments now need to look at their contribution towards cutting emissions - including the Department for Transport."" This video can not be played Caroline Lucas: âWeâve been before with the Conservatives adopting a nice green sheen"" The committee wants 30% to 70% of new cars to be ultra-low emission by 2030, as well as up to 40% of new vans, as part of efforts to phase out sales of conventional petrol and diesel versions by 2040. Currently, fewer than 5% of new car sales are ""alternatively fuelled"", which also includes hybrid models. Prof Michael Grubb, from University College London, said: ""There are plenty of good ideas out there on low-carbon energy, cutting emissions from buildings, clean transport and more, but as the committee rightly points out, concrete plans need to be put in place, and soon. ""The government is making all the right noises on support for the low-carbon economy, but these must be turned into action: we need a year of decision-making."" Richard Black, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, agreed: ""We're not on track to meet emissions goals that kick in in just five years' time. ""That leaves ministers little time for enquiries and consultations - they're going to have to put new policies in place fast."" Mr Black suggested quick-win policies including: cutting company car tax for electric vehicles; repealing the ban on onshore wind power (the cheapest form of electricity generation), and re-starting the programme for Zero Carbon Homes. A business department spokesperson said: ""The scrutiny of the independent Committee on Climate Change plays an important role. ""The UK has reduced emissions on a per-person basis faster than any other G7 nation, and our clean growth strategy is the next ambitious milestone in our work to de-carbonise the UK. ""We have always said it is only the start of a process. ""Our proposals will continue to evolve - whether in response to costs of renewable energy coming down, improved evidence about climate change, wider trends in technology or the economic opportunities delivered through our industrial strategy.""

"Poppi Worthington was blue and not breathing when she was taken to hospital Prosecutors are considering the findings of a fresh inquest into the death of toddler Poppi Worthington after the coroner ruled she was sexually assaulted by her father. David Roberts concluded on the balance of probabilities that Poppi was abused before she died on 12 December 2012. Her father, Paul Worthington, denies the accusation. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it would look carefully at the judgement along with Cumbria Police. Mr Roberts, senior coroner for Cumbria, ruled,in a third court judgment on the case, that the 13-month-old died from asphyxia following the assault at her home in in Barrow-in-Furness. He said she died because her ability to breathe was compromised as a result of ""an unsafe sleeping environment."" 'Why did you hurt your daughter?' Latest updates as the coroner delivers his inquest findings Key dates in the Poppi investigation The inquest: Review of evidence, findings and conclusion,external During a three-week inquest at Kendal Coroner's Court, Poppi's father declined to answer 252 questions relating to the circumstances surrounding her death. However, Mr Worthington did tell the hearing he had gone to get Poppi a fresh nappy and a few minutes later he reached over and found her limp. The toddler was pronounced dead at Furness General Hospital shortly after. Paul Worthington denies abusing his daughter and has faced no charges Mr Roberts said: ""A coroner must adjourn an inquest and notify the Director of Public Prosecutions , if during the course of an inquest, it appears to the coroner that the death of the deceased is likely to have been due to a homicide offence and that a person may be charged in relation to the offence. ""For the reasons that should be clear from my conclusion that provision did not apply. That said I have sent a copy of my decision to the CPS for their consideration. ""It is a matter for the CPS to consider my decision, not for me to make recommendations."" Despite the coroner's conclusion, the CPS has said the prospects of another criminal investigation remain slim. The burden of proof in a criminal court is higher than that of a coroner's court and the CPS must be confident of a conviction before it sanctions any re-investigation. It has previously said it would be difficult to secure a conviction because of the lack of physical evidence. Rule 25 of the Coroners (Inquest) Rules 2013 state that ""a coroner must adjourn an inquest and notify the Director of Public Prosecutions, if during the course of an inquest, it appears to the coroner that the death of the deceased is likely to have been due to a homicide offence and that a person may be charged in relation to the offence"". Mr Roberts was clear that provision did not apply. He has sent, as is normal practice, a copy of his conclusions to the CPS, but did not and cannot make any recommendations as to what actions, if any, should follow. A spokesman for the CPS said: ""We have received a copy of the coroner's decision and will now consider this carefully in liaison with Cumbria Constabulary."" Minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability, Victoria Atkins, added: ""The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Poppi Worthington are extremely distressing. ""We were deeply concerned about the findings in the Independent Police Complaints Commission report into Cumbria Constabulary last year. ""Cumbria Constabulary have accepted their failings in this case. We trust improvements will continue in order to keep vulnerable people safe from harm."" Cumbria coroner David Roberts oversaw the inquest Poppi's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has called for prosecutors to re-examine the case following Monday's ruling, which mirrored two fact-finding judgments by a High Court family judge in 2014 and 2016 that Mr Worthington abused his daughter shortly before her death.

"Jerry Chun Shing Lee began working for the CIA in 1994, the US justice department says A former CIA officer has been arrested in the US on charges of retaining classified information in a case thought to be linked to the crippling of the agency's spy operation in China. Jerry Chun Shing Lee, a naturalised US citizen, was held at New York's JFK airport on Monday, the US justice department said. He worked for the CIA between 1994 and 2007, when he left for Hong Kong. In 2012 the FBI began investigating the disappearance of CIA agents in China. In the two years before, some 20 informants had been killed or jailed - one of the most disastrous failures of US intelligence in recent years. But officials did not know at the time whether to blame a mole or data hack. China crippled CIA by killing US sources, says New York Times US media, quoting sources close to the inquiry, say investigators now suspect Mr Lee of helping China. Chinese police guard the US embassy in the capital, Beijing 2010:Information gathered by the US from sources deep inside the Chinese government bureaucracy start to dry up 2011:Informants begin to disappear. It is not clear whether the CIA has been hacked or whether a mole has helped the Chinese to identify agents 2012:FBI begins investigation May 2014:Five Chinese army officers are charged with stealing trade secrets and internal documents from US companies. Later that same month, China says it has been a main target for US spies 2015:CIA withdraws staff from the US embassy in Beijing, fearing data stolen from government computers could expose its agents April 2017:Beijing offers hefty cash rewards for information on foreign spies May 2017:Four former CIA officials tell the New York Times that up to 20 CIA informants were killed or imprisoned by the Chinese between 2010 and 2012 June 2017:Former US diplomatic officer Kevin Mallory is arrested and charged with giving top-secret documents to a Chinese agent January 2018:Former CIA officer Jerry Chun Shing Lee is arrested Mr Lee, also known as Zhen Cheng Li, served in the US Army from 1982-86, say court documents. He began his CIA career in 1994 as a case officer trained in covert communications, surveillance detection, recruitment, and the handling and payment of assets (agents or informants), among other duties. He was given top secret clearance and signed several non-disclosure agreements. When Mr Lee left the CIA in 2007,""those who knew him said he left the agency disgruntled after his career plateaued"", reported the New York Times.,external Mr Lee remained in Hong Kong and only returned to America in 2012 to live in northern Virginia, the court documents say - according to one report lured by a fake job offer. The FBI's investigation into why the US was losing so many informants in China was by this point in full swing. FBI agents searched his hotel rooms,externalin Hawaii and Virginia and found two small books with secret records, the US justice department says. They contained handwritten notes on details such as ""true names and phone numbers of assets and covert CIA employees"". Mr Lee left the US in 2013 after being questioned on five occasions by FBI agents. He never mentioned his possession of the books containing classified information, say the court documents. He has only now been detained while on another visit. It's unclear whether he knew he was still under suspicion. The justice department says that Mr Lee, 53, has been charged ""with unlawful retention of national defence information and faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, if convicted"". He has not been charged with espionage, which can carry the death penalty - with some reports suggesting the US may not want to reveal secret information in court or that the FBI has struggled to gather the quality of evidence required to make a case for such a charge. The court documents make no mention of any covert link between Mr Lee and the Chinese state, but sources close to the investigation say this is the suspicion. Mr Lee appeared in Brooklyn federal court on Tuesday after being arrested at JFK. He is being held there while awaiting transfer to Virginia, where a federal court has brought the charges against him. If Washington's reported suspicions are correct, this case has had enormous repercussions. Some 18-20 informants may have been killed as part of China's attempts to dismantle the US intelligence operation on its soil. But it's only the latest chapter in a long saga of espionage and counter-espionage between the US and China - one, say analysts, that should not be eclipsed by the focus on Russian covert activities. Tech giants have been banned from both countries amid concerns about industrial espionage. In more recent years, concerns about cyber hacking have come to the fore. In May 2014,five Chinese army officers were charged with hacking into US companies in a bid for competitive advantage. Just a week later,China accused the US of using the internet to spy on its leaders and leading institutions. Earlier that year, former CIA contractor Edward Snowden claimed that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was hacking thousands of Chinese computer networks.

"The NHS is ""haemorrhaging"" nurses with one in 10 now leaving the NHS in England each year, figures show. More than 33,000 walked away last year, piling pressure on understaffed hospitals and community services. The figures - obtained by the BBC from NHS Digital - represent a rise of 20% since 2012-13, and mean there are now more leavers than joiners. Nurse leaders said it was a ""dangerous and downward spiral"", but NHS bosses said the problem was being tackled. Video: How nursing has changed over time Jobs you never knew nurses did The figures have been compiled as part of an in-depth look at nursing by the BBC. We can reveal: More than 10% of the nursing workforce have left NHS employment in each of the past three years The number of leavers would be enough to staff more than 20 average-sized hospital trusts More than half of those who walked away in the last year were under the age of 40 Leavers outnumbered joiners by 3,000 last year, the biggest gap over the five-year period examined by the BBC Brexit may have had an impact. Since the referendum the NHS has gone from EU joiners outnumbering leavers to the reverse - more leavers than joiners Nurses are being pulled off research work, special projects and admin roles to plug the gaps Other parts of the UK are also experiencing problems retaining nurses. In Northern Ireland and Scotland, the leaver rates are rising. In the most recent years, 7.5% of nurses left NHS employment in Northern Ireland and 7.2% did so in Scotland. But in both nations, the number of joiners outnumbered leavers. In Wales there were more leavers than joiners, according to Freedom of Information reports. This video can not be played Mary Trevelyan quit the NHS two-and-a-half years after graduating One of the nurses who has left the NHS is Mary Trevelyan. She was working as a staff nurse in a London hospital, but quit last year after the pressures of the job left her stressed and depressed. She had only worked in the NHS for two-and-a-half years. ""I want to be a great nurse and I want to give my patients my best, but I feel that I can't do that at the moment because we're just too short-staffed, too busy, there are far too many things for us to be doing. ""I want to work for the NHS, it's such a brilliant thing, [but] I don't think I can."" She is now living with her family in Cornwall. She says she has not decided what to do next, but is considering moving abroad. ""A few of my friends have gone. I think they've just got a better quality of life nursing overseas, which is very sad."" The figures do not show where these nurses went, although the BBC has been told the private sector, including agencies, drug firms and hospitals, is particularly popular. But the figures will also include those moving abroad or leaving nursing altogether to pursue other careers. A fifth of leavers in the past year were over 55 - the age at which nurses can start retiring on a full pension. Royal College of Nursing head Janet Davies said: ""The government must lift the NHS out of this dangerous and downward spiral. ""We are haemorrhaging nurses at precisely the time when demand has never been higher. ""The next generation of British nurses aren't coming through just as the most experienced nurses are becoming demoralised and leaving."" She said nurses needed a pay rise and more support if the vacancy rate - currently running at one in nine posts - was not to increase further. ""Most patient care is given by NHS nurses and each time the strain ratchets up again they are the ones who bear the brunt of it,"" she added. It also says more must be done to support younger nurses at the start of their careers. The chief nursing officer for England, professor Jane Cummings, admitted there was a problem - but said changes were being made to highlight the value of the NHS to new talent and retain current staff. ""We do lose people that need to be encouraged. We're in the process of bringing in lots of nurse ambassadors that are going to be able to talk about what a great role it is, to be able to tell their story, so we can really encourage people to enter the profession and for those in the profession, to stay in it,"" she said. The regulator, NHS Improvement, is rolling out a retention programme to help the health service reduce the number of leavers. More than half of hospitals and all mental health trusts are getting direct support. Master classes are also being organised for all directors of nursing and HR leads. The support is prompting hospitals to adopt a range of initiatives. Some have introduced internal ""transfer"" systems, allowing nurses to move jobs more easily, and mentoring schemes have been started for newly qualified nurses, while in some places, staff can ask for ""itchy feet"" interviews where they get the opportunity to talk to bosses about why they might leave. Others have introduced staff awards and worked with local businesses to offer workers discounts and benefits at shops and gyms. England's chief nurse Prof Jane Cummings acknowledged there was a ""workforce problem"" and it was becoming more of a challenge retaining nurses. But she said the NHS was learning by making nursing more attractive. ""We are beginning to see some fantastic good practice giving people flexible, rewarding careers. The key is getting it everywhere."" She also said in the future the number of joiners should rise. The government is increasing the number of nurse training places by 5,000 this year - a rise of 25%. But it will be three years before these nurses graduate. The Department of Health and Social Care in England has been quick to point out that the number of nurses employed by the NHS has risen. They have picked May 2010 - the point when the coalition government was formed - as the starting point, claiming there are ""11,700 more nurses on our wards"". That relates to the rise in hospital nurses - up from 162,500 full-time equivalents. But if you look at the entire nursing workforce, the numbers have only risen by just under 3,000 to 283,853 on the latest count - a rise of 1%. The population will have grown by 5% during this period, according to the Office for National Statistics. And if you look at nearly any measure of NHS demand - from GP referrals and diagnostic tests to emergency admissions and A&E visits - the increase is somewhere between 10% and 20%. What is more, if you take the last 12 months, the number of nurses has started falling and the number of vacant posts is rising. Even taking into account the rising number of nurses in training, the health service will only be able to ensure it has enough nurses by tackling retention.

"Joshua Wong was the face of the 2014 protests A Hong Kong court has jailed activist Joshua Wong for three months, his second prison sentence related to the 2014 pro-democracy protests. Along with other activists he was found guilty of contempt of court for blocking clearance of a protest site. He had been on bail pending an appeal against another six-month term in a separate case linked to the protests. Wong was the public face of the protests against the perceived increase of authoritarian influence from China. Known as Umbrella Movement,the 2014 protests brought parts of central Hong Kong to a standstill for nearly three months. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts When Hong Kong languages get political Hong Kong's handover explained Ahead of the hearing, the 21-year old said he had ""no regrets"" about his part in the demonstrations. ""They can lock up our bodies but they can't lock up our minds,"" he said outside the court. Wong had pleaded guilty, deciding not to fight the charges. The court denied bail but granted a second hearing with Wong's lawyers for later on Wednesday on the matter. Fellow activist Raphael Wong was sentenced to four months and 15 days. Several other activists received suspended sentences. The pro-democracy protests bought an area of central Hong Kong to a standstill for weeks in 2014 In August 2017,Joshua Wong was jailed for six months for unlawful assembly. He had initially been sentenced to community service but the Hong Kong government appealed against that, arguing it was too lenient. His new conviction on Wednesday comes just one day after his lawyers had appealed against that separate six-month sentence. The courts will decide on the appeal for the separate charges at a later date. The student activist was at the heart of the mass demonstrationscalling for more democracy and protesting against Beijing's growing influence. The protesters were calling for free elections for Hong Kong's leadership but failed to achieve their goal. Several of their leaders, including Joshua Wong have since entered politics. Hong Kong was handed over from British rule to China in 1997 with Beijing agreeing to govern the territory under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". Under this Basic Law, Hong Kong would enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for the next 50 years.

"A future generation of MPs will seek to ""improve or undo"" Brexit if it does not work for young people, a former cabinet minister has said. Justine Greening - who quit as education secretary in last week's reshuffle - said MPs had a duty to make sure Brexit was ""sustainable"". She was speaking as the Commons debated the government's EU (Withdrawal) Bill. MPs have now voted to back the bill which means it moves to the House of Lords. Tusk: UK can still change its mind EU bill 'an assault on devolution' Ms Greening resigned from government last week after refusing the move from education to the Department for Work and Pensions she was offered by Prime Minister Theresa May. Speaking for the first time from the backbenches, the Putney MP said: ""I represent a very young constituency here in London. ""The bottom line is that looking ahead, if Brexit doesn't work for young people in our country in the end it will not be sustainable. ""When they take their place here they will seek to improve or undo what we've done and make it work for them. ""So we do absolutely have a duty in this House to look ahead and ensure that whatever we get is sustainable and works for them."" Asked about Ms Greening's comment, Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""The prime minister is clear that she is determined to deliver a Brexit which works for all sections of society. Of course that would include young people."" The draft EU bill has already been the subject of highly charged debate in the Commons, facing hundreds of attempts to change its wording and suffering one government defeat. Ministers were not expected to lose Wednesday evening's third reading vote, and it passed by 324 votes to 295. But there have been warnings of trouble further ahead when the House of Lords takes over. The government can seek to overturn any changes inflicted by the Lords. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and the EU (Withdrawal) Bill is a key part of the government's Brexit strategy. It aims to end the supremacy of EU law, which would be copied into UK law in order to ensure a smooth transition on Brexit day. Much has been said about Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, under which the UK gave formal notice of Brexit in March. But now the head of the European Commission has said the UK could always reapply to join - using Article 49. Article 49 sets out the procedure for new countries wanting to join the EU. On Tuesday EU Council chief Donald Tusk suggested the UK would be welcome to stay in the EU if it changed its mind about leaving - comments that were dismissed by Brexit campaigners. Speaking at the European Parliament on Wednesday, Mr Juncker said: ""We are not throwing the British out, we would like the British to stay, and if they so wish, they should be allowed to do so. ""In London, there was a rather irritated response to this proposal (to stay in the EU), but note that even if the British leave according to Article 50 then Article 49 would allow them to accede again and I would be happy to facilitate that.""

"This video can not be played The Carillion collapse: What does it mean? Carillion was in talks with the government since October as part of a desperate bid to stave off collapse, according to the chief executive. Keith Cochrane says the construction giant was left with just Â£29m in cash by the time it went bust on Monday. Until the last moments, directors still believed a rescue was possible, but banks became more demanding, he said. The details are included in a document Mr Cochrane has prepared as part of the insolvency process. His statement sets out attempts to save Britain's second-biggest construction company after three profits warnings and a collapse in the share price. Efforts to sell off parts of the business failed and Carillion's banks became more demanding, only agreeing fresh funding under tight new conditions that the company was unable to meet, the statement discloses. There had been regular meetings with the government and its advisers in the final few months of 2017, Mr Cochrane says. But on 31 December a ""formal request"" was made for support from the government. Are you a Carillion employee or contractor? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. ''Sites are silent and virtually deserted' Carillion apprentices given notice 'They've literally locked the gate' Watershed moment for privatisation? Carillion: Not alone in hitting problems Even as late as last weekend, directors believed that ""a constructive dialogue"" was underway with banks and the government about providing short-term funding. Directors wanted the government to ""guarantee"" more funding for four months while Carillion continued its restructuring, and be allowed to defer tax payments. Both requests were refused, according to Mr Cochrane. But his document adds that ""certain of the group's lenders took unilateral action which in the company's view undermined the group's efforts to conserve cash"". He singles out Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) as one of the banks that wanted to impose tough new lending conditions. RBS said in a statement to the BBC that it had ""provided considerable support and forbearance to Carillion over many months"". ""The judgement of the bank was that the restructuring plan put forward by the company was not viable and therefore we took the difficult decision not to extend further funding and increase our exposure to the business."" Running out of cash and owing more than Â£1.3bn to its banks, Carillion declared itself insolvent on Monday. Rather than attempt an orderly administration of Carillion in the hope of salvaging something from the business, the Official Receiver was appointed to liquidate the business. Accountants EY and PwC both rejected requests to become administrators because there was no money left to keep the company ticking over, Mr Cochrane says. Meanwhile, Treasury minister Liz Truss told the Commons on Tuesday that ""it would be completely wrong for a public company that got itself in this state to be bailed out by the state"". Business Secretary Greg Clark has asked for an investigation by the Official Receiver to be broadened and fast-tracked. The conduct of directors in charge at the time of the company's failure and previous directors will be examined. ""It is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation,"" said Mr Clark. ""Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously."" At the same time, the role of Carillion's auditor, KPMG, will be examined by the Financial Reporting Council. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, 20,000 in the UK, and had 450 contracts with the UK government. The government has said that staff and contractors working on public sector service contracts will continue to be paid. But there is concern that big projects, including the construction of hospitals and roads, will be delayed while the details are worked out. There are also big worries for an estimated 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector. Many are owed money and are waiting to find out if they will get any of it back. Andy Bradley is the managing director of Flora-tec, which is owed Â£800,000 by Carillion for landscaping services. ""The government actively encouraged businesses like mine... to get involved in public sector contracts, to make sure the little guy got a slice of the pie. ""When Carillion started to get into trouble last year we were considering that we would scale back our involvement with them. ""However... the government continued to give them billion-pound contract after billion-pound contract and that said to me, as a small supplier, that the government had done their due diligence. ""We were following the government lead... only to be given a sucker punch. ""I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. That's 10 people with mortgages, car loans, all that stuff. It's an absolute disgrace."" On Monday, the government said that firms working on Carillion's private contracts would be paid for another 48 hours. Butthe latest statement from the Insolvency Service,externalindicates there might be more flexibility. It says that the liquidator is talking to Carillion's private sector clients about which services will continue; however contracts will be ended if the client no longer wants to pay for them. ""No one has been dismissed at this point and staff will continue to be paid for the work they perform,"" a spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said. Carillion was hit by cost overruns on big projects, problems with contracts in the Middle East and a large deficit in the company pension scheme. Chief executive Richard Howson stepped down in Julylast year after a profit warning. There has been much criticism over the size of Mr Howson's pay award in 2016 which, including bonuses, totalled about Â£1.5m. Finance director Richard Adam, who retired in December 2016 after nine years at Carillion, received almost Â£1.1m in salary and bonuses in 2016. Are you a Carillion employee or contractor?

"Carillion apprentice Kyle Fitzsimmons is weeks away from achieving a higher level carpentry qualification ""I'm really worried I might lose access to all my work,"" says Kyle Fitzsimmons, who until Tuesday morning was studying for a higher level carpentry apprenticeship with Carillion in Liverpool. He and the rest of his class were getting on with their work at the training centre when their tutor was suddenly called to a meeting. When he came back, the tutor told the group they had to leave and that the electricity was about to be turned off. Someone would be in touch, the tutor told the apprentices. ""It all happened really quickly,"" says Kyle. Some members of the group found they could no longer access their work online. Kyle says he still can and is trying to print it off in case it disappears. He has just weeks to go before he qualifies and is desperate to get his certificate as he is hoping to travel to Australia to work as a carpenter there. This video can not be played Carillion apprentices 'sent home with no explanation' He joined Carillion straight out of school three years ago and has completed level one and two apprenticeships in carpentry and joinery - but the higher, level three qualification, is the one he really needs to get better paid work. The trainees work five days a week with local work-experience providers and then do block release courses in college for periods of up to eight weeks to improve their skills. Kyle says the whole experience has been frustrating, with tutors sometimes not turning up to teach the courses - but he persevered and has now all but achieved his goal. He says he has already been in touch with a local college and has a meeting to talk about completing his qualification there. Another apprentice, trainee bricklayer Jay Smith, told the BBC that nobody knew what to believe at his training centre in Birmingham. ""What I've been told is the centre has two weeks to come up with the money to pay its debts otherwise it's going to be sold or closed,"" he said. ""If it's sold, we're moved to a different training centre or another area -  but if it's closed, we lose the apprenticeships. ""Yesterday we saw people leaving, the man in charge of stock just left, he was the first to go. ""Then, we saw people high up in the office with their bags packed leaving. ""I saw another man going, and more people just with their bags packed going."" The Construction Industries Training Board estimates that Carillion has about 1,400 apprentices. CITB says it is working to secure the future of the apprentices and hopes a package of grants and transfer incentives it is putting together will ""encourage construction employers to enable these apprentices to join their existing workforce"". ""CITB's priority is to do all it can to ensure that Carillion apprentices can continue their training so their skills are not lost,"" said chief executive Sarah Beale. The Department for Education said the transfer of the training of Carillion apprentices to the CITB would help protect them. ""We will continue to work closely with the CITB to support apprentices to remain in existing placements or to find new employment with other local organisations so they can complete their training,"" an official said. Carillion apprentices can contact CITB on carillion.apprenticeshipsupport@citb.co.uk or 0344 994 4010.

"This video can not be played President Trump received a mixed reaction of cheers and boos US President Donald Trump was greeted with a mixture of cheers and boos as he took to the field for the national anthem during a college football game in Atlanta. But as The Star-Spangled Banner began to play, social media users turned their attention to his anthem etiquette. Mr Trump's supporters said they were proud to see him standing with his hand over his heart, while his critics said it looked as though he had forgotten the lyrics. He certainly didn't sing all of them. Video of the anthem shows Mr Trump getting off to a slow start. He appears to mouth some of the words while occasionally pausing and missing some out. Some lines and phrases are sung with gusto. The president can clearly be seen mouthing ""bright stars"" and he finishes with a flourish, smiling and singing ""the land of the free and the home of the brave"". What must Americans do during the anthem? Other lines are not sung at all. Whether or not he forgot the words is open for debate. He has been pictured singing the anthem in the past and has been vocal in his support of respecting it. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher has a theory that singing along in this instance is difficult for two reasons: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Flag Code,externalcovers aspects of etiquette when the anthem is played in some detail. The code is never enforced, however, and there is no punishment for breaching it. In the video, the president can be seen standing in the customary way, as stipulated by the code. It states that: During a rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. By contrast, his predecessor President Barack Obama famously neglected to put his hand over his heart during the 2008 election campaign. He said his grandfather had taught him to do this only during the pledge, and to only sing during the anthem. The code adds that military personnel and veterans should salute throughout the anthem. Civilians should stand with right hand over heart and military personnel should salute It makes no mention of whether the anthem should be sung. However, singing the Star-Spangled Banner is encouraged from school onwards - in some schools it is compulsory. In 1942 the National Anthem Committee wrote that ""it is of paramount importance that emphasis be placed upon the singing of the National Anthem"". Ultimately, it comes down to personal choice as to whether the president sings the anthem or just  stands respectfully. Barack Obama has done both, and said in 2016 that ""respecting and honouring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation"". Former President Ronald Reagan once said: ""I can't claim to know the words of all the national anthems in the world, but I don't know of any other that ends with a question and a challenge as ours does."" The president has been extremely vocal in urging respect for the US national anthem. On Monday, he tweeted: We want our flag respected - and we want our NATIONAL ANTHEM respected also!"". He has even changed the banner image on his Twitter account to a photograph of him standing during the anthem before the game. The banner image on the president's Twitter account is a photograph of him during the national anthem Mr Trump has also strongly criticised NFL stars kneeling during the anthem in protest against perceived racial injustice.He has previously insisted that players who fail to stand should be fired or suspended.

"It is a question that has dogged Donald Trump - fairly or otherwise - since he was elected president: is he mentally fit for office? The question has been raised again by the release of a new book by New York journalist Michael Wolff, which chronicles the first year of the Trump White House. The book - the accuracy of which has been disputed by the White House and queried by others - paints the president as impatient and unable to focus, prone to rambling and repeating himself. Mr Trump has hit back against Mr Wolff's account, claiming on Twitter to be a ""very stable genius"" whose ""two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart"". But the president's manner and speaking style have led to armchair diagnoses of a host of ailments, from Alzheimer's to narcissistic personality disorder - a controversial practice that has divided the medical profession.

The current flurry of speculation has been triggered by the book Fire and Fury, in which Mr Wolff writes that during the course of his access to the White House preparing the book, he witnessed people around President Trump become aware that ""his mental powers were slipping"". During the marketing campaign for the book, Mr Wolff said Mr Trump, 71, repeated himself often. Repetition can be caused by poor short-term memory, as well as by other factors. It can be a sign of dementia, which affects 5-8% of people aged 60 and over worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. ""Everybody was painfully aware of the increasing pace of his repetitions,"" wrote Mr Wolff.,external""It used to be inside of 30 minutes he'd repeat, word-for-word and expression-for-expression, the same three stories - now it was within 10 minutes."" Mr Wolff did not give any other context for the alleged repetitions. Mr Trump has blasted the book, calling it ""phony"" and ""full of lies"" and saying he did not authorise any access to the White House for Mr Wolff.

Psychologists had previously speculated about symptoms they purported to see in Mr Trump's behaviour. Several books came out on the topic within months of the Trump inauguration: The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump by Bandy X Lee, Twilight of American Sanity by Allen Frances and Fantasyland by Kurt Andersen. Dr Lee, who is a psychiatry professor at Yale, told a group of mostly-Democrat senators last month that Mr Trump was ""going to unravel, and we are seeing the signs"". But it's worth remembering that none of these people have treated Mr Trump, nor do they have close-up information on his state of mind. Anyone who has treated him would be going against ethics standards and, in most cases, federal law if they disclosed any details. In theory it could cost Mr Trump his job. Under the 25th amendment to the US Constitution, if the president is deemed to be ""unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office"", the vice-president takes over. His cabinet and the vice-president together would need to kick-start the process, so it's unlikely to happen, however many voices call for it. This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? Yes - presidents have suffered from mental ill health going right back to Abraham Lincoln, whose clinical depression prompted several breakdowns. More recently Ronald Reagan, who was president from 1981 to 1989, suffered confusion and seemed unsure of where he was at times - he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's five years after he left office. The 25th amendment has never been used to depose a sitting president. It is worth reiterating, there is no real evidence as nobody speaking publicly has examined the president. But some have suggested thatMr Trump may have symptoms which would point to Narcissistic Personality Disorder,external(NPD). People with this condition often show some three key characteristics,external, according to Psychology Today: Grandiosity, a lack of empathy for other people and a need for admiration They believe they are superior or may deserve special treatment They seek excessive admiration and attention, and struggle with criticism or defeat But the man who wrote the diagnostic criteria for NPD, Allen Frances, said a lack of obvious distress stopped him from saying Mr Trump had the condition. ""Mr Trump causes severe distress rather than experiencing it and has been richly rewarded, rather than punished, for his grandiosity, self-absorption and lack of empathy,"" he wrote. Experts debate Trump's mental health Trump like a child, says defiant author Wolff's book has prompted some to ask if Mr Trump might be suffering from cognitive decline. Repetition of stories and the way Mr Trump speaks have been put forward to back up the claims. Whenneurological experts compared clips of Mr Trump in the past with more recent footage,external, they found his manner of speaking had totally changed. In the past he spoke in long and complicated sentences, following thoughts through and using long adjectives while in more recent clips, he used fewer and shorter words, missed words out, rambled, and was more likely to use superlatives like ""the best"". In one instance during a speech in December, Trump lifted a glass awkwardly, with both hands This could be due to a neurological condition like Alzheimer's, some experts said, or it could be a symptom of nothing more sinister than age. Those who say the president is concealing cognitive decline point to a few other incidences where he seemed not to have full control over his own movements. There was one instance in December where he was giving a speech and lifted a glass awkwardly, with both hands. During another speech,he slurred through some of his words,external, which the White House blamed on a dry throat but some said could be a sign of something more serious. This video can not be played Viewers were left amazed at parts of Trump's Jerusalem announcement Motor function is driven by the brain's frontal lobe, which loses volume with age but also gets affected by a specific, relatively rare, type of dementia. According to the UK's National Health Service,external(NHS), frontotemporal dementia has symptoms including ""acting inappropriately or impulsively"", ""appearing selfish or unsympathetic"", ""overeating"", ""getting distracted easily"" and ""struggling to make the right sounds when saying a word"". Next week the president will undergo his first medical examination - a physical - since taking office. Well, there's the question. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press spokeswoman, said: ""It's disgraceful and laughable. ""If he was unfit, he probably wouldn't be sitting there, wouldn't have defeated the most qualified group of candidates the Republican Party has ever seen."" Some Republican lawmakers have dismissed the concerns as a partisan attack. Representatives Duncan Hunter of California and Mike Simpson of Idaho were said to have ""burst out laughing"" in February last year when told by news website The Hill that the Democrats were raising such questions. (Mr Simpson did say it was fair to question the president's ""judgment"",external, however.) But others have been more scathing. Following in the footsteps of Jeb Bush's assertion during the race for the presidency that ""the guy needs therapy"", Tennessee senatorBob Corker said in August that Mr Trump had not demonstrated the ""stability"" he needed,externalfor the role. Dr Frances previously said the debate was unfair - but to people suffering from mental illnesses. ""Bad behaviour is rarely a sign of mental illness, and the mentally ill behave badly only rarely,"" he said. ""It is a stigmatising insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr Trump (who is neither)."" Others have echoed this, withone columnist saying the debate would ""make people with mental-health needs more likely to stay closeted,external"". But professionals who have given their opinion on Mr Trump's psychological state say they have done so in order to warn the nation. In speaking out they have in fact broken their industry's own ethics - the decades-old Goldwater Rule prohibits psychiatrists from giving diagnosis about someone they have not personally evaluated. It was instated after a magazine asked thousands of experts in 1964 whether Republican nominee Barry Goldwater was psychologically fit to be president. He successfully sued the magazine's editor for libel after the results were published. The APA warned during the campaign that breaking the rule in trying to analyse the candidates in the presidential election was ""irresponsible, potentially stigmatising, and definitely unethical"". Given the rule against diagnosing from afar, some argue that there should be a system in place for diagnosing Mr Trump up close. ""A president could be actively hallucinating,external,"" writes the Atlantic, ""threatening to launch a nuclear attack based on intelligence he had just obtained from David Bowie, and the medical community could be relegated to speculation from afar."" In fact there is a law in the works for a committee to be required to assess the president's health - the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity (OCPC) Act. And despite the amount of space given to the topic of the president's mental health, many commentators recoil from it.Carlos Lozada writes in the Washington Post that this is reductive,external: ""There is something too simple about dismissing his misdeeds as signs of mental illness; it almost exonerates him, and us."" Former Harvard Law Schoolprofessor Alan Dershowitz says this approach is ""just dangerous"",external, writing: ""If we don't like someone's politics we rail against him, we campaign against him, we don't use the psychiatric system against him,"" He said people who thought the 25th Amendment would end the Trump presidency were putting ""hope over reality"". Only a ""major psychotic break"" would result in that, he said. Who is author of explosive Trump book?

"A satellite image shows half the UK under snow and cloud Drivers have been urged to stay off major roads unless absolutely necessary as a new snow storm approaches southern Scotland and northern England. A Met Office amber ""be prepared"" alert is now in place from 21:00 on Wednesday until 05:00 on Thursday. Scotland's Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said the authorities would be ""tested to our limit"". An estimated 40,000 children missed classes as about 300 schools were shut across Scotland on Wednesday. This video can not be played ""We were on the road for 12 hours"" The travel warning came after hundreds of drivers were stranded on Tuesday night on the main route between Scotland and England. Many drivers were stuck for up to 11 hours on the M74 in South Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway after HGVs blocked the lanes. More of your photos of snow from around Scotland Pictures of animals in the Scottish snow Snow roller - nature's own snowball Snow disruption in Northern Ireland Runaway lorry slides down icy street How cold is it where you are? Have you seen Sir Andy Flurry? Mountain rescue teams were sent to help drivers trapped in cars at Millbank and Beattock, checking they were warm and had adequate supplies. Elsewhere,a lorry rolled down a hill in North Lanarkshire, smashing into other vehicles and a fence,after two workmen got out to help clear the road. No-one was injured. This video can not be played A runaway lorry ploughed into cars before crashing on a snowy street. In a statement in the Scottish Parliament Mr Yousaf apologised to anyone who had been stuck on the M74 but said it was as a result of ""extremely challenging conditions"", with persistent snow at a level that had not been seen for a number of years. He also announced that police were upgrading their travel warning from level three to level four. ""That in practice means that all travel should be avoided on those parts of the trunk road affected by the amber warning, namely south and south-west Scotland for the duration of the amber warning,"" he said. Stein Connolly from Traffic Scotland said the evening commute began relatively smoothly on Wednesday. He told BBC Scotland's Newsdrive programme: ""The M74 is black, it's running OK. You can see quite a substantial snowfall on the fields next to the 74 and even along the centre but the actual road is clear right now."" He said he believed the level four ""do not travel"" warning had only been issued once before, in the high winds of January 2013. ""We really hope that after last night people do listen to us. Avoid the area. We don't want a repeat of last night. ""If you do go out there, you're putting yourself at risk and other people at risk."" Travel conditions are graded at four levels by police and transport officials depending on the severity of the weather. Level 1:Normaloperations - no severe weather. Level 2: Travel withcaution- police advise people that conditions for road travel may be hazardous. Level 3:High riskof disruption for road journeys - police advise that there is a high risk of disruption for road journeys. Travellers are likely to experience significant delays. Level 4:Avoidtravelling on the roads - journeys should be avoided. Severe delays expected. The Met Office has predicted persistent heavy snow, with travel delays likely on roads and a risk that some vehicles and passengers could become stranded. Delays or cancellations are likely to rail and air travel. Some rural communities are likely to become cut off and power cuts are ""probable"". Less severe yellow warnings remain in place with snow and ice forecast until Friday evening, with Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England likely to be affected. The amber warning extends until 05:00 on Thursday On Wednesday, thousands of pupils missed lessons as about 300 Scottish schools or nurseries were shut or partially closed as a result of the weather. Scottish Borders Council said no schools would open in its area on Wednesday or Thursday, with 15,000 pupils missing lessons and 26 schools were also shut in Dumfries and Galloway, affecting 4,000 students. In the Highland Council area, nearly 150 schools and nurseries were shut or partially closed, affecting 15,000 pupils. Nearly 30 schools and nurseries were closed in South Lanarkshire and there are also a number of schools shut in East Ayrshire, Stirling, Falkirk and Perth and Kinross. This video can not be played Video released by a Dumfries and Galloway rescue team shows difficult driving conditions Overnight travel on the M74 was particularly difficult around junction 12 in South Lanarkshire southbound and between junctions 14 and 15 northbound. One driver stuck on the northbound carriageway of the M74, Fergus McCann, said the impatience of other drivers had made things worse. He told the BBC: ""There's been a fair bit of impatient driving going on. ""People are in one queue, then people are cutting out and trying to go down lanes that clearly are not for driving on. ""It's not a surprise that you're getting a few hundred yards down the road and you're seeing them facing the wrong way."" Steve Harris became stranded on the M74 at 17:30 GMT and was still stuck between junctions 11 and 12 more than eight hours later. ""I've not moved really in the last four hours,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live at about 03:00 GMT. ""I've managed to get out of my car a couple of times to stretch my legs. The snow is probably between four and six inches deep around the cars.""

"Ben Bradley became the MP for Mansfield in June 2017 A Conservative MP has apologised for a 2012 blog post in which he suggested benefit claimants should have vasectomies. In the post Ben Bradley, made Tory vice-chairman for youth in last week's reshuffle, hit out at what he called a ""vast sea of unemployed wasters"". Apologising, he said he had matured since writing the now-deleted remarks, which were highlighted byBuzzfeed,external. Labour attacked him over the ""repulsive comments"". Young MP wants to 'fix Tory image problem' The 28-year-old Mansfield MP had been writing in support of the benefits cap. ""Sorry but how many children you have is a choice; if you can't afford them, stop having them! Vasectomies are free,"" his post read. ""Families who have never worked a day in their lives having four or five kids and the rest of us having one or two means it's not long before we're drowning in a vast sea of unemployed wasters that we pay to keep!"" After they were highlighted by Buzzfeed, he said: ""I apologise for these posts. My time in politics has allowed me to mature and I now realise that this language is not appropriate."" Cat Smith, Labour's shadow minister for youth affairs, said: ""These repulsive comments expose the Tories' disgraceful attitude to unemployed people. ""That they come from a man Theresa May chose as a vice chair of her party speaks volumes. The nasty party is alive and well."" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said it ""beggars belief that someone who has shown such contempt for young people who are out of work has been tasked by the prime minister to improve her party's appeal with young voters"".

"A minister for loneliness, a project first started by the late MP Jo Cox, has been announced by Downing Street. Tracey Crouch said she was proud to take on the ""generational challenge"" to tackle an issue affecting about nine million UK people, young and old. The 42-year-old said she would work across political parties in the role. The Commission on Loneliness was first set up by Ms Cox,who was killed before the EU referendum.

"Poppi Worthington was blue and not breathing when she was taken to hospital Prosecutors are considering the findings of a fresh inquest into the death of toddler Poppi Worthington after the coroner ruled she was sexually assaulted by her father. David Roberts concluded on the balance of probabilities that Poppi was abused before she died on 12 December 2012. Her father, Paul Worthington, denies the accusation. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it would look carefully at the judgement along with Cumbria Police. Mr Roberts, senior coroner for Cumbria, ruled,in a third court judgment on the case, that the 13-month-old died from asphyxia following the assault at her home in in Barrow-in-Furness. He said she died because her ability to breathe was compromised as a result of ""an unsafe sleeping environment."" 'Why did you hurt your daughter?' Latest updates as the coroner delivers his inquest findings Key dates in the Poppi investigation The inquest: Review of evidence, findings and conclusion,external During a three-week inquest at Kendal Coroner's Court, Poppi's father declined to answer 252 questions relating to the circumstances surrounding her death. However, Mr Worthington did tell the hearing he had gone to get Poppi a fresh nappy and a few minutes later he reached over and found her limp. The toddler was pronounced dead at Furness General Hospital shortly after. Paul Worthington denies abusing his daughter and has faced no charges Mr Roberts said: ""A coroner must adjourn an inquest and notify the Director of Public Prosecutions , if during the course of an inquest, it appears to the coroner that the death of the deceased is likely to have been due to a homicide offence and that a person may be charged in relation to the offence. ""For the reasons that should be clear from my conclusion that provision did not apply. That said I have sent a copy of my decision to the CPS for their consideration. ""It is a matter for the CPS to consider my decision, not for me to make recommendations."" Despite the coroner's conclusion, the CPS has said the prospects of another criminal investigation remain slim. The burden of proof in a criminal court is higher than that of a coroner's court and the CPS must be confident of a conviction before it sanctions any re-investigation. It has previously said it would be difficult to secure a conviction because of the lack of physical evidence. Rule 25 of the Coroners (Inquest) Rules 2013 state that ""a coroner must adjourn an inquest and notify the Director of Public Prosecutions, if during the course of an inquest, it appears to the coroner that the death of the deceased is likely to have been due to a homicide offence and that a person may be charged in relation to the offence"". Mr Roberts was clear that provision did not apply. He has sent, as is normal practice, a copy of his conclusions to the CPS, but did not and cannot make any recommendations as to what actions, if any, should follow. A spokesman for the CPS said: ""We have received a copy of the coroner's decision and will now consider this carefully in liaison with Cumbria Constabulary."" Minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability, Victoria Atkins, added: ""The tragic circumstances surrounding the death of Poppi Worthington are extremely distressing.

"Author Margaret Atwood Author Margaret Atwood has sparked a Twitter storm after a provocative column on the Me Too anti-sexual harassment movement. Her op-edpublished in the Globe and Mail newspaper,externalquestioned the impact of the movement against inappropriate sexual behaviour. Ms Atwood called the movement a ""symptom"" of a broken legal system. She also defended her support for due process in the case of a male writer accused of sexual harassment. Ms Atwood, the Canadian author of the dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale, is the latest in a number of celebrities to face a backlash after weighing in on the movement sparked by the Harvey Weinstein scandal. French actress Catherine Deneuve recently apologised to sexual assault victims after signing on to a letter that argued the campaign against sexual harassment had gone too far.

She says she is concerned the University of British Columbia denied due process to professor and fellow author Steven Galloway, who first faced accusations of bullying and sexual harassment in 2015. In 2016, members of Canada's literary community, including Ms Atwood, rallied behind Mr Galloway. Canadian authors in university firing row Canadian sex scandal author speaks out They penned an open letter,externalto Mr Galloway's employer defending his right to due process following his suspension over undefined ""serious allegations"". Media later reported accusations of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault. A number of authors have since removed their names from the controversial letter. Mr Galloway was dismissed by the university and is fighting his termination. He faces no criminal charges. Of the criticism for adding her name to the letter, Ms Atwood wrote: ""And now, it seems, I am conducting a War on Women, like the misogynistic, rape-enabling Bad Feminist that I am"". She added: ""In times of extremes, extremists win. Their ideology becomes a religion, anyone who doesn't puppet their views is seen as an apostate, a heretic or a traitor, and moderates in the middle are annihilated."" Ms Atwood also offers misgivings about the movement going too far, warning of the dangers of ""vigilante justice"", which she says ""begins as a response to a lack of justice"".

"Cars and lorries were tailed back on the M74 southbound Heavy snowfalls have been causing disruption as wintry conditions sweep across large swathes of Scotland. Traffic between Scotland and England has been affected, with closures on the M74 in both directions. Traffic Scotland said gritters were working to make the motorway safe enough to fully reopen. Police Scotland has advised motorists to avoid the area. Some drivers complained of being stuck in traffic for several hours. On the Isle of Skye, the main road - the A87- was blocked for several hours in both directions by a jack-knifed lorry. The closure meant two school buses with pupils who had been stuck for hours had to return to Portree High. The school said they would be put in temporary accommodation for the night. The Met Office has issued an amber alert for south west Scotland, extending to parts of the central belt, lasting until Wednesday morning. Thundersnow was also forecast in the west. A lorry jack-knifed on the A87 in Skye Earlier on Tuesday evening, all three lanes on the M74 southbound at J12 Millbank were closed. One lane later re-opened but traffic was again halted as conditions worsened. Police advised drivers to follow the gritters and said the delays would take some time to clear. A subsequent accident at J15 Beattock led to closure of the northbound carriageway. Traffic Scotland apologised to those stuck in the queues. Motorist Nigel Cliff, who was heading south, told BBC Scotland at about 19:00 that he had been stationary on the motorway for about an hour and a half. ""It's pretty rough,"" he said. ""It's snowing again now so it is probably only going to get worse. There are cars and lorries just sitting here - nothing moving."" Mr Cliff said he was prepared for the conditions: ""I've got food. I've got big thick coats, big thick socks. My wife always makes sure I've got everything in the car."" The M74 was closed between Millbank and Abington due to the wintry conditions Transport Minister Humza Yousaf tweeted that a number of HGVs had ""lost traction with challenging weather impacting on M74"". He added: ""Necessary to close the junction to get additional gritters and equipment to the scene."" Live updates on heavy snowfall Have you seen Sir Andy Flurry? Your pictures of snowy scenes What is thundersnow? Snow disruption in Northern Ireland Police Scotland said anyone taking to the roads in the worst affected areas was ""highly likely"" to experience disruption, and urged drivers to consider carefully if the journey was necessary.

Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said: ""The Met Office has upgraded its snow warning for parts of south west and central Scotland, with the areas affected by the amber warning set to see heavier snowfalls and greater disruption to transport. ""The snow and ice is likely to lead to difficult driving conditions, so I'd urge all travellers to take extra time and plan their journeys in advance. The high winds forecast for later in the week may also see some bridge restrictions.""

A crashed car is buried by snow beside this road in County Antrim The Met Office amber ""be prepared"" warning - which means transport and power supplies may be disrupted with a potential risk to lives and property -  was issued from 15:00 on Tuesday until 08:00 on Wednesday and also extends across much of Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said crews had attended 12 crashes as a direct result of the poor conditionsand at least 13 schools were closed. Some high ground was likely to see 15-25 cm (6-10 inches) of snow building up, especially above 200-300m, with 5-10 cm (2-4 inches) more typical at low levels throughout the warning area. Yellow warnings of snow are likely to remain in place across most of the country until late on Friday.

""No-one should ever place themselves at risk on the road and it may be worth considering postponing your journey or making alternative arrangements such as delaying travel until conditions improve or using public transport. ""If you are travelling on the roads you should ensure you and your vehicle are adequately prepared for the conditions, making sure you have sufficient fuel and supplies such as warm clothing, food and water in the event you are delayed for several hours.

"Palestinians like these in Gaza City receive UN food aid The US is withholding more than half of a $125m (Â£90m) instalment destined for the UN relief agency for the Palestinians, American officials say. It will provide $60m in aid to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) but will hold back a further $65m. A UN official said the move would have devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people. President Donald Trump said earlier the US could cut aid if Palestinians rejected peace efforts with Israel. The US funds almost 30% of the UN agency's work overall and gave $370m to UNRWA last year. The money withheld is part of this year's first instalment. On Sunday, Palestinian PresidentMahmoud Abbas sharply attacked Mr Trump's Middle East peace efforts, saying he would not accept any peace plan from the US after it recognised Jerusalem last year as Israel's capital. He accused Israel of putting an end to the 1994 Oslo Accords, which began the peace process. Palestinian territories profile ""This is not aimed at punishing"" anyone, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters, adding that it was due to a US desire to see reforms at the agency. The $65m is being withheld ""for future consideration"", a US official told Reuters news agency, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""It is time other countries, some of them quite wealthy, step in and do their part to advance regional security and stability,"" the official added. The decision comes two weeks after President Trump'scomplaint that America receives ""no appreciation or respect"" in return for its aid. The US's $370m dwarfs the amount given by other donors - in 2016, the second-largest donor, the EU, gave less than half as much to UNWRA, which runs educational, health and social programmes. The US also donated $260m in bilateral aid, with much of it going towardsprojects administered by the US Agency for International Development (USAid),external. Those projects are run by non-governmental organisations involved in humanitarian assistance, economic development, democratic reform, improving water access and other infrastructure, healthcare, education, and vocational training. By contrast, Israel receives more than $3bn in military aid per year from the US. Jan Egeland, the former UN humanitarian chief who now serves as its humanitarian co-ordinator for Syria, called on other donor nations to cover the shortfall caused by the US move. The withdrawal of funds would, he said, have ""devastating consequences for vulnerable Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, including hundreds of thousands of refugee children in the West Bank and Gaza, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria who depend on the agency for their education"". It would also ""deny their parents a social safety net that helps them to survive, and undermine the UN agency's ability to respond in the event of another flare up in the conflict"". The Palestine Liberation Organization, an umbrella group for Palestinian factions, tweeted that the Trump administration seemed to be following an Israeli policy of dismantling ""the one agency that was established by the international community to protect the rights of the Palestinian refugees"".

Its ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, called for aid to UNRWA to be scrapped completely. He accused the agency of misusing humanitarian aid and supporting ""anti-Israel propaganda"". ""It is time for this absurdity to end and for humanitarian funds to be directed towards their intended purpose - the welfare of refugees,"" he said. The president's decision last month to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and begin preparations to move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv were denounced by the Palestinians, who said it showed the US could not be a neutral mediator. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important UN member states also voted decisively at the General Assembly in favour of a resolution effectively calling the US declaration ""null and void"" and demanding it be cancelled. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future state. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.
