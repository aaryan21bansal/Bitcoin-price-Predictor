"Sarah Everard went missing from Clapham on 3 March A probationary Met officer involved in the search for Sarah Everard has been removed from duties for allegedly sharing an ""inappropriate graphic"".

"Georgina had joined hundreds of other people at Clapham Common on Saturday evening A woman who attended a vigil for Sarah Everard in south London says she was ignored when she tried to report a case of indecent exposure to police. Georgina was on her way home from Clapham Common on Saturday when she was confronted by a man exposing himself. She told the BBC she tried to speak to a group of police but a male officer told her they had ""had enough with the rioters tonight"". The Met Police said it was looking into the report. The force has faced criticism for the way it handled the vigilafter officers handcuffed and forcibly removed a number of women from the event. Patel 'listening to women' but warns over protests How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? Georgina, who only wants to be known by her first name, was among hundreds of people who had gathered to pay their respects to 33-year-old Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. On her way, she said she walked past a man who was standing on a pavement with ""his genitals out of his fly"". She told the BBC she went up to a group of ""about five or six police officers"" to ask them if they could address the situation as she was feeling ""very uncomfortable"". ""The female officer said 'ok, fine, we'll go' and she was about to go when a male colleague said 'we're not dealing with this anymore, no, we've had enough with the rioters tonight, we're not dealing with it',"" she said. The Met has faced criticism for the way the vigil was policed She added she had been left ""shocked"" by the police's reaction. ""It's such a huge challenge that women don't feel they have a safe space to even speak on these things let alone that these things even happen and continue to happen,"" she said. Two female officers from the Met have since visited Georgina and the force has said it was looking into her report. ""We are aware of a report that she tried to report this incident at the time to officers in the area - this will be looked at,"" the Met said.

"Left-right: Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan and Riz Ahmed are all nominated Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars. Vanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees. It's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds. And two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history. This video can not be played Film critic Clarisse Loughrey shares her thoughts on this yearâs Oscar nominations Chloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman. Other nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman. Mank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations. This year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station. Olivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins are both nominated for The Father 10 nominations - Mank 6 - The Father 6 - Judas and the Black Messiah 6 - Minari 6 - Nomadland 6 - Sound of Metal 6 - The Trial of the Chicago 7 The Oscar nominations in full Daniel Kaluuya is nominated for playing Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah The eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination. At 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Colman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father. Carey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director. Kirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively. Other British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.

Zhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director. If she wins them all, she will equal a record set by Walt Disney, who is the only person to have won four Oscars in the same night. Allow Twitter content?

Fennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year. Overall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards. The 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy. ""I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,"" she said. Her previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year? Probably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel. Plus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance. Downey and Hathaway get 'worst acting' nominations Mank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture. Crucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script. It has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited. Mank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves. It would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley. I have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination.

"Chocolate maker Thorntons has said none of its stores will reopen after coronavirus lockdowns are lifted. The decision to close its 61 shops will put more than 600 jobs at risk. The company said it had been badly hit by the pandemic, which forced its stores to shut their doors during the crucial Christmas and Easter holidays. ""The obstacles we have faced and will continue to face on the High Street are too severe,"" said Thorntons retail director Adam Goddard. ""Despite our best efforts we have taken the difficult decision to permanently close our retail store estate."" Thorntons has been on the High Street for more than a century but these days history isn't enough to guarantee survival. It was losing its way in the early 2000s with newer players, like Hotel Chocolat, entering the scene. It also embarked on a strategy of selling more chocolates through supermarkets and closing unprofitable shops. Italian food giant Ferrero bought the business in 2015 and has been trying to turn it around ever since. Over the last five years, it's shrunk from 252 to 61 stores. But Ferrero has now thrown in the towel on Thorntons stores altogether, betting that the brand's future is now online and on the supermarket shelves. This pandemic has created brutal trading conditions for so many traditional retailers. And the high street shakeout is still far from over. Thorntons said it had spent Â£45m transforming the business with changes to the way stores operate and the introduction of new cafes but its plans had been thrown off course by the pandemic. The company, which was founded in Sheffield in 1911, said it would continue to sell its chocolate online and try to sell more through supermarkets. Since the beginning of the crisis, sales through its website have increased by more than 70% compared to the previous year, it said. It will also try to expand the range of products made at its factory in Alfreton, Derbyshire and increase international sales. Chocolate firms' sticky dilemma Pandemic impact 'yet to be felt' on High Streets In 2011, Thorntons announced plans to massively reduce the number of stores it had on the High Street and in shopping centres. It said it would close up to 180 of the 364 stores it had at the time, following a strategic review. Since then, the number of stores has dwindled to 61. In 2015, Italian food giant Ferrero bought the chocolate chain for Â£112m. In a statement, the company said: ""We remain committed to this iconic British brand and will continue to invest further in the future potential of Thorntons to ensure we evolve with the times."" Thorntons is just the latest well-known name to suffer the impact that rolling lockdowns have had on the High Street as more people take to shopping online. More than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to figures from the Local Data Company. That is an average rate of 48 closures a day. Last week, department store chain John Lewisannounced plans to close more stores.  Other casualties have includedPSir Philip Green's retail empire, Arcadia, which included Topshop and Dorothy Perkins. Are you a Thorntons employee?

"Hundreds of people gathered at Parliament Square to pay tribute to Sarah Everard Hundreds of people joined a new vigil for Sarah Everard on Monday, despite the home secretary warning against such gatherings. Priti Patel said she understood public anger over the 33-year-old's killing but urged people not to protest while Covid restrictions were in place. Ms Patel also said she had started a review into the policing ofa previous London event for Ms Everard. Officers handcuffed and removed several women from Saturday's vigil in Clapham. Speaking from Monday's event in Parliament Square, Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home and legal correspondent, said there were ""far fewer"" police than there had been at Saturday's vigil, adding that officers had taken a ""hands-off"" approach similar to that seen during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. The Met faced widespread criticism for its handling of the Clapham vigil but the force's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, has rejecteda call to step down.,external What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Policing bill 'ignores violence against women' Four people were arrested for public order and Covid offences on Saturday, after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the marketing executive's kidnap and murder. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared On Monday evening, police began to move in on protesters in central London, after urging crowds to ""leave immediately"" or face ""enforcement activity"". Campaigners had marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area chanting and waving banners. Protesters could be heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"", with traffic in the surrounding areas brought to a stop. A large police presence followed the demonstrators, along with police vans and motorbikes. Protests andvigilshave also been held in several other UK cities over the past few days, includingCardiff,Edinburgh,Leeds,Brighton, andLiverpool. Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel said: ""Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge why Sarah's death has upset so many. ""My heartache, and that of others, can be summed up in just five words: 'She was just walking home.'"" The home secretary also confirmed she had instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to review the policing of Saturday's vigil. She said Ms Everard's killing had ""rightly ignited anger at the danger posed to women by predatory men and anger I feel as strongly as anyone"". However, she urged people not to participate in large gatherings or protests, saying that while the right to protest was a ""cornerstone of our democracy"", the government's duty was still to prevent more lives being lost during the pandemic. This video can not be played The home secretary speaks of the fear women have every day while walking home alone. She stressed that the government had put in place measures to ensure women and girls felt safe, including tackling domestic abuse, female genital mutilation and upskirting. The Domestic Abuse bill is on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, she said, adding that it would ""transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime"". 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' Met PC removed from duties for sharing graphic Woman 'was ignored by police' over exposure report In response, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: ""Let me be clear, it is not women who should change their behaviour, it is men and wider society that needs to change. ""And at times like this it is vital people are able to have their voices heard, of course in a way that is lawful and Covid-secure. Yet this weekend in Clapham things clearly went very wrong and I share the anger about the policing and the scenes we saw."" He also accused the government of ""a chronic failure"" to address violence against women and girls, adding that ""meetings and reopening surveys are not enough"". Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening. After that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End. At first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations. And so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets. Eventually teams of police officers began trying to pick off stragglers, instructing them to go home in line with the lockdown rules - or face fines. Some left, some appeared to get tickets. They wanted to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations. But the way they acted tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted. Following a meeting of the government's Criminal Justice taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take ""immediate steps"" to give ""further reassurance"" to women and girls in the wake of Ms Everard's death. No 10 said it would be doubling the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to Â£45m. Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - with uniformed and undercover officers working to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in ""landmark legislation"" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets. He said: ""Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them."" Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds said replacing ""a tiny fraction of the cuts [the Conservatives] have made to local services is nowhere near good enough"". A spokeswoman for Reclaim These Streets, the group that initially organised the vigil, said they welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were ""so important"". ""Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,"" she said. Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests On Monday, Reclaim These Streets said it had lost confidence in Dame Cressida after talks with her earlier, claiming that she left after 15 minutes. Anna Birley of the group told BBC News: ""To be honest, Cressida Dick has lost our confidence and the confidence of women in the capital. We didn't want to call on her to resign until we'd at least had a meeting and given her a chance to engage. ""We don't have great confidence in the Met Police's willingness to work with us, unless forced to."" Reclaim These Streets called off Saturday's vigil, saying police had failed to ""constructively engage"" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way. When people gathered anyway, the group pointed out that they did so without the marshalling and other safety measures that had been originally proposed. On Sunday, there were protests outside the Met Police's headquarters at New Scotland Yard, Downing Street and in Parliament Square.

"At the beginning of March 2020, I asked a senior member of the government: ""Do you feel worried?"" They replied: ""Personally? No."" But just weeks later, Downing Street was scrambling to manage the biggest crisis since World War Two. Since then, monumental decisions have had to be taken. And there have been many accusations of failings - the desperate shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), Covid ripping through unprepared care homes, hundreds of billions borrowed and spent to keep the economy going, to name a few. I have asked 20 of the most senior politicians, officials and former officials, who either witnessed or were involved in the big decisions, to pick five pivotal moments from the past 12 months. What they say tells us so much about what really happened, what our leaders were thinking, and, strikingly, how little they knew. The contributors are not being named, so they could speak freely. On 31 January, it was reported that coronavirus had arrived in the UK, as two people were admitted to hospital. Meanwhile, more than 80 Britons evacuated from China were quarantined at a facility in the north-west of England. But for the government, Brexit had sucked up all the political energy - it was the day the country officially left the EU. The prime minister and his team were exhausted but elated. It felt like Boris Johnson had ""just really started to take flight"", one member of the team tells me. Ministers and officials had already been meeting to discuss the virus in China - but it felt thousands of miles away. There was a ""lack of concern and energy,"" one source tells me. ""The general view was it is just hysteria. It was just like a flu."" The prime minister was even heard to say: ""The best thing would be to ignore it."" And he repeatedly warned, several sources tell me, that an overreaction could do more harm than good. A small group in Downing Street had started daily meetings, after, according to one of those who attended, ""it became clear that there was no proper, 'Emergency break-the-glass' plan."" But for many of those I've spoken to, the game-changer was at the end of February, when the virus took hold in northern Italy - it was closer to home, and England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, had, one minister told me, warned that if it got out of China, it would become global, and be on its way to the UK. ""The biggest moment for me was when I saw those pictures of northern Italy,"" one senior minister says. ""I thought that will be us if we don't move."" Reports of the chaos there catapulted the virus, one senior minister says, ""from not on the radar, to people on the floor of hospitals in Lombardy."" They say that was the moment ""we knew that it was inevitable"". Ministers and officials became locked in arguments over how to respond. The prime minister and many cabinet ministers were reluctant to consider anything as draconian as a lockdown. To many people, the very idea would have seemed fanciful. Even stopping shaking hands seemed a step too far for the prime minister. Before the first major coronavirus briefing on 3 March, he had, I am told, been prepared by aides to say, if asked by journalists, people should stop shaking hands with each other - as per government scientific advice. But he said the exact opposite. ""I've shaken hands with everybody,"" he said, about visiting a hospital with Covid patients. And it was not just a slip, one of those present at the briefing says. It demonstrated ""the whole conflict for him - and his lack of understanding of the severity of what was coming"". A Downing Street spokesperson told the BBC: ""The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed."" By this point, Mr Johnson was attending emergency committee Cobra meetings with officials and leaders from Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff - although he had missed the first few. But one senior politician who attended at the same time says: ""The early meetings with the prime minister were dreadful."" And inside Downing Street, senior staff's concerns about the government's ability to cope grew. There were huge logistical considerations about equipment, facilities and how fast the disease might move in the UK, and questions about how effective the actions taken in China to suppress the virus would be here. It was not well understood, for example, that people without symptoms could still pass it on, nor that Britons returning from half-term holidays in northern Europe were bringing the virus back home in large numbers. ""There was a genuine argument in government, which everyone has subsequently denied,"" one senior figure tells me, about whether there should be a hard lockdown or a plan to protect only the most vulnerable, and even encourage what was described to me at that time as ""some degree of herd immunity"". There was even talk of ""chicken pox parties"", where healthy people might be encouraged to gather to spread the disease. And while that was not considered a policy proposal, real consideration was given to whether suppressing Covid entirely could be counter productive. On 3 March, when the prime minister set out the government's plan, the focus was on detecting early cases and preventing the spread. But on 12 March, with journalists crammed into the state dining room at No 10, he told the public that the country was facing its worst health crisis in a generation. Anyone with symptoms was told to stay at home for a week. Advisers seemed confident it was not yet time to close schools or stop large crowds gathering. And the government's scientists felt they had time to slow everything down - the peak was not expected for another 10-14 weeks. That same week, though, nervousness was rising among others in government that the virus was outpacing everyone's expectations, and the plans in place to smooth out the outbreak would not work. One source tells me it felt like the ""government machine was breaking in our hands"", things were ""imploding"", and within 48 hours the approach outlined on the 12th would feel out of date. There has been no shortage of controversy over whether the government was too slow to close the doors on 23 March - but many of the conversations I have had, pinpoint the moment it became urgent in No 10. On 13 March, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee concluded the virus was spreading faster than thought. But it was Downing Street ""modellers in the building"", according to one current official, who pored again over the numbers, and realised the timetable that had only just been announced was likely to result in disaster. The next morning, a small group of key staff got together. Simple graphs were drawn on a whiteboard and the prime minister was confronted with the stark prediction that the plan he had just announced would result in the NHS collapsing under the sheer number of cases. Several of those present tell me that was the moment Mr Johnson realised the urgency - that the official assumptions about the speed of the spread of this new disease had been wrong. To prevent the NHS ""falling over"", he was warned, the government would have to impose measures as infections rose. And while they could be relaxed as cases fell, this pattern might recur across ""multiple waves for 18 months"". Several sources recall vividly the ""snake like graph"" they were shown that day. Then, one official says, everything started to move at ""lightning speed"". And behind closed doors - before the terrifying projections of Imperial College became public, a couple of days later - plans were accelerated. On 16 March, the public were told to stop all unnecessary social contact and to work at home if possible. New cabinet committees were formed. And the machine moved into a different phase, with the prime minister and the ""quad"" - Matt Hancock, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Rishi Sunak - the new decision-making form. It was, I am told, ""high tension - [with] a lot of testosterone in the room"". For many inside government, the pace of change that week was staggering - but others remain frustrated the government machine, in their view, had failed to move quickly enough. There was tension between those who wanted to ensure systems were as ready as they could be first, and others who argued vociferously that moving fast against the virus was more important than anything else. But those I spoke to now agree on one thing - how much they did not know about the disease. ""You can kick yourself about the things that you wish you knew,"" one minister says, ""but we just didn't have anything in place."" Another cabinet minister says: ""It's easy to say we should have locked down longer, gone harder, but there are more complex debates about where the national interests really lie."" And it was all so strange. One minister who made some of the public announcements when lockdown came says: ""I remember when I wrote it into the script, I just couldn't believe that I was saying this."" And one official, struck by how huge it all felt, says he googled: ""Did they shut the schools during the War?"" Another, meanwhile, admits, ""We were more blind than we told the public,"" and suggests that is still the case one year on. On 18 March, we reported that a small number of members of staff in No 10 had fallen ill. One insider says: ""People were dropping like flies."" The prime minister, however, was acting as though he was impervious to the risk. He had developed a habit of banging his own chest, telling staff he was ""strong as a bull"". Soon, though, this chest-banging turned into ""extreme coughing fits"". Tests, in short supply everywhere, were requested for him from 25 March. And two days later, he tested positive. He switched to the chancellor's bigger suite of offices so that he could keep working, screened off from the rest of the building. Insiders recall how much he hated this and, in a second spell of isolation in the autumn, chairs had to be placed across the door ""like a puppy gate"", so he could still communicate with the tiny number of staff allowed into the same part of the building. Then, at the end of March, the prime minister became increasingly ill - each video call he made to reassure the public required more takes. On 6 April, he agreed to go to St Thomas' Hospital and, struggling for breath on a phone call, I have been told, confirmed he wanted Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to stand in for him. Initially, Downing Street tried to give the impression that all was well. Journalists were even told that Mr Johnson was working on his red boxes. That message has been put down to a mix up, and we now know this was far from the truth. The moment of genuine crisis came when he was moved into intensive care. No-one knew if the prime minister would make it through the night - or what the plan was if he did not. By this point, with so many in No 10 and in government already sick, there were, I have been told, about ""half a dozen people running things"". Fears that he might need to be intubated were shared by a tiny group inside Number 10. They discussed the possibility that ministers would have to gather in the cabinet room, with the doors closed, until they chose a successor - but there was no fixed protocol, and no conclusion was reached. The Tory Party, I have been told, even started to consider how to transfer the leadership without a contest, fearing that such a competition could be seen as ""venal"" after the prime minister's death. Then cabinet ministers were summoned urgently for a conference call. ""All of a sudden we were asked to join this call - not knowing if he was alive,"" one tells me.  Then No 10 prepared to make the news public. The Downing Street voice on the other end of the phone cracked with fear as I was asked to get to the Foreign Office as soon possible with a camera to talk to Mr Raab, who was being sent out to try to reassure the country. We reported the news that Mr Johnson was in intensive care from the back of a taxi. A former official tells me: ""We thought we really could lose him - we had to plan for a full transition."" That night was ""long and shocking"", one source says. By the end of May, the number of coronavirus cases was falling, the prime minister was back at work full time, and the public had surprised the government by overwhelmingly sticking to the rules. Furthermore, despite some embarrassing and prominent lockdown breaches - in April, for example, Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, had to quit over her visits to her holiday home - there had been what one senior minister describes as ""tremendous goodwill"". But then came the Mirror and the Guardian's scoop - in March, the prime minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had travelled hundreds of miles to County Durham, after his wife fell ill with Covid. He, too, succumbed to the virus and his stay on his family's farm to recover, before returning to London, had been kept secret - apart from among a tiny number of Downing Street staff. And Mr Cummings was determined not to quit. After considering sacking him, the prime minister stuck by him - but first, there was what has been described to me as tense ""mediation between a couple deciding whether to divorce"". Before making that decision, he had summoned Mr Cummings to go through his version of events. Together, they planned for him to give this version publicly - despite others' protestations. The result was the surreal press conference in the Downing Street rose garden. Many of those I have talked to describe this episode as a terrible turning-point. ""Even for us, this is mad,"" a member of the Downing Street team tells me. Senior ministers say: ""The handling was a fiasco"". ""It was ridiculous"", and, at a time of national emergency, ""broke the political consensus"". Perhaps, after two months of lockdown, the public was ready to be angry with someone. MPs' inboxes were swamped with irate emails - mine too. ""The early pandemic washed away all the bitterness of Brexit,"" one senior minister tells me. ""That all came flooding back, all that bile, all that pent up frustration."" Some ministers tweeted their support for Mr Cummings. One of those who refused says: ""He should have resigned straight away. You lead by example. I was busy chopping logs with my chainsaw to get the frustration out."" Some polling suggests the Barnard Castle episode really did dent the public's trust in the government. ""It gave people who wanted to break the rules an excuse,"" one source says. But inside government, there was a belief that an extraordinary period of unity had already started to fade, and the public had started to tire of the rules once the government had moved towards its plans to lift them. There is no question, though, the whole misadventure made the politics of the pandemic more scratchy and less consensual. Mr Cummings was not the only one to be caught up. In June, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, provoked anger by attending a huge Republican funeral. But it was after Barnard Castle that it felt like the mood in the country had changed. ""People wanted to portray the PM as a clown,"" one minister tells me, ""or not up to the level of events."" Britain in the summer did not feel like a country still gripped by a pandemic. ""There was loads of over optimistic messaging,"" one politician says. For example, the time when a Labour MP asked for advice at the end of June for his constituency, which was home to a popular beach and he was worried about huge numbers heading for the sea. ""Show some guts,"" the prime minister told him. In July, a grinning chancellor delivered plates of Japanese curry to unsuspecting customers at a London restaurant, to promote his ""eat out to help out"" scheme. Then the prime minister started to encourage people back to the office. But behind closed doors, there were significant doubts about the wisdom of this new mood. ""We knew there was going to be a second wave,"" one cabinet minister tells me, ""and there was a row about whether people should work from home or not - it was totally ridiculous."" The summer optimism and opening was ""the biggest mistake - a rush of blood to the head"", another senior figure says. ""The PM has to carry the can"". The prime minister believed that another lockdown would be a disaster and wanted to avoid it at all costs - but for many of those involved in making the decisions, his hostility to tightening the rules again was frustrating, dangerous and political. ""The policy objective in the summer and the autumn was - do the minimum possible,"" one tells me. But by the end of August, with Britons packing beaches, the warnings of what might come were already flickering in Number 10. Some days, sources suggest, the prime minister would express concern about the virus coming back. Others, he would be in ""let-it-rip mode"". And senior officials expressed deep concern about what seemed to be changes of heart on a daily basis. The disease would not be contained by indecision, and  by the start of September, with schools and universities having returned, ""you could clearly see a steady increase,"" a senior figure says. The testing system had not been able to keep pace with demand, and too few people were willing to, or could afford, to self-isolate if they tested positive. ""The idea that you could liberalise in the summer was based on the idea that you could whackamole with test and trace,"" the source says. ""But if you didn't whack the right moles then it doesn't work."" By the middle of September, ""the data was already screaming out"", one insider says. On the 17th, I was told by one source: ""If you do nothing now, by the end of October you will get something worse than the first wave."" The possibility of a short ""circuit breaker"" lockdown was already being discussed in Downing Street that week. Prof Whitty, the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and Mr Cummings and others were arguing hard for action to be taken - but the prime minister was unpersuaded. Others wanted to push again - one current official recalls a ""concerted effort"" - and on Sunday 20th, the No 10 team gathered a range of scientists. But the prime minister remained reluctant. Another current official describes his attitude as, ""if there is a way not to act, why do it?"". Over the next 36 hours, I have been told, a small group inside Downing Street repeatedly tried to change Mr Johnson's mind - but by then, he was operating in a very different atmosphere. ""A swampiness had risen because of ideological pressure on this government at every turn to do less - and to do it more slowly,"" a senior figure says. And it is understood Mr Johnson had privately assured groups of MPs there would be no more restrictions. The Treasury was pointing out the damage any further restrictions would do to the economy, many of the traditional Tory-backing newspapers were hungry for restrictions to be relaxed, the party was restless, and I remember cabinet ministers who had hardly any cases of the virus in their constituencies at that point, suggesting they saw no evidence for further action. So when Mr Johnson made changes to the coronavirus restrictions on 22 September, they were tweaks, rather than a real tightening up.  I remember talking to Tory backbenchers that day who felt they had won. The importance of the missed September moment is cited by many senior figures - and some now concede it was a mistake. ""We strained at the leash to get things going,"" one cabinet minister admits. ""I was aggressively for that - but I have learned that it is better to go slow."" Another senior minister, one of those who pushed for more radical action at the time, now says: ""We should have locked down more severely, earlier in the autumn - the whole point was, the earlier you act the more you buy yourself time for a strategy that can get out."" You can still hear the frustration in the voices of those who lost the argument. ""The PM was saying the Tory Party won't swallow it,"" one tells me. ""Everyone else felt, we know we are going to have to do a lockdown."" And there is no question that the tier system that was introduced over the autumn, which portioned England into different levels of restrictions, was soon tied up in confusion and regional spats. ""It was completely unintelligible to any normal human being,"" one senior official says. ""It was too slow, and too Byzantine, and that resulted in more cases."" Another says now: ""We ended up tying ourselves into ever tighter knots,"" as the system became more and more particular to each part of the country. It is impossible to know what would have happened if the brakes had been slammed on in September - but some ministers pin the terrible scale of the second wave, at least in part, on the apparent reluctance to act. The circuit-breaker that was imposed later in Wales did not make the problem go away, however. Case numbers weren't the only concern - the economy had been shuttered, and shattered. Political demands had changed. In defence of Mr Johnson, one senior minister says: ""He's not to blame if he was trying to reflect the aspiration for the country back in the summer"". Another tells me the plans, and the billions spent on ""test-and-trace and tiering meant it was reasonable to do the unlock"". They reject the idea that a circuit breaker was the obvious option - ""There wasn't a slam dunk recommendation."" Regarding the potential introduction of national restrictions in September, Downing Street referred us back to comments made by the prime minister to parliament in early November. ""No-one wants to impose measures unless absolutely essential,"" Mr Johnson told the Commons. ""So it made sense to focus initially on the areas where the disease was surging and not to shut businesses, pubs and restaurants in parts of the country where incidence was low."" But while there is no question mistakes were made in the first phase of the pandemic, when so much about the virus was a mystery, those involved in the decisions are already less forgiving of their own mistakes the second time around. ""A miracle,"" is how one minister describes the vaccine gamble to me. A government so often lambasted by critics for busting convention did it again - but this time, so far, with a stunning outcome. Vaccines had been discussed in January, as the government machine began to contemplate, slowly, what might be ahead. Early on the chancellor, holding the cheque book, indicated a willingness to spend at speed, without asking for guarantees. No 10 decided to ""chuck everything at it"", at a meeting in April. With Sir Patrick's crucial experience and deputy chief medical officer for England Prof Jonathan Van-Tam's emphasis on the practicalities of delivering the vaccine, politicians were persuaded to take what was then a huge risk. There was an early decision to ""pay high, pay early, and ensure it works,"" one senior official tells me. And it seems their decision was informed by everything that had gone wrong with trying to secure PPE - the collapse of the NHS's normal procurement process, which is controlled by the Department of Health. The UK decided early not to participate in the EU's joint plan to buy vaccines. While publicly this decision may have been politically controversial, behind closed doors it was ""easy"" and ""straightforward"", ministers and officials say. ""No-one wanted any of the Brexit baggage anywhere near it."" And, more importantly, the EU had made it clear any participating country would be unable to make its own deals with manufacturers the EU had an agreement with - or control its own supply. The vaccines team had warned ministers at the start of May that nothing was certain - and developing a vaccine as quickly as the prime minister, who ""wanted it yesterday"", required would be an uphill struggle. But, as one minister says, it was ""the one thing we would wish that we had done in a year's time"". Another, a senior minister, says: ""The PM strategically saw immediately that the combination of testing, drugs and vaccine was the way out."" And when it came to vaccines, the UK was ready to take an expensive gamble. The Treasury was spending speculatively in ways it had not since the War - and vaccine spending has already reached nearly Â£13.5bn. ""Imagine if it hadn't come off and we had spent all of that taxpayers' money,"" one senior official says to me. There was intense secrecy, throughout, with the various vaccines given secret code names to ensure commercial confidentiality. All were named after submarines - the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine ""Ambush"", I can now reveal, and the Oxford-AstraZeneca ""Triumph"". After 12 months of grappling with endless calculations about balancing risks to life, wider health and how the country makes a living, decision-makers are exhausted. They have to accept it is perfectly possible to be wrong, one senior minister tells me. And those who made the decisions are all too aware mistakes they made in these past 12 months may have had such a terrible cost. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Protesters in Cardiff held signs calling for changes following the death of Sarah Everard Hundreds of people have attended a protest outside a Cardiff police station following the death of Sarah Everard. The 33-year-old went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March in south London. Her remains were later found in a woodland in Kent and a Metropolitan Police officer has been charged with her murder and kidnap. Demonstrators in Cardiff on Monday were also campaigning on other issues. These included Black Lives Matter,the death of Mohamud Mohammed Hassan, and the right to protest following the introduction of the UK government's Police and Crime Bill. PM 'concerned' by Sarah Everard vigil footage 'Damning' that women feel unsafe exercising alone What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? Banners supporting different causes were on show in the crowd and chants of ""Whose Streets? Our Streets"" and ""Black Lives Matter"" could be heard. People were also protesting over the death of Mahmoud Hassan who died after being released from police custody Earlier, Wales's first minister said no-one could be ""anything but disturbed"" by scenes of policing at a vigil in London in memory of Sarah Everard. Mark Drakeford said it was ""particularly"" the case because of the ""allegation that a member of the Metropolitan Police had carried out a murder of somebody"". The Met has faced widespread criticism for its handling of the gathering. Hundreds attended the demonstration outside Cardiff Bay police station on Monday evening However, the head of the force has defended how officers responded. Hundreds of people gathered on London's Clapham Common on Saturday to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who was found dead a week after she disappeared on her way home in south London. Police officers later handcuffed and removed a number of women from the gathering, arresting four people for public order and Covid offences. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said the police's response to the vigil in London had given rise to ""real concerns"" In response to the scenes in London, Mr Drakeford said there was a ""contrast"" to the way events were handled in Wales. ""Here in Wales I think our police have always managed to respond to such events in a way that is sensitive to them, proportionate to what is going on, and allows people even in the extraordinary times we are in to mark something very significant in their lives,"" he said. ""In London, nobody could be anything but disturbed to see the scenes we've seen emerging, particularly as the precipitating event is the allegation that a member of the Metropolitan Police had carried out a murder of somebody. Images of Patsy Stevenson being detained by police at the vigil in London were shared widely ""To see the same police force respond to people who wanted to mark that in a way, that I think can only give rise for very real concern."" Ms Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March, with her body being found a week later in Kent. Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with kidnap and murder. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said she will not resign over the protests. ""Quite rightly, as far as I can see, my team felt that this is now an unlawful gathering which poses a considerable risk to people's health,"" shesaid. ""I don't think anybody who was not in the operation can actually pass a detailed comment on the rightness and wrongness... This is fiendishly difficult policing."" This video can not be played Organisers said they cancelled a vigil originally planned at Clapham Common because police did not ""constructively engage"" with logistics Mr Drakeford also raised concerns about the UK government's policing bill,and its provisions on protests. ""This is not the moment at all for the UK government to be seeking to cut back on people's ability to get together when conditions allow and express their concerns about the way that things happen in our society,"" he said. Opposition MPs, including Labour and Plaid Cymru, plan to vote against the bill. It has been defended by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said it was a ""very sensible package of measures"". In common with the other three UK nations, coronavirus laws set in Wales by the Welsh Government restrict large gatherings. No more than four people from two households can gather outside. Earlier this year Bianca Alifaced a Â£500 fine for breaching Covid rulesafter allegedly organising a protest in Cardiff over the death of a man who died after he was released from police custody. His death prompted several days of protest. Ms Ali is understood to be contesting the fine. Mark Drakeford said he had ""cause for concern"" by the police response In response to a question on the Welsh Government views' about protests under the regulations, and whether they can be lawfully held, a spokesperson told BBC Wales: ""We are in the middle of public health emergency. ""For everyone wishing to hold peaceful vigils, we would ask people to follow the rules which have protected us all from coronavirus and consider holding online events until larger gatherings can be held.""

"Ministers and senior officials have criticised Boris Johnson's decisions ahead of the ""inevtiable"" second wave Cabinet ministers and senior officials have told the BBC the government should have brought in tougher restrictions in the early autumn to tackle the ""inevitable"" second wave of coronavirus.

"Hundreds of people have attended a vigil for Sarah Everard in Parliament Square, despite Home Secretary Priti Patel urging against gatherings A crowd also blocked Westminster Bridge, with some appearing to receive fines for breaching Covid rules Patel says she has commissioned a review into the policing of a vigil on London's Clapham Common on Saturday Officers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Saturday night - with four arrests made The home secretary says she is ""listening to women and girls"" following criticism of the police's behaviour Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says she is ""more determined"" to lead the force, following calls for her to resign The PM has chaired a meeting of the government's crime and justice taskforce to discuss ways to protect women Edited by Alice Evans and James Clarke We are bringing an end to our live coverage now, but here's a reminder of the day's events: Today's updates were brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce, Kate Whannel, James Clarke and Alice Evans. Thanks for joining us. The prime minister has announced measures to make the streets safer for women, after a meeting of the Criminal Justice Taskforce. Boris Johnson says he is doubling the Safer Streets fund to Â£45m. The money will be spent on local projects to improve lighting and CCTV in parks and alleyways, and routes from bars,
restaurants and nightclubs. Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - where uniformed and undercover officers will work to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Johnson says: âThe horrific case of Sarah
Everard has unleashed a wave of feeling about women not feeling safe at night. âWe must do
everything we can to ensure our streets are safe, and we are bringing in
landmark legislation to toughen sentences and put more police on the streets. âUltimately, we must drive
out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal
justice system work to better protect and defend them.â The government also pledged Â£11m for more independent sexual violence advisors to support victims through the criminal justice process. This video can not be played Sarah Everard case: Aerials show police search area We have been hearing aboutsearches taking place in Sandwich, Kent, today as part of the investigation into the death of Sarah Everard. The video above (which has no sound) shows an aerial view of where those searches have been happening. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening. After that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End. At first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations. And so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets. Eventually teams of police officers began trying to pick off stragglers, instructing them to go home in line with the lockdown rules - or face fines. Some left, some appeared to get tickets. Now, those who are still here - mainly young people - have gone back to Westminster Bridge, disrupting the traffic through Whitehall and Parliament Square. They want to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations.But the way they are acting tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted. Three people have been fined for breaching Covid rules at a vigil in Liverpool in memory of Sarah Everard. Merseyside Police says up to 40 people held a ""peaceful"" socially-distanced minute's silence outside St Luke's Church on Saturday evening. But three people were fined for refusing to socially distance at a second event staged afterwards. Deputy Chief Constable Serena Kennedy says the force ""completely understands"" people want to hold an event in Ms Everard's memory ""whilst at the same time recognising the dangers faced by women"". However, she added: ""We must all do what we can to prevent the spread of [coronavirus] andthat includes not meeting in large groups."" Police were recorded removing women from the area Sussex Police has defended its response at a vigil held to remember Sarah Everard in Brighton. More than 150 people gathered in Valley Gardens on Saturday. One man was arrested, eight people were fined and many attendees criticised officers' handling of the unofficial event. Attendee Francesca Thornton, from Brighton, accused the police of an ""unjustified use of force"" after video footage showed officers removing a woman from the vigil and holding onto her arms. Assistant Chief Constable Lisa Bell says officers have ""an obligation to deal with things robustly when people disregard the law"". The force says it will review body-worn footage from the evening to see if thereare any lessons to learn. Police must respond with ""proportionate"" action under new protest laws, the home secretary has told MPs debating the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Priti Patel says the government will ""always defend"" the right to protest peacefully. ""But there is a balance to be struck between the rights of the protester and the rights of individuals to go about their daily lives,"" she says. ""This bill will give police the powers to take a more proactive approach in tackling dangerous and disruptive protest,"" she says. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Commons he wanted to talk about the ""distressing scenes we saw at Clapham"" on Saturday, when police clashed with people attending a vigil for Sarah Everard. He says: ""I share the anger that there is about the policing of this - deep and profound lessons need to be learned and there must be change. ""People should have been able to mark this moment peacefully and safely. We need to find a way for people to show solidarity safely and in a Covid-secure way."" He says: ""The scenes from Saturday should be a red warning signal to this House that rushing through ill-judged, ill-thought out restrictions on the right to protest would be a profound mistake that would have long-lasting consequences and do great damage to our democracy."" Police have moved in on protesters in central London, who have been campaigning following the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of protesters have marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area, chanting and waving banners. A large police presence has followed the demonstrators, with police vans and motorbikes. A tweet from the Met Police a few minutes ago urged the crowds to leave ""immediately"", warning that ""enforcement activity"" would take place shortly. And in the past few minutes, protesters have been heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Davina McCall has responded to the widespread backlash TV presenter Davina McCall has sought to ""clarify"" comments about the Sarah Everard case that sparked a backlash. As we've been reporting, the disappearance of the 33-year-old as she walked home on 3 March prompted many women to discuss their public safety concerns on social media. In response, McCalltweeted on Friday,externalthat the ""fear-mongering"" and ""calling all men out"" around the ""rare"" case could damage male mental health. Yesterday evening she said there had been a ""misinterpretation"" of her views. ""Any man that's violent [or] coercive towards a woman is abhorrent,"" she wrote. Read the full story here. BBC Radio 5 Live A retired police officer has told BBC Radio 5 Live Saturday's vigil for Sarah Everard should have been facilitated and allowed to go ahead. Ch Supt Owen West was a public order protest specialist for West Yorkshire Police. ""It was was an opportunity, not a threat, for the police to engage, to reassure, and to learn from the young women there, in relation to their lived experience,"" he says. He says too often the police see protest crowds as potentially inherently dangerous and violent. The government should think about police resources, he says, and consider the ""values, principles and ethics"" they want them to uphold. ""It's not just a numbers game,"" he says. ""It's not so much the quantity, it's the quality, it's the type of responses, it's the type of skills that are invested in."" Listen to the interviewhere,externalorlisten to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. Jennifer ScottBBC News The killing of Sarah Everard has sparked fresh debate on how to protect women from violence After the killing of Sarah Everard, the issue of violence against women and girls is at the forefront of many minds in Westminster. Figures from across the political spectrum are putting forward proposals of how to tackle the ongoing blight on our society, but one suggestion in particular has re-emerged in light of the tragic events: To make misogyny - prejudice against women - a hate crime. A crime is considered a hate crime if it is proven that the victim was targeted because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. When a crime falls into one of the above categories, judges in England and Wales have enhanced sentencing powers and can increase the punishment as a result. Campaigners say sex and gender should be added to the list, arguing misogyny is one of the ""root causes"" of violence against women. They also believe the addition would help to provide ""critical data on the link between hostility to women and the abuse and harassment women experience"". Read the full story here. Emma GlasbeyJournalist, BBC Look North It is not just in central London that crowds have been gathering this evening - hundreds of people have attended a protest in Leeds against the way the Metropolitan Police handled the vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. The event in Millennium Square, at which organisers Reclaim the Night Leeds have asked attendees to wear masks and socially distance, is also to protest overthe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. In a statement, West Yorkshire Police says: ""We understand the genuine safety concerns women have, concerns which have been amplified following the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard. ""Women should always feel safe to walk the streets of West Yorkshire and we remain committed to making the county a safe place to live and work for everyone. ""It is entirely normal the public wish to express their solidarity and concern in these circumstances."" However, the statement adds that ""the threat from coronavirus remains and any large gathering is a real risk to individuals' health"". ""We would ask everyone to consider the current risk to their own health and think about attending public events at a later date, when it is both safe and legal to do so."" A Metropolitan police cordon in Sandwich, Kent A probationary Metropolitan Police officer involved in the Sarah Everard search operation in Kent has been removed from their duties for allegedly sharing an ""inappropriate graphic"" with colleagues. The force says a graphic was shared via social media on Friday and was reported by a number of officers ""who were concerned by its content"". In a statement, the Met says: ""The PC had been deployed as a cordon officer supporting the search operation in Kent in relation to the murder of Sarah Everard. ""The officer has been removed from these duties and placed in a non-public facing role while inquiries continue. ""The graphic does not contain photographic images, no images of Sarah, nor any other material obtained from or related to the investigation into Sarah's murder."" Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave says: ""The MPS expects its officers to behave professionally at all times and this includes how they use social media. I take allegations that any officer or officers have failed to observe these standards very seriously and have referred this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct."" The force says Sarah Everard's family have been made aware of the incident. A woman who was at the vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common on Saturday says she was shocked by the clashes with police. Georgina, 27, who lives locally, says: ""It was disappointing, shocking,
really, because it was something so solemn and so lovely. ""There were even
pockets of people kind of praying or taking a moment's silence - and then all of a
sudden it just seemed like mayhem broke out."" The turning point in police tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, at about 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear and soon afterwards, officers tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people they believed were contributing to the crowding. Georgina says she accepts police officers are ""just doing their job"" but that the problem therefore needs solving ""from the top"" ""It
needs to be systematic change,"" she says. Georgina adds that on the evening of the vigil, she was ""shocked"" to see a man indecently exposing himself in the Clapham area. She has since given a police statement about the incident but says the officers she flagged it to at the time ""did nothing on the night to investigate"". You can read more about her experiences here. A large number of protesters have blocked off traffic on Westminster Bridge to demonstrate after the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of Reclaim These Streets campaigners chanted and held banners while police officers halted oncoming cars. They then moved outside nearby Scotland Yard where they chanted ""shame on you"" and ""our streets"". Protesters sat down on the road and shouted ""we will not be silenced"" as police officers watched on. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The Parliament Square demo has broken up - with some heading to Westminster Bridge and others leaving the scene. Before she went, university student Rebecca told me she wanted the government to let her arm herself - not to start a revolution, but to revolutionise her own feeling of safety. ""I think it's hugely important that what comes out of this entire incident is not just some kind of keyboard-warrior rage. ""A great place to start? Allow women to carry a firearm, namely pepper spray. On nights out we carry hairspray and a rape alarm because we don't feel safe.""   Sarah Everard's disappearance and death in south London has led to a national conversation about violence by men against women, with many women speaking out about their fears and personal experiences. Below are some charts and graphs to visualise violent crimes against women. See more here. Sarah Everard's death has sparked a moment for society to ""reflect"" on how to reduce male violence, abuse and harassment, the chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council says. Speaking after police chiefs from across the country met to discuss male violence against women, Martin Hewitt says his organisation wants to help contribute to a ""legacy of meaningful change"" following Ms Everard's ""truly tragic"" death. He says one of the key issues for policing is that too few victims see their cases go to court - and for those that do, the experience is ""long and difficult"". ""This has a serious impact on their confidence in the police and in the criminal justice system and means too many perpetrators get away with their crimes,"" he says. Hewitt says his council is waiting to hear the outcome of the government's review into why the number of rape prosecutions is falling. The NPCC is also carefully considering ""the role police could play in responding to street harassment"", he says, adding that calls for misogyny to be treated as a hate crime should be assessed. The Law Commission is due to make final recommendations on this issue in the autumn. Sarah Everard's death has sparked many women to share their experiences of sexual harrassment and violence A little earlier Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people not to attend protests during the coronavirus pandemic - following the clashes between police and women at a vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. ""The right to protest is the cornerstone of our democracy but the government's duty is to prevent more lives being lost during this pandemic,""she told MPs. Hundreds of people have gathered in central London anyway - following similar protests elsewhere in the country. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hundreds of people gathered at Parliament Square to pay tribute to Sarah Everard Hundreds of people joined a new vigil for Sarah Everard on Monday, despite the home secretary warning against such gatherings. Priti Patel said she understood public anger over the 33-year-old's killing but urged people not to protest while Covid restrictions were in place. Ms Patel also said she had started a review into the policing ofa previous London event for Ms Everard. Officers handcuffed and removed several women from Saturday's vigil in Clapham. Speaking from Monday's event in Parliament Square, Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home and legal correspondent, said there were ""far fewer"" police than there had been at Saturday's vigil, adding that officers had taken a ""hands-off"" approach similar to that seen during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. The Met faced widespread criticism for its handling of the Clapham vigil but the force's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, has rejecteda call to step down.,external What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Policing bill 'ignores violence against women' Four people were arrested for public order and Covid offences on Saturday, after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the marketing executive's kidnap and murder. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared On Monday evening, police began to move in on protesters in central London, after urging crowds to ""leave immediately"" or face ""enforcement activity"". Campaigners had marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area chanting and waving banners. Protesters could be heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"", with traffic in the surrounding areas brought to a stop. A large police presence followed the demonstrators, along with police vans and motorbikes. Protests andvigilshave also been held in several other UK cities over the past few days, includingCardiff,Edinburgh,Leeds,Brighton, andLiverpool. Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel said: ""Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge why Sarah's death has upset so many. ""My heartache, and that of others, can be summed up in just five words: 'She was just walking home.'"" The home secretary also confirmed she had instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to review the policing of Saturday's vigil. She said Ms Everard's killing had ""rightly ignited anger at the danger posed to women by predatory men and anger I feel as strongly as anyone"". However, she urged people not to participate in large gatherings or protests, saying that while the right to protest was a ""cornerstone of our democracy"", the government's duty was still to prevent more lives being lost during the pandemic. This video can not be played The home secretary speaks of the fear women have every day while walking home alone. She stressed that the government had put in place measures to ensure women and girls felt safe, including tackling domestic abuse, female genital mutilation and upskirting. The Domestic Abuse bill is on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, she said, adding that it would ""transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime"". 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' Met PC removed from duties for sharing graphic Woman 'was ignored by police' over exposure report In response, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: ""Let me be clear, it is not women who should change their behaviour, it is men and wider society that needs to change. ""And at times like this it is vital people are able to have their voices heard, of course in a way that is lawful and Covid-secure. Yet this weekend in Clapham things clearly went very wrong and I share the anger about the policing and the scenes we saw."" He also accused the government of ""a chronic failure"" to address violence against women and girls, adding that ""meetings and reopening surveys are not enough"". Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening. After that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End. At first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations.

They wanted to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations. But the way they acted tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted. Following a meeting of the government's Criminal Justice taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take ""immediate steps"" to give ""further reassurance"" to women and girls in the wake of Ms Everard's death. No 10 said it would be doubling the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to Â£45m. Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - with uniformed and undercover officers working to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in ""landmark legislation"" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets. He said: ""Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them."" Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds said replacing ""a tiny fraction of the cuts [the Conservatives] have made to local services is nowhere near good enough"". A spokeswoman for Reclaim These Streets, the group that initially organised the vigil, said they welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were ""so important"". ""Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,"" she said. Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests On Monday, Reclaim These Streets said it had lost confidence in Dame Cressida after talks with her earlier, claiming that she left after 15 minutes. Anna Birley of the group told BBC News: ""To be honest, Cressida Dick has lost our confidence and the confidence of women in the capital. We didn't want to call on her to resign until we'd at least had a meeting and given her a chance to engage. ""We don't have great confidence in the Met Police's willingness to work with us, unless forced to."" Reclaim These Streets called off Saturday's vigil, saying police had failed to ""constructively engage"" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way. When people gathered anyway, the group pointed out that they did so without the marshalling and other safety measures that had been originally proposed. On Sunday, there were protests outside the Met Police's headquarters at New Scotland Yard, Downing Street and in Parliament Square.

MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU's preference is for ""collaborative, pragmatic and constructive"" political discussions. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland and has led to the creation of a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Earlier this month,the UK government changed how the protocol is being implementedwithout EU agreement. It delayed the introduction of new sea border checks on food, parcels and pets. It also moved unilaterally to ease the trade in horticultural products across from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The European Commission hassent a letter of formal notice,externalto the UK saying these actions breach the substantive provisions of the protocol as well as the good faith obligation under the Withdrawal Agreement. It has asked the UK to respond within a month before it decides on further legal steps. Mr Å efÄoviÄ has separately sent a ""political letter"" to David Frost, the UK minister in charge of Brexit. It calls for the UK to enter into good faith consultations in the Joint Committee, the body which oversees the protocol, with the aim of reaching a mutually agreed solution by the end of this month.

Mr Å efÄoviÄ said: ""The EU and the UK agreed the protocol together. We are also bound to implement it together. ""Unilateral decisions and international law violations by the UK defeat its very purpose and undermine trust between us. The UK must properly implement it if we are to achieve our objectives."" Senior EU figures had previously made clear they'd be taking this legal action, so there was no element of surprise today. They felt they had to act in the face of what they claim is the UK breaking international law for the second time in six months. Triggering this sort of complaint, ""an infringement procedure"", is a weapon in the armoury the commission often reaches for when it believes member states have breached the rules. The unusual element here is that the dispute with the British will be ruled on by the European Court of Justice, even though the UK has left the EU. It's one legacy of Brexit that Downing Street will not want to shout about. Speaking earlier, the prime minister said the actions taken by the UK were ""temporary and technical measures that we think are very sensible"". Asked on a visit to Coventry on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""The protocol is there to uphold and guarantee, to buttress the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process."" It had always been ""very important [that] the wishes and consent of both communities in Northern Ireland are properly reflected in the outcome and that it should guarantee trade and movement not just north-south but east-west as well"", he added. The UK looked forward to discussions with its EU friends on the issue, said the prime minister. The UK government had received the European Commission letters and would respond ""in due course"", said a statement. It described the UK's actions as ""temporary, operational steps"" which were ""lawful and part of a progressive and good faith implementation"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""Low key operational measures like these are well precedented and common in the early days of major international treaties,"" it continued. ""In some areas, the EU also seems to need time to implement the detail of our agreements."" Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said the legal action was ""further proof that Brussels is closing its eyes to the serious problems the Protocol has caused for Northern Ireland"". EU says UK grace period extension breaches law Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Doing business with the Irish Sea border ""Rather than showing concern for stability in Northern Ireland or respect for the principle of consent, Brussels is foolishly and selfishly focused on protecting its own bloc,"" said the DUP leader. ""Not one single unionist party in the Northern Ireland Assembly supports this flawed Protocol, therefore Brussels' claim to be protecting peace continues to ring hollow. ""Regardless of the reaction in Brussels, the Prime Minister must deliver the unfettered flow of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland."" The Northern Ireland Protocolis part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union. But anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes.

"Zoe Ley, pictured here in 2015 The owner of a dog food firm brokered personal protective equipment deals worth Â£258m between the government and a Hong Kong firm, a BBC investigation has found. London-based Zoe Ley is likely to have been paid at last Â£1m by the firm for her work in securing the deals last spring when the UK was short of PPE. Ms Ley says she was approached by the UK's Covid taskforce when it was ""seeking urgent assistance"" to get PPE. The government denies this. Ms Ley has a background in finance and banking. When the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020, rising global demand for PPE - including orders for gowns, gloves and face masks - led to shortages and a scramble for supplies for NHS workers. Because of this, the UK government began awarding PPE contracts under emergency terms in which deals were handed to companies based on price and quality but without direct competition. This has led to concerns over a lack of clarity about why particular suppliers were chosen and accusations that a so-called high-priority lane favoured firms with political connections. What is going on with government Covid contracts? Has the NHS got enough of the right PPE? Ms Ley's company, Life Partners, was set up in May 2020 to ""supply Covid-related products"" and helped broker two deals, worth Â£258m, between Hong Kong firm Worldlink Resources and the UK government. Ms Ley, a former investment banker, also owns an organic dog food company called The Rockster. It is endorsed on its website by Prince Michael of Kent and actress Liz Hurley. In an effort to establish Ms Ley's role in the PPE deals, an industry insider helping the BBC's Panorama, called Worldlink posing as someone trying to buy PPE. He was told Ms Ley's involvement was crucial - her company was described as ""a bridge"" to the UK government. The insider was also told she was paid 30% - likely a seven-figure sum - of Worldlink's profits on the deals. But Ms Ley's lawyers would not tell the BBC how much commission she earned. The lawyers added that Worldlink paid Ms Ley less than 30%, saying Worldlink's own margins were at the lower end of the scale. Zoe Ley runs a company making organic dog food that retails at about Â£5 a tin Middlemen and women are a common feature of PPE deals. Manufacturers in China often use local brokers who then reach out to people in other countries to help them sell to customers. This can add to the overall cost of the products. The contract for one of the Worldlink deals -a Â£178m agreement to buy protective goggles,externalfor health workers - was only made public last week, after Panorama contacted the government. It blamed an ""admin error"" for having not published the deal earlier. The contract for one of the Worldlink dealswas one of 100 Covid-related contracts that remained unpublishedwhen Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs last month they were ""on the record for everyone to see"". Also last month, a judge ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancockhad acted unlawfully by not publishing Covid contractsin the required timeframe. The ruling came amid concern over how contracts were being awarded. Deals that have prompted questions includemajor PPE contracts awarded to a Tory councillor last yearand a Â£30m deal given to a firm owned by a man who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home. That caseis being investigated by the UK's medical regulator. In November last year, a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the coronavirus pandemicwas paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK taxpayer cash. The government has also been accused of favouring firms with political connections with a ""high-priority lane"" - in reality an email inbox available to ministers, civil servants or MPs and peers from any party. The idea of the inbox was to help the government choose between the huge numbers of offers it was getting. A report from the National Audit Office found that up to the end of July 2020, about one in 10 suppliers who had been put in the high-priority lane were then awarded contracts. The figure was less than one in 100 for other suppliers, outside the lane. The government says all leads were subject to the same eight-stage procurement process and the inbox helped identify credible offers more quickly. Almost all the companies that won contracts via the preference lane remain unidentified. The government has refused to say whether the deals Ms Ley brokered were placed in the so-called high priority lane. It said it has no contracts with Life Partners Limited or Zoe Ley, adding the 90 million goggles and nine million gowns supplied by Worldlink were made available to NHS workers. ""We've been consistently clear that work was taking place at a time when global demand was greater than ever before and rapid action was required, so we had to work at an unprecedented pace to get supplies to the frontline,"" a government statement said.

"Hundreds of people gathered at Parliament Square to pay tribute to Sarah Everard Hundreds of people joined a new vigil for Sarah Everard on Monday, despite the home secretary warning against such gatherings. Priti Patel said she understood public anger over the 33-year-old's killing but urged people not to protest while Covid restrictions were in place. Ms Patel also said she had started a review into the policing ofa previous London event for Ms Everard. Officers handcuffed and removed several women from Saturday's vigil in Clapham. Speaking from Monday's event in Parliament Square, Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home and legal correspondent, said there were ""far fewer"" police than there had been at Saturday's vigil, adding that officers had taken a ""hands-off"" approach similar to that seen during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. The Met faced widespread criticism for its handling of the Clapham vigil but the force's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, has rejecteda call to step down.,external What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Policing bill 'ignores violence against women' Four people were arrested for public order and Covid offences on Saturday, after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the marketing executive's kidnap and murder. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared On Monday evening, police began to move in on protesters in central London, after urging crowds to ""leave immediately"" or face ""enforcement activity"". Campaigners had marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area chanting and waving banners. Protesters could be heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"", with traffic in the surrounding areas brought to a stop. A large police presence followed the demonstrators, along with police vans and motorbikes. Protests andvigilshave also been held in several other UK cities over the past few days, includingCardiff,Edinburgh,Leeds,Brighton, andLiverpool. Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel said: ""Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge why Sarah's death has upset so many. ""My heartache, and that of others, can be summed up in just five words: 'She was just walking home.'"" The home secretary also confirmed she had instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to review the policing of Saturday's vigil. She said Ms Everard's killing had ""rightly ignited anger at the danger posed to women by predatory men and anger I feel as strongly as anyone"". However, she urged people not to participate in large gatherings or protests, saying that while the right to protest was a ""cornerstone of our democracy"", the government's duty was still to prevent more lives being lost during the pandemic. This video can not be played The home secretary speaks of the fear women have every day while walking home alone. She stressed that the government had put in place measures to ensure women and girls felt safe, including tackling domestic abuse, female genital mutilation and upskirting. The Domestic Abuse bill is on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, she said, adding that it would ""transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime"". 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' Met PC removed from duties for sharing graphic Woman 'was ignored by police' over exposure report In response, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: ""Let me be clear, it is not women who should change their behaviour, it is men and wider society that needs to change. ""And at times like this it is vital people are able to have their voices heard, of course in a way that is lawful and Covid-secure. Yet this weekend in Clapham things clearly went very wrong and I share the anger about the policing and the scenes we saw.""

Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening.

"Hundreds of people gathered at Parliament Square to pay tribute to Sarah Everard Hundreds of people joined a new vigil for Sarah Everard on Monday, despite the home secretary warning against such gatherings. Priti Patel said she understood public anger over the 33-year-old's killing but urged people not to protest while Covid restrictions were in place. Ms Patel also said she had started a review into the policing ofa previous London event for Ms Everard. Officers handcuffed and removed several women from Saturday's vigil in Clapham. Speaking from Monday's event in Parliament Square, Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home and legal correspondent, said there were ""far fewer"" police than there had been at Saturday's vigil, adding that officers had taken a ""hands-off"" approach similar to that seen during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. The Met faced widespread criticism for its handling of the Clapham vigil but the force's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, has rejecteda call to step down.,external What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Policing bill 'ignores violence against women' Four people were arrested for public order and Covid offences on Saturday, after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the marketing executive's kidnap and murder. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared On Monday evening, police began to move in on protesters in central London, after urging crowds to ""leave immediately"" or face ""enforcement activity"". Campaigners had marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area chanting and waving banners. Protesters could be heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"", with traffic in the surrounding areas brought to a stop. A large police presence followed the demonstrators, along with police vans and motorbikes. Protests andvigilshave also been held in several other UK cities over the past few days, includingCardiff,Edinburgh,Leeds,Brighton, andLiverpool. Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel said: ""Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge why Sarah's death has upset so many. ""My heartache, and that of others, can be summed up in just five words: 'She was just walking home.'"" The home secretary also confirmed she had instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to review the policing of Saturday's vigil. She said Ms Everard's killing had ""rightly ignited anger at the danger posed to women by predatory men and anger I feel as strongly as anyone"". However, she urged people not to participate in large gatherings or protests, saying that while the right to protest was a ""cornerstone of our democracy"", the government's duty was still to prevent more lives being lost during the pandemic. This video can not be played The home secretary speaks of the fear women have every day while walking home alone. She stressed that the government had put in place measures to ensure women and girls felt safe, including tackling domestic abuse, female genital mutilation and upskirting. The Domestic Abuse bill is on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, she said, adding that it would ""transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime"". 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' Met PC removed from duties for sharing graphic Woman 'was ignored by police' over exposure report In response, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: ""Let me be clear, it is not women who should change their behaviour, it is men and wider society that needs to change. ""And at times like this it is vital people are able to have their voices heard, of course in a way that is lawful and Covid-secure. Yet this weekend in Clapham things clearly went very wrong and I share the anger about the policing and the scenes we saw.""

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" Officers investigating the death of Sarah Everard have cordoned off an area in the town of Sandwich in Kent. The 33-year-old marketing executive disappeared as she walked home in Clapham on 3 March. Herbody was founda week later in Kent woodland. Serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has beencharged with her murder and kidnap. Police cordoned off a section of The Rope Walk, near the centre of Sandwich, on Sunday evening. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? Scotland Yard said police had routinely been searching areas of London and Kent as part of the investigation. On Sunday, Sandwich Town Council said it was in contact with Kent Police on behalf of Scotland Yard. Earlier, the mayor of Sandwich estimated that about one square mile of the town had been taped off. Officers from the Metropolitan Police have set up a tent and equipment inside the cordon The search site is near the centre of Sandwich Police officers are continuing to search along Delf stream and The Rope Walk with metre-long wooden sticks. Officers are also searching a trolley shelter at a Co-op supermarket. The cordoned-off area contains a secluded path near a stream and homes. At the edge of the cordon, a few officers gathered for discussion as one showed colleagues a piece of gold jewellery that was then put in an evidence bag. Divers have been searching a stretch of water in Sandwich, Kent Residents have been asked not to gather at the scene. Ms Everard was reported missing by her boyfriend on 4 March.

"Zoe Ley, pictured here in 2015 The owner of a dog food firm brokered personal protective equipment deals worth Â£258m between the government and a Hong Kong firm, a BBC investigation has found. London-based Zoe Ley is likely to have been paid at last Â£1m by the firm for her work in securing the deals last spring when the UK was short of PPE. Ms Ley says she was approached by the UK's Covid taskforce when it was ""seeking urgent assistance"" to get PPE. The government denies this. Ms Ley has a background in finance and banking. When the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020, rising global demand for PPE - including orders for gowns, gloves and face masks - led to shortages and a scramble for supplies for NHS workers. Because of this, the UK government began awarding PPE contracts under emergency terms in which deals were handed to companies based on price and quality but without direct competition. This has led to concerns over a lack of clarity about why particular suppliers were chosen and accusations that a so-called high-priority lane favoured firms with political connections. What is going on with government Covid contracts? Has the NHS got enough of the right PPE? Ms Ley's company, Life Partners, was set up in May 2020 to ""supply Covid-related products"" and helped broker two deals, worth Â£258m, between Hong Kong firm Worldlink Resources and the UK government. Ms Ley, a former investment banker, also owns an organic dog food company called The Rockster. It is endorsed on its website by Prince Michael of Kent and actress Liz Hurley. In an effort to establish Ms Ley's role in the PPE deals, an industry insider helping the BBC's Panorama, called Worldlink posing as someone trying to buy PPE. He was told Ms Ley's involvement was crucial - her company was described as ""a bridge"" to the UK government. The insider was also told she was paid 30% - likely a seven-figure sum - of Worldlink's profits on the deals. But Ms Ley's lawyers would not tell the BBC how much commission she earned. The lawyers added that Worldlink paid Ms Ley less than 30%, saying Worldlink's own margins were at the lower end of the scale. Zoe Ley runs a company making organic dog food that retails at about Â£5 a tin Middlemen and women are a common feature of PPE deals. Manufacturers in China often use local brokers who then reach out to people in other countries to help them sell to customers. This can add to the overall cost of the products. The contract for one of the Worldlink deals -a Â£178m agreement to buy protective goggles,externalfor health workers - was only made public last week, after Panorama contacted the government. It blamed an ""admin error"" for having not published the deal earlier. The contract for one of the Worldlink dealswas one of 100 Covid-related contracts that remained unpublishedwhen Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs last month they were ""on the record for everyone to see"". Also last month, a judge ruled that Health Secretary Matt Hancockhad acted unlawfully by not publishing Covid contractsin the required timeframe. The ruling came amid concern over how contracts were being awarded. Deals that have prompted questions includemajor PPE contracts awarded to a Tory councillor last yearand a Â£30m deal given to a firm owned by a man who used to run a pub near Matt Hancock's old constituency home. That caseis being investigated by the UK's medical regulator. In November last year, a Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the coronavirus pandemicwas paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK taxpayer cash. The government has also been accused of favouring firms with political connections with a ""high-priority lane"" - in reality an email inbox available to ministers, civil servants or MPs and peers from any party. The idea of the inbox was to help the government choose between the huge numbers of offers it was getting. A report from the National Audit Office found that up to the end of July 2020, about one in 10 suppliers who had been put in the high-priority lane were then awarded contracts. The figure was less than one in 100 for other suppliers, outside the lane. The government says all leads were subject to the same eight-stage procurement process and the inbox helped identify credible offers more quickly. Almost all the companies that won contracts via the preference lane remain unidentified. The government has refused to say whether the deals Ms Ley brokered were placed in the so-called high priority lane. It said it has no contracts with Life Partners Limited or Zoe Ley, adding the 90 million goggles and nine million gowns supplied by Worldlink were made available to NHS workers. ""We've been consistently clear that work was taking place at a time when global demand was greater than ever before and rapid action was required, so we had to work at an unprecedented pace to get supplies to the frontline,"" a government statement said. ""Stringent checks were in place on all contracts to guarantee quality, value for money and due diligence.""

At first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations. And so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets.

They wanted to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations. But the way they acted tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted.

Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - with uniformed and undercover officers working to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in ""landmark legislation"" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets. He said: ""Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them."" Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds said replacing ""a tiny fraction of the cuts [the Conservatives] have made to local services is nowhere near good enough"".

"Hundreds of people have attended a vigil for Sarah Everard in Parliament Square, despite Home Secretary Priti Patel urging against gatherings A crowd also blocked Westminster Bridge, with some appearing to receive fines for breaching Covid rules Patel says she has commissioned a review into the policing of a vigil on London's Clapham Common on Saturday Officers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Saturday night - with four arrests made The home secretary says she is ""listening to women and girls"" following criticism of the police's behaviour Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says she is ""more determined"" to lead the force, following calls for her to resign The PM has chaired a meeting of the government's crime and justice taskforce to discuss ways to protect women Edited by Alice Evans and James Clarke We are bringing an end to our live coverage now, but here's a reminder of the day's events: Today's updates were brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce, Kate Whannel, James Clarke and Alice Evans. Thanks for joining us. The prime minister has announced measures to make the streets safer for women, after a meeting of the Criminal Justice Taskforce. Boris Johnson says he is doubling the Safer Streets fund to Â£45m. The money will be spent on local projects to improve lighting and CCTV in parks and alleyways, and routes from bars,
restaurants and nightclubs. Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - where uniformed and undercover officers will work to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Johnson says: âThe horrific case of Sarah
Everard has unleashed a wave of feeling about women not feeling safe at night. âWe must do
everything we can to ensure our streets are safe, and we are bringing in
landmark legislation to toughen sentences and put more police on the streets. âUltimately, we must drive
out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal
justice system work to better protect and defend them.â The government also pledged Â£11m for more independent sexual violence advisors to support victims through the criminal justice process. This video can not be played Sarah Everard case: Aerials show police search area We have been hearing aboutsearches taking place in Sandwich, Kent, today as part of the investigation into the death of Sarah Everard. The video above (which has no sound) shows an aerial view of where those searches have been happening. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening. After that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End. At first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations. And so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets. Eventually teams of police officers began trying to pick off stragglers, instructing them to go home in line with the lockdown rules - or face fines. Some left, some appeared to get tickets. Now, those who are still here - mainly young people - have gone back to Westminster Bridge, disrupting the traffic through Whitehall and Parliament Square. They want to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations.But the way they are acting tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted. Three people have been fined for breaching Covid rules at a vigil in Liverpool in memory of Sarah Everard. Merseyside Police says up to 40 people held a ""peaceful"" socially-distanced minute's silence outside St Luke's Church on Saturday evening. But three people were fined for refusing to socially distance at a second event staged afterwards. Deputy Chief Constable Serena Kennedy says the force ""completely understands"" people want to hold an event in Ms Everard's memory ""whilst at the same time recognising the dangers faced by women"". However, she added: ""We must all do what we can to prevent the spread of [coronavirus] andthat includes not meeting in large groups."" Police were recorded removing women from the area Sussex Police has defended its response at a vigil held to remember Sarah Everard in Brighton. More than 150 people gathered in Valley Gardens on Saturday. One man was arrested, eight people were fined and many attendees criticised officers' handling of the unofficial event. Attendee Francesca Thornton, from Brighton, accused the police of an ""unjustified use of force"" after video footage showed officers removing a woman from the vigil and holding onto her arms. Assistant Chief Constable Lisa Bell says officers have ""an obligation to deal with things robustly when people disregard the law"". The force says it will review body-worn footage from the evening to see if thereare any lessons to learn. Police must respond with ""proportionate"" action under new protest laws, the home secretary has told MPs debating the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Priti Patel says the government will ""always defend"" the right to protest peacefully. ""But there is a balance to be struck between the rights of the protester and the rights of individuals to go about their daily lives,"" she says. ""This bill will give police the powers to take a more proactive approach in tackling dangerous and disruptive protest,"" she says. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Commons he wanted to talk about the ""distressing scenes we saw at Clapham"" on Saturday, when police clashed with people attending a vigil for Sarah Everard. He says: ""I share the anger that there is about the policing of this - deep and profound lessons need to be learned and there must be change. ""People should have been able to mark this moment peacefully and safely. We need to find a way for people to show solidarity safely and in a Covid-secure way."" He says: ""The scenes from Saturday should be a red warning signal to this House that rushing through ill-judged, ill-thought out restrictions on the right to protest would be a profound mistake that would have long-lasting consequences and do great damage to our democracy."" Police have moved in on protesters in central London, who have been campaigning following the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of protesters have marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area, chanting and waving banners. A large police presence has followed the demonstrators, with police vans and motorbikes. A tweet from the Met Police a few minutes ago urged the crowds to leave ""immediately"", warning that ""enforcement activity"" would take place shortly. And in the past few minutes, protesters have been heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Davina McCall has responded to the widespread backlash TV presenter Davina McCall has sought to ""clarify"" comments about the Sarah Everard case that sparked a backlash. As we've been reporting, the disappearance of the 33-year-old as she walked home on 3 March prompted many women to discuss their public safety concerns on social media. In response, McCalltweeted on Friday,externalthat the ""fear-mongering"" and ""calling all men out"" around the ""rare"" case could damage male mental health. Yesterday evening she said there had been a ""misinterpretation"" of her views. ""Any man that's violent [or] coercive towards a woman is abhorrent,"" she wrote. Read the full story here. BBC Radio 5 Live A retired police officer has told BBC Radio 5 Live Saturday's vigil for Sarah Everard should have been facilitated and allowed to go ahead. Ch Supt Owen West was a public order protest specialist for West Yorkshire Police. ""It was was an opportunity, not a threat, for the police to engage, to reassure, and to learn from the young women there, in relation to their lived experience,"" he says. He says too often the police see protest crowds as potentially inherently dangerous and violent. The government should think about police resources, he says, and consider the ""values, principles and ethics"" they want them to uphold. ""It's not just a numbers game,"" he says. ""It's not so much the quantity, it's the quality, it's the type of responses, it's the type of skills that are invested in."" Listen to the interviewhere,externalorlisten to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. Jennifer ScottBBC News The killing of Sarah Everard has sparked fresh debate on how to protect women from violence After the killing of Sarah Everard, the issue of violence against women and girls is at the forefront of many minds in Westminster. Figures from across the political spectrum are putting forward proposals of how to tackle the ongoing blight on our society, but one suggestion in particular has re-emerged in light of the tragic events: To make misogyny - prejudice against women - a hate crime. A crime is considered a hate crime if it is proven that the victim was targeted because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. When a crime falls into one of the above categories, judges in England and Wales have enhanced sentencing powers and can increase the punishment as a result. Campaigners say sex and gender should be added to the list, arguing misogyny is one of the ""root causes"" of violence against women. They also believe the addition would help to provide ""critical data on the link between hostility to women and the abuse and harassment women experience"". Read the full story here. Emma GlasbeyJournalist, BBC Look North It is not just in central London that crowds have been gathering this evening - hundreds of people have attended a protest in Leeds against the way the Metropolitan Police handled the vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. The event in Millennium Square, at which organisers Reclaim the Night Leeds have asked attendees to wear masks and socially distance, is also to protest overthe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. In a statement, West Yorkshire Police says: ""We understand the genuine safety concerns women have, concerns which have been amplified following the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard. ""Women should always feel safe to walk the streets of West Yorkshire and we remain committed to making the county a safe place to live and work for everyone. ""It is entirely normal the public wish to express their solidarity and concern in these circumstances."" However, the statement adds that ""the threat from coronavirus remains and any large gathering is a real risk to individuals' health"". ""We would ask everyone to consider the current risk to their own health and think about attending public events at a later date, when it is both safe and legal to do so."" A Metropolitan police cordon in Sandwich, Kent A probationary Metropolitan Police officer involved in the Sarah Everard search operation in Kent has been removed from their duties for allegedly sharing an ""inappropriate graphic"" with colleagues. The force says a graphic was shared via social media on Friday and was reported by a number of officers ""who were concerned by its content"". In a statement, the Met says: ""The PC had been deployed as a cordon officer supporting the search operation in Kent in relation to the murder of Sarah Everard. ""The officer has been removed from these duties and placed in a non-public facing role while inquiries continue. ""The graphic does not contain photographic images, no images of Sarah, nor any other material obtained from or related to the investigation into Sarah's murder."" Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave says: ""The MPS expects its officers to behave professionally at all times and this includes how they use social media. I take allegations that any officer or officers have failed to observe these standards very seriously and have referred this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct."" The force says Sarah Everard's family have been made aware of the incident. A woman who was at the vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common on Saturday says she was shocked by the clashes with police. Georgina, 27, who lives locally, says: ""It was disappointing, shocking,
really, because it was something so solemn and so lovely. ""There were even
pockets of people kind of praying or taking a moment's silence - and then all of a
sudden it just seemed like mayhem broke out."" The turning point in police tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, at about 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear and soon afterwards, officers tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people they believed were contributing to the crowding. Georgina says she accepts police officers are ""just doing their job"" but that the problem therefore needs solving ""from the top"" ""It
needs to be systematic change,"" she says. Georgina adds that on the evening of the vigil, she was ""shocked"" to see a man indecently exposing himself in the Clapham area. She has since given a police statement about the incident but says the officers she flagged it to at the time ""did nothing on the night to investigate"". You can read more about her experiences here. A large number of protesters have blocked off traffic on Westminster Bridge to demonstrate after the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of Reclaim These Streets campaigners chanted and held banners while police officers halted oncoming cars. They then moved outside nearby Scotland Yard where they chanted ""shame on you"" and ""our streets"". Protesters sat down on the road and shouted ""we will not be silenced"" as police officers watched on. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The Parliament Square demo has broken up - with some heading to Westminster Bridge and others leaving the scene. Before she went, university student Rebecca told me she wanted the government to let her arm herself - not to start a revolution, but to revolutionise her own feeling of safety. ""I think it's hugely important that what comes out of this entire incident is not just some kind of keyboard-warrior rage. ""A great place to start? Allow women to carry a firearm, namely pepper spray. On nights out we carry hairspray and a rape alarm because we don't feel safe.""   Sarah Everard's disappearance and death in south London has led to a national conversation about violence by men against women, with many women speaking out about their fears and personal experiences. Below are some charts and graphs to visualise violent crimes against women. See more here. Sarah Everard's death has sparked a moment for society to ""reflect"" on how to reduce male violence, abuse and harassment, the chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council says. Speaking after police chiefs from across the country met to discuss male violence against women, Martin Hewitt says his organisation wants to help contribute to a ""legacy of meaningful change"" following Ms Everard's ""truly tragic"" death. He says one of the key issues for policing is that too few victims see their cases go to court - and for those that do, the experience is ""long and difficult"". ""This has a serious impact on their confidence in the police and in the criminal justice system and means too many perpetrators get away with their crimes,"" he says. Hewitt says his council is waiting to hear the outcome of the government's review into why the number of rape prosecutions is falling. The NPCC is also carefully considering ""the role police could play in responding to street harassment"", he says, adding that calls for misogyny to be treated as a hate crime should be assessed. The Law Commission is due to make final recommendations on this issue in the autumn. Sarah Everard's death has sparked many women to share their experiences of sexual harrassment and violence A little earlier Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people not to attend protests during the coronavirus pandemic - following the clashes between police and women at a vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. ""The right to protest is the cornerstone of our democracy but the government's duty is to prevent more lives being lost during this pandemic,""she told MPs. Hundreds of people have gathered in central London anyway - following similar protests elsewhere in the country. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" Officers investigating the death of Sarah Everard have cordoned off an area in the town of Sandwich in Kent. The 33-year-old marketing executive disappeared as she walked home in Clapham on 3 March. Herbody was founda week later in Kent woodland. Serving Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has beencharged with her murder and kidnap. Police cordoned off a section of The Rope Walk, near the centre of Sandwich, on Sunday evening. Sarah Everard murder case: What happens next? Scotland Yard said police had routinely been searching areas of London and Kent as part of the investigation. On Sunday, Sandwich Town Council said it was in contact with Kent Police on behalf of Scotland Yard. Earlier, the mayor of Sandwich estimated that about one square mile of the town had been taped off. Officers from the Metropolitan Police have set up a tent and equipment inside the cordon The search site is near the centre of Sandwich Police officers are continuing to search along Delf stream and The Rope Walk with metre-long wooden sticks. Officers are also searching a trolley shelter at a Co-op supermarket. The cordoned-off area contains a secluded path near a stream and homes. At the edge of the cordon, a few officers gathered for discussion as one showed colleagues a piece of gold jewellery that was then put in an evidence bag. Divers have been searching a stretch of water in Sandwich, Kent Residents have been asked not to gather at the scene. Ms Everard was reported missing by her boyfriend on 4 March. She had visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at about 21:00 GMT to make what was roughly a 2.5-mile (4km) journey home.

"Hundreds of people gathered at Parliament Square to pay tribute to Sarah Everard Hundreds of people joined a new vigil for Sarah Everard on Monday, despite the home secretary warning against such gatherings. Priti Patel said she understood public anger over the 33-year-old's killing but urged people not to protest while Covid restrictions were in place. Ms Patel also said she had started a review into the policing ofa previous London event for Ms Everard. Officers handcuffed and removed several women from Saturday's vigil in Clapham. Speaking from Monday's event in Parliament Square, Dominic Casciani, the BBC's home and legal correspondent, said there were ""far fewer"" police than there had been at Saturday's vigil, adding that officers had taken a ""hands-off"" approach similar to that seen during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations last summer. The Met faced widespread criticism for its handling of the Clapham vigil but the force's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, has rejecteda call to step down.,external What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Policing bill 'ignores violence against women' Four people were arrested for public order and Covid offences on Saturday, after crowds gathered on Clapham Common to lay flowers and pay their respects to Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her body was later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the marketing executive's kidnap and murder. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared On Monday evening, police began to move in on protesters in central London, after urging crowds to ""leave immediately"" or face ""enforcement activity"". Campaigners had marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area chanting and waving banners. Protesters could be heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"", with traffic in the surrounding areas brought to a stop. A large police presence followed the demonstrators, along with police vans and motorbikes. Protests andvigilshave also been held in several other UK cities over the past few days, includingCardiff,Edinburgh,Leeds,Brighton, andLiverpool. Speaking in the House of Commons, Ms Patel said: ""Mr Speaker, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge why Sarah's death has upset so many. ""My heartache, and that of others, can be summed up in just five words: 'She was just walking home.'"" The home secretary also confirmed she had instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to review the policing of Saturday's vigil. She said Ms Everard's killing had ""rightly ignited anger at the danger posed to women by predatory men and anger I feel as strongly as anyone"". However, she urged people not to participate in large gatherings or protests, saying that while the right to protest was a ""cornerstone of our democracy"", the government's duty was still to prevent more lives being lost during the pandemic. This video can not be played The home secretary speaks of the fear women have every day while walking home alone. She stressed that the government had put in place measures to ensure women and girls felt safe, including tackling domestic abuse, female genital mutilation and upskirting. The Domestic Abuse bill is on track to receive royal assent by the end of April, she said, adding that it would ""transform our collective response to this abhorrent crime"". 'All I wanted was to stand with other women' Met PC removed from duties for sharing graphic Woman 'was ignored by police' over exposure report In response, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said: ""Let me be clear, it is not women who should change their behaviour, it is men and wider society that needs to change. ""And at times like this it is vital people are able to have their voices heard, of course in a way that is lawful and Covid-secure. Yet this weekend in Clapham things clearly went very wrong and I share the anger about the policing and the scenes we saw."" He also accused the government of ""a chronic failure"" to address violence against women and girls, adding that ""meetings and reopening surveys are not enough"". Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening. After that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End.

They wanted to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations. But the way they acted tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted. Following a meeting of the government's Criminal Justice taskforce on Monday evening, Downing Street said it would take ""immediate steps"" to give ""further reassurance"" to women and girls in the wake of Ms Everard's death. No 10 said it would be doubling the size of the Safer Streets fund - which provides local measures such as better lighting and CCTV - to Â£45m. Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - with uniformed and undercover officers working to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who chaired the meeting - said the government was bringing in ""landmark legislation"" to toughen up sentences and put more police on streets. He said: ""Ultimately, we must drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to better protect and defend them."" Labour's Mr Thomas-Symonds said replacing ""a tiny fraction of the cuts [the Conservatives] have made to local services is nowhere near good enough"". A spokeswoman for Reclaim These Streets, the group that initially organised the vigil, said they welcomed additional funding but did not believe funding alone would create the structural changes which were ""so important"". ""Women won't be able to trust that they are safe until misogyny and racism are tackled at an institutional level within government, police and the criminal justice system,"" she said. Under the current lockdown rules two people can meet for recreation outside, which can include ""coffee on a bench"" From 29 March people will be allowed to meet outdoors, either with one other household or within the ""rule of six"" Police can break up illegal gatherings and issue fines of Â£10,000 to someone holding a gathering of more than 30 people During last year's restrictions, when Black Lives Matter and anti-lockdown demonstrations took place,police took a hands-off approach to protests On Monday, Reclaim These Streets said it had lost confidence in Dame Cressida after talks with her earlier, claiming that she left after 15 minutes. Anna Birley of the group told BBC News: ""To be honest, Cressida Dick has lost our confidence and the confidence of women in the capital. We didn't want to call on her to resign until we'd at least had a meeting and given her a chance to engage. ""We don't have great confidence in the Met Police's willingness to work with us, unless forced to."" Reclaim These Streets called off Saturday's vigil, saying police had failed to ""constructively engage"" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way. When people gathered anyway, the group pointed out that they did so without the marshalling and other safety measures that had been originally proposed. On Sunday, there were protests outside the Met Police's headquarters at New Scotland Yard, Downing Street and in Parliament Square.

""But there is a balance to be struck between the rights of the protester and the rights of individuals to go about their daily lives,"" she says. ""This bill will give police the powers to take a more proactive approach in tackling dangerous and disruptive protest,"" she says. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Commons he wanted to talk about the ""distressing scenes we saw at Clapham"" on Saturday, when police clashed with people attending a vigil for Sarah Everard. He says: ""I share the anger that there is about the policing of this - deep and profound lessons need to be learned and there must be change. ""People should have been able to mark this moment peacefully and safely. We need to find a way for people to show solidarity safely and in a Covid-secure way."" He says: ""The scenes from Saturday should be a red warning signal to this House that rushing through ill-judged, ill-thought out restrictions on the right to protest would be a profound mistake that would have long-lasting consequences and do great damage to our democracy."" Police have moved in on protesters in central London, who have been campaigning following the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of protesters have marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area, chanting and waving banners. A large police presence has followed the demonstrators, with police vans and motorbikes. A tweet from the Met Police a few minutes ago urged the crowds to leave ""immediately"", warning that ""enforcement activity"" would take place shortly.

Figures from across the political spectrum are putting forward proposals of how to tackle the ongoing blight on our society, but one suggestion in particular has re-emerged in light of the tragic events: To make misogyny - prejudice against women - a hate crime. A crime is considered a hate crime if it is proven that the victim was targeted because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. When a crime falls into one of the above categories, judges in England and Wales have enhanced sentencing powers and can increase the punishment as a result. Campaigners say sex and gender should be added to the list, arguing misogyny is one of the ""root causes"" of violence against women. They also believe the addition would help to provide ""critical data on the link between hostility to women and the abuse and harassment women experience"". Read the full story here. Emma GlasbeyJournalist, BBC Look North It is not just in central London that crowds have been gathering this evening - hundreds of people have attended a protest in Leeds against the way the Metropolitan Police handled the vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. The event in Millennium Square, at which organisers Reclaim the Night Leeds have asked attendees to wear masks and socially distance, is also to protest overthe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. In a statement, West Yorkshire Police says: ""We understand the genuine safety concerns women have, concerns which have been amplified following the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard. ""Women should always feel safe to walk the streets of West Yorkshire and we remain committed to making the county a safe place to live and work for everyone. ""It is entirely normal the public wish to express their solidarity and concern in these circumstances."" However, the statement adds that ""the threat from coronavirus remains and any large gathering is a real risk to individuals' health"". ""We would ask everyone to consider the current risk to their own health and think about attending public events at a later date, when it is both safe and legal to do so."" A Metropolitan police cordon in Sandwich, Kent A probationary Metropolitan Police officer involved in the Sarah Everard search operation in Kent has been removed from their duties for allegedly sharing an ""inappropriate graphic"" with colleagues. The force says a graphic was shared via social media on Friday and was reported by a number of officers ""who were concerned by its content"". In a statement, the Met says: ""The PC had been deployed as a cordon officer supporting the search operation in Kent in relation to the murder of Sarah Everard. ""The officer has been removed from these duties and placed in a non-public facing role while inquiries continue. ""The graphic does not contain photographic images, no images of Sarah, nor any other material obtained from or related to the investigation into Sarah's murder."" Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave says: ""The MPS expects its officers to behave professionally at all times and this includes how they use social media. I take allegations that any officer or officers have failed to observe these standards very seriously and have referred this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct."" The force says Sarah Everard's family have been made aware of the incident. A woman who was at the vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common on Saturday says she was shocked by the clashes with police. Georgina, 27, who lives locally, says: ""It was disappointing, shocking,
really, because it was something so solemn and so lovely. ""There were even
pockets of people kind of praying or taking a moment's silence - and then all of a
sudden it just seemed like mayhem broke out."" The turning point in police tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, at about 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear and soon afterwards, officers tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people they believed were contributing to the crowding. Georgina says she accepts police officers are ""just doing their job"" but that the problem therefore needs solving ""from the top"" ""It
needs to be systematic change,"" she says. Georgina adds that on the evening of the vigil, she was ""shocked"" to see a man indecently exposing himself in the Clapham area. She has since given a police statement about the incident but says the officers she flagged it to at the time ""did nothing on the night to investigate"".

Sarah Everard's disappearance and death in south London has led to a national conversation about violence by men against women, with many women speaking out about their fears and personal experiences. Below are some charts and graphs to visualise violent crimes against women. See more here. Sarah Everard's death has sparked a moment for society to ""reflect"" on how to reduce male violence, abuse and harassment, the chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council says. Speaking after police chiefs from across the country met to discuss male violence against women, Martin Hewitt says his organisation wants to help contribute to a ""legacy of meaningful change"" following Ms Everard's ""truly tragic"" death. He says one of the key issues for policing is that too few victims see their cases go to court - and for those that do, the experience is ""long and difficult"". ""This has a serious impact on their confidence in the police and in the criminal justice system and means too many perpetrators get away with their crimes,"" he says. Hewitt says his council is waiting to hear the outcome of the government's review into why the number of rape prosecutions is falling. The NPCC is also carefully considering ""the role police could play in responding to street harassment"", he says, adding that calls for misogyny to be treated as a hate crime should be assessed. The Law Commission is due to make final recommendations on this issue in the autumn.

"Hundreds of people have attended a vigil for Sarah Everard in Parliament Square, despite Home Secretary Priti Patel urging against gatherings A crowd also blocked Westminster Bridge, with some appearing to receive fines for breaching Covid rules Patel says she has commissioned a review into the policing of a vigil on London's Clapham Common on Saturday Officers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Saturday night - with four arrests made The home secretary says she is ""listening to women and girls"" following criticism of the police's behaviour Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says she is ""more determined"" to lead the force, following calls for her to resign The PM has chaired a meeting of the government's crime and justice taskforce to discuss ways to protect women Edited by Alice Evans and James Clarke We are bringing an end to our live coverage now, but here's a reminder of the day's events: Today's updates were brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce, Kate Whannel, James Clarke and Alice Evans. Thanks for joining us. The prime minister has announced measures to make the streets safer for women, after a meeting of the Criminal Justice Taskforce. Boris Johnson says he is doubling the Safer Streets fund to Â£45m. The money will be spent on local projects to improve lighting and CCTV in parks and alleyways, and routes from bars,
restaurants and nightclubs. Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - where uniformed and undercover officers will work to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Johnson says: âThe horrific case of Sarah
Everard has unleashed a wave of feeling about women not feeling safe at night. âWe must do
everything we can to ensure our streets are safe, and we are bringing in
landmark legislation to toughen sentences and put more police on the streets. âUltimately, we must drive
out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal
justice system work to better protect and defend them.â The government also pledged Â£11m for more independent sexual violence advisors to support victims through the criminal justice process. This video can not be played Sarah Everard case: Aerials show police search area We have been hearing aboutsearches taking place in Sandwich, Kent, today as part of the investigation into the death of Sarah Everard. The video above (which has no sound) shows an aerial view of where those searches have been happening. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening. After that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End. At first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations. And so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets. Eventually teams of police officers began trying to pick off stragglers, instructing them to go home in line with the lockdown rules - or face fines. Some left, some appeared to get tickets. Now, those who are still here - mainly young people - have gone back to Westminster Bridge, disrupting the traffic through Whitehall and Parliament Square. They want to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations.But the way they are acting tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted. Three people have been fined for breaching Covid rules at a vigil in Liverpool in memory of Sarah Everard. Merseyside Police says up to 40 people held a ""peaceful"" socially-distanced minute's silence outside St Luke's Church on Saturday evening. But three people were fined for refusing to socially distance at a second event staged afterwards. Deputy Chief Constable Serena Kennedy says the force ""completely understands"" people want to hold an event in Ms Everard's memory ""whilst at the same time recognising the dangers faced by women"". However, she added: ""We must all do what we can to prevent the spread of [coronavirus] andthat includes not meeting in large groups."" Police were recorded removing women from the area Sussex Police has defended its response at a vigil held to remember Sarah Everard in Brighton. More than 150 people gathered in Valley Gardens on Saturday. One man was arrested, eight people were fined and many attendees criticised officers' handling of the unofficial event. Attendee Francesca Thornton, from Brighton, accused the police of an ""unjustified use of force"" after video footage showed officers removing a woman from the vigil and holding onto her arms. Assistant Chief Constable Lisa Bell says officers have ""an obligation to deal with things robustly when people disregard the law"". The force says it will review body-worn footage from the evening to see if thereare any lessons to learn. Police must respond with ""proportionate"" action under new protest laws, the home secretary has told MPs debating the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Priti Patel says the government will ""always defend"" the right to protest peacefully.

"Left-right: Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan and Riz Ahmed are all nominated Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars. Vanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees. It's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds. And two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history. This video can not be played Film critic Clarisse Loughrey shares her thoughts on this yearâs Oscar nominations Chloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman. Other nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman. Mank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations. This year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station. Olivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins are both nominated for The Father 10 nominations - Mank 6 - The Father 6 - Judas and the Black Messiah 6 - Minari 6 - Nomadland 6 - Sound of Metal 6 - The Trial of the Chicago 7 The Oscar nominations in full Daniel Kaluuya is nominated for playing Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah The eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination. At 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Colman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father. Carey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director. Kirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively. Other British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film. How Celeste made a 'secret' Oscars film song Why Olivia Colman's new film will leave you disorientated How Daniel Kaluuya became a freedom fighter Steven Yeun (left) and Yuh-Jung Youn (second left) are up for acting awards for Minari Six black actors and actresses are nominated, equalling the record set in 2017. This year, Kaluuya, Boseman and Davis are joined by US stars Andra Day, LaKeith Stanfield and Leslie Odom Jr - who is also up for best original song. Davis is shortlisted for playing a 1920s blues singer in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - the fourth nomination of her career, making her the most-nominated black actress ever. Allow Twitter content?

""Never in my dreams did I ever think a Korean actress would be nominated for an Oscar, and I can't believe it's me!"" she said. She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor. Minari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers.

Zhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director.

Fennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year. Overall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards. The 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy. ""I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,"" she said. Her previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year? Probably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel. Plus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance. Downey and Hathaway get 'worst acting' nominations Mank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture. Crucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script. It has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited. Mank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves. It would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley. I have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination.

"Ministers and senior officials have criticised Boris Johnson's decisions ahead of the ""inevtiable"" second wave Cabinet ministers and senior officials have told the BBC the government should have brought in tougher restrictions in the early autumn to tackle the ""inevitable"" second wave of coronavirus. In the run up to the anniversary of the lockdown, BBC News has spoken off the record to more than 20 senior politicians, officials and former officials about the key moments of the last 12 months. The investigation revealed significant frustration in government about Boris Johnson's unwillingness to tighten restrictions in September, as cases again began to rise. NHS waits at record high as second wave hits care How are the lockdown rules changing across the UK? Second wave: NHS staff 'feeling the strain' One senior minister said the government ""should have locked down more severely in the autumn"", while another said it had been ""totally ridiculous"" to be arguing about whether people should return to the office when there was inevitably going to be a second wave. And one senior figure told us: ""The biggest mistake was the rush of blood of to the head in the summerâ¦ there was a sense of denial about the second wave."" One former official added: ""We kept repeating the same mistakes over and over again, despite the masses of evidence that kept coming up. ""We lost an awful lot of time, and that led to more cases and more deaths."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the decisions taken, saying the government had ""listened to all the evidence all the way through"". But, he added: ""You have to balance all the different considerations. It's only at the prime minister's desk that all these different considerations come together. ""I'm responsible for the health aspects and then the huge economic response the chancellor is responsible for."" The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg puts the accusations to Health Secretary Matt Hancock We can also reveal that Boris Johnson had been briefed by officials ahead of a press conference on 3 March 2020 - right at the start of the pandemic - to discourage people from shaking hands with each other. Instead, when he took to the lectern, the PM boasted he ""shook hands with everybody"" during a hospital visit. A spokesman for No 10 said: ""The prime minister was very clear at the time he was taking a number of precautionary steps, including frequently washing his hands. ""Once the social distancing advice changed, the prime minister's approach changed."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson told reporters in March 2020 he 'shook hands with everybody' It's also understood the moment Mr Johnson realised the gravity of the situation was at a small meeting of No 10 staff on 14 March 2020. Data experts told the prime minister that the government's forecasts of how the disease was spreading were wrong, and without an acceleration of the plans to control the pandemic, the NHS would be overwhelmed. He was also warned that restrictions could be needed for as long as 18 months.

"Chocolate maker Thorntons has said none of its stores will reopen after coronavirus lockdowns are lifted. The decision to close its 61 shops will put more than 600 jobs at risk. The company said it had been badly hit by the pandemic, which forced its stores to shut their doors during the crucial Christmas and Easter holidays. ""The obstacles we have faced and will continue to face on the High Street are too severe,"" said Thorntons retail director Adam Goddard. ""Despite our best efforts we have taken the difficult decision to permanently close our retail store estate."" Thorntons has been on the High Street for more than a century but these days history isn't enough to guarantee survival. It was losing its way in the early 2000s with newer players, like Hotel Chocolat, entering the scene. It also embarked on a strategy of selling more chocolates through supermarkets and closing unprofitable shops. Italian food giant Ferrero bought the business in 2015 and has been trying to turn it around ever since. Over the last five years, it's shrunk from 252 to 61 stores. But Ferrero has now thrown in the towel on Thorntons stores altogether, betting that the brand's future is now online and on the supermarket shelves. This pandemic has created brutal trading conditions for so many traditional retailers. And the high street shakeout is still far from over. Thorntons said it had spent Â£45m transforming the business with changes to the way stores operate and the introduction of new cafes but its plans had been thrown off course by the pandemic. The company, which was founded in Sheffield in 1911, said it would continue to sell its chocolate online and try to sell more through supermarkets. Since the beginning of the crisis, sales through its website have increased by more than 70% compared to the previous year, it said. It will also try to expand the range of products made at its factory in Alfreton, Derbyshire and increase international sales. Chocolate firms' sticky dilemma Pandemic impact 'yet to be felt' on High Streets In 2011, Thorntons announced plans to massively reduce the number of stores it had on the High Street and in shopping centres. It said it would close up to 180 of the 364 stores it had at the time, following a strategic review. Since then, the number of stores has dwindled to 61. In 2015, Italian food giant Ferrero bought the chocolate chain for Â£112m. In a statement, the company said: ""We remain committed to this iconic British brand and will continue to invest further in the future potential of Thorntons to ensure we evolve with the times."" Thorntons is just the latest well-known name to suffer the impact that rolling lockdowns have had on the High Street as more people take to shopping online. More than 17,500 chain stores and other venues closed in Great Britain last year, according to figures from the Local Data Company. That is an average rate of 48 closures a day. Last week, department store chain John Lewisannounced plans to close more stores.  Other casualties have includedPSir Philip Green's retail empire, Arcadia, which included Topshop and Dorothy Perkins. Are you a Thorntons employee?

"Left-right: Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan and Riz Ahmed are all nominated Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars. Vanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees. It's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds. And two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history. This video can not be played Film critic Clarisse Loughrey shares her thoughts on this yearâs Oscar nominations Chloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman. Other nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman. Mank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations. This year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station. Olivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins are both nominated for The Father 10 nominations - Mank 6 - The Father 6 - Judas and the Black Messiah 6 - Minari 6 - Nomadland 6 - Sound of Metal 6 - The Trial of the Chicago 7 The Oscar nominations in full Daniel Kaluuya is nominated for playing Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah The eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination. At 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Colman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father. Carey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director. Kirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively. Other British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.

This year, Kaluuya, Boseman and Davis are joined by US stars Andra Day, LaKeith Stanfield and Leslie Odom Jr - who is also up for best original song. Davis is shortlisted for playing a 1920s blues singer in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - the fourth nomination of her career, making her the most-nominated black actress ever. Allow Twitter content?

""Never in my dreams did I ever think a Korean actress would be nominated for an Oscar, and I can't believe it's me!"" she said. She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor. Minari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers.

Zhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director. If she wins them all, she will equal a record set by Walt Disney, who is the only person to have won four Oscars in the same night. Allow Twitter content?

Fennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year. Overall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards. The 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy. ""I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,"" she said. Her previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year? Probably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel. Plus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance.

"Hundreds of people have attended a vigil for Sarah Everard in Parliament Square, despite Home Secretary Priti Patel urging against gatherings A crowd also blocked Westminster Bridge, with some appearing to receive fines for breaching Covid rules Patel says she has commissioned a review into the policing of a vigil on London's Clapham Common on Saturday Officers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Saturday night - with four arrests made The home secretary says she is ""listening to women and girls"" following criticism of the police's behaviour Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says she is ""more determined"" to lead the force, following calls for her to resign The PM has chaired a meeting of the government's crime and justice taskforce to discuss ways to protect women Edited by Alice Evans and James Clarke We are bringing an end to our live coverage now, but here's a reminder of the day's events: Today's updates were brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce, Kate Whannel, James Clarke and Alice Evans. Thanks for joining us. The prime minister has announced measures to make the streets safer for women, after a meeting of the Criminal Justice Taskforce. Boris Johnson says he is doubling the Safer Streets fund to Â£45m. The money will be spent on local projects to improve lighting and CCTV in parks and alleyways, and routes from bars,
restaurants and nightclubs. Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - where uniformed and undercover officers will work to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Johnson says: âThe horrific case of Sarah
Everard has unleashed a wave of feeling about women not feeling safe at night. âWe must do
everything we can to ensure our streets are safe, and we are bringing in
landmark legislation to toughen sentences and put more police on the streets. âUltimately, we must drive
out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal
justice system work to better protect and defend them.â The government also pledged Â£11m for more independent sexual violence advisors to support victims through the criminal justice process. This video can not be played Sarah Everard case: Aerials show police search area We have been hearing aboutsearches taking place in Sandwich, Kent, today as part of the investigation into the death of Sarah Everard. The video above (which has no sound) shows an aerial view of where those searches have been happening. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening. After that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End. At first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations. And so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets. Eventually teams of police officers began trying to pick off stragglers, instructing them to go home in line with the lockdown rules - or face fines. Some left, some appeared to get tickets. Now, those who are still here - mainly young people - have gone back to Westminster Bridge, disrupting the traffic through Whitehall and Parliament Square. They want to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations.But the way they are acting tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted. Three people have been fined for breaching Covid rules at a vigil in Liverpool in memory of Sarah Everard. Merseyside Police says up to 40 people held a ""peaceful"" socially-distanced minute's silence outside St Luke's Church on Saturday evening. But three people were fined for refusing to socially distance at a second event staged afterwards. Deputy Chief Constable Serena Kennedy says the force ""completely understands"" people want to hold an event in Ms Everard's memory ""whilst at the same time recognising the dangers faced by women"". However, she added: ""We must all do what we can to prevent the spread of [coronavirus] andthat includes not meeting in large groups."" Police were recorded removing women from the area Sussex Police has defended its response at a vigil held to remember Sarah Everard in Brighton. More than 150 people gathered in Valley Gardens on Saturday. One man was arrested, eight people were fined and many attendees criticised officers' handling of the unofficial event. Attendee Francesca Thornton, from Brighton, accused the police of an ""unjustified use of force"" after video footage showed officers removing a woman from the vigil and holding onto her arms. Assistant Chief Constable Lisa Bell says officers have ""an obligation to deal with things robustly when people disregard the law"". The force says it will review body-worn footage from the evening to see if thereare any lessons to learn. Police must respond with ""proportionate"" action under new protest laws, the home secretary has told MPs debating the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Priti Patel says the government will ""always defend"" the right to protest peacefully. ""But there is a balance to be struck between the rights of the protester and the rights of individuals to go about their daily lives,"" she says. ""This bill will give police the powers to take a more proactive approach in tackling dangerous and disruptive protest,"" she says. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Commons he wanted to talk about the ""distressing scenes we saw at Clapham"" on Saturday, when police clashed with people attending a vigil for Sarah Everard. He says: ""I share the anger that there is about the policing of this - deep and profound lessons need to be learned and there must be change. ""People should have been able to mark this moment peacefully and safely. We need to find a way for people to show solidarity safely and in a Covid-secure way."" He says: ""The scenes from Saturday should be a red warning signal to this House that rushing through ill-judged, ill-thought out restrictions on the right to protest would be a profound mistake that would have long-lasting consequences and do great damage to our democracy."" Police have moved in on protesters in central London, who have been campaigning following the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of protesters have marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area, chanting and waving banners. A large police presence has followed the demonstrators, with police vans and motorbikes. A tweet from the Met Police a few minutes ago urged the crowds to leave ""immediately"", warning that ""enforcement activity"" would take place shortly. And in the past few minutes, protesters have been heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Radio 5 Live Listener says she is thankful to the women who gathered at Clapham Common BBC Radio 5 Live heard earlier from an anonymous listener who says police described her experience of sexual abuse as a teenager as ""experimentation"". Talking to Naga Munchetty, she said: ""I want justice but I know Iâll never get that. ""The women who stood up and went to the vigil and protested, Iâm just so thankful to them, theyâve made people have the conversation."" Listen to the interviewhere,external. Davina McCall has responded to the widespread backlash TV presenter Davina McCall has sought to ""clarify"" comments about the Sarah Everard case that sparked a backlash. As we've been reporting, the disappearance of the 33-year-old as she walked home on 3 March prompted many women to discuss their public safety concerns on social media. In response, McCalltweeted on Friday,externalthat the ""fear-mongering"" and ""calling all men out"" around the ""rare"" case could damage male mental health. Yesterday evening she said there had been a ""misinterpretation"" of her views. ""Any man that's violent [or] coercive towards a woman is abhorrent,"" she wrote. Read the full story here. BBC Radio 5 Live A retired police officer has told BBC Radio 5 Live Saturday's vigil for Sarah Everard should have been facilitated and allowed to go ahead. Ch Supt Owen West was a public order protest specialist for West Yorkshire Police. ""It was was an opportunity, not a threat, for the police to engage, to reassure, and to learn from the young women there, in relation to their lived experience,"" he says. He says too often the police see protest crowds as potentially inherently dangerous and violent. The government should think about police resources, he says, and consider the ""values, principles and ethics"" they want them to uphold. ""It's not just a numbers game,"" he says. ""It's not so much the quantity, it's the quality, it's the type of responses, it's the type of skills that are invested in."" Listen to the interviewhere,externalorlisten to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. Jennifer ScottBBC News The killing of Sarah Everard has sparked fresh debate on how to protect women from violence After the killing of Sarah Everard, the issue of violence against women and girls is at the forefront of many minds in Westminster. Figures from across the political spectrum are putting forward proposals of how to tackle the ongoing blight on our society, but one suggestion in particular has re-emerged in light of the tragic events: To make misogyny - prejudice against women - a hate crime. A crime is considered a hate crime if it is proven that the victim was targeted because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. When a crime falls into one of the above categories, judges in England and Wales have enhanced sentencing powers and can increase the punishment as a result. Campaigners say sex and gender should be added to the list, arguing misogyny is one of the ""root causes"" of violence against women. They also believe the addition would help to provide ""critical data on the link between hostility to women and the abuse and harassment women experience"". Read the full story here. Emma GlasbeyJournalist, BBC Look North It is not just in central London that crowds have been gathering this evening - hundreds of people have attended a protest in Leeds against the way the Metropolitan Police handled the vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. The event in Millennium Square, at which organisers Reclaim the Night Leeds have asked attendees to wear masks and socially distance, is also to protest overthe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. In a statement, West Yorkshire Police says: ""We understand the genuine safety concerns women have, concerns which have been amplified following the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard. ""Women should always feel safe to walk the streets of West Yorkshire and we remain committed to making the county a safe place to live and work for everyone. ""It is entirely normal the public wish to express their solidarity and concern in these circumstances."" However, the statement adds that ""the threat from coronavirus remains and any large gathering is a real risk to individuals' health"". ""We would ask everyone to consider the current risk to their own health and think about attending public events at a later date, when it is both safe and legal to do so."" A Metropolitan police cordon in Sandwich, Kent A probationary Metropolitan Police officer involved in the Sarah Everard search operation in Kent has been removed from their duties for allegedly sharing an ""inappropriate graphic"" with colleagues. The force says a graphic was shared via social media on Friday and was reported by a number of officers ""who were concerned by its content"". In a statement, the Met says: ""The PC had been deployed as a cordon officer supporting the search operation in Kent in relation to the murder of Sarah Everard. ""The officer has been removed from these duties and placed in a non-public facing role while inquiries continue. ""The graphic does not contain photographic images, no images of Sarah, nor any other material obtained from or related to the investigation into Sarah's murder."" Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave says: ""The MPS expects its officers to behave professionally at all times and this includes how they use social media. I take allegations that any officer or officers have failed to observe these standards very seriously and have referred this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct."" The force says Sarah Everard's family have been made aware of the incident. A woman who was at the vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common on Saturday says she was shocked by the clashes with police. Georgina, 27, who lives locally, says: ""It was disappointing, shocking,
really, because it was something so solemn and so lovely. ""There were even
pockets of people kind of praying or taking a moment's silence - and then all of a
sudden it just seemed like mayhem broke out."" The turning point in police tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, at about 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear and soon afterwards, officers tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people they believed were contributing to the crowding. Georgina says she accepts police officers are ""just doing their job"" but that the problem therefore needs solving ""from the top"" ""It
needs to be systematic change,"" she says. Georgina adds that on the evening of the vigil, she was ""shocked"" to see a man indecently exposing himself in the Clapham area. She has since given a police statement about the incident but says the officers she flagged it to at the time ""did nothing on the night to investigate"". You can read more about her experiences here. A large number of protesters have blocked off traffic on Westminster Bridge to demonstrate after the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of Reclaim These Streets campaigners chanted and held banners while police officers halted oncoming cars. They then moved outside nearby Scotland Yard where they chanted ""shame on you"" and ""our streets"". Protesters sat down on the road and shouted ""we will not be silenced"" as police officers watched on. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The Parliament Square demo has broken up - with some heading to Westminster Bridge and others leaving the scene. Before she went, university student Rebecca told me she wanted the government to let her arm herself - not to start a revolution, but to revolutionise her own feeling of safety. ""I think it's hugely important that what comes out of this entire incident is not just some kind of keyboard-warrior rage. ""A great place to start? Allow women to carry a firearm, namely pepper spray. On nights out we carry hairspray and a rape alarm because we don't feel safe.""   Sarah Everard's disappearance and death in south London has led to a national conversation about violence by men against women, with many women speaking out about their fears and personal experiences. Below are some charts and graphs to visualise violent crimes against women. See more here. Sarah Everard's death has sparked a moment for society to ""reflect"" on how to reduce male violence, abuse and harassment, the chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council says. Speaking after police chiefs from across the country met to discuss male violence against women, Martin Hewitt says his organisation wants to help contribute to a ""legacy of meaningful change"" following Ms Everard's ""truly tragic"" death. He says one of the key issues for policing is that too few victims see their cases go to court - and for those that do, the experience is ""long and difficult"". ""This has a serious impact on their confidence in the police and in the criminal justice system and means too many perpetrators get away with their crimes,"" he says. Hewitt says his council is waiting to hear the outcome of the government's review into why the number of rape prosecutions is falling. The NPCC is also carefully considering ""the role police could play in responding to street harassment"", he says, adding that calls for misogyny to be treated as a hate crime should be assessed. The Law Commission is due to make final recommendations on this issue in the autumn. Sarah Everard's death has sparked many women to share their experiences of sexual harrassment and violence A little earlier Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people not to attend protests during the coronavirus pandemic - following the clashes between police and women at a vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. ""The right to protest is the cornerstone of our democracy but the government's duty is to prevent more lives being lost during this pandemic,""she told MPs. Hundreds of people have gathered in central London anyway - following similar protests elsewhere in the country. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson said buses would be greener and more frequent Hundreds of miles of new bus lanes and price caps on tickets are being planned for England under a new bus strategy from the government. The Â£3bn plan will make buses across the country cheaper and easier to use, the Department for Transport said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the strategy would create thousands of jobs, as well as making buses greener and more frequent. But unions and Labour said it would not reverse past cuts to services. Speaking as he toured the National Express depot in Coventry, the prime minister said the city would become the UK's first electric bus city. Mr Johnson said the scheme would drive down carbon emissions and pollution. He added that the number of people using buses was beginning to ""bounce back"" and that good bus routes could be ""transformatory"" for people's job prospects. What has been happening to bus travel? Bus cuts leave a million people without a regular service Bus funding: Where would it make the most difference? The government is promising services that are so frequent, passengers will be able to ""turn up and go"". As part of the shake-up, daily price caps will be introduced so that people can use the bus as many times a day as they need. More evening and weekend services will also be introduced, and all buses will accept contactless payment, the government pledged. It hopes to meet its targets through so-called enhanced partnerships that will see local authorities agree to make improvements to infrastructure in return for better services from bus companies. More franchising will also be introduced. As part of the plan, the government has promised to deliver 4,000 new electric or hydrogen buses that will be built in the UK by the end of this parliament. It will also end the sale of diesel buses and has launched a consultation to decide when the ban should come into effect. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Buses are this country's favourite way of getting around. But services across England are patchy, and it's frankly not good enough."" Governmentfigures from 2019,externalshow that 7% of people travelled to work by bus, while 68% commute by car. But bus use has fallen steadily over the past decade, along withfinancial support from both local and central government. In 2009, 4.64 billion journeys were taken on local buses. By 2019, that figure was 4.32 billion. The government said it wanted to encourage more people on to buses as the UK emerges from the coronavirus crisis. ""As we build back from the pandemic, better buses will be one of our first acts of levelling-up,"" Boris Johnson said. ""Just as they did in London, our reforms will make buses the transport of choice, reducing the number of car journeys and improving quality of life for millions."" But even in the capital, the number of journeys taken by bushas fallen by 1.4%,externalsince 2009. In a statement, Labour's shadow bus minister Sam Tarry said: ""This so-called strategy offers nothing for those who were looking for a bold vision to reverse the millions of miles of bus routes lost across the country."" ""The Tories said deregulation would improve our buses but they're running bus services into the ground. Passengers now face a toxic mix of rising fares, cuts to services and reduced access."" Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for transport, said: ""It's welcome that the Conservatives have finally realised that people take buses, however today's announcement will not reverse their endless cuts to our vital bus networks. ""Liberal Democrats believe local authorities must be at the heart of any bus strategy. This includes giving them power to run their own bus services, instead of being shackled to unpopular private bus companies who too often fail the communities they serve."" The Unite union, which represents more than 70,000 bus workers, said the plan would not be enough to reverse a decade of service cuts that have left communities isolated. ""The national bus strategy is an admission that the 1980s deregulation of the bus service has been a complete failure,"" said Bobby Morton, the union's national officer for passenger transport. ""Fares have increased, services have reduced, private operators cherry-pick the most profitable routes and social exclusion has mushroomed as connectivity has been cut."" But bus operator Stagecoach said it welcomed the ""ambition"" of the government's new strategy. ""For too long, the power of buses to transform local communities and local people's lives has been overlooked,"" its chief executive Martin Griffiths said. He added that it was ""critical"" the new strategy was matched with ""the right level of funding"" and consistent government policy on buses. ""We look forward to understanding more detail around the government's plans for the future and its proposed roadmap to bridge from the pandemic to a new era for buses."" Today's strategy makes the right noises that will appeal to bus users. But some passenger groups say the devil could be in the detail. They want to know how the government is going to make sure it pays for the long list of promises it has made. That will come down to the plans that local authorities make with bus operators. Some councils and operators will already be ahead of the game, with teams that are keen to work together, particularly after the past year when many bus routes and services had to change during the pandemic. Other councils will find it more difficult to get people with the right skills in place to be able to work out what will be best for bus users in their area. The government says it will provide support and funding to help draw up those plans. How each part of the country experiences these changes will depend on how those local decisions are made.

"Getting goods across the Irish Sea border involves a range of new processes, checks and documentation The EU has begun legal action against the UK over its alleged breach ofthe NI Protocol. It could lead to the UK having to defend its actions at the European Court of Justice. The European Commission's vice president said he hopes the issue can be resolved without further legal action. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the EU's preference is for ""collaborative, pragmatic and constructive"" political discussions. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland and has led to the creation of a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Earlier this month,the UK government changed how the protocol is being implementedwithout EU agreement. It delayed the introduction of new sea border checks on food, parcels and pets. It also moved unilaterally to ease the trade in horticultural products across from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The European Commission hassent a letter of formal notice,externalto the UK saying these actions breach the substantive provisions of the protocol as well as the good faith obligation under the Withdrawal Agreement. It has asked the UK to respond within a month before it decides on further legal steps. Mr Å efÄoviÄ has separately sent a ""political letter"" to David Frost, the UK minister in charge of Brexit. It calls for the UK to enter into good faith consultations in the Joint Committee, the body which oversees the protocol, with the aim of reaching a mutually agreed solution by the end of this month.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said: ""The EU and the UK agreed the protocol together. We are also bound to implement it together. ""Unilateral decisions and international law violations by the UK defeat its very purpose and undermine trust between us. The UK must properly implement it if we are to achieve our objectives."" Senior EU figures had previously made clear they'd be taking this legal action, so there was no element of surprise today. They felt they had to act in the face of what they claim is the UK breaking international law for the second time in six months. Triggering this sort of complaint, ""an infringement procedure"", is a weapon in the armoury the commission often reaches for when it believes member states have breached the rules. The unusual element here is that the dispute with the British will be ruled on by the European Court of Justice, even though the UK has left the EU. It's one legacy of Brexit that Downing Street will not want to shout about. Speaking earlier, the prime minister said the actions taken by the UK were ""temporary and technical measures that we think are very sensible"". Asked on a visit to Coventry on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""The protocol is there to uphold and guarantee, to buttress the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process."" It had always been ""very important [that] the wishes and consent of both communities in Northern Ireland are properly reflected in the outcome and that it should guarantee trade and movement not just north-south but east-west as well"", he added. The UK looked forward to discussions with its EU friends on the issue, said the prime minister. The UK government had received the European Commission letters and would respond ""in due course"", said a statement. It described the UK's actions as ""temporary, operational steps"" which were ""lawful and part of a progressive and good faith implementation"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""Low key operational measures like these are well precedented and common in the early days of major international treaties,"" it continued. ""In some areas, the EU also seems to need time to implement the detail of our agreements."" Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said the legal action was ""further proof that Brussels is closing its eyes to the serious problems the Protocol has caused for Northern Ireland"". EU says UK grace period extension breaches law Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Doing business with the Irish Sea border ""Rather than showing concern for stability in Northern Ireland or respect for the principle of consent, Brussels is foolishly and selfishly focused on protecting its own bloc,"" said the DUP leader. ""Not one single unionist party in the Northern Ireland Assembly supports this flawed Protocol, therefore Brussels' claim to be protecting peace continues to ring hollow. ""Regardless of the reaction in Brussels, the Prime Minister must deliver the unfettered flow of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland."" The Northern Ireland Protocolis part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union. But anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes. EU says UK grace period extension breaches law EU legal action imminent over UK extensions What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"This video can not be played Organisers said they cancelled a vigil originally planned at Clapham Common because police did not ""constructively engage"" with logistics Boris Johnson has said he is ""deeply concerned"" by footage showing police officers detaining women at Saturday's vigil to remember Sarah Everard. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the crime and justice taskforce later to discuss ways to protect women. Officers handcuffed women and removed them from the gathering on Clapham Common in London on Saturday. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has dismissed calls to resign and defended the force's actions. She said she was ""more determined"" to lead the Met, and hit out at ""armchair"" critics. Dame Cressida will join Mr Johnson at the taskforce meeting, which will discuss what further action is needed to make streets safer for women. Government sources said both Home Secretary Priti Patel and the prime minister had confidence in Dame Cressida. What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? Policing bill 'ignores violence against women' What are the plans to change the law on protests? Ms Patel has instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), to ""conduct a lessons learned review in to the policing of the event"", the prime minister has said. Mr Johnson said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the scenes on Clapham Common on Saturday night and that Dame Cressida had ""committed to reviewing how this was handled"". ""The death of Sarah Everard must unite us in determination to drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to protect and defend them,"" he added. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared Dame Cressida said she agreed on the need for a ""sober review"" and defended how officers responded to the ""really big crowd"". ""They have to make these really difficult calls and I don't think anybody should be sitting back in an armchair and saying 'well that was done badly' or 'I would have done it differently' without actually understanding what was going through their minds,"" she said. She added that what happened to Ms Everard made her ""more determined"" to lead the organisation. Four people were arrested for public order and coronavirus regulation breaches, the Met said. This video can not be played Dania Al-Obeid, who was arrested at the vigil: ""All I wanted was to stand with other women"" Hundreds gathered at the bandstand in Clapham Common, south London, on Saturday evening for a vigil for Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her remains were later found in woodland in Kent and Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old's kidnap and murder. Town centre searches in Everard murder case How many attacks on women are there? How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Louise McLoughlin was one of those at the bandstand on Saturday. She told BBC Breakfast it was ""a really lovely scene"" when she arrived at around 18:00 GMT, but ""it started to get a bit more riled"" around half an hour later. ""The decision was obviously made for [the police] to move in and take over the area,"" she said. ""At that point, it became a bit of a push and pull and there were a few scuffles and all of the candles and glass and the signs and the flowers that would have been put down for Sarah, you could just hear the breaking of glass now and again as these things were trampled on."" One of the women arrested, Dania Al'Obeid, said she knew the vigil had been cancelled but she ""needed to go and pay my respects"". She told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think that is where the frustration was, the bigger picture here was lost - we felt like we were silenced."" Another of those arrested, Patsy Stevenson, whose photograph featured on many newspaper front pages, told Sky News: ""I've been thrown into the public eye and the only way I can make this not in vain is to not make it political, not against the police, it's just about the safety of women and we need to talk about it."" Images of Patsy Stevenson being detained by police at the vigil were shared widely Maintaining public order at protests is one of the hardest jobs in modern policing. If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe. But when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in. Sunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head. But the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control. The question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing. Read more from Dominic. Asked whether police could have used their discretion as they did when taking the knee with Black Lives Matter protesters or dancing with Extinction Rebellion, Martin Hewitt - chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council - told Today that the investigation into the Met's actions ""will look at all elements"" of the event. Sir Peter Fahy, former chief constable for Greater Manchester Police, said HMIC had previously criticised the police for not intervening enough in Black Lives Matter protests and that many officers felt they were ""damned if they do and damned if they don't"". He added that current techniques for removing people from events safely ""means that they normally have about five officers - one on each limb and one holding the head"". ""The trouble is, when you photograph that, it then looks very heavy-handed,"" he said. The force's action at the vigil have drawn widespread criticism, with images and footage showing officers forcibly detaining women. London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the police's actions as ""unacceptable"", adding he was ""not satisfied"" with the explanation provided by Dame Cressida and the deputy commissioner when he spoke to them. He said he wanted HMIC to investigate the events and for the Independent Office for Police Conduct to investigate the actions of police officers. But Dame Vera Baird - the victims' commissioner for England and Wales - said the focus must now return to women's experience of sexual harassment and violence rather than the police's handling of Saturday's vigil. Dame Vera told the BBC: ""Let's return to the issue, which is why is it that this number of women, when this awful event [Sarah Everard;s death] has occurred, have started to talk about their appalling experiences. ""They regard, quite clearly, the streets as lawless for women when it comes to male behaviour. Men it seems, they tell us, they can do what they want and say what they want, and nobody will take action."" Ahead of the event, organisers Reclaim These Streets had called off the vigil, saying the police had failed to ""constructively engage"" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way. The NPCC's Mr Hewitttweeted that he would ""bring all police chiefs together"",externalon Monday to discuss ""what more we can do to better protect women"". In a letter to Dame Cressida, posted on Twitter on Sunday,,externalReclaim These Streets accused the Met chief of putting those who attended ""at a serious health risk through a lack of Covid-safe marshalling"" and ""at risk of being manhandled, fined and arrested"" by officers. The group said it believed the Met had misrepresented a High Court ruling on Friday, whena judge refused to say the event would be permittedunder coronavirus regulations. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmersaid the scenes were ""deeply disturbing"",external, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey hascalled for Dame Cressida to resign,external.

Sisters Uncut,externalheld an event outside the Metropolitan Police's headquarters atNew Scotland Yard,external, which it said was to remember Ms Everard and demonstrate against broader ""police brutality"".

"Education Minister Kirsty Williams and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Chris Jones have been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic It comes as all primary school pupils and secondary pupils in qualification years return to the classroom this week Hairdressers and barbers can reopen to customers with appointments from today as part of lockdown easing Outdoor education centres may not survive unless they are allowed to reopen soon, industry workers warn Natalie Grice, Luca Weinmann Al-Nawab and Andy Roberts That brings our coverage of today's Welsh Government coronavirus update to a close. Here's a summary of the main points from today:  Thanks for joining us - we'll have live coverage of the next scheduled Welsh Government coronavirus update on Wednesday. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has praised a fellow MPfor giving him  the Covid-19 vaccine. The Ribble Valley MP - originally from Swansea - received his vaccination at Blackburn Cathedral from his ""good friend and colleague"" Andrew Stephenson, who is helping with the vaccine roll-out. ""I've heard of MPs stabbing each other in the back before but never of them stabbing each other in the arm,"" Mr Evans said. A whole year has passed since the Stereophonics went ahead and played two indoor shows in Cardiff despite growing fears about the spread of  coronavirus in the UK. Looking back on the anniversary, Jessica Elgot from The Guardian newspaper said the gigs going ahead was ""one of the most jaw-dropping moments"" of the pandemic. The Welsh band were criticised for playing two nights at the Motorpoint Arena on the same weekend that theWales v Scotland rugby match was postponedby the Welsh Rugby Union for reasons of public health safety. Theband's sound engineer Dave Roden later said ""it wasn't our call"" to cancel the gigs, saying such a decision was ""usually"" the responsibility of the authorities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a UK-wide lockdown a week later. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Member of the Senedd Neil McEvoy has taken advantage of the relaxation of Covid rules for haircuts with a visit to a barber in Cardiff. ""If hairdressers can operate safely, surely other so-called 'non-essential' retail can too,"" he says, adding: ""Let's get back to work."" Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said all secondary school pupils in Wales should return before 12 April. Those in qualification years are back in class this week, along with all primary school children. Pupils in years 7 to 9 are able to get ""check-in"" sessions with teachers before that date, but Mr Davies said: âItâs important that pupils start their education rather than have simple check-in sessions.â Meanwhile Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the evidence presented by the deputy chief medical officer and the success of the vaccine roll-out pointed toward a return to university teaching being safe. âOn that basis, we should support it,â he said. Wales' education minister says she will âcontinue to have conversationsâ with universities and student unions about the issue of violence against women and girls. Kirsty Williams said although student satisfaction was high at Welsh universities, âwe cannot rest on our laurelsâ. âOne incident is too much and you can be assured that we will continue to have conversations with our vice-chancellors and NUS here in Wales,â she said. Small numbers of Covid cases in schools in Wales over the last month have not been sufficient to prompt a re-think over returning to the classroom, Education Minister Kirsty Williams has said. She told the Welsh Government press briefing the small number of cases were ânot a surpriseâ and that health officials were advising schools on how to handle any cases. Pupils aged three to seven returned to school last month, with older pupils heading back to class this week. âThere is nothing in our experience of the last three weeks when the foundation phase pupils have been in that has made us think we canât proceed with the important steps weâre taking today,â she said. âBut clearly one of the reasons weâre having a phased return is that we can monitor the data really closely.â Protective measures put in place in schools to reduce the spread of coronavirus will be kept âunder reviewâ, Wales' education minister has said. Teaching staff and secondary school pupils are required to wear face coverings, but not primary school pupils. Speaking during Mondayâs press briefing, Kirsty Williams said she acknowledged that the wearing of face masks and other protective measures in schools such as contact groups âcurtail that normal educational experienceâ. However, she added: âAs soon as the advice says we can move away from some of them, then we will do so."" Education minister Kirsty Williams has said it isa ""damning indictment"" that women do not feel safe to exercise alone outdoors. But she did not confirm when gyms may open again in Wales. When asked about clarity on gyms reopening, in light of safety concerns raised after the killing of Sarah Everard, Ms Williams said women feeling unsafe exercising alone outdoors ""tells you how far we have got to go as a society"". Ms Williams said gyms would reopen ""as soon as we're able"". She added: ""They are important places for many people. ""The Welsh Government has recognised this, when we changed the rules to allow two people to exercise together."" Wales is âwell placedâ to address issues of violence against women and girls because of the introduction of the new curriculum according to Education Minister Kirsty Williams. Ms Williams told the coronavirus press briefing she wanted to âput on record deepest sympathies to the familyâ of Sarah Everard,who was kidnapped in Clapham in London and found dead a week later. âCan I say that we really are well placed in the education system in Wales to address these points,"" she added. ""Only last week we saw the passage in our national parliament, our ground breaking new curriculum, which will mean that every child in Wales will be entitled to relationship education. âI honestly believe that that exposure to high quality education that looks at respect, consent, our roles as individuals in a safe and secure relationship is really important and will create the societal change that we need for the longer term,â she said. Police have been criticised fortheir handling of a vigil in Ms Everard's memory in London on Saturday, making arrests for alleged breaches of Covid regulations against large gatherings. Sarah Everard was found dead after going missing while walking home in south London Police in Wales should be commended for the way they handled vigils paying respects to Sarah Everard last weekend, according to the education minister. Ms Everard was found dead in a wooded area in Kent, after going missing while walking home in south London on 3 March. A Metropolitan Police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder. Kirsty Williams said the scenes witnessed at Clapham Common in London on Saturday, where police arrested a number of people at a vigil on grounds of breaching Covid regulations, would have âshockedâ those watching. However, she praised the way gatherings in Wales were held without incident. âI donât think anybody that watched those scenes [at Clapham Common] canât have been shocked by what they saw,â she said. âBut can I say how grateful I am to women and men in Wales who over this weekend also carried out vigils to mark the death of Sarah, and the wider issues that that death makes us confront as a society, and the police that oversaw those gatherings in a really respectful way. âWe have to remember weâre still in the middle of a pandemic and we need people to be cognisant of that, but I would commend both those that wanted to have their voices heard this weekend in Wales, and the police for the sensitive way that that was handled."" A total of 1,122,931 people in Wales have now received their first vaccination. This figure represents over 35% of the adult population. The Welsh Government claimed that with 264,255 people fully vaccinated, Wales leads the British nations in the vaccine roll-out. Allow Twitter content?

School trips make up the bulk of outdoor centres' income, say staff Businesses offering overnight education trips for childrenmay not survive unless they are allowed to reopen soon, industry workers say. Wales had 44 outdoor education centres before the pandemic, but at least five have now closed permanently. School trips make up the bulk of their income, with many heavily-reliant on pupils from England. The Welsh Government said it was doing ""everything we can to support businesses"". Currently guidance for English schools from the Department of Education (DfE) advises ""against all educational visits at this time"". Gareth Davies, operations manager at the Arete Outdoor Education Centre in Llanrug, Gwynedd, said he felt he was part of a ""forgotten sector"". ""We know that wellbeing and mental health is really important... and this is exactly where we can help,"" he said. ""But at the moment centres are closing and the next generation are going to miss out at a time when we could be of most help."" All university students in Wales will be able toaccess libraries, studios or labs after the Easter break, the Welsh Government has announced. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said students would be able to resume ""blended"" learning â mixing attending campus and working from home â from 12 April. She said the overall Covid message remained to âstay localâ, but the rules did allow travel for education. Lateral-flow Covid tests will be available twice a week for those students and staff who do attend campuses. Ms Williams told students: âI know your university experience this year has been very different from your expectations and youâve missed out on many of the social aspects of university life. âBut in doing so you have helped to keep the virus under control, reduced the risk of catching and spreading the virus, and this will certainly have saved lives.â Of the two Covid deaths in Wales reported on Monday, one is in the Swansea Bay area and one in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board in south Wales. Cwm Taf Morgannwg remains the board with the highest number of deaths, at 1,498. Case rates in Wales remain at 39 cases per 100,000 people overall. Merthyr Tydfil's case rate, which has been rising, is the highest in Wales at 144.2, followed by Anglesey at 92.8 and Conwy at 70. The number of people in Wales who have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine now stands at 1,122,931. Of those, 264,255 have received a second dose as well. Of those aged 65 and over, 90.5% or more have received a first dose, rising to 95% in the 75-79 age group. In the 50-54 age group, 30.3% have had a first dose along with 35.2% of the 55-59s. It rises to 56.9% in the 60-64 age category. Monday's Welsh Government briefing on the pandemic is being led by Education Minister Kirsty Williams, with Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Chris Jones. It begins at 12:15 GMT and can be viewed via the Coronavirus Update video link at the top of this page. You can also follow proceedings live on BBC One Wales, onBBC iPlayerorS4C. Supermarket aisles selling non-essential goods have been closed to the public Allowing supermarkets in Wales to start selling non-essential items again while other shops remain shut was not something ministers were comfortable with, the deputy economy minister says. Non-essential aisles in supermarkets will be able toreopen From 22 March, but all other shops must remain closed for another three weeks, until 12 April. Lee Waters said the move was seen as ""the least risky"" Covid rules relaxation, as supermarkets were already open. ""It was something we wrestled with, it was not something we were comfortable with, if I'm completely honest with you, but it's a pragmatic judgement,"" he told theBBC Politics Walesprogramme. Two more people in Wales have died with coronavirus, Public Health Wales has reported, taking the total deaths to 5,454. A further 248 cases have been logged, with the number in Wales since the pandemic began now standing at 206,653. Wales' health minister has thanked staff who havegiven him his first Covid vaccination. Vaughan Gething, who received the jab in Barry on Sunday, praised the ""very efficient and friendly team helping to keep Wales safe"". The minister, who is in his forties, has an underlying health condition which put him in a higher priority group for vaccination. He has urged other people in black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to accept the jab when offered it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Sarah Everard's death has prompted a public debate over women's safety It is a ""damning indictment"" that women feel unsafe to exercise alone outdoors, Wales' education minister has said. Kirsty Williams said the safety concerns raised afterthe death of Sarah Everard""tells you how far we have got to go as a society"". Meanwhile, First Minister Mark Drakeford said there needed to be a focus on women being and feeling safe. Ms Everard disappeared while walking home in London last week. Her death has prompted a debate over women's safety. This video can not be played Llinos Dafydd says the scenes at the vigil in London were very traumatic and triggering for survivors. A vigil on Saturday to remember the 33-year-old marketing executive has attracted criticism after footage showed officers detaining women, prompting Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say he was ""deeply concerned"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick hasdismissed calls to resign and defended the force's actions. When asked about clarity on gyms reopening, in light of safety concerns raised after Ms Everard's death, Ms Williams said women feeling unsafe exercising alone outdoors ""tells you how far we have got to go as a society"". But she did not confirm when gyms may reopen in Wales. What went wrong at the vigil? Town centre searches in Everard death case Vigils were also held in Waleson Saturday night to mark Ms Everard's death - some were held online, others were attended in person. This video can not be played Kirsty Williams says the new curriculum in Wales will help spark ""societal change"" Speaking at the Welsh Government's Covid briefing on Monday, Ms Williams said anyone watching events unfold at the London vigil would have been ""shocked by what they saw"". ""But can I say how grateful I am to women and men in Wales who, over this weekend, also carried out vigils to mark the death of Sarah, and the wider issues that that death makes us confront as a society, and the police that oversaw those gatherings in a really respectful way."" Pam French has spoken to her two sons, aged three and six, about women's safety Pam French, an organiser of a vigil for Ms Everard at Hailey Park in Llandaff North, said she had spoken about women's safety with her two sons, aged three and six. ""Sometimes it's easier to talk to children about it because the response isn't defensive, it's usually, 'why are you upset and what can I do about it?'. ""We've just been talking to them about being kind, treating people equally and all of those really basic messages, but if we start them from that early on then hopefully, we can make a difference,"" she said. The 43-year-old said issues raised in the past week ""just rips sticky plasters off a lot of stuff that I think a lot of us have held for many years"". ""For many of us, that brought home years of having to change our behaviour and modify our behaviour and being afraid,"" she added. People attended a vigil in Llandaff North in Cardiff on Saturday Ms Everard went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her remains were later found in woodland in Kent and Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with her kidnap and murder. Following Ms Everard's death, several hotels in Cardiff have responded by offering help to anyone feeling unsafe. About 50 people attended the vigil in Llandaff North The Angel Hotel urged women walking home who felt afraid to come to its reception. It tweeted: ""In light of the devastating news regarding Sarah Everard this week, here at the Angel Hotel we would like to offer women and girls who feel intimidated, scared or at risk in Cardiff city centre a 'safe place'. ""Please come into our reception and a member of our team will help you call a taxi, friend or family member to ensure you get home safe."" Later, the city's Indigo Hotel said it had been inspired by the Angel Hotel's offer and tweeted that staff would ""help you and ensure that you get home safely"". Sophie Howe said there was ""still an issue of men not willing to challenge"" sexual harassment The future generations commissioner said that misogyny ""should be an offence"" and ""something that the police should be taking seriously"". Sophie Howe said she thought the only reason why it was not an offence was because of the ""scale of the problem"". ""Millions of women probably across the UK are experiencing this sort of thing everyday. ""So I think there is a reluctance around how you can possibly start policing this."" However she said you have ""got to start somewhere, and it is down to what your priorities are"". She added that men should be educated about calling out sexual harassment. Ms Howe also said she had spoken to her four sons, aged nine to 21, about misogyny and harassment scenarios. She said she had experienced sexually explicit remarks and ""many times"" whilst walking on the street, had been followed by men driving slowly next to her. ""Speaking to them over the weekend, I think there is still this issue of men not willing to challenge,"" she said. She said she gave them one scenario in which they said the men involved were ""probably just having a laugh with friends"". This video can not be played Organisers said they cancelled a vigil originally planned at Clapham Common because police did not ""constructively engage"" with logistics ""I would like to think that my boys have been brought up to be feminists to be committed and interested in women's rights - even then that was the response I was getting,"" Ms Howe said. ""It might start out as a comment to make you laugh butâ¦ the more that society makes these things acceptable, the more that those people who are rapists, who are the sort of people who want to stalk, the more acceptable that becomes in their minds."" Mr Drakeford said that earlier this year ""women were contacting us saying they didn't safe being on their own on a dark January evening"", which prompted a change to Covid rules on exercise outdoors. ""Women need to be safe and there are practical things that can be done by public authorities, to try and assist that, but then it is feeling safe as well. ""In this instance, perception and reality both need to be addressed,"" he said. Deputy Minister Jane Hutt said that a ""deep change in society"" in needed to tackle violence against women.

"Blockbuster movie Avatar has retaken the highest-grossing film of all time spot thanks to its re-release in China. The sci-fi epic debuted in 2009 and held the global box office title for a decade until it was overtaken by Marvel's Avengers: Endgame in 2019. Following its re-release in the world's biggest movie-watching market of China worldwide total sales pushed it above the $2.8bn (Â£2bn) mark on the weekend. China has been the top-performing film market since pandemic lockdowns. Avengers overtakes Avatar at all-time box office Odeon cinema owner warns it's running out of cash How Asian film could take over from Hollywood Disney's new heroine representing 600 million people Director James Cameron's Avatar took in around $4m on Friday alone which pushed it ahead of  Endgame, according to distributor Walt Disney. Disney owns both films after the company bought entertainment assets from Fox in 2019. It also owns the Titanic movie, which is third on the list of highest-grossing movies. When Endgame passed Avatar in 2019, Mr Cameron tweeted a picture of Avenger's Iron Man on the fictional Avatar universe of Pandora along with a congratulatory note. He is currently working on four sequels to Avatar. The next film, which has been delayed several times, is currently scheduled for release in December 2022. This video can not be played Meet the three friends hoping to 'kick Disney's ass' ""We are proud to reach this great milestone, but Jim (James Cameron) and I are most thrilled that the film is back in theatres during these unprecedented times, and we want to thank our Chinese fans for their support,"" said Avatar producer Jon Landau. Chinese movie theatres have been open for several months now since pandemic-led shutdowns, and local movies have also been enjoying some of their strongest box-office sales ever. Ahead of its re-release in China, Avatar grossed around $760m in the US and just over $2bn internationally. Earlier this month, Disney's premiered its first South East Asian heroine movie in cinemas Raya and the Last Dragon sees her travel around the region to reunite its people and attempt to save the world in the process.

"Left-right: Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan and Riz Ahmed are all nominated Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars. Vanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees. It's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds. And two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history. This video can not be played Film critic Clarisse Loughrey shares her thoughts on this yearâs Oscar nominations Chloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman. Other nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman. Mank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations. This year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station. Olivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins are both nominated for The Father 10 nominations - Mank 6 - The Father 6 - Judas and the Black Messiah 6 - Minari 6 - Nomadland 6 - Sound of Metal 6 - The Trial of the Chicago 7 The Oscar nominations in full Daniel Kaluuya is nominated for playing Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah The eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination. At 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Colman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father. Carey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director. Kirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively. Other British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.

This year, Kaluuya, Boseman and Davis are joined by US stars Andra Day, LaKeith Stanfield and Leslie Odom Jr - who is also up for best original song. Davis is shortlisted for playing a 1920s blues singer in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom - the fourth nomination of her career, making her the most-nominated black actress ever. Allow Twitter content?

Ahmed is the first actor of Pakistani descent to get an Oscar nomination and the first Muslim to be up for best actor; and Yuh-Jung Youn is the first South Korean actress to get an Oscar nod. ""Never in my dreams did I ever think a Korean actress would be nominated for an Oscar, and I can't believe it's me!"" she said. She will be joined at the ceremony by Steven Yeun, her Korean-American co-star in Minari, who is nominated for best actor. Minari is also up for the Academy Awards' top prize, best picture, which is given to a film's producers. Its rivals for that award include Judas and the Black Messiah, which is the first best picture nominee to have an all-black line-up of producers.

This year, two of the five contenders are female, with Chinese-born, US-based Zhao the hot favourite for her story of a woman, played by Frances McDormand, who lives a nomadic life in a van. Zhao is up for a total of four awards this year - best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing, as well as best director. If she wins them all, she will equal a record set by Walt Disney, who is the only person to have won four Oscars in the same night. Allow Twitter content?

Fennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year. Overall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards. The 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy. ""I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,"" she said. Her previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year? Probably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel. Plus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance. Downey and Hathaway get 'worst acting' nominations Mank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture. Crucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script. It has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited. Mank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves. It would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley. I have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination.

"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

"Education Minister Kirsty Williams and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Chris Jones have been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic It comes as all primary school pupils and secondary pupils in qualification years return to the classroom this week Hairdressers and barbers can reopen to customers with appointments from today as part of lockdown easing Outdoor education centres may not survive unless they are allowed to reopen soon, industry workers warn Natalie Grice, Luca Weinmann Al-Nawab and Andy Roberts That brings our coverage of today's Welsh Government coronavirus update to a close. Here's a summary of the main points from today:  Thanks for joining us - we'll have live coverage of the next scheduled Welsh Government coronavirus update on Wednesday. Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans has praised a fellow MPfor giving him  the Covid-19 vaccine. The Ribble Valley MP - originally from Swansea - received his vaccination at Blackburn Cathedral from his ""good friend and colleague"" Andrew Stephenson, who is helping with the vaccine roll-out. ""I've heard of MPs stabbing each other in the back before but never of them stabbing each other in the arm,"" Mr Evans said. A whole year has passed since the Stereophonics went ahead and played two indoor shows in Cardiff despite growing fears about the spread of  coronavirus in the UK. Looking back on the anniversary, Jessica Elgot from The Guardian newspaper said the gigs going ahead was ""one of the most jaw-dropping moments"" of the pandemic. The Welsh band were criticised for playing two nights at the Motorpoint Arena on the same weekend that theWales v Scotland rugby match was postponedby the Welsh Rugby Union for reasons of public health safety. Theband's sound engineer Dave Roden later said ""it wasn't our call"" to cancel the gigs, saying such a decision was ""usually"" the responsibility of the authorities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a UK-wide lockdown a week later. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Member of the Senedd Neil McEvoy has taken advantage of the relaxation of Covid rules for haircuts with a visit to a barber in Cardiff. ""If hairdressers can operate safely, surely other so-called 'non-essential' retail can too,"" he says, adding: ""Let's get back to work."" Allow Twitter content?

Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said all secondary school pupils in Wales should return before 12 April. Those in qualification years are back in class this week, along with all primary school children. Pupils in years 7 to 9 are able to get ""check-in"" sessions with teachers before that date, but Mr Davies said: âItâs important that pupils start their education rather than have simple check-in sessions.â Meanwhile Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the evidence presented by the deputy chief medical officer and the success of the vaccine roll-out pointed toward a return to university teaching being safe. âOn that basis, we should support it,â he said. Wales' education minister says she will âcontinue to have conversationsâ with universities and student unions about the issue of violence against women and girls. Kirsty Williams said although student satisfaction was high at Welsh universities, âwe cannot rest on our laurelsâ. âOne incident is too much and you can be assured that we will continue to have conversations with our vice-chancellors and NUS here in Wales,â she said. Small numbers of Covid cases in schools in Wales over the last month have not been sufficient to prompt a re-think over returning to the classroom, Education Minister Kirsty Williams has said. She told the Welsh Government press briefing the small number of cases were ânot a surpriseâ and that health officials were advising schools on how to handle any cases. Pupils aged three to seven returned to school last month, with older pupils heading back to class this week. âThere is nothing in our experience of the last three weeks when the foundation phase pupils have been in that has made us think we canât proceed with the important steps weâre taking today,â she said. âBut clearly one of the reasons weâre having a phased return is that we can monitor the data really closely.â Protective measures put in place in schools to reduce the spread of coronavirus will be kept âunder reviewâ, Wales' education minister has said. Teaching staff and secondary school pupils are required to wear face coverings, but not primary school pupils. Speaking during Mondayâs press briefing, Kirsty Williams said she acknowledged that the wearing of face masks and other protective measures in schools such as contact groups âcurtail that normal educational experienceâ. However, she added: âAs soon as the advice says we can move away from some of them, then we will do so."" Education minister Kirsty Williams has said it isa ""damning indictment"" that women do not feel safe to exercise alone outdoors. But she did not confirm when gyms may open again in Wales. When asked about clarity on gyms reopening, in light of safety concerns raised after the killing of Sarah Everard, Ms Williams said women feeling unsafe exercising alone outdoors ""tells you how far we have got to go as a society"". Ms Williams said gyms would reopen ""as soon as we're able"". She added: ""They are important places for many people. ""The Welsh Government has recognised this, when we changed the rules to allow two people to exercise together."" Wales is âwell placedâ to address issues of violence against women and girls because of the introduction of the new curriculum according to Education Minister Kirsty Williams. Ms Williams told the coronavirus press briefing she wanted to âput on record deepest sympathies to the familyâ of Sarah Everard,who was kidnapped in Clapham in London and found dead a week later. âCan I say that we really are well placed in the education system in Wales to address these points,"" she added. ""Only last week we saw the passage in our national parliament, our ground breaking new curriculum, which will mean that every child in Wales will be entitled to relationship education. âI honestly believe that that exposure to high quality education that looks at respect, consent, our roles as individuals in a safe and secure relationship is really important and will create the societal change that we need for the longer term,â she said. Police have been criticised fortheir handling of a vigil in Ms Everard's memory in London on Saturday, making arrests for alleged breaches of Covid regulations against large gatherings. Sarah Everard was found dead after going missing while walking home in south London Police in Wales should be commended for the way they handled vigils paying respects to Sarah Everard last weekend, according to the education minister. Ms Everard was found dead in a wooded area in Kent, after going missing while walking home in south London on 3 March. A Metropolitan Police officer has been charged with her kidnap and murder. Kirsty Williams said the scenes witnessed at Clapham Common in London on Saturday, where police arrested a number of people at a vigil on grounds of breaching Covid regulations, would have âshockedâ those watching. However, she praised the way gatherings in Wales were held without incident. âI donât think anybody that watched those scenes [at Clapham Common] canât have been shocked by what they saw,â she said. âBut can I say how grateful I am to women and men in Wales who over this weekend also carried out vigils to mark the death of Sarah, and the wider issues that that death makes us confront as a society, and the police that oversaw those gatherings in a really respectful way. âWe have to remember weâre still in the middle of a pandemic and we need people to be cognisant of that, but I would commend both those that wanted to have their voices heard this weekend in Wales, and the police for the sensitive way that that was handled."" A total of 1,122,931 people in Wales have now received their first vaccination. This figure represents over 35% of the adult population. The Welsh Government claimed that with 264,255 people fully vaccinated, Wales leads the British nations in the vaccine roll-out. Allow Twitter content?

School trips make up the bulk of outdoor centres' income, say staff Businesses offering overnight education trips for childrenmay not survive unless they are allowed to reopen soon, industry workers say. Wales had 44 outdoor education centres before the pandemic, but at least five have now closed permanently. School trips make up the bulk of their income, with many heavily-reliant on pupils from England. The Welsh Government said it was doing ""everything we can to support businesses"". Currently guidance for English schools from the Department of Education (DfE) advises ""against all educational visits at this time"". Gareth Davies, operations manager at the Arete Outdoor Education Centre in Llanrug, Gwynedd, said he felt he was part of a ""forgotten sector"". ""We know that wellbeing and mental health is really important... and this is exactly where we can help,"" he said. ""But at the moment centres are closing and the next generation are going to miss out at a time when we could be of most help."" All university students in Wales will be able toaccess libraries, studios or labs after the Easter break, the Welsh Government has announced. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said students would be able to resume ""blended"" learning â mixing attending campus and working from home â from 12 April. She said the overall Covid message remained to âstay localâ, but the rules did allow travel for education. Lateral-flow Covid tests will be available twice a week for those students and staff who do attend campuses. Ms Williams told students: âI know your university experience this year has been very different from your expectations and youâve missed out on many of the social aspects of university life. âBut in doing so you have helped to keep the virus under control, reduced the risk of catching and spreading the virus, and this will certainly have saved lives.â Of the two Covid deaths in Wales reported on Monday, one is in the Swansea Bay area and one in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board in south Wales. Cwm Taf Morgannwg remains the board with the highest number of deaths, at 1,498. Case rates in Wales remain at 39 cases per 100,000 people overall. Merthyr Tydfil's case rate, which has been rising, is the highest in Wales at 144.2, followed by Anglesey at 92.8 and Conwy at 70. The number of people in Wales who have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine now stands at 1,122,931. Of those, 264,255 have received a second dose as well. Of those aged 65 and over, 90.5% or more have received a first dose, rising to 95% in the 75-79 age group. In the 50-54 age group, 30.3% have had a first dose along with 35.2% of the 55-59s. It rises to 56.9% in the 60-64 age category. Monday's Welsh Government briefing on the pandemic is being led by Education Minister Kirsty Williams, with Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Chris Jones. It begins at 12:15 GMT and can be viewed via the Coronavirus Update video link at the top of this page. You can also follow proceedings live on BBC One Wales, onBBC iPlayerorS4C. Supermarket aisles selling non-essential goods have been closed to the public Allowing supermarkets in Wales to start selling non-essential items again while other shops remain shut was not something ministers were comfortable with, the deputy economy minister says. Non-essential aisles in supermarkets will be able toreopen From 22 March, but all other shops must remain closed for another three weeks, until 12 April. Lee Waters said the move was seen as ""the least risky"" Covid rules relaxation, as supermarkets were already open. ""It was something we wrestled with, it was not something we were comfortable with, if I'm completely honest with you, but it's a pragmatic judgement,"" he told theBBC Politics Walesprogramme. Two more people in Wales have died with coronavirus, Public Health Wales has reported, taking the total deaths to 5,454. A further 248 cases have been logged, with the number in Wales since the pandemic began now standing at 206,653. Wales' health minister has thanked staff who havegiven him his first Covid vaccination. Vaughan Gething, who received the jab in Barry on Sunday, praised the ""very efficient and friendly team helping to keep Wales safe"". The minister, who is in his forties, has an underlying health condition which put him in a higher priority group for vaccination. He has urged other people in black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to accept the jab when offered it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has defended himself after a former appeal court judge criticised evidence he gave to MPs over a scandal in which thousands lost their life savings. Mr Bailey is the former boss of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). He has been criticised by Dame Elizabeth Gloster forhis role at the FCA in regulating London Capital & Finance, which collapsed in 2019. Mr Bailey said responsibility and culpability were not the same thing. Before becoming governor, Andrew Bailey was chief executive of the FCA, which was criticised in a report by Dame Elizabeth for failing to supervise and regulate LCF. Her report named Mr Bailey as responsible for that failure and said he had made legal representations to prevent responsibility for the FCA's failings being attributed to him by name. Before the Treasury committee of MPs last month, Mr Bailey said he was ""angry"" and ""disturbed"" by her criticisms, adding it was ""not correct"" to say he did not want his name mentioned in the context of personal responsibility and that his apology for the failure had been misrepresented. That prompted Dame Elizabeth to write to the committee releasing extracts of representations from Mr Bailey's legal team, revealing that they had asked for him not to be named on a number of different grounds. More than 11,000 savers lost money in investing Â£238m in LCF, which went bust in 2019. BBC Radio 4 Today programme host Martha Kearney asked Mr Bailey about LCF during a wide-ranging interview. He replied: ""I never said that I was not responsible for everything that went on at the FCA. That was my role as CEO. ""The particular issueâ¦ was that the first draft of the report introduced responsibility and culpability together in an inseparable way and they're not the same thing."" Separately,Mr Bailey has come under new criticismfollowing a report that he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in  a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefiting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin. Now it is reported that Mr Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal. The Bank of England said there was no interest to declare. During the same BBC Today interview, Mr Bailey said he was ""not out of firepower"" in defending the UK economy as it recovers from the pandemic. He said he was looking at ""new tools"" to deal with the UK's biggest economic shock in 300 years. These could include negative interest rates, but ""that's not a view on whether we will use them or not"". ""The economy will actually get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019,"" he said. However, that was ""not much more than getting back to where we were pre-Covid"". Mr Bailey said the Bank expected inflation to start rising towards its 2% target in ""the next two or three months"". But he added that the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee would need to see ""a lot more evidence"" that the inflationary trend was sustainable before acting, given the ""huge uncertainty"" over the economic effects of Covid. ""We are not out of tools, we are not out of firepower,"" Mr Bailey said. Although he did not commit one way or the other on the use of negative interest rates, he said it was ""appropriate to have that tool in the box"". The Bank governor's comments follow months of public speculation about the possibility of negative rates, with several former and current Bank policymakers weighing in with their views. What are negative interest rates? At the same time, other commentators have been warning that the economy could overheat as the end of lockdown unleashes pent-up consumer demand, with a surge in inflation as a result. Mr Bailey said he had seen ""no evidence"" to support fears that inflation could hit 4% or 5% as the recovery gathered pace. He said the UK's vaccination campaign had been ""a great achievement"" and he was now ""more positive"" about the recovery, but he wanted to add ""a large dose of caution"". Mr Bailey warned that new variants of the virus could still pose a risk to the recovery. He also said the economic effects of the pandemic had been ""very unequal"". ""Covid has affected the low-paid more. There are more women in that section of the labour force,"" he said. Ethnic minorities were also disproportionately affected, he added. But he said it was ""very helpful"" that the furlough scheme was now projected to extend beyond the lifting of Covid restrictions, which should ""help to smooth that transition"".

"Boris Johnson has promised to help make the UK ""match-fit"" when he unveils his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy. The prime minister said there would be ""more investment"" in infrastructure and skills around the country. He also announced that 500 Foreign Office jobs would be moving from London to East Kilbride. The government publishes its Integrated Review of the UK's defence and foreign relations capabilities on Tuesday. But a group of MPs has warned that ""general ineptitude"" over the last 20 years has undermined attempts to re-equip the Army. Ageing equipment puts Army at risk, MPs warn Cabinet Office to move 500 jobs to Glasgow Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' The Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat. Some details are being pre-released, including the plan to move 500 jobs to the Foreign Office's East Kilbride hub - which follows news that the Cabinet Office will transfer at least 500 civil servants to nearby Glasgow by 2024. The government has promised ""further commitments"" to ""strengthening the UK's core industrial base"" in the Integrated Review, including building ships in Scotland and armoured vehicles in Wales. There will also be a focus on lithium mining in Cornwall and manufacturing satellites in Northern Ireland, it added. The Integrated Review is billed as the most radical reassessment of Britain's place in the world since the end of the Cold War. But the prime minister wants the new strategy to make a difference at home as well as abroad. He is promising new investment in domestic industries such as defence, science and technology. And, crucially, he argues that this will provide jobs across the United Kingdom. Ministers argue it's only by combining the resources of the union that the UK is able to respond to global challenges and project its influence abroad. The test will be whether that argument is accepted by those calling for a fresh independence referendum in Scotland. Mr Johnson said: ""The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and - most importantly - our people. ""So I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people."" He added that the UK's ""international ambitions must start at home"", with investment in regional industry ""ensuring the UK is on the cutting-edge of innovation and creating an entire country that is match-fit for a more competitive world"". The government has said ""further jobs"" will be created outside London by the establishment of the National Cyber Force HQ in the North of England. It has also promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21, with the overall figure expected to rise to Â£41.5bn during this time. From 2010 to 2017, annual defence spendingfell by Â£6.6bn in real terms,but, since then, it has increased by Â£3bn in real terms. A report by the Commons Defence Committee, published on Sunday, warned that the Army was at ""serious risk"" of being outmatched by the UK's adversaries. It described efforts to modernise its fleet of armoured fighting vehicles as ""woeful"" and criticised what it called ""bureaucratic procrastination"" and ""general ineptitude"" over the past two decades. In a speech last month, Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the Integrated Review should ""refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are"". He added that unless it confirmed a reduction in potential dangers to the UK, it would be ""very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces"".

There will also be a focus on lithium mining in Cornwall and manufacturing satellites in Northern Ireland, it added. The Integrated Review is billed as the most radical reassessment of Britain's place in the world since the end of the Cold War. But the prime minister wants the new strategy to make a difference at home as well as abroad. He is promising new investment in domestic industries such as defence, science and technology. And, crucially, he argues that this will provide jobs across the United Kingdom. Ministers argue it's only by combining the resources of the union that the UK is able to respond to global challenges and project its influence abroad. The test will be whether that argument is accepted by those calling for a fresh independence referendum in Scotland. Mr Johnson said: ""The foundation of our foreign policy is who we are as a country: our values, our strengths and - most importantly - our people. ""So I am determined to ensure we have a foreign policy that delivers for those people."" He added that the UK's ""international ambitions must start at home"", with investment in regional industry ""ensuring the UK is on the cutting-edge of innovation and creating an entire country that is match-fit for a more competitive world"". The government has said ""further jobs"" will be created outside London by the establishment of the National Cyber Force HQ in the North of England. It has also promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21, with the overall figure expected to rise to Â£41.5bn during this time. From 2010 to 2017, annual defence spendingfell by Â£6.6bn in real terms,but, since then, it has increased by Â£3bn in real terms. A report by the Commons Defence Committee, published on Sunday, warned that the Army was at ""serious risk"" of being outmatched by the UK's adversaries. It described efforts to modernise its fleet of armoured fighting vehicles as ""woeful"" and criticised what it called ""bureaucratic procrastination"" and ""general ineptitude"" over the past two decades. In a speech last month, Labour's shadow defence secretary, John Healey, said the Integrated Review should ""refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are"".

Earlier, the mayor of Sandwich estimated that about one square mile of the town had been taped off. Officers from the Metropolitan Police have set up a tent and equipment inside the cordon The search site is near the centre of Sandwich Police officers are continuing to search along Delf stream and The Rope Walk with metre-long wooden sticks. Officers are also searching a trolley shelter at a Co-op supermarket. The cordoned-off area contains a secluded path near a stream and homes. At the edge of the cordon, a few officers gathered for discussion as one showed colleagues a piece of gold jewellery that was then put in an evidence bag. Divers have been searching a stretch of water in Sandwich, Kent Residents have been asked not to gather at the scene. Ms Everard was reported missing by her boyfriend on 4 March. She had visited a friend in the Clapham Junction area on 3 March and left at about 21:00 GMT to make what was roughly a 2.5-mile (4km) journey home.

"Hundreds of people have attended a vigil for Sarah Everard in Parliament Square, despite Home Secretary Priti Patel urging against gatherings A crowd also blocked Westminster Bridge, with some appearing to receive fines for breaching Covid rules Patel says she has commissioned a review into the policing of a vigil on London's Clapham Common on Saturday Officers handcuffed women and removed them from crowds on Saturday night - with four arrests made The home secretary says she is ""listening to women and girls"" following criticism of the police's behaviour Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says she is ""more determined"" to lead the force, following calls for her to resign The PM has chaired a meeting of the government's crime and justice taskforce to discuss ways to protect women Edited by Alice Evans and James Clarke We are bringing an end to our live coverage now, but here's a reminder of the day's events: Today's updates were brought to you by Jennifer Meierhans, Julian Joyce, Kate Whannel, James Clarke and Alice Evans. Thanks for joining us. The prime minister has announced measures to make the streets safer for women, after a meeting of the Criminal Justice Taskforce. Boris Johnson says he is doubling the Safer Streets fund to Â£45m. The money will be spent on local projects to improve lighting and CCTV in parks and alleyways, and routes from bars,
restaurants and nightclubs. Pilots of so-called Project Vigilant will be rolled out across the country - where uniformed and undercover officers will work to identify predatory and suspicious offenders around clubs and bars at night. Johnson says: âThe horrific case of Sarah
Everard has unleashed a wave of feeling about women not feeling safe at night. âWe must do
everything we can to ensure our streets are safe, and we are bringing in
landmark legislation to toughen sentences and put more police on the streets. âUltimately, we must drive
out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal
justice system work to better protect and defend them.â The government also pledged Â£11m for more independent sexual violence advisors to support victims through the criminal justice process. This video can not be played Sarah Everard case: Aerials show police search area We have been hearing aboutsearches taking place in Sandwich, Kent, today as part of the investigation into the death of Sarah Everard. The video above (which has no sound) shows an aerial view of where those searches have been happening. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Police took a hands-off approach at the main demonstration in Parliament Square earlier this evening. After that broke up, a few hundred protesters moved off and started randomly following a route through Westminster towards London's West End. At first they tried to sit down and occupy roads - including outside Scotland Yard - but every time they stopped, they were told by police they needed to move on because of Covid regulations. And so what began as a vigil in Parliament Square became a somewhat chaotic parade through Theatreland and the quiet, locked-down London streets. Eventually teams of police officers began trying to pick off stragglers, instructing them to go home in line with the lockdown rules - or face fines. Some left, some appeared to get tickets. Now, those who are still here - mainly young people - have gone back to Westminster Bridge, disrupting the traffic through Whitehall and Parliament Square. They want to make their voices heard againstthese proposed police powers to curtail demonstrations.But the way they are acting tonight is exactly the type of disruption that may in future be targeted. Three people have been fined for breaching Covid rules at a vigil in Liverpool in memory of Sarah Everard. Merseyside Police says up to 40 people held a ""peaceful"" socially-distanced minute's silence outside St Luke's Church on Saturday evening. But three people were fined for refusing to socially distance at a second event staged afterwards. Deputy Chief Constable Serena Kennedy says the force ""completely understands"" people want to hold an event in Ms Everard's memory ""whilst at the same time recognising the dangers faced by women"". However, she added: ""We must all do what we can to prevent the spread of [coronavirus] andthat includes not meeting in large groups."" Police were recorded removing women from the area Sussex Police has defended its response at a vigil held to remember Sarah Everard in Brighton. More than 150 people gathered in Valley Gardens on Saturday. One man was arrested, eight people were fined and many attendees criticised officers' handling of the unofficial event. Attendee Francesca Thornton, from Brighton, accused the police of an ""unjustified use of force"" after video footage showed officers removing a woman from the vigil and holding onto her arms. Assistant Chief Constable Lisa Bell says officers have ""an obligation to deal with things robustly when people disregard the law"". The force says it will review body-worn footage from the evening to see if thereare any lessons to learn. Police must respond with ""proportionate"" action under new protest laws, the home secretary has told MPs debating the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. Priti Patel says the government will ""always defend"" the right to protest peacefully. ""But there is a balance to be struck between the rights of the protester and the rights of individuals to go about their daily lives,"" she says. ""This bill will give police the powers to take a more proactive approach in tackling dangerous and disruptive protest,"" she says. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Commons he wanted to talk about the ""distressing scenes we saw at Clapham"" on Saturday, when police clashed with people attending a vigil for Sarah Everard. He says: ""I share the anger that there is about the policing of this - deep and profound lessons need to be learned and there must be change. ""People should have been able to mark this moment peacefully and safely. We need to find a way for people to show solidarity safely and in a Covid-secure way."" He says: ""The scenes from Saturday should be a red warning signal to this House that rushing through ill-judged, ill-thought out restrictions on the right to protest would be a profound mistake that would have long-lasting consequences and do great damage to our democracy."" Police have moved in on protesters in central London, who have been campaigning following the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of protesters have marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area, chanting and waving banners. A large police presence has followed the demonstrators, with police vans and motorbikes. A tweet from the Met Police a few minutes ago urged the crowds to leave ""immediately"", warning that ""enforcement activity"" would take place shortly. And in the past few minutes, protesters have been heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Talking to Naga Munchetty, she said: ""I want justice but I know Iâll never get that. ""The women who stood up and went to the vigil and protested, Iâm just so thankful to them, theyâve made people have the conversation."" Listen to the interviewhere,external. Davina McCall has responded to the widespread backlash TV presenter Davina McCall has sought to ""clarify"" comments about the Sarah Everard case that sparked a backlash. As we've been reporting, the disappearance of the 33-year-old as she walked home on 3 March prompted many women to discuss their public safety concerns on social media. In response, McCalltweeted on Friday,externalthat the ""fear-mongering"" and ""calling all men out"" around the ""rare"" case could damage male mental health. Yesterday evening she said there had been a ""misinterpretation"" of her views. ""Any man that's violent [or] coercive towards a woman is abhorrent,"" she wrote. Read the full story here. BBC Radio 5 Live A retired police officer has told BBC Radio 5 Live Saturday's vigil for Sarah Everard should have been facilitated and allowed to go ahead. Ch Supt Owen West was a public order protest specialist for West Yorkshire Police. ""It was was an opportunity, not a threat, for the police to engage, to reassure, and to learn from the young women there, in relation to their lived experience,"" he says. He says too often the police see protest crowds as potentially inherently dangerous and violent. The government should think about police resources, he says, and consider the ""values, principles and ethics"" they want them to uphold. ""It's not just a numbers game,"" he says. ""It's not so much the quantity, it's the quality, it's the type of responses, it's the type of skills that are invested in."" Listen to the interviewhere,externalorlisten to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. Jennifer ScottBBC News The killing of Sarah Everard has sparked fresh debate on how to protect women from violence After the killing of Sarah Everard, the issue of violence against women and girls is at the forefront of many minds in Westminster. Figures from across the political spectrum are putting forward proposals of how to tackle the ongoing blight on our society, but one suggestion in particular has re-emerged in light of the tragic events: To make misogyny - prejudice against women - a hate crime. A crime is considered a hate crime if it is proven that the victim was targeted because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. When a crime falls into one of the above categories, judges in England and Wales have enhanced sentencing powers and can increase the punishment as a result. Campaigners say sex and gender should be added to the list, arguing misogyny is one of the ""root causes"" of violence against women. They also believe the addition would help to provide ""critical data on the link between hostility to women and the abuse and harassment women experience"". Read the full story here. Emma GlasbeyJournalist, BBC Look North It is not just in central London that crowds have been gathering this evening - hundreds of people have attended a protest in Leeds against the way the Metropolitan Police handled the vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. The event in Millennium Square, at which organisers Reclaim the Night Leeds have asked attendees to wear masks and socially distance, is also to protest overthe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. In a statement, West Yorkshire Police says: ""We understand the genuine safety concerns women have, concerns which have been amplified following the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard. ""Women should always feel safe to walk the streets of West Yorkshire and we remain committed to making the county a safe place to live and work for everyone. ""It is entirely normal the public wish to express their solidarity and concern in these circumstances."" However, the statement adds that ""the threat from coronavirus remains and any large gathering is a real risk to individuals' health"". ""We would ask everyone to consider the current risk to their own health and think about attending public events at a later date, when it is both safe and legal to do so."" A Metropolitan police cordon in Sandwich, Kent A probationary Metropolitan Police officer involved in the Sarah Everard search operation in Kent has been removed from their duties for allegedly sharing an ""inappropriate graphic"" with colleagues. The force says a graphic was shared via social media on Friday and was reported by a number of officers ""who were concerned by its content"". In a statement, the Met says: ""The PC had been deployed as a cordon officer supporting the search operation in Kent in relation to the murder of Sarah Everard. ""The officer has been removed from these duties and placed in a non-public facing role while inquiries continue. ""The graphic does not contain photographic images, no images of Sarah, nor any other material obtained from or related to the investigation into Sarah's murder."" Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave says: ""The MPS expects its officers to behave professionally at all times and this includes how they use social media. I take allegations that any officer or officers have failed to observe these standards very seriously and have referred this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct."" The force says Sarah Everard's family have been made aware of the incident. A woman who was at the vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common on Saturday says she was shocked by the clashes with police. Georgina, 27, who lives locally, says: ""It was disappointing, shocking,
really, because it was something so solemn and so lovely. ""There were even
pockets of people kind of praying or taking a moment's silence - and then all of a
sudden it just seemed like mayhem broke out."" The turning point in police tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, at about 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear and soon afterwards, officers tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people they believed were contributing to the crowding. Georgina says she accepts police officers are ""just doing their job"" but that the problem therefore needs solving ""from the top"" ""It
needs to be systematic change,"" she says. Georgina adds that on the evening of the vigil, she was ""shocked"" to see a man indecently exposing himself in the Clapham area. She has since given a police statement about the incident but says the officers she flagged it to at the time ""did nothing on the night to investigate"". You can read more about her experiences here. A large number of protesters have blocked off traffic on Westminster Bridge to demonstrate after the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of Reclaim These Streets campaigners chanted and held banners while police officers halted oncoming cars. They then moved outside nearby Scotland Yard where they chanted ""shame on you"" and ""our streets"". Protesters sat down on the road and shouted ""we will not be silenced"" as police officers watched on. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The Parliament Square demo has broken up - with some heading to Westminster Bridge and others leaving the scene. Before she went, university student Rebecca told me she wanted the government to let her arm herself - not to start a revolution, but to revolutionise her own feeling of safety. ""I think it's hugely important that what comes out of this entire incident is not just some kind of keyboard-warrior rage. ""A great place to start? Allow women to carry a firearm, namely pepper spray. On nights out we carry hairspray and a rape alarm because we don't feel safe.""   Sarah Everard's disappearance and death in south London has led to a national conversation about violence by men against women, with many women speaking out about their fears and personal experiences. Below are some charts and graphs to visualise violent crimes against women. See more here. Sarah Everard's death has sparked a moment for society to ""reflect"" on how to reduce male violence, abuse and harassment, the chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council says. Speaking after police chiefs from across the country met to discuss male violence against women, Martin Hewitt says his organisation wants to help contribute to a ""legacy of meaningful change"" following Ms Everard's ""truly tragic"" death. He says one of the key issues for policing is that too few victims see their cases go to court - and for those that do, the experience is ""long and difficult"". ""This has a serious impact on their confidence in the police and in the criminal justice system and means too many perpetrators get away with their crimes,"" he says. Hewitt says his council is waiting to hear the outcome of the government's review into why the number of rape prosecutions is falling. The NPCC is also carefully considering ""the role police could play in responding to street harassment"", he says, adding that calls for misogyny to be treated as a hate crime should be assessed. The Law Commission is due to make final recommendations on this issue in the autumn. Sarah Everard's death has sparked many women to share their experiences of sexual harrassment and violence A little earlier Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people not to attend protests during the coronavirus pandemic - following the clashes between police and women at a vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. ""The right to protest is the cornerstone of our democracy but the government's duty is to prevent more lives being lost during this pandemic,""she told MPs. Hundreds of people have gathered in central London anyway - following similar protests elsewhere in the country. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson has promised to help make the UK ""match-fit"" when he unveils his plan for modernising the armed forces and foreign policy. The prime minister said there would be ""more investment"" in infrastructure and skills around the country. He also announced that 500 Foreign Office jobs would be moving from London to East Kilbride. The government publishes its Integrated Review of the UK's defence and foreign relations capabilities on Tuesday. But a group of MPs has warned that ""general ineptitude"" over the last 20 years has undermined attempts to re-equip the Army. Ageing equipment puts Army at risk, MPs warn Cabinet Office to move 500 jobs to Glasgow Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' The Integrated Review, first announced in 2019, will set out the UK's defence and foreign affairs priorities for the next decade or so, during which cyber warfare in particular is expected to become a greater threat.

Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told the Commons he wanted to talk about the ""distressing scenes we saw at Clapham"" on Saturday, when police clashed with people attending a vigil for Sarah Everard. He says: ""I share the anger that there is about the policing of this - deep and profound lessons need to be learned and there must be change. ""People should have been able to mark this moment peacefully and safely. We need to find a way for people to show solidarity safely and in a Covid-secure way."" He says: ""The scenes from Saturday should be a red warning signal to this House that rushing through ill-judged, ill-thought out restrictions on the right to protest would be a profound mistake that would have long-lasting consequences and do great damage to our democracy."" Police have moved in on protesters in central London, who have been campaigning following the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of protesters have marched from Parliament Square and through the Soho area, chanting and waving banners. A large police presence has followed the demonstrators, with police vans and motorbikes. A tweet from the Met Police a few minutes ago urged the crowds to leave ""immediately"", warning that ""enforcement activity"" would take place shortly. And in the past few minutes, protesters have been heard urging others to run and ""keep moving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Davina McCall has responded to the widespread backlash TV presenter Davina McCall has sought to ""clarify"" comments about the Sarah Everard case that sparked a backlash. As we've been reporting, the disappearance of the 33-year-old as she walked home on 3 March prompted many women to discuss their public safety concerns on social media. In response, McCalltweeted on Friday,externalthat the ""fear-mongering"" and ""calling all men out"" around the ""rare"" case could damage male mental health.

BBC Radio 5 Live A retired police officer has told BBC Radio 5 Live Saturday's vigil for Sarah Everard should have been facilitated and allowed to go ahead. Ch Supt Owen West was a public order protest specialist for West Yorkshire Police. ""It was was an opportunity, not a threat, for the police to engage, to reassure, and to learn from the young women there, in relation to their lived experience,"" he says. He says too often the police see protest crowds as potentially inherently dangerous and violent. The government should think about police resources, he says, and consider the ""values, principles and ethics"" they want them to uphold. ""It's not just a numbers game,"" he says. ""It's not so much the quantity, it's the quality, it's the type of responses, it's the type of skills that are invested in."" Listen to the interviewhere,externalorlisten to 5 Live on the free BBC Sounds app. Jennifer ScottBBC News The killing of Sarah Everard has sparked fresh debate on how to protect women from violence After the killing of Sarah Everard, the issue of violence against women and girls is at the forefront of many minds in Westminster. Figures from across the political spectrum are putting forward proposals of how to tackle the ongoing blight on our society, but one suggestion in particular has re-emerged in light of the tragic events: To make misogyny - prejudice against women - a hate crime. A crime is considered a hate crime if it is proven that the victim was targeted because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or transgender identity. When a crime falls into one of the above categories, judges in England and Wales have enhanced sentencing powers and can increase the punishment as a result. Campaigners say sex and gender should be added to the list, arguing misogyny is one of the ""root causes"" of violence against women. They also believe the addition would help to provide ""critical data on the link between hostility to women and the abuse and harassment women experience"". Read the full story here. Emma GlasbeyJournalist, BBC Look North It is not just in central London that crowds have been gathering this evening - hundreds of people have attended a protest in Leeds against the way the Metropolitan Police handled the vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. The event in Millennium Square, at which organisers Reclaim the Night Leeds have asked attendees to wear masks and socially distance, is also to protest overthe Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill. In a statement, West Yorkshire Police says: ""We understand the genuine safety concerns women have, concerns which have been amplified following the recent tragic death of Sarah Everard. ""Women should always feel safe to walk the streets of West Yorkshire and we remain committed to making the county a safe place to live and work for everyone. ""It is entirely normal the public wish to express their solidarity and concern in these circumstances."" However, the statement adds that ""the threat from coronavirus remains and any large gathering is a real risk to individuals' health"". ""We would ask everyone to consider the current risk to their own health and think about attending public events at a later date, when it is both safe and legal to do so."" A Metropolitan police cordon in Sandwich, Kent A probationary Metropolitan Police officer involved in the Sarah Everard search operation in Kent has been removed from their duties for allegedly sharing an ""inappropriate graphic"" with colleagues. The force says a graphic was shared via social media on Friday and was reported by a number of officers ""who were concerned by its content"". In a statement, the Met says: ""The PC had been deployed as a cordon officer supporting the search operation in Kent in relation to the murder of Sarah Everard. ""The officer has been removed from these duties and placed in a non-public facing role while inquiries continue. ""The graphic does not contain photographic images, no images of Sarah, nor any other material obtained from or related to the investigation into Sarah's murder."" Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave says: ""The MPS expects its officers to behave professionally at all times and this includes how they use social media. I take allegations that any officer or officers have failed to observe these standards very seriously and have referred this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct."" The force says Sarah Everard's family have been made aware of the incident. A woman who was at the vigil for Sarah Everard in Clapham Common on Saturday says she was shocked by the clashes with police. Georgina, 27, who lives locally, says: ""It was disappointing, shocking,
really, because it was something so solemn and so lovely. ""There were even
pockets of people kind of praying or taking a moment's silence - and then all of a
sudden it just seemed like mayhem broke out."" The turning point in police tactics appears to have been the start of speeches from the bandstand, at about 18:00 GMT. People pressed forwards to hear and soon afterwards, officers tried to break up that part of the gathering and remove people they believed were contributing to the crowding. Georgina says she accepts police officers are ""just doing their job"" but that the problem therefore needs solving ""from the top"" ""It
needs to be systematic change,"" she says. Georgina adds that on the evening of the vigil, she was ""shocked"" to see a man indecently exposing himself in the Clapham area. She has since given a police statement about the incident but says the officers she flagged it to at the time ""did nothing on the night to investigate"". You can read more about her experiences here. A large number of protesters have blocked off traffic on Westminster Bridge to demonstrate after the death of Sarah Everard. Hundreds of Reclaim These Streets campaigners chanted and held banners while police officers halted oncoming cars. They then moved outside nearby Scotland Yard where they chanted ""shame on you"" and ""our streets"". Protesters sat down on the road and shouted ""we will not be silenced"" as police officers watched on. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The Parliament Square demo has broken up - with some heading to Westminster Bridge and others leaving the scene. Before she went, university student Rebecca told me she wanted the government to let her arm herself - not to start a revolution, but to revolutionise her own feeling of safety. ""I think it's hugely important that what comes out of this entire incident is not just some kind of keyboard-warrior rage. ""A great place to start? Allow women to carry a firearm, namely pepper spray. On nights out we carry hairspray and a rape alarm because we don't feel safe.""   Sarah Everard's disappearance and death in south London has led to a national conversation about violence by men against women, with many women speaking out about their fears and personal experiences. Below are some charts and graphs to visualise violent crimes against women. See more here. Sarah Everard's death has sparked a moment for society to ""reflect"" on how to reduce male violence, abuse and harassment, the chair of the National Police Chiefsâ Council says. Speaking after police chiefs from across the country met to discuss male violence against women, Martin Hewitt says his organisation wants to help contribute to a ""legacy of meaningful change"" following Ms Everard's ""truly tragic"" death. He says one of the key issues for policing is that too few victims see their cases go to court - and for those that do, the experience is ""long and difficult"". ""This has a serious impact on their confidence in the police and in the criminal justice system and means too many perpetrators get away with their crimes,"" he says. Hewitt says his council is waiting to hear the outcome of the government's review into why the number of rape prosecutions is falling. The NPCC is also carefully considering ""the role police could play in responding to street harassment"", he says, adding that calls for misogyny to be treated as a hate crime should be assessed. The Law Commission is due to make final recommendations on this issue in the autumn. Sarah Everard's death has sparked many women to share their experiences of sexual harrassment and violence A little earlier Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people not to attend protests during the coronavirus pandemic - following the clashes between police and women at a vigil for Sarah Everard at the weekend. ""The right to protest is the cornerstone of our democracy but the government's duty is to prevent more lives being lost during this pandemic,""she told MPs. Hundreds of people have gathered in central London anyway - following similar protests elsewhere in the country. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has defended himself after a former appeal court judge criticised evidence he gave to MPs over a scandal in which thousands lost their life savings. Mr Bailey is the former boss of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). He has been criticised by Dame Elizabeth Gloster forhis role at the FCA in regulating London Capital & Finance, which collapsed in 2019. Mr Bailey said responsibility and culpability were not the same thing. Before becoming governor, Andrew Bailey was chief executive of the FCA, which was criticised in a report by Dame Elizabeth for failing to supervise and regulate LCF. Her report named Mr Bailey as responsible for that failure and said he had made legal representations to prevent responsibility for the FCA's failings being attributed to him by name. Before the Treasury committee of MPs last month, Mr Bailey said he was ""angry"" and ""disturbed"" by her criticisms, adding it was ""not correct"" to say he did not want his name mentioned in the context of personal responsibility and that his apology for the failure had been misrepresented. That prompted Dame Elizabeth to write to the committee releasing extracts of representations from Mr Bailey's legal team, revealing that they had asked for him not to be named on a number of different grounds. More than 11,000 savers lost money in investing Â£238m in LCF, which went bust in 2019. BBC Radio 4 Today programme host Martha Kearney asked Mr Bailey about LCF during a wide-ranging interview. He replied: ""I never said that I was not responsible for everything that went on at the FCA. That was my role as CEO. ""The particular issueâ¦ was that the first draft of the report introduced responsibility and culpability together in an inseparable way and they're not the same thing."" Separately,Mr Bailey has come under new criticismfollowing a report that he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in  a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefiting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin. Now it is reported that Mr Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal. The Bank of England said there was no interest to declare. During the same BBC Today interview, Mr Bailey said he was ""not out of firepower"" in defending the UK economy as it recovers from the pandemic. He said he was looking at ""new tools"" to deal with the UK's biggest economic shock in 300 years. These could include negative interest rates, but ""that's not a view on whether we will use them or not"". ""The economy will actually get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019,"" he said. However, that was ""not much more than getting back to where we were pre-Covid"". Mr Bailey said the Bank expected inflation to start rising towards its 2% target in ""the next two or three months"". But he added that the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee would need to see ""a lot more evidence"" that the inflationary trend was sustainable before acting, given the ""huge uncertainty"" over the economic effects of Covid. ""We are not out of tools, we are not out of firepower,"" Mr Bailey said. Although he did not commit one way or the other on the use of negative interest rates, he said it was ""appropriate to have that tool in the box"". The Bank governor's comments follow months of public speculation about the possibility of negative rates, with several former and current Bank policymakers weighing in with their views. What are negative interest rates? At the same time, other commentators have been warning that the economy could overheat as the end of lockdown unleashes pent-up consumer demand, with a surge in inflation as a result. Mr Bailey said he had seen ""no evidence"" to support fears that inflation could hit 4% or 5% as the recovery gathered pace. He said the UK's vaccination campaign had been ""a great achievement"" and he was now ""more positive"" about the recovery, but he wanted to add ""a large dose of caution"". Mr Bailey warned that new variants of the virus could still pose a risk to the recovery. He also said the economic effects of the pandemic had been ""very unequal"". ""Covid has affected the low-paid more. There are more women in that section of the labour force,"" he said. Ethnic minorities were also disproportionately affected, he added. But he said it was ""very helpful"" that the furlough scheme was now projected to extend beyond the lifting of Covid restrictions, which should ""help to smooth that transition"".

"The governor of the Bank of England has come under new criticism for failing to declare a potential conflict of interest in a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefitting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin. Now, it is reported that Andrew Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal. That is despite being asked about it when he was appointed to his previous job as head of the city watchdog. The Bank of England said there was no interest to declare. RBS, now called Natwest, was accused of putting its own interests ahead of its clients when it moved 16,000 small business customers to its Global Restructuring Group (GRG). More than 90% of those customers suffered some form of mistreatment and many were financially ruined between 2009 and 2013. Internal emails later emerged highlightingabusive attitudesto small business customers, including one in which a banker wrote: ""Rope: sometimes you need to let customers hang themselves."" A government body, the Asset Protection Agency, was accused of driving the scandal after it pressured the bank to withdraw loans from business customers and obtain their assets. Some of those customers lost not only their livelihoods but also their marriages, which took a heavy toll on their physical and mental health. RBS escapes action over controversial unit Treasury had role in controversial RBS unit Mr Bailey was asked about the GRG scandal in 2016 when he appeared before a Treasury Select committee to vet him for conflicts of interest before he was made chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. Now, The Times reports in that, and in other more recent hearings, Mr Bailey failed to mention his role helping the Treasury design the body that oversaw the troubled division of RBS. According to court testimony given by the former boss of the scandal-hit division, the Asset Protection Agency pressured the bank to withdraw loans from business customers and obtain their assets. The agency, a division of the Treasury, had close oversight of GRG,signing off key decisionsand pressuring staff to withdraw loans from customers rather than maintain support. The former boss of the RBS division, Derek Sach, has previously testified that the Asset Protection Agency had no interest in customers and would have preferred the bank to ""flog"" businesses rather than support them. And in October 2016, BBC Newsnight and Buzzfeed revealed a cache of internal documents showing GRG was seeking to benefit financially by withdrawing support from business customers. Kevin Hollinrake, co-chairman of the all party parliamentary group on fair business banking, told The Times Bailey ""must explain"" why there was no disclosure of the potential conflict of interest. ""On Andrew Bailey's watch, the FCA repeatedly avoided the opportunities to publish key evidence about the GRG scandal and failed to hold anyone to account,"" he said. ""That Bailey failed to declare his interest and involvement in the agency when it featured in the FCA report as a potential cause of the scandal or to [MPs] when questioned about it is extremely disturbing."" In 2013, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was ordered to investigate the scandal and it commissioned two firms of consultants, Promontory and Mazars, who reported back three years later ,although their findings were not disclosed. The contents of the report only became public when the BBC obtained a copy of the document, which showed that over 90% of GRG customers had suffered mistreatment. Mr Bailey still refused to publish the report and instead launched a hunt for the leaker. In 2018, after taking the second phase of the investigation in-house, the FCA decided not to take any enforcement action. The Bank of England said Mr Bailey was not a decision maker in respect of that decision. Mr Bailey's role in designing the agency that oversaw GRG will add to pressure on the governor after he was named in a report by an Appeal Court judge whocriticised the FCA's handlingof the Â£238m London Capital and Finance scandal, where thousands of retail investors lost large sums.

"Left-right: Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan and Riz Ahmed are all nominated Sacha Baron Cohen, Carey Mulligan, Olivia Colman, Daniel Kaluuya and Sir Anthony Hopkins are among the British stars nominated for this year's Oscars. Vanessa Kirby, Gary Oldman and Riz Ahmed are among the other UK nominees. It's also the most diverse Oscars ever, with nine of the 20 acting nominees from ethnic minority backgrounds. And two women were nominated for best director - the first time more than one woman has been shortlisted for that prize in the awards' 93-year history. This video can not be played Film critic Clarisse Loughrey shares her thoughts on this yearâs Oscar nominations Chloe Zhao is nominated for directing Nomadland, and Britain's Emerald Fennell is recognised for Promising Young Woman. Other nominated stars include Frances McDormand, Glenn Close, Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman. Mank, the black-and-white drama starring Oldman as Citizen Kane writer Herman Mankiewicz, leads the overall field with 10 nominations. This year's winners will be announced on 25 April at a delayed ceremony that will take place at both the Dolby Theatre, the ceremony's normal home, and Los Angeles' main railway hub, Union Station. Olivia Colman and Sir Anthony Hopkins are both nominated for The Father 10 nominations - Mank 6 - The Father 6 - Judas and the Black Messiah 6 - Minari 6 - Nomadland 6 - Sound of Metal 6 - The Trial of the Chicago 7 The Oscar nominations in full Daniel Kaluuya is nominated for playing Black Panthers leader Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah The eight British acting nominees range from Ahmed, who receives his first Oscar nomination for playing a drummer who loses his hearing in Sound of Metal, to Sir Anthony, whose performance as a man who loses his grip on reality in The Father earns him his sixth nomination. At 83, he is the oldest person ever to be nominated for best actor. Sir Anthony and Ahmed are joined on the award's five-strong shortlist by Oldman, who won the trophy three years ago for playing Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Colman will hope to repeat her 2019 success with The Favourite after being nominated this year for her role in The Father. Carey Mulligan is nominated for Promising Young Woman despite being shut out by this year's Baftas. The revenge thriller also earns Fennell - best known for her acting in Call the Midwife and The Crown - nominations for best picture and best original screenplay as well as best director. Kirby, who also made her name on The Crown, is nominated for playing a traumatised mother in Pieces of a Woman, while Kaluuya and Baron Cohen are up for best supporting actor for Judas and the Black Messiah and The Trial of the Chicago 7 respectively. Other British nominees include singer Celeste for best song, for her contribution to The Trial of the Chicago 7; and Aardman's A Shaun The Sheep Movie: Farmageddon, which is up for best animated film.

Fennell is the first British woman to be up for best director. Some predicted a third female best director nominee this year, with Regina King tipped for One Night in Miami. She won an Oscar for her acting for If Beale Street Could Talk in 2019, but will not get a directing award to go with it this year. Overall, a record 76 nominations went to women this year, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the awards. The 73-year-old has her eighth Oscar nomination for playing a foul-mouthed, prosthetic-nosed grandmother in Ron Howard's Hillbilly Elegy. ""I dedicate this honour to all the grandmothers in the world who fight to give their children a better life,"" she said. Her previous nominations have come for films like The World According to Garp, Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons. She has never won. So could this finally be her year? Probably not - the favourites for best supporting actress are Yuh-Jung Youn and Maria Bakalova, the Bulgarian newcomer who is rewarded for playing Borat's daughter in Baron-Cohen's comedy sequel. Plus, Hillbilly Elegy was panned by many critics, and Close now has the dubious honour of being only the third person to be up for an Oscar and a Razzie (for the worst films of the year) for the same performance. Downey and Hathaway get 'worst acting' nominations Mank, about the making of Citizen Kane, may have the most Oscar nominations with 10, but it is highly unlikely to win best picture. Crucially, it failed to land a screenwriting nomination. In the past 55 years, the only films to have been named best picture without one are The Sound of Music and Titanic - a musical and a film that relied on spectacle rather than script. It has also missed out in best editing, a category in which, since 1981, every best picture winner has been nominated - apart from Birdman, which gave the appearance of not having been edited. Mank's omission in these categories suggests it is a film the Academy admires, rather than loves. It would appear to be destined for the same fate as the film it is about, which nominated for best picture at the 1941 Oscars, but lost out to How Green Was My Valley. I have the favourite as Nomadland, which has already been a winner at the Golden Globes and the Critics' Choice Awards. However, it has one thing going against it - the Academy almost never rewards female-fronted films. Last year, 68% of Oscar voters were men and of the last 15 best picture winners, only one (The Shape of Water) even managed a best actress nomination.

"Blockbuster movie Avatar has retaken the highest-grossing film of all time spot thanks to its re-release in China. The sci-fi epic debuted in 2009 and held the global box office title for a decade until it was overtaken by Marvel's Avengers: Endgame in 2019. Following its re-release in the world's biggest movie-watching market of China worldwide total sales pushed it above the $2.8bn (Â£2bn) mark on the weekend. China has been the top-performing film market since pandemic lockdowns. Avengers overtakes Avatar at all-time box office Odeon cinema owner warns it's running out of cash How Asian film could take over from Hollywood Disney's new heroine representing 600 million people Director James Cameron's Avatar took in around $4m on Friday alone which pushed it ahead of  Endgame, according to distributor Walt Disney. Disney owns both films after the company bought entertainment assets from Fox in 2019. It also owns the Titanic movie, which is third on the list of highest-grossing movies. When Endgame passed Avatar in 2019, Mr Cameron tweeted a picture of Avenger's Iron Man on the fictional Avatar universe of Pandora along with a congratulatory note.

"This video can not be played Organisers said they cancelled a vigil originally planned at Clapham Common because police did not ""constructively engage"" with logistics Boris Johnson has said he is ""deeply concerned"" by footage showing police officers detaining women at Saturday's vigil to remember Sarah Everard. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the crime and justice taskforce later to discuss ways to protect women. Officers handcuffed women and removed them from the gathering on Clapham Common in London on Saturday. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has dismissed calls to resign and defended the force's actions. She said she was ""more determined"" to lead the Met, and hit out at ""armchair"" critics. Dame Cressida will join Mr Johnson at the taskforce meeting, which will discuss what further action is needed to make streets safer for women. Government sources said both Home Secretary Priti Patel and the prime minister had confidence in Dame Cressida. What went wrong at the Sarah Everard vigil? Policing bill 'ignores violence against women' What are the plans to change the law on protests? Ms Patel has instructed the police watchdog, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), to ""conduct a lessons learned review in to the policing of the event"", the prime minister has said. Mr Johnson said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the scenes on Clapham Common on Saturday night and that Dame Cressida had ""committed to reviewing how this was handled"". ""The death of Sarah Everard must unite us in determination to drive out violence against women and girls and make every part of the criminal justice system work to protect and defend them,"" he added. Sarah Everard had been walking to her home in Brixton when she disappeared Dame Cressida said she agreed on the need for a ""sober review"" and defended how officers responded to the ""really big crowd"". ""They have to make these really difficult calls and I don't think anybody should be sitting back in an armchair and saying 'well that was done badly' or 'I would have done it differently' without actually understanding what was going through their minds,"" she said. She added that what happened to Ms Everard made her ""more determined"" to lead the organisation. Four people were arrested for public order and coronavirus regulation breaches, the Met said. This video can not be played Dania Al-Obeid, who was arrested at the vigil: ""All I wanted was to stand with other women"" Hundreds gathered at the bandstand in Clapham Common, south London, on Saturday evening for a vigil for Ms Everard, who went missing while walking home from a friend's house on 3 March. Her remains were later found in woodland in Kent and Met Police officer Wayne Couzens, 48, has been charged with the 33-year-old's kidnap and murder. Town centre searches in Everard murder case How many attacks on women are there? How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Louise McLoughlin was one of those at the bandstand on Saturday. She told BBC Breakfast it was ""a really lovely scene"" when she arrived at around 18:00 GMT, but ""it started to get a bit more riled"" around half an hour later. ""The decision was obviously made for [the police] to move in and take over the area,"" she said. ""At that point, it became a bit of a push and pull and there were a few scuffles and all of the candles and glass and the signs and the flowers that would have been put down for Sarah, you could just hear the breaking of glass now and again as these things were trampled on."" One of the women arrested, Dania Al'Obeid, said she knew the vigil had been cancelled but she ""needed to go and pay my respects"". She told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think that is where the frustration was, the bigger picture here was lost - we felt like we were silenced."" Another of those arrested, Patsy Stevenson, whose photograph featured on many newspaper front pages, told Sky News: ""I've been thrown into the public eye and the only way I can make this not in vain is to not make it political, not against the police, it's just about the safety of women and we need to talk about it."" Images of Patsy Stevenson being detained by police at the vigil were shared widely Maintaining public order at protests is one of the hardest jobs in modern policing. If everything goes well, the public won't notice how commanders and demo organisers have worked out how to make an event safe. But when it goes wrong, then the inevitable accusations of failure come piling in. Sunday dawned badly for the Metropolitan Police's commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick. Her officers were accused of oppressing women and politicians waded in calling for her head. But the seeds for Saturday's PR disaster for the force were sown in the legal dispute over whether a vigil could take place at all - and how events then seemed to run out of control. The question is whether the police should have foreseen that happening. That, time and again, is the great challenge of public order policing. Read more from Dominic. Asked whether police could have used their discretion as they did when taking the knee with Black Lives Matter protesters or dancing with Extinction Rebellion, Martin Hewitt - chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council - told Today that the investigation into the Met's actions ""will look at all elements"" of the event. Sir Peter Fahy, former chief constable for Greater Manchester Police, said HMIC had previously criticised the police for not intervening enough in Black Lives Matter protests and that many officers felt they were ""damned if they do and damned if they don't"". He added that current techniques for removing people from events safely ""means that they normally have about five officers - one on each limb and one holding the head"". ""The trouble is, when you photograph that, it then looks very heavy-handed,"" he said. The force's action at the vigil have drawn widespread criticism, with images and footage showing officers forcibly detaining women. London Mayor Sadiq Khan described the police's actions as ""unacceptable"", adding he was ""not satisfied"" with the explanation provided by Dame Cressida and the deputy commissioner when he spoke to them. He said he wanted HMIC to investigate the events and for the Independent Office for Police Conduct to investigate the actions of police officers. But Dame Vera Baird - the victims' commissioner for England and Wales - said the focus must now return to women's experience of sexual harassment and violence rather than the police's handling of Saturday's vigil. Dame Vera told the BBC: ""Let's return to the issue, which is why is it that this number of women, when this awful event [Sarah Everard;s death] has occurred, have started to talk about their appalling experiences. ""They regard, quite clearly, the streets as lawless for women when it comes to male behaviour. Men it seems, they tell us, they can do what they want and say what they want, and nobody will take action."" Ahead of the event, organisers Reclaim These Streets had called off the vigil, saying the police had failed to ""constructively engage"" on how it could be held in a Covid-secure way. The NPCC's Mr Hewitttweeted that he would ""bring all police chiefs together"",externalon Monday to discuss ""what more we can do to better protect women"". In a letter to Dame Cressida, posted on Twitter on Sunday,,externalReclaim These Streets accused the Met chief of putting those who attended ""at a serious health risk through a lack of Covid-safe marshalling"" and ""at risk of being manhandled, fined and arrested"" by officers. The group said it believed the Met had misrepresented a High Court ruling on Friday, whena judge refused to say the event would be permittedunder coronavirus regulations. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmersaid the scenes were ""deeply disturbing"",external, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey hascalled for Dame Cressida to resign,external. Protesters lie down in Parliament Square on Sunday Thousands congregated in central London on Sunday to protest about violence against women. Sisters Uncut,externalheld an event outside the Metropolitan Police's headquarters atNew Scotland Yard,external, which it said was to remember Ms Everard and demonstrate against broader ""police brutality"". Demonstrators chanted ""shame on you"" at police and officers erected barriers around the building near the Houses of Parliament in central London.

"Alan Rusbridger was the editor of The Guardian from 1995 to 2015 The former editor of The Guardian newspaper has resigned from a commission set up to examine the future of the media in Ireland. Alan Rusbridger had faced calls to be removed after it emerged that his former media editor, Roy Greenslade, was supportive of the IRA. MÃ¡irÃ­a Cahill, who toldthe BBC in 2014 she was raped by an IRA member, had called for the taoiseach (Irish PM) to consider his position on the panel. The government decided he should stay. That decision was backed unanimously by fellow members of the Future of Media Commission earlier this week. However, on Sunday, Mr Rusbridger said that he stepped down to avoid his involvement being a ""distraction"" to the ""critical"" work of the commission. The Guardian apologises over Roy Greenslade column Journalist's widow challenges Greenslade on threats The Guardian apologises over Roy Greenslade column He said he had been pleased to be invited and the ""unanimous support"" of his colleagues had been important to him. On Sunday, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin and Media Minister Catherine Martin acknowledged the decision and thanked him for his ""significant contribution to date"". The Guardianapologised to MÃ¡irÃ­a Cahill over an article written about her by Mr Greenslade.earlier this month. MÃ¡irÃ­a Cahill described Mr Greenslade's article about her in The Guardian as ""vile"" Aftera BBC Spotlight programme on her allegationsin 2014, Mr Greenslade wrote a column in The Guardian which said that Spotlight ""were too willing to accept Cahill's story and did not point to countervailing evidence"". Mr Greenslade wrote: ""This lack of balance resulted in the Cahill story being accepted at face value across Ireland, where [Gerry] Adams and his party were forced on to the back foot as they tried to defend and explain the IRA's actions."" Ms Cahill receivedan apology from the PSNI in 2018 after a report found she had been failed by themover her claim. Roy Greenslade is a former editor of the Daily Mirror and was a media commentator for The Guardian Mr Greenslade, a former editor of the Daily Mirror, wrote inthe British Journalism Review,externalat the end of February that he backed the IRA's armed campaign while he was working as a journalist during the Troubles. He also said he had made contributions to the republican newspaper An Phoblacht during the Troubles under the pseudonym George King. Ms Cahill then complained to The Guardian that its 2014 article by Mr Greenslade was a ""propaganda piece against a rape victim"". The Guardian confirmed on Friday evening that its current editor-in-chief, who was not in the role at the time the article was published, had sent a private apology on its behalf to Ms Cahill. Katharine Viner, who took up her post in 2015, acknowledged that the column ""was not handled appropriately"". The Guardian has beguna review into articles about NI written by the ex-Daily Mirror editor and The Guardian commentator, after the complaint by Ms Cahill. A note has been added to the 2014 piece which reads: ""The lack of disclosure was especially unfair to a vulnerable individual, and The Guardian has now apologised to Ms Cahill."" Writing in The Guardian, Mr Rusbridger also apologised to Ms Cahill. He wrote: ""Given what he has now shared, I believe he should have avoided those topics - or, at the very least, have been consistent in letting readers know more about where he was coming from - especially as The Guardian's own guidelines have long been explicit about declaring interests. ""In particular, Greenslade had criticised transparency in a 2014 piece about a BBC programme on Mairia Cahill's claim of rape by an alleged IRA member. Given his own lack of transparency, that was, at best, hypocritical. ""The piece spectacularly fails on transparency grounds. Had Greenslade been open with me back in 2014, I would have been able to come to a different judgement about it overall. ""So I am sincerely sorry to MÃ¡irÃ­a Cahill, both for the article and for the upset it must have caused her.""
