"Russia has begun implementing plans to call up reservists to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks there President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 more Russians with military experience sparked protests on Wednesday More than 1,000 anti-mobilisation protesters are reported to have been arrested Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has not denied media reports that some protesters were given draft papers Meanwhile the BBC has spoken to young men fleeing over the border into Georgia - one of the few remaining countries Russians can get to without a visa And Ukraine is celebrating a prisoner exchange which saw more than 200 prisoners of war released by Russia They include more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, hailed as heroes for mounting resistance at a steelworks in Mariupol Five British nationals also freed have arrived back in the UK Edited by Jeremy Gahagan Our live page coverage is now pausing. Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

"Russian troops in Kherson - in many cases Ukrainian tactics have outwitted the Russians Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a partial mobilisation to reinforce his troops in Ukraine after major combat setbacks this month. In an address to the nation, he said Russia was directly threatened with ""disintegration"" by the Western powers backing the Kyiv government. He also warned Nato that nuclear-armed Russia could use any weapons in its armoury against what he called Western ""nuclear blackmail"". His message came a day after Russian-installed leaders in four regions of eastern and southern Ukraine announced plans for so-called referendums - starting this week - on joining Russia. Crimea was annexed by Russia after just such a move in 2014. Russia plans to call up about 300,000 reservists - that is, people who have had military training and, Vladimir Putin stressed, have specialist skills needed in the Ukraine conflict. They will include many reserve officers, including some over 60, pulled in from retirement. Russia could in theory mobilise some 25 million people for military service, but that is not yet being considered. Both President Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu stressed that conscripts would not be sent to fight in Ukraine. Mr Shoigu said the extra troops were required to defend a front line stretching for some 1,000km (600 miles). The mobilisation will be spread over months - and Mr Putin has said previously that Russia is prepared for a long fight. Reuters news agency says it is Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, but the Kremlin did send thousands of conscripts to fight in Afghanistan in the 1980s, and later in Chechnya, in the North Caucasus. Many poorly-trained conscripts were killed in those costly wars, and this time the Kremlin appears anxious to avoid fuelling anti-war sentiment. Russia's military is numerically superior to Ukraine's, but Ukraine's battlefield tactics and precision Western weapons have narrowed that gap. Russia's initial invasion force in February numbered about 190,000 troops, in addition to thousands of pro-Russian fighters in the Donbas region. The Kremlin launched a massive recruitment drive, offering big financial incentives. So extra troops were drafted in, especially from poor regions of Siberia and the Caucasus, including experienced Chechen fighters. Russia has a normal limit of just over a million military personnel and almost 900,000 civilian staff - but last month President Putin signed a decree to recruit 137,000 more. Currently Russian men aged 18-27 are obliged to do military service, usually for one year, but there are many exemptions on medical grounds or for students. Russia initially denied sending conscript soldiers to Ukraine, but several officers were disciplined after cases came to light of conscripts being forced to sign contracts. President Putin then insisted no conscripts would be sent into combat. Before the invasion Ukraine's military numbers were much smaller - about 196,600 active troops. But Kyiv ordered a mass mobilisation, which has boosted those numbers. Ukraine's big counter-offensive in the northern Kharkiv region has put the Kremlin on the back foot, Western analysts and politicians say - which explains Vladimir Putin's latest move. Defence Minister Shoigu gave a new death toll on Wednesday - 5,937 Russian troops killed. But that is still far below the estimate of 25,000 dead given by the UK defence ministry in June, while Ukraine claims the figure is about 50,000. It has emerged that Russia isrecruiting prisoners to fight, as it struggles with its heavy losses. In the 1979-1989 war in Afghanistan the Soviet military lost about 15,000 troops. BBC Russian has established that Russia's losses in Ukraine include more than 1,000 elite officers, including many pilots, intelligence experts and special forces. President Putin castigated Kyiv's Western supporters for making anti-Russian ""threats"" - and warned that any threat to Russia's territorial integrity would be met with whatever weapons the Kremlin deemed necessary. ""Our country also has various weapons of mass destruction and, in some categories, more modern ones than those possessed by Nato countries,"" he said. ""This is no bluff,"" he added. Russia's military doctrine allows the use of tactical nuclear weapons if the Russian state is threatened with destruction. Russia has already usedlong-range hypersonic missilesin Ukraine, which can fly faster than 6,000 km/h (3,730 mph). But analysts say that has not been a game-changer. If Russia claims, after controversial referendums, that more parts of Ukraine have joined Russia it may then also claim that Russia itself is under Nato attack. Kyiv and Western leaders see the ""referendums"" as disguise for a Russian land grab. US Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said ""sham referenda"" and mobilisation were signs of Russian weakness. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called Mr Putin's military move ""a sign of panic"". ""His rhetoric on nuclear weapons is something we have heard many times before,"" he said, adding that it left him untroubled. Other Western politicians have also played down any threat of nuclear escalation. ANALYSIS:Who is winning the war in Ukraine? ON THE GROUND:What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

"Unsafe online content contributed ""in a more than minimal way"" to the death of 14-year-old Molly Russell, an inquest found on Friday. Early in the inquest it was revealed that Molly - who took her own life in 2017 - had a secret Twitter account which she used to express her thoughts about her worsening depression. The BBC learnt about the account several years ago, and the Russell family hope publicising it now will help others. After her death, Molly became a household name - a photo of her in school uniform appeared across newspaper front pages - as her father became a prominent campaigner for stronger regulation of social media. Ian believes most of Molly's time online was spent on Instagram and Pinterest, where she viewed thousands of images concerning suicide and self harm. Representatives of both companies gave evidence at her inquest. Molly spent much less time on Twitter, and the company was not involved in the inquest. But nevertheless, the time she spent on the platform is significant - because we can see her own thoughts and feelings, written and composed as tweets, and how complex and nuanced a teenager's mental health can be. This article was first published on 21 September. If you are suffering distress or despair,details of help and support are available here. The Met Police forensically examined Molly's phone in preparation for the inquest. Officers handed over tens of thousands of pages of material to the Russell family's legal team, including details of the previously-unknown Twitter account. The account revealed that for a year, Molly expressed her state of mind through a series of tweets and retweets. The name she chose for her Twitter handle was ""Idfc_nomore,"" which Ian thinks meant, ""I don't care no more,"" with an expletive in the middle. But normal teenage interests are reflected by what she wrote in her Twitter bio - a  short ""about me"" summary at the top of her account. It read: ""Harry Potter is life."" Ian has locked the account so others cannot view Molly's tweets, but he is happy for us to quote them. She first tweeted in December 2016, sharing a post by an account dedicated to tweeting quotes about depression. That account has been on Twitter for years, with more than 200,000 followers. It appears to belong to an American teenage boy who has struggled with depression, self-harm and anxiety - a US suicide hotline number is ""pinned"" to the top of the account, so people will see it before starting to scroll down. Like many similar accounts, its bio contains the term, ""Trigger Warning - proceed with caution"". When Molly followed this account, Twitter's algorithms would have recommended similar ones - the more you interact with content on a particular subject, the more of that kind of content is suggested to you. Twitter told us its number one priority was the safety of people who used its service. A spokesman said it has forged partnerships with UK mental health authorities to offer vulnerable people a support service called #ThereIsHelp, which provides mental health resources. ""As a result of this partnership, when someone searches for terms associated with suicide or self harm, the top search result is a notification encouraging them to reach out for help,"" he added. The first picture Molly retweeted using her secret account was a hand-drawn image of a teenage girl staring at the night sky, saying, ""I'm ready to become one of the stars"". The first image tweeted by Molly Teenagers may search for such content because they are feeling troubled and want to reach out to others. We are conscious of not wanting to direct vulnerable teenagers toward content of this kind, but they already follow these accounts in their tens of thousands - which Ian believes is incredibly dangerous. Ian says such images dress up suicide, and the grief it causes, in a way that makes it almost acceptable. ""There's a sort of stylistic, artistic, creative way that says, 'join this, join this club,'"" he says. The charity Papyrus specialises in suicide prevention for young people. It estimates four children aged five to 18 end their own lives in the UK each week. Calls to its helpline surged when Molly's story hit the headlines, with more than 30 families saying they felt social media had played a role in their child's death. Its chief executive, Ged Flynn, says struggling with suicidal thoughts over a long period of time is not unusual. ""They will go over and over their thoughts, ruminate and cogitate sometimes for weeks and months,"" he says. ""Many young people do that online - exercising their uncertainty, trying to work it out, asking, 'Am I the only one to feel like this?' ""People don't wear a big sign around their neck that they need help. They will drop hints and Molly was doing that online."" Talking to your child about suicidal thoughts can be difficult and feel very daunting,says the charity Papyrus,external, but starting the conversation is the most important thing. It suggests these simple steps may help you discuss the issue with your child: Ask directly Use the word suicide Practice asking first if this helps - it may give you more confidence Stay calm - this is important as your child may be looking at how you react before deciding how much they should tell you Be clear and direct Look them in the eye and ask: ""Are you thinking about suicide?"" For months, if not years, it seemed Molly was able to hide her depression from those who knew her. Ian remembers a time when she had not quite been herself. During a car journey he spoke to her about it and made her promise to tell him if there was ever something she needed to talk about. She agreed. But Molly chose Twitter and Instagram instead. She wrote on Twitter for the first time on 4 February 2017: ""I don't need to be saved, I need to be found."" This came from a poem by the model and actress Cara Delevingne, about her own struggle with depression. A day later, Molly tweeted this, apparently a screenshot from her own Pinterest account: ""It just shows the depth of despair she must have been feeling, which none of us had any idea,"" Ian says. ""I think she thought she was coping, she was finding a way through it. And then, slowly over those months, it all grew - and it swamped, consumed her. But she kept this secret."" In between her growing depression, Molly also shared the interests of an ordinary teenager on her Twitter account. She stayed up late waiting for a video to drop from US rapper Phora. She watched the American TV drama Riverdale. She retweeted Ariana Grande around the time of the Manchester terror attack. But, at the same time, Molly sent a tweet to JK Rowling saying her mind was full of suicidal thoughts. She didn't get a reply, but that is not surprising given the author has 13.9 million followers and must receive countless mentions and messages. Some of Molly's activity suggests she was looking for help, but did not quite know where to find it. One of the stars of Riverdale, Lili Reinhart, has publicly struggled with depression. During mental health awareness month in 2017, Reinhart, who has more than three million followers, tweeted urging them to have strength. ""When I'm feeling depressed or sad, I remind myself how far I've come,"" she wrote, ""and how I didn't let depression consume me."" Molly retweeted the posts but also messaged Reinhart directly, saying: ""I can't take it no more, I need someone but I can't reach out to anyone I love I just can't take it."" She did not receive a reply. Like JK Rowling, Reinhart has millions of followers and must equally be inundated with messages. Molly would later tweet a link to an online TED talk from California Highway Patrol Officer, Kevin Briggs. In it, he shared his experiences of trying to talk to people in moments of personal crisis, when they were about to jump from bridges. It is clear from her tweets that Molly was struggling. She was depressed and, it seems, increasingly focused on taking her own life. On 19 July, she posted words of despair on Twitter: But instead of talking to her family or friends, Molly discovered a Californian influencer who most people in the UK will probably never have heard of. Salice Rose has a fanbase of millions on Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, and more recently TikTok. Molly messaged her repeatedly. Despite outwardly appearing confident and full of life, Rose has publicly struggled with her own depression and anxiety. Was this what drew a teenager from Harrow, in north-west London, to her? On her phone, it appears as though Molly had composed a note to the influencer thousands of miles away: And Molly was clearly moved when Salice Rose posted a dramatic video advising how to overcome suicidal thoughts. She repeatedly tweeted Rose asking for help, but did not receive a reply. Ged Flynn from Papyrus says celebrities must be socially responsible. He says it is important to share and normalise the fact that life is difficult, but they must balance this by showing that help is available and where to get it. ""If I send you an email I may expect a response. For a young person like Molly, that expectation may be heightened. They've seen someone putting out their pain and they want to connect with that person,"" he says. Molly's father Ian thinks his daughter believed Salice had been reading and answering messages more than  would have been physically possible. ""By being able to shout into the vast world of the internet, Molly had the false impression that she was being listened to when, in effect, she was just shouting into the wind,"" he says. Salice Rose sent a video statement to the BBC saying she was upset that she did not know who Molly was, because if she did she could have called her and told her not to end her life. ""It's a feeling of guilt, knowing that one of my followers ended their life because in that moment, I could have helpedâ¦ and I'm trying my hardest not to cry, because this isn't about me, it's about Molly. It's super sad and she will always be in my prayers,"" she said. For Ian, Molly's tweets make hard reading. One showed his daughter was on her phone at 01:00, talking about drinking alcohol. He says Molly's entire family wishes every day that they had realised how she had been feeling and had done something different. ""Part of learning to process the grief that comes with a death by suicide is also learning to deal with that guilt. Many nice people say you can't blame yourself but that's an impossibility. ""Some days are worse than others. But I don't think there will be a day in the rest of my life where I won't blame myself."" Looking at her tweets, it is clear that, at the end of September 2017, Molly's mood was darkening again. She messaged the US rapper Phora, who has 380,000 followers. Unfortunately, says Ged Flynn, Molly was looking for help in the wrong places. ""At its simplest, that a person is still alive and tweeting is an opportunity for someone to step in. We need young people to sometimes look for adult help, expert help and most importantly safe help."" Ian agrees. ""If you're in a horrible low place where you actually want to end your life, please reach out to those people you love."" To Molly's parents, everything appeared normal. They had no idea that anything was wrong. In the week before her death, Molly won a part in a school play and appeared to be looking forward to rehearsals. There was also a family celebration for her sisters' birthdays coming up. On Monday 20 November, she completed her homework, packed her school bag and watched TV with her family. Ian remembers that  evening well - they were watching the new series of ""I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here"". Sitting next to him on the sofa, Molly was on Twitter on her phone. She wished Salice Rose a happy birthday - these are her last words on the platform: Everything appeared normal. Yet, for a reason only she will ever know, Molly took her own life in the early hours of the following morning. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played New York attorney general Letitia James wants the Trumps to repay $250m that she says was illegally obtained Donald Trump and three of his children have been hit with a fraud lawsuit after a New York investigation into their family company - the Trump Organization. It alleges that they lied ""by billions"" about the value of real estate in order to get loans and pay less tax. Prosecutors say the Trump Organization committed numerous acts of fraud between 2011-21. Mr Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as ""another witch hunt"". The former president's eldest children, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump, were also named as defendants alongside two executives at the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney. The lawsuit has been brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is the state's most senior lawyer, after a three-year civil investigation. Her office does not have the power to file criminal charges, but is referring allegations of criminal wrongdoing to federal prosecutors and to the Internal Revenue Service. ""With the help of his children and senior executives at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to unjustly enrich himself and cheat the system,"" Ms James said in a statement. She said Mr Trump's own apartment in Trump Tower, which was valued at $327m (Â£288m), was among the properties whose values were allegedly misrepresented. ""No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount,"" Ms James added. Here's a look at what the 222-page document alleges: Donald Trump and three of his children lied about the value of his properties - hotels, golf courses and other assets - in order to secure better loans and lower tax rates Over the course of a decade, Trump and his family made more than 200 false or misleading valuations on financial statements The potential value of development on some estates was overstated, and used to gain higher tax benefits for forfeiting development in favour of conservation Each statement was personally certified as accurate by Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, or former Trump Organization financial executive Allen Weisselberg The scheme enriched the Trump family by at least $250m (Â£220m) - the state wants to recover that money ""White collar financial crime is not a victimless crime,"" the attorney general said. ""When the well-connected break the law to take in more money than they are entitled to, it reduces resources available to working people, to regular people, to small businesses and to all tax payers."" Ms James is asking a court to bar the former president and his children from serving as officers or directors in any New York business. She also wants the Trump Organization banned from engaging in real estate transactions there for five years. The announcement comes after Ms James - a Democrat who is running for re-election in November - rejected at least one offer to settle the long-running civil investigation into the company's business practices. Blasting the lawsuit on his Truth Social site, Mr Trump branded Ms James, who is black, a racist. ""Another Witch Hunt by a racist Attorney General, Letitia James, who failed in her run for Governor, getting almost zero support from the public,"" he wrote. The Trumps have previously accused Ms James of pursuing a political vendetta, citing remarks she made before being elected as attorney general in 2018 in which she vowed to sue Mr Trump and branded him an ""illegitimate president"". Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump are named as defendants in the lawsuit On Twitter, Donald Trump Jr accused Ms James of ""weaponising her office to go after her political opponents"". While Mr Trump is not on the ballot in November's midterm elections, he remains the dominant force in the Republican Party - and is stoking speculation about another run for the White House in 2024. In August Mr Trump declined to answer questions during an interview at the attorney general's office connected to this civil investigation. Ms James said he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not self-incriminate, confirming only his name. Ms James said that Eric Trump did the same more than 500 times in a 2020 deposition. Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who worked on a separate case against Trump University, told the BBC that the lawsuit could take a year to go to trial. But the potential of such a trial could severely restrict Mr Trump's ability to do business in New York and profit from his marquee real estate holdings in New York City. It could trigger a series of financial consequences that would make it harder for him to raise capital and maintain credit, Snell said. ""It definitely could be ruinous for him,"" Snell said. The lawsuit lists some of the most well-known Trump properties: Prosecutors allege that the value of an apartment Trump had in Trump Tower in New York was listed at $327m after its ""wildly overstated"" size was tripled and given an ""unreasonable"" price per square foot. The record sale in the entire tower was $16.5m. The Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was valued as high as $739m by the Trump Organization. The attorney general's office alleges the real value was closer to $75m and that it generated less than $25m per year. Ms James's announcement that she would pass the findings of her investigation to other law enforcement agencies was ""an ominous signal"" for Mr Trump, according to Miriam Baer, vice-dean at Brooklyn Law School. ""The New York attorney general went one step further today,"" she told the BBC. ""It announced that in addition to filing this civil complaint, it was also making a referral to federal law enforcement authorities for a criminal investigation."" The lawsuit is one of a number of legal issues the former president is facing. On 8 August, the FBI conducted a search warrant at his home in Mar-a-Lago as part of an investigation into his handling of classified records. Federal investigators were then ordered by another judge to freeze their probe while a court-appointed official decides if any of the records should be private. But on Wednesday a federal appeals court ruled that the justice department can resume reviewing the classified documents. The decision reactivates the inquiry into whether Mr Trump withheld US national secrets after leaving office. He is also being investigated in Georgia in relation to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He has denied any wrongdoing in both those investigations.

"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. Some analysts predict another cut when the Bank meets in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. It was the first drop in more than four years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,was 2.5% in the 12 months to December 2024, down slightly from 2.6% in November. Despite the drop, inflation remains above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The spending and borrowing plans set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgetchanged expectations, in particular an increase inthe minimum wageandthe amount of National Insurance paid by employers. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskas a result of the National Insurance changes. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. Some economists believe the drop in inflation in December strengthens the case for a further cut. Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs Chris Mason: Political heat ramps up over the economy Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change has an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.49%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.27%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row, meaning its key lending ratehas a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%.

The scheme will fix wholesale gas and electricity prices for firms for six months from 1 October, shielding businesses from crippling costs. Hospitals, schools and charities will also get help, the government said. It comes after ministers announced a multi-billion pound plan to help households with bills for two years. Analysts suggest the help for firms and households combined could cost up to Â£150bn. Industry groups welcomed the package but warned further support may be needed after the winter. It is understood the scheme will be reviewed after three months with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but it is not known what sectors come under the category. Wholesale prices, which are what suppliers pay for energy in bulk before they distribute it to customers, are expected to be fixed for all non-domestic energy customers at Â£211 per MWh for electricity and Â£75 per MWh for gas. Those rates will be the base cost, to which other add-ons, such as standing charges will be added by suppliers. Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Pubs warning: 'My energy bill tripled to Â£35,000' Independent analysts Cornwall Insight said the plan marked a ""substantial"" 45% discount on wholesale energy prices at the end of last week. The government said the scheme would apply to companies which had agreed fixed deals at higher prices on or after 1 April, when energy bills started to surge. Those on variable and flexible tariffs will also be eligible. Companies do not need to contact suppliers as the discount will automatically be applied to their bills, with savings seen from October but received from November. Josh Farrant, manager at The Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, said the pub was facing a hike in energy bills from Â£44,000 to around Â£124,000 a year before the government's wholesale cap was announced. ""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" he said. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things."" ""It doesn't mean the panic is over. It's going to run for six months, then we'll see."" Read more reaction to the energy support for businesses,here. Guy Adams, who runs the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel in the Hebrides, said he had been quoted a 377% increase in his energy bills before the cap, which ""would probably have finished us off"". ""At present our cheapest room rate is Â£110 per night. We would have had to raise that to Â£415 per night,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. However, he said because his seasonal hotel will close for the winter and reopen in May, it was ""absolutely impossible"" to set prices for bookings given the support package will only run until April. ""The fact that it is going to be reviewed in six months is not practical,"" he added. Prime Minister Liz Truss said the government understood the ""huge pressure"" businesses, charities and public sector organisations faced with bills. She added that the new scheme would provide ""certainty and peace of mind"". Bur Labour business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said there were still questions about ""how much this will cost and who will pay for it"". Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the ""delayed announcement"" left businesses ""under a cloud of damaging uncertainty"". ""The government have no plan beyond these next six months, paralysing businesses who need to make decisions for the long term,"" she added. The support will apply to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. A scheme offering comparable support will be established in Northern Ireland. Officials have not said how much the package will cost the taxpayer, but Cornwall Insight estimates it at around Â£25bn. Energy-intensive industries, such as steel-making, have warned that businesses could go bust due to their energy costs, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine. Unlike households, businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, which is the maximum amount a supplier can charge per unit of energy. It means non-domestic bills have soared even higher. The government announced earlier this month that bills for a typical household would be limited to Â£2,500 annually until 2024 under a separate scheme. On Wednesday, it also said: New laws would be introduced to ensure landlords passed the discount on to tenants who pay all-inclusive bills. An additional Â£100 payment would go to households that do not receive support for their heating costs, such as those not served by the gas grid. The big problem with this support for business is its shelf life. Few businesses plan with only a six-month time horizon and there will be some whose plans to cut production, close premises and let staff go will not change as a result of this intervention. But many others - particularly those in retail and hospitality - may see this giving them a fighting chance over the commercially crucial Christmas trading period. The government has thrown an emergency blanket over the economy this winter, but longer term, more fundamental reform to the energy supply market, its pricing and mechanics will be needed. Developing more cheap renewables, securing foreign supplies of liquid gas, drilling for more domestic fossil fuels, breaking the link between gas prices and electricity and pushing ahead with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and small and large scale nuclear have been part of the government's plan for nearly two years. What's new is the pressure applied by Vladimir Putin to do it as fast as possible. Stephen Phipson of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said businesses would ""warmly welcome"" the government support package. ""Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector and making immediately available the much-needed help companies have been calling for across the board."" However, he warned that energy prices were likely to remain high for more than six months and firms may need ""support for a longer period if we are to protect jobs and remain competitive"". Director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the price cap would give steelmakers ""the chance to get through the winter"". But he called on the government to ""rapidly reform the energy market to ensure longer-term competitive prices"". Smaller businesses have also been struggling with rising bills, with brewery bosses warning that pubs and restaurants could be forced to close after energy costs soared by as much as 300%. A landlord of one Essex pub told the BBC his energy bill had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the industry was ""relieved"" by the support ahead of the busy Christmas trading period, adding it would secure jobs.

"Donald Trump and three of his children are hit by a fraud lawsuit following a three-year investigation into the family's business practices New York Attorney General Letitia James filed the lawsuit against the Trump Organization at a state court on Wednesday Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump are named as defendants and are accused of ""numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation"" The lawsuit is seeking around $250m (Â£220m) from the former president and his three eldest children A lawyer for Mr Trump says ""absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place"" and accuses New York officials of ""unchecked abuse of authority"" Edited by Gareth Evans We're closing our live coverage of the lawsuit announced against former President Donald Trump and his three eldest children. To recap, here's what happened:  For the latest developments,read our story here. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York Today, New York's attorney general filed a civil lawsuit. But at her press conference, she also announced that she would pass her findings to other powerful law enforcement officials including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice. They could carry out potential criminal investigations. Miriam Baer, vice-dean at Brooklyn Law School, called this one of the more notable developments from todayâs press conference. âThe New York attorney general went one step further today,â Baer told the BBC. âIt announced that in addition to filing this civil complaint, it was also making a referral to federal law enforcement authorities for a criminal investigation.â âThis sends an additionally ominous signal, as the Department of Justiceâs Tax Division and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York will now consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted,â Baer said. This development could open up additional fronts in Trumpâs multi-pronged legal war against both federal and state officials. In addition to the $250m (Â£220m) that New York's attorney general is seeking, today's announcement could have far-reaching implications for Donald Trump, his family members and their business dealings. For one, Attorney General Letitia James said her office is hoping that a court permanently bars Donald Trump - as well as Donald Trump Jr, Eric and Ivanka - from serving as an officer or director in any corporation or business entity in the entire state of New York. Additionally, Trump - and the entire Trump Organization - would be unable to acquire any commercial property in the state for the next five years, and would be barred from applying for loans from any institution registered with the state's Department of Financial Services. As one of the trustees of the Donald Trump Revocable Trust - which controls the former president's business interests - Donald Trump Jr would also be replaced with an independent trustee if the entity is replaced with a new trust. A judge would have to rule on all these measures before they come into effect. Donald Trump and sons Donald Trump Jr (centre) and Eric at an event on 31 July Mike WendlingReporting from Chicago At nearly 100 stories tall, the Trump International Hotel and Tower
in Chicago is the cityâs second-tallest building. Its shiny, stacked-box design and all-caps
TRUMP logo stands out even among the huge towers that line the Chicago River. But according to the New York lawsuit, Trump declared this luxury building
â stuffed with apartments, hotel rooms and restaurants â âworthlessâ. The lawsuit alleges the claim would help offset federal taxes.
At the same time, however, the former president was obtaining loans against the
tower from Deutsche Bank. The massive German financial institution loaned billions to
Trump over decades despite the ex-presidentâs defaults and lawsuits against the bank. Deutsche Bank vowed to stop lending Trump money shortly after
the 6 January riot at the US Capitol. Government lawyers say Trump has obtained tens of millions of
dollars of loans on the Trump Chicago building since 2011. The lawsuit alleges that Trump and his organisation misrepresented their financial position in
order to obtain favourable terms, not only on loans against the Chicago tower but
on property around the world. The 222-page lawsuit against Donald Trump and his three eldest children lists a number of properties that New York officials say were grossly misrepresented as part of the alleged fraud. Here are a few of the most well-known: Prosecutors alleged that the value of an apartment Trump had in Trump Tower in New York was listed at $327m after its ""wildly overstated"" size was tripled and given an ""unreasonable"" price per square foot. The record sale in the entire tower was $16.5m The Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was valued as high as $739m - although the attorney general's office alleges the real value was closer to $75m and that it generated less than $25m per year Prosecutors say Trump's golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland was valued at $327m based on the assumption that 2,500 homes could be developed there - 1,000 more than had been approved by local authorities A 2020 appraisal of Trump Park Avenue in New York valued it at $84.5m - but it was allegedly listed as $135.8m on a company statement that same year A commercial property at 40 Wall Street in New York was valued at $220m in a November 2012 appraisal. The same year, it was listed as being worth $527m in a company statement - a figure which rose to $530m the following year Even before she took office as New York's attorney general, Letitia James has had Donald Trump in her sights. On the night she was elected, the former New York City councilwoman from Brooklyn took aim at Trump. âHe should know that we here in New York - and I, in particular - we are not scared of you,â she said after her win in 2018. âAnd as the next attorney general of his home state, I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn.â James has made good on her promise, officially launching a civil investigation into Trump and his family business in 2019. Trump, in turn, has responded with his customary name-calling, accusing ""Letitia Peekaboo James"" of a politically-motivated campaign against him. He's called James, who is black, a ""racist"" and a ""failed"" attorney general with bad poll numbers. On Wednesday, James appeared to shrug off the insults, saying they had no bearing on her investigation or the potential outcome in court. For those of you just joining us, here's the latest: The taxpayers of New York are paying for the attorney generalâs
investigation and other legal costs. Legal experts say these costs could eventually be charged to Trump as part of a settlement, or as part of a judge's order. But a large chunk of Trumpâs legal bills have so far been footed by the Republican National Committee. The RNC paid almost $2m (Â£1.76m) in legal fees to law firms representing the former president between October 2021 and July of this year, according to Federal Election
Commission (FEC) records. This could, however, end if Trump
decides to run for president again in 2024. RNC officials, quoted in various US media reports, say the payments would stop because the party has a
""neutrality policy"" that prohibits it from taking sides in the
presidential primary. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York Should he declare another run for president in 2024, Donald Trump would be running under the shadow of a fraud lawsuit that could ultimately be âruinousâ for his real estate business, Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who handled a fraud case against Trump University, tells the BBC. He would enter the campaign as the undisputed frontrunner of the Republican pack, but his legal jeopardy opens up lines of attack that a potential challenger could exploit. Snell says Trump and the Trump Organization may seek to settle, rather than go to a full trial, in an effort to deal with at least one of the multiple legal battles he faces. âFrom Trumpâs perspective, itâs better to rip off the Band-Aid and get it over with and out of the way ahead of any run that could happen next year,â he says. Mike WendlingDisinformation reporter Subscribers to a pro-Trump channel on Telegram react to a clip of the New York attorney general's announcement Donald Trump and some of his most staunch supporters reacted
with predictable fury against todayâs lawsuit, but for others the news was a bit ""meh"". On his Truth Social network, which has become Trumpâs main
megaphone following his removal from mainstream social networking platforms,
the ex-president railed against a âWitch Hunt by a racist Attorney Generalâ. On other outlets, including pro-Trump channels on the Telegram chat
app, users repeated Trumpâs main themes - angrily accusing New York
Attorney General Letitia James of ignoring violent crime and
driving businesses out of the state. âWhy doesnât James stop harassing President Trump?â one
supporter tweeted. Trumpâs sons also accused the attorney general of being
politically biased. At the same time, other big supporter accounts and pro-Trump
media outlets, perhaps wearied by yet another legal fracas involving the former
president, seemed to barely notice the news. On alternative social network Gab, populated mostly by fringe
and far-right characters, the most popular posts railed against immigration and
Covid vaccines, with little mention of the fraud case. As well as this civil investigation, there's also an active criminal investigation into the Trump Organization based out of New York. For months, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been looking into whether Donald Trump or the Trump family business purposely inflated the value of the company's assets to potential lenders. In the last few moments, Bragg released a statement saying this investigation was ""active and ongoing"". It has already yielded criminal charges against the Trump Organization and its former Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg - who was also named by Letitia James today. Last month, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to 15 feloniesand admitted he had conspired with the company to avoid paying taxes. As part of a plea deal, Weissleberg must testify at the company's criminal trial if asked by prosecutors. Nada TawfikReporting from New York Remember the name Michael Cohen? This lawsuit can be traced back to President Trumpâs former lawyer and his dramatic testimony to Congress in 2019. He described the former president as a âcon-manâ who repeatedly exaggerated his wealth in financial documents to receive favourable loans from banks and insurance coverage. That caught the attention of New York stateâs Attorney General Letitia James, who said today that her investigation started only after Cohen had shed light on the alleged misconduct. Former President Trump fought her at every turn through the courts, insisting this was a witch-hunt by James, a Democrat. But his attempts to ignore her subpoenas and to block her investigation altogether were unsuccessful. When he sat for a four-hour, court ordered, deposition earlier this year he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times. While that canât be held against Trump in a criminal trial, it very much can be in a civil one. Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, his legal team tried to settle but were rebuffed. He has a long legal battle ahead and must now also worry whether this will turn into criminal charges. The lawsuit is long (more than 200 pages) and the result of a three-year investigation. Here's a look at what it alleges:  âThis conduct cannot be brushed aside and dismissed as some sort of good-faith mistake,â James said on Wednesday. âThe statements of financial condition were greatly exaggerated, grossly inflated, objectively false, and therefore fraudulent and illegal."" Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Donald Trump Jr - the former president's eldest son - has responded to the lawsuit on Twitter, saying Letitia James is ""weaponising her office"" to attack political opponents. ""This is all about politics,"" he wrote - echoing a statement made by his father's lawyer just moments ago. Donald Jr and two of his siblings, Eric and Ivanka, are defendants in the suit. They are accused of helping their father inflate his net worth by billions of dollars. Attorney General Letitia James was earlier asked whether she would be willing to settle the case with Donald Trump and his children out of court. ""I will not negotiate in public,"" she said, noting recent coverage saying her office had rejected settlement offers from Trump lawyers in recent days. ""Our doors are always open,"" she added. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York The decision to move ahead with a fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children raises the political stakes for the former president. That's because this is one of several ongoing investigations into Trump. These range from his businesses, his efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election, to his handling of classified government documents. Several of these have heated up in the last few weeks. The advancement of another major investigation into Trump gives his Democratic rivals more fodder as the midterm elections on 8 November loom ever nearer. While Trump is not on the ballot, Democrats have sought to tie Republican candidates to the former president, his policies and his alleged conduct. He has spun the multiple investigations as a partisan witch hunt, and has portrayed himself and his supporters as victims of political persecution. Trump, meanwhile, continues to hold rallies across the country and has not ruled out a run for president in 2024.  This video can not be played New York Attorney General announces lawsuit against Donald Trump Former President Donald Trump has responded to the lawsuit, calling it politically motivated. âTodayâs filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law,â he said in a statement through his lawyer Alina Habba. âIt is abundantly clear that the Attorney Generalâs Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place,â it read. Trump and Attorney General James have repeatedly sparred over the past year, while her office conducted an investigation into his family's business affairs. The sweeping lawsuit
against Donald Trump and three of his adult children â Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric â alleges that they lied to lenders and insurers
for more than a decade in order to enrich themselves. In
the more than 200-page lawsuit, James alleges that the defendants ârepeatedly and
consistentlyâ manipulated the value of their assets to receive favourable loans
and lower tax rates. The
âastoundingâ fraud scheme, she said, helped Trump pad his bank account by at
least $250m (Â£220m). James,
a Democrat, is asking the court for these funds to be returned. She is also seeking to permanently
bar Trump, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric from serving
as the director of a business registered anywhere in New York state. She is also seeking
to cancel the Trump Organizationâs corporate certificate. If this motion is
granted by a judge, it could effectively force the company to cease operations
in the state. The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, has filed a fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children. It is seeking around $250m (Â£220m) from the defendants. James said the former president's family business, the Trump Organization, had repeatedly used false statements to get banks to lend them money on favourable terms. ""[He] falsely inflated net worth by billions of dollars,"" she said in a press conference earlier. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

"This video can not be played New York attorney general Letitia James wants the Trumps to repay $250m that she says was illegally obtained Donald Trump and three of his children have been hit with a fraud lawsuit after a New York investigation into their family company - the Trump Organization. It alleges that they lied ""by billions"" about the value of real estate in order to get loans and pay less tax. Prosecutors say the Trump Organization committed numerous acts of fraud between 2011-21. Mr Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as ""another witch hunt"". The former president's eldest children, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump, were also named as defendants alongside two executives at the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney. The lawsuit has been brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is the state's most senior lawyer, after a three-year civil investigation. Her office does not have the power to file criminal charges, but is referring allegations of criminal wrongdoing to federal prosecutors and to the Internal Revenue Service. ""With the help of his children and senior executives at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to unjustly enrich himself and cheat the system,"" Ms James said in a statement. She said Mr Trump's own apartment in Trump Tower, which was valued at $327m (Â£288m), was among the properties whose values were allegedly misrepresented. ""No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount,"" Ms James added. Here's a look at what the 222-page document alleges: Donald Trump and three of his children lied about the value of his properties - hotels, golf courses and other assets - in order to secure better loans and lower tax rates Over the course of a decade, Trump and his family made more than 200 false or misleading valuations on financial statements The potential value of development on some estates was overstated, and used to gain higher tax benefits for forfeiting development in favour of conservation Each statement was personally certified as accurate by Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, or former Trump Organization financial executive Allen Weisselberg The scheme enriched the Trump family by at least $250m (Â£220m) - the state wants to recover that money ""White collar financial crime is not a victimless crime,"" the attorney general said. ""When the well-connected break the law to take in more money than they are entitled to, it reduces resources available to working people, to regular people, to small businesses and to all tax payers."" Ms James is asking a court to bar the former president and his children from serving as officers or directors in any New York business. She also wants the Trump Organization banned from engaging in real estate transactions there for five years. The announcement comes after Ms James - a Democrat who is running for re-election in November - rejected at least one offer to settle the long-running civil investigation into the company's business practices. Blasting the lawsuit on his Truth Social site, Mr Trump branded Ms James, who is black, a racist. ""Another Witch Hunt by a racist Attorney General, Letitia James, who failed in her run for Governor, getting almost zero support from the public,"" he wrote. The Trumps have previously accused Ms James of pursuing a political vendetta, citing remarks she made before being elected as attorney general in 2018 in which she vowed to sue Mr Trump and branded him an ""illegitimate president"". Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump are named as defendants in the lawsuit On Twitter, Donald Trump Jr accused Ms James of ""weaponising her office to go after her political opponents"". While Mr Trump is not on the ballot in November's midterm elections, he remains the dominant force in the Republican Party - and is stoking speculation about another run for the White House in 2024. In August Mr Trump declined to answer questions during an interview at the attorney general's office connected to this civil investigation. Ms James said he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not self-incriminate, confirming only his name. Ms James said that Eric Trump did the same more than 500 times in a 2020 deposition. Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who worked on a separate case against Trump University, told the BBC that the lawsuit could take a year to go to trial. But the potential of such a trial could severely restrict Mr Trump's ability to do business in New York and profit from his marquee real estate holdings in New York City. It could trigger a series of financial consequences that would make it harder for him to raise capital and maintain credit, Snell said. ""It definitely could be ruinous for him,"" Snell said. The lawsuit lists some of the most well-known Trump properties: Prosecutors allege that the value of an apartment Trump had in Trump Tower in New York was listed at $327m after its ""wildly overstated"" size was tripled and given an ""unreasonable"" price per square foot. The record sale in the entire tower was $16.5m. The Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was valued as high as $739m by the Trump Organization. The attorney general's office alleges the real value was closer to $75m and that it generated less than $25m per year. Ms James's announcement that she would pass the findings of her investigation to other law enforcement agencies was ""an ominous signal"" for Mr Trump, according to Miriam Baer, vice-dean at Brooklyn Law School. ""The New York attorney general went one step further today,"" she told the BBC. ""It announced that in addition to filing this civil complaint, it was also making a referral to federal law enforcement authorities for a criminal investigation."" The lawsuit is one of a number of legal issues the former president is facing. On 8 August, the FBI conducted a search warrant at his home in Mar-a-Lago as part of an investigation into his handling of classified records. Federal investigators were then ordered by another judge to freeze their probe while a court-appointed official decides if any of the records should be private. But on Wednesday a federal appeals court ruled that the justice department can resume reviewing the classified documents. The decision reactivates the inquiry into whether Mr Trump withheld US national secrets after leaving office. He is also being investigated in Georgia in relation to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He has denied any wrongdoing in both those investigations.

â stuffed with apartments, hotel rooms and restaurants â âworthlessâ. The lawsuit alleges the claim would help offset federal taxes.
At the same time, however, the former president was obtaining loans against the
tower from Deutsche Bank. The massive German financial institution loaned billions to
Trump over decades despite the ex-presidentâs defaults and lawsuits against the bank. Deutsche Bank vowed to stop lending Trump money shortly after
the 6 January riot at the US Capitol. Government lawyers say Trump has obtained tens of millions of
dollars of loans on the Trump Chicago building since 2011. The lawsuit alleges that Trump and his organisation misrepresented their financial position in
order to obtain favourable terms, not only on loans against the Chicago tower but
on property around the world. The 222-page lawsuit against Donald Trump and his three eldest children lists a number of properties that New York officials say were grossly misrepresented as part of the alleged fraud. Here are a few of the most well-known: Prosecutors alleged that the value of an apartment Trump had in Trump Tower in New York was listed at $327m after its ""wildly overstated"" size was tripled and given an ""unreasonable"" price per square foot. The record sale in the entire tower was $16.5m The Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was valued as high as $739m - although the attorney general's office alleges the real value was closer to $75m and that it generated less than $25m per year Prosecutors say Trump's golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland was valued at $327m based on the assumption that 2,500 homes could be developed there - 1,000 more than had been approved by local authorities A 2020 appraisal of Trump Park Avenue in New York valued it at $84.5m - but it was allegedly listed as $135.8m on a company statement that same year A commercial property at 40 Wall Street in New York was valued at $220m in a November 2012 appraisal. The same year, it was listed as being worth $527m in a company statement - a figure which rose to $530m the following year Even before she took office as New York's attorney general, Letitia James has had Donald Trump in her sights. On the night she was elected, the former New York City councilwoman from Brooklyn took aim at Trump. âHe should know that we here in New York - and I, in particular - we are not scared of you,â she said after her win in 2018. âAnd as the next attorney general of his home state, I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn.â James has made good on her promise, officially launching a civil investigation into Trump and his family business in 2019. Trump, in turn, has responded with his customary name-calling, accusing ""Letitia Peekaboo James"" of a politically-motivated campaign against him. He's called James, who is black, a ""racist"" and a ""failed"" attorney general with bad poll numbers. On Wednesday, James appeared to shrug off the insults, saying they had no bearing on her investigation or the potential outcome in court. For those of you just joining us, here's the latest: The taxpayers of New York are paying for the attorney generalâs
investigation and other legal costs. Legal experts say these costs could eventually be charged to Trump as part of a settlement, or as part of a judge's order. But a large chunk of Trumpâs legal bills have so far been footed by the Republican National Committee. The RNC paid almost $2m (Â£1.76m) in legal fees to law firms representing the former president between October 2021 and July of this year, according to Federal Election
Commission (FEC) records. This could, however, end if Trump
decides to run for president again in 2024. RNC officials, quoted in various US media reports, say the payments would stop because the party has a
""neutrality policy"" that prohibits it from taking sides in the
presidential primary. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York Should he declare another run for president in 2024, Donald Trump would be running under the shadow of a fraud lawsuit that could ultimately be âruinousâ for his real estate business, Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who handled a fraud case against Trump University, tells the BBC. He would enter the campaign as the undisputed frontrunner of the Republican pack, but his legal jeopardy opens up lines of attack that a potential challenger could exploit. Snell says Trump and the Trump Organization may seek to settle, rather than go to a full trial, in an effort to deal with at least one of the multiple legal battles he faces. âFrom Trumpâs perspective, itâs better to rip off the Band-Aid and get it over with and out of the way ahead of any run that could happen next year,â he says. Mike WendlingDisinformation reporter Subscribers to a pro-Trump channel on Telegram react to a clip of the New York attorney general's announcement Donald Trump and some of his most staunch supporters reacted
with predictable fury against todayâs lawsuit, but for others the news was a bit ""meh"". On his Truth Social network, which has become Trumpâs main
megaphone following his removal from mainstream social networking platforms,
the ex-president railed against a âWitch Hunt by a racist Attorney Generalâ. On other outlets, including pro-Trump channels on the Telegram chat
app, users repeated Trumpâs main themes - angrily accusing New York
Attorney General Letitia James of ignoring violent crime and
driving businesses out of the state. âWhy doesnât James stop harassing President Trump?â one
supporter tweeted. Trumpâs sons also accused the attorney general of being
politically biased. At the same time, other big supporter accounts and pro-Trump
media outlets, perhaps wearied by yet another legal fracas involving the former
president, seemed to barely notice the news. On alternative social network Gab, populated mostly by fringe
and far-right characters, the most popular posts railed against immigration and
Covid vaccines, with little mention of the fraud case. As well as this civil investigation, there's also an active criminal investigation into the Trump Organization based out of New York. For months, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been looking into whether Donald Trump or the Trump family business purposely inflated the value of the company's assets to potential lenders. In the last few moments, Bragg released a statement saying this investigation was ""active and ongoing"". It has already yielded criminal charges against the Trump Organization and its former Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg - who was also named by Letitia James today. Last month, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to 15 feloniesand admitted he had conspired with the company to avoid paying taxes. As part of a plea deal, Weissleberg must testify at the company's criminal trial if asked by prosecutors. Nada TawfikReporting from New York Remember the name Michael Cohen? This lawsuit can be traced back to President Trumpâs former lawyer and his dramatic testimony to Congress in 2019. He described the former president as a âcon-manâ who repeatedly exaggerated his wealth in financial documents to receive favourable loans from banks and insurance coverage. That caught the attention of New York stateâs Attorney General Letitia James, who said today that her investigation started only after Cohen had shed light on the alleged misconduct. Former President Trump fought her at every turn through the courts, insisting this was a witch-hunt by James, a Democrat. But his attempts to ignore her subpoenas and to block her investigation altogether were unsuccessful. When he sat for a four-hour, court ordered, deposition earlier this year he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times. While that canât be held against Trump in a criminal trial, it very much can be in a civil one. Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, his legal team tried to settle but were rebuffed. He has a long legal battle ahead and must now also worry whether this will turn into criminal charges. The lawsuit is long (more than 200 pages) and the result of a three-year investigation. Here's a look at what it alleges:  âThis conduct cannot be brushed aside and dismissed as some sort of good-faith mistake,â James said on Wednesday. âThe statements of financial condition were greatly exaggerated, grossly inflated, objectively false, and therefore fraudulent and illegal."" Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Donald Trump Jr - the former president's eldest son - has responded to the lawsuit on Twitter, saying Letitia James is ""weaponising her office"" to attack political opponents. ""This is all about politics,"" he wrote - echoing a statement made by his father's lawyer just moments ago. Donald Jr and two of his siblings, Eric and Ivanka, are defendants in the suit. They are accused of helping their father inflate his net worth by billions of dollars. Attorney General Letitia James was earlier asked whether she would be willing to settle the case with Donald Trump and his children out of court. ""I will not negotiate in public,"" she said, noting recent coverage saying her office had rejected settlement offers from Trump lawyers in recent days. ""Our doors are always open,"" she added. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York The decision to move ahead with a fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children raises the political stakes for the former president. That's because this is one of several ongoing investigations into Trump. These range from his businesses, his efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election, to his handling of classified government documents. Several of these have heated up in the last few weeks. The advancement of another major investigation into Trump gives his Democratic rivals more fodder as the midterm elections on 8 November loom ever nearer. While Trump is not on the ballot, Democrats have sought to tie Republican candidates to the former president, his policies and his alleged conduct. He has spun the multiple investigations as a partisan witch hunt, and has portrayed himself and his supporters as victims of political persecution. Trump, meanwhile, continues to hold rallies across the country and has not ruled out a run for president in 2024.  This video can not be played New York Attorney General announces lawsuit against Donald Trump Former President Donald Trump has responded to the lawsuit, calling it politically motivated. âTodayâs filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law,â he said in a statement through his lawyer Alina Habba. âIt is abundantly clear that the Attorney Generalâs Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place,â it read. Trump and Attorney General James have repeatedly sparred over the past year, while her office conducted an investigation into his family's business affairs. The sweeping lawsuit
against Donald Trump and three of his adult children â Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric â alleges that they lied to lenders and insurers
for more than a decade in order to enrich themselves. In
the more than 200-page lawsuit, James alleges that the defendants ârepeatedly and
consistentlyâ manipulated the value of their assets to receive favourable loans
and lower tax rates. The
âastoundingâ fraud scheme, she said, helped Trump pad his bank account by at
least $250m (Â£220m). James,
a Democrat, is asking the court for these funds to be returned. She is also seeking to permanently
bar Trump, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric from serving
as the director of a business registered anywhere in New York state. She is also seeking
to cancel the Trump Organizationâs corporate certificate. If this motion is
granted by a judge, it could effectively force the company to cease operations
in the state. The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, has filed a fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children. It is seeking around $250m (Â£220m) from the defendants. James said the former president's family business, the Trump Organization, had repeatedly used false statements to get banks to lend them money on favourable terms. ""[He] falsely inflated net worth by billions of dollars,"" she said in a press conference earlier. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

"This video can not be played New York attorney general Letitia James wants the Trumps to repay $250m that she says was illegally obtained Donald Trump and three of his children have been hit with a fraud lawsuit after a New York investigation into their family company - the Trump Organization. It alleges that they lied ""by billions"" about the value of real estate in order to get loans and pay less tax. Prosecutors say the Trump Organization committed numerous acts of fraud between 2011-21. Mr Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as ""another witch hunt"". The former president's eldest children, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump, were also named as defendants alongside two executives at the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney. The lawsuit has been brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is the state's most senior lawyer, after a three-year civil investigation. Her office does not have the power to file criminal charges, but is referring allegations of criminal wrongdoing to federal prosecutors and to the Internal Revenue Service. ""With the help of his children and senior executives at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to unjustly enrich himself and cheat the system,"" Ms James said in a statement. She said Mr Trump's own apartment in Trump Tower, which was valued at $327m (Â£288m), was among the properties whose values were allegedly misrepresented. ""No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount,"" Ms James added. Here's a look at what the 222-page document alleges: Donald Trump and three of his children lied about the value of his properties - hotels, golf courses and other assets - in order to secure better loans and lower tax rates Over the course of a decade, Trump and his family made more than 200 false or misleading valuations on financial statements The potential value of development on some estates was overstated, and used to gain higher tax benefits for forfeiting development in favour of conservation Each statement was personally certified as accurate by Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, or former Trump Organization financial executive Allen Weisselberg The scheme enriched the Trump family by at least $250m (Â£220m) - the state wants to recover that money ""White collar financial crime is not a victimless crime,"" the attorney general said. ""When the well-connected break the law to take in more money than they are entitled to, it reduces resources available to working people, to regular people, to small businesses and to all tax payers."" Ms James is asking a court to bar the former president and his children from serving as officers or directors in any New York business. She also wants the Trump Organization banned from engaging in real estate transactions there for five years. The announcement comes after Ms James - a Democrat who is running for re-election in November - rejected at least one offer to settle the long-running civil investigation into the company's business practices. Blasting the lawsuit on his Truth Social site, Mr Trump branded Ms James, who is black, a racist. ""Another Witch Hunt by a racist Attorney General, Letitia James, who failed in her run for Governor, getting almost zero support from the public,"" he wrote. The Trumps have previously accused Ms James of pursuing a political vendetta, citing remarks she made before being elected as attorney general in 2018 in which she vowed to sue Mr Trump and branded him an ""illegitimate president"". Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump are named as defendants in the lawsuit On Twitter, Donald Trump Jr accused Ms James of ""weaponising her office to go after her political opponents"". While Mr Trump is not on the ballot in November's midterm elections, he remains the dominant force in the Republican Party - and is stoking speculation about another run for the White House in 2024. In August Mr Trump declined to answer questions during an interview at the attorney general's office connected to this civil investigation. Ms James said he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not self-incriminate, confirming only his name. Ms James said that Eric Trump did the same more than 500 times in a 2020 deposition. Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who worked on a separate case against Trump University, told the BBC that the lawsuit could take a year to go to trial. But the potential of such a trial could severely restrict Mr Trump's ability to do business in New York and profit from his marquee real estate holdings in New York City. It could trigger a series of financial consequences that would make it harder for him to raise capital and maintain credit, Snell said. ""It definitely could be ruinous for him,"" Snell said. The lawsuit lists some of the most well-known Trump properties: Prosecutors allege that the value of an apartment Trump had in Trump Tower in New York was listed at $327m after its ""wildly overstated"" size was tripled and given an ""unreasonable"" price per square foot. The record sale in the entire tower was $16.5m. The Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was valued as high as $739m by the Trump Organization. The attorney general's office alleges the real value was closer to $75m and that it generated less than $25m per year. Ms James's announcement that she would pass the findings of her investigation to other law enforcement agencies was ""an ominous signal"" for Mr Trump, according to Miriam Baer, vice-dean at Brooklyn Law School. ""The New York attorney general went one step further today,"" she told the BBC. ""It announced that in addition to filing this civil complaint, it was also making a referral to federal law enforcement authorities for a criminal investigation."" The lawsuit is one of a number of legal issues the former president is facing. On 8 August, the FBI conducted a search warrant at his home in Mar-a-Lago as part of an investigation into his handling of classified records. Federal investigators were then ordered by another judge to freeze their probe while a court-appointed official decides if any of the records should be private. But on Wednesday a federal appeals court ruled that the justice department can resume reviewing the classified documents. The decision reactivates the inquiry into whether Mr Trump withheld US national secrets after leaving office. He is also being investigated in Georgia in relation to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He has denied any wrongdoing in both those investigations.

"Tax cuts, due to be announced on Friday, are likely to push UK borrowing and debt to unsustainable levels, a leading economic think tank has warned. The UK will spend billions helping households and firms with energy bills, but tax cuts will have a longer-term impact on public finances, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Even after that support ends, the UK will borrow Â£100bn a year, it says. Tax cuts amounted to a ""gamble"" that may not pay off, the IFS warned. In Friday's mini-budget the government is expected to reverse a rise in National Insurance and scrap a planned increase in corporation tax, which could cost Â£30bn. The Treasury has refused to publisha forecast of the UK's economic outlook alongside this Friday's mini-Budget. The IFS said it was publishing its own research, setting out ""how much red ink"" would be added to the country's financial position as a result of the strategy led by new prime minister Liz Truss. Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer? Firms' energy bills to be cut by half this winter Carl Emmerson, deputy director at the IFS and an author of the research, said the government's tax cutting plans meant borrowing would remain high, even after the cost of subsidising energy bills had fallen away, adding to overall debt. ""While we would get to enjoy lower taxes now, ever-increasing debt would eventually prove unsustainable,"" Mr Emmerson said. ""The government is choosing to ramp up borrowing just as it becomes more expensive to do so, in a gamble on growth that may not pay off."" The sums indicated by the IFS are staggering. No doubt the government will argue they do not take into account their growth plans, but the government rejected the OBR offer to bring out an official forecast. Hundreds of billions extra in borrowing seems a reasonable indication of the cost of the energy rescue packages, the economic shocks and then permanent planned tax cuts. An increase of this scale has not occurred in recent memory, without at the same time, the Bank of England in the market buying up government debts. The government's own recently legislated rules for limiting borrowing would also be broken, if these forecasts are right. While some of this is down to the spending on energy, much is down to the forecast increase in borrowing from permanent tax cuts. There appears to be a clear break occurring in tax and spending policy. An official forecast would have revealed this change clearly. The reality will come soon enough. The new prime minister has outlined her plans for the economy, arguing that cutting taxes will ""boost business-led growth and investment"". The pace of growth that would be required to keep national debt at sustainable levels was not impossible but would require ""a great deal of luck over a long period or a concerted change in policy direction,"" Mr Emmerson said. The government has said it wants the economy to grow by 2.5% a year on average. The IFS said finding a way to boost the UK's rate of economic growth would ""undoubtedly help"", but said the government should not underestimate the scale of that challenge. Borrowing of nearly Â£100bn a year is significantly higher than previously forecast. In March, borrowing was predicted to be Â£50bn next year and well below Â£40bn by the mid-2020s. The Â£100bn figure is equivalent to around 3.5% of national income, which is high in historical terms. In the 60 years before the financial crisis, borrowing averaged 1.9% of national income, the IFS said.âThe fluctuating wholesale price of energy means the cost of government subsidies for households, public bodies and private firms, is hard to estimate. However the think tank calculates the planned tax cuts would leave government revenues around Â£30bn lower than they would have been. Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer?

"Joel Borders (left) and Jonathon Cobban have been convicted of sharing offensive messages in a WhatsApp group A serving Met police constable and an ex-officer have been found guilty of sharing ""grossly racist, sexist, and misogynistic"" messages with Sarah Everard's killer. Jonathon Cobban, 35, and former PC Joel Borders, 45, shared WhatsApp messages about women and disabled people with Wayne Couzens. Judge Sarah Turnock described some of the comments as ""abhorrent"". Couzens, 49, murdered Ms Everard last year while serving as a Met officer. Cobban and Borders were members of a WhatsApp group called ""Bottle and Stoppers"", along with Couzens. In comments on April 5 2019, Cobban and Borders swapped messages about tasering children, animals and disabled people. Judge Turnock said: ""I can honestly say that I consider it to be sickening to think of a police officer joking about using firearms in this way."" On April 25 2019, Borders joked about raping a female colleague using language which the judge said was ""misogynistic and aggressive in its nature"". Cobban, from Didcot, Oxfordshire and Borders, from Preston, Lancashire, will be sentenced on 2 November. William Neville, from Weybridge in Surrey, 34, was cleared of sending grossly offensive messages following a trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court in July. Neville had been accused of""acting out a rape fantasy""following comments he made about restraining a teenage girl, which he referred to as a ""struggle snuggle"". But Judge Turnock found the term referred to a technique learnt during police training, and said the message did not in itself imply the action had been sexually motivated. The offences took place two years before Couzens kidnapped Sarah Everard in a fake arrest in March 2021, before raping and murdering the 33-year-old marketing executive. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) previously said the charges arose from an investigation into the phone records of Couzens. IOPC regional director Sal Naseem said: ""The messages sent by these police officers were inexcusable and particularly disturbing given the profession they represent. ""Social media cannot be a hiding place for these types of views. ""Behaviour of this nature seriously undermines public confidence in policing."" Messages the men shared had been previously described in court by Prosecutor Edward Brown QC as being ""grossly racist, sexist, misogynistic"".

"Chris Kaba, who was due to become a father, died in the early hours of 6 September about two hours after he was shot The family of Chris Kaba, an unarmed black man killed by the Metropolitan Police in south London, has been shown body-worn police camera footage of the moments leading up to his death. Mr Kaba, 24, was shot dead by an armed officer following a car pursuit that ended in Streatham on 5 September. Mr Kaba's mother Helen Nkama told the BBC it had been ""very hard"" to watch the footage. The family also met the Met Police's Commissioner after viewing the footage. Ms Nkama said her heart was ""already broken"" but that she now wanted ""justice"". ""I want the truth,"" she said. ""The truth. That's what I want for Chris,"" she said of her son, who had been an expectant father. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), has begun a homicide investigation into the shooting. Police watchdog to examine race as factor Chris Kaba family says officer suspension too slow Met Police officers 'concerned' over shooting suspension It said last week it was making arrangements for the family to view the footage after they had asked to see it. The family gathered at their solicitors' office to watch the video before being joined later by Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley. Afterwards, Mr Kaba's cousin Jefferson Bosela repeated Ms Nkama's comments, saying the family now wants ""justice"" but that they would now be taking a ""step back"" after some initial campaigning following Mr Kaba's death. This video can not be played Watch: Chris Kaba's parents, Prosper Kaba and Helen Nkama, have accused the Met of racism The Met Police has suspended the officer involved, but the family has previously criticised the length of time it took for this to happen, accusing the force of racism. The IOPC recently said it would examine whether or not Mr Kaba's race influenced any actions taken by the Met Police. Its investigation is expected to take six to nine months. It has also previously said that on the night Mr Kaba was shot, a police Automatic Number Plate Recognition camera had indicated a vehicle being driven by the 24-year-old, which was not registered to him, had been linked to a firearms incident in the previous days. The IOPC said CPR was immediately given by officers and support requested from the ambulance service, but Mr Kaba later died in hospital in the early hours of 6 September.

"Jerome Powell, head of the Federal Reserve, says inflation in the US is too high The US central bank has pushed interest rates to the highest level in almost 15 years as it fights to rein in soaring prices in the world's largest economy. The Federal Reserve announced it was raising its key rate by another 0.75 percentage points, lifting the target range to between 3% and 3.25%. Borrowing costs are expected to climb more - and remain high, the bank said. The move comes despite mounting concern that the cost of controlling inflation could be a harsh economic downturn. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the rate rises were necessary to slow demand, easing the pressures putting up prices and avoiding long-term damage to the economy. But he conceded that they will take a toll. ""We have got to get inflation behind us,"" he said. ""I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't."" Banks in nearly every country - with the big exceptions of Japan and China -  are facing similar trade-offs as they raise rates to combat their own inflation problems. The Bank of England is widely expected to announce its seventh consecutive rate rise at its meeting on Thursday, while Indonesia and the Philippines are among the other countries also poised for increases. Analysts are starting to worry that the global sweep of the rate hikes, which ripple out to the public in the form of more expensive mortgages, loans and credit card debt, could lead to greater economic slowdown than policymakers expect. Even if it avoids the two quarters of contraction that typically define a recession, the 2023 world economy is expected to be at its weakest in more than a decade, excepting the 2020 pandemic year, said Ben May, director of global macro research at Oxford Economics. ""What has become clear is that if given the choice between allowing inflation to remain high for a sustained period .... or pushing the economy into a recession, [central bank leaders] would rather push the economy into recession and get inflation back towards target,"" he said. In the US, the Fed is raising rates at one of the fastest paces in its modern history, a sharp reversal after years of low borrowing costs, responding to inflation that is running at a 40-year high. The Fed initially hoped that the problems would fade as supply chain issues tied to the coronavirus pandemic abated. But the war in Ukraine, which disrupted oil and food supplies, added to the problem. And while oil prices have since come down, inflation pressures are now bubbling across the economy, with the most recent data showing inflation at 8.3% in August, with big increases in housing, health care and education costs. Wages, while rising, have not kept pace, hurting household budgets. Wednesday's rate increase - the fifth in a row - lifts the rate the Fed charges banks to borrow from near zero at the start of the year to 3% for the first time since early 2008. Forecasts released by the Fed on Wednesday show policymakers expect it to reach 4.4% by the end of the year - and rise further in 2023, sharply higher than its prior forecasts. ""What is striking is the speed,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. ""They're having to move very quickly ... and it means it's more likely to be a surprise to firms and households."" Sean is scrapping holiday plans, uncertain what the economy may bring New Yorker Sean V said he felt lucky that he bought a two-bedroom condo last year, before borrowing costs started their climb, locking in a mortgage rate around 2.6%. But the 30-year-old works in the home loan industry, which has seen business plunge as mortgage rates cross 6% for the first time since 2008. He said he feared losing his job ""every single day"" and was cutting back spending and scrapping holiday plans amid the uncertainty. ""I don't know what 2023 is going to bring,"" he said. ""All of that weighs heavily - not just on me, on everybody."" ""I don't know how stalling the economy is helping anyone."" Analysts hope that slowdown will be mild thanks to the strong labour market but the risks are rising Some inflation is seen as healthy, but sudden, sharp price spikes make it hard for households and businesses to plan and reduce spending power, hurting economic growth and eroding living standards over time. By raising borrowing costs for businesses and households, central banks intend to reduce demand for big-ticket items like cars, homes or business expansions, which should ease the pressures pushing up prices. But it also means less economic activity, which typically leads to job losses and other economic pain. In the US, where the economy contracted in the first half of the year, home sales have slumped and growing numbers of firms have instituted job cuts or hiring freezes, warning of rising costs and slowdown ahead. For now, the US jobs market has shown few signs of slowdown, helping to keep consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - resilient. But pressure has been rising on the Fed. On Wednesday, prominent progressive senator, Elizabeth Warren, called the Fed's moves ""extreme"". ""I've been warning that Chair Powell's Fed would throw millions of Americans out of work - and I fear he's already on the path to doing so,"" she wrote on Twitter. Forecasts released by the Fed show policymakers expect growth in the US to slow to a crawl this year, to 0.2%. They see growth picking up to 1.2% next year, but predict the unemployment rate will rise to 4.4%. The forecasts do not show inflation returning to the bank's 2% target until 2025. Mr Powell said doing less could lead to even more economic damage. ""Higher interest rates, slower growth and a softening labour market are all painful for the public that we serve but they're not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and and do it down the road again,"" he said. Many analysts are forecasting a recession in the US next year but remain hopeful it will be relatively mild, noting that household finances are in better shape than in prior downturns. But the war in Ukraine and concerns about energy supplies raise the risks, JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon warned lawmakers at a congressional hearing on Wednesday. ""There's a chance - not a big chance -  a small chance, of a soft landing, there is a chance of a mild recession, a chance of a harder recession. And because of the war in Ukraine... and the uncertainty that causes in the global energy supply and food supply, there's a chance could be worse,"" he said. ""I think policymakers should be prepared for the worst."" Why are prices rising and what is the inflation rate in the US?

"Liz Truss met Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska in New York Downing Street says President Vladimir Putin's call-up of Russia's military reservists is a ""clear admission"" his invasion of Ukraine is failing. Mr Putin called the mobilisation a necessary step to protect Russia's territorial integrity. No 10 condemned Russia's ""reprehensible actions"" and said the UK would continue to support Ukraine. Prime Minister Liz Truss vowed to stand up for freedom in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York. On her first foreign trip as prime minister, Ms Truss argued that democratic nations should prioritise economic growth and security in a new era of strategic competition. West condemns Russian plans for 'sham' Ukraine vote Why is Russia calling 'votes' in occupied Ukraine? Who is winning the war in Ukraine? She also used her speech on Thursday to rally support for Ukraine and highlight the threat from authoritarian states such as Russia and China. Ms Truss said: ""The Ukrainians aren't just defending their own country, they're defending our values and the security of the whole world. That's why we must act."" The prime minister also pledged to ""sustain or increase"" the military support to Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"", telling the assembled UN  delegates that ""we will not rest until Ukraine prevails"". ""The time to act is now. This is a decisive moment in our history, in the history of this organisation and the history of freedom."" Earlier this week, the government said it would match or exceed the Â£2.3bn support given to Ukraine's ""inspirational"" troops since Mr Putin's forces invaded the country in February. On Wednesday, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""Putin's speech and his move to mobilise the Russian population are a clear admission that his invasion is failing. ""The UK alongside our international partners stand united in condemning the Russian government's reprehensible actions."" Downing Street said US President Joe Biden and Ms Truss both ""condemned Putin's recent belligerent statements on Ukraine"" when they held their first one-on-one meeting at the UN summit. ""They agreed his actions highlight the need for allies to continue their economic and military support to Ukraine,"" a read-out of the meeting said. Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska and prime minister Denys Shmyal were among the foreign leaders Ms Truss has already met in New York. Ms Truss's pledge to support Ukraine in the long term echoes a key policy plank of the previous UK government led by her predecessor, Boris Johnson. In a previous speech, when Ms Truss was foreign secretary, the prime minister said Russian forces must be pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"". On Tuesday, Ms Truss said ""we are facing incredibly tough economic times"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic ""pushed up energy prices"", but she said higher fuel bills were ""a price worth paying"" for the UK's long-term security. In her UN speech, Ms Truss called on democracies ""to harness the power of co-operation seen since Putin's invasion of Ukraine to constrain authoritarianism"". In a meeting ahead of her speech, Ms Truss and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen agreed that Mr Putin's mobilisation of reservists was a ""statement of weakness"". As the motorcades of innumerable world leaders clog the streets of Manhattan, in the corridors of the United Nations the war in Ukraine shapes every conversation. This international crisis has profound and obvious domestic implications that have forced the government to act to help businesses as well as households. Ms Truss's address to the UN here and what amounts to a Budget in all but formal title on Friday offers the clearest picture yet of her new government's worldview and strategy - and it is shaped by the war. The prime minister said the ""free world"", as she put it, must prioritise economic growth so it is ""no longer strategically dependent on those who seek to weaponise the global economy"". Hence, a desire to boost defence spending, and a commitment to turbocharge the economy, with tax cuts the preferred fuel. Mr Putin accused the West of wanting to destroy Russia and stressed he would use ""all available means"" to protect its territory. ""Those who are trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the wind can also turn in their direction,"" President Putin added. In an interview with Germany's Bild media group, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he did not think Mr Putin would resort to nuclear weapons. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denounced the call-up as ""an act of desperation"" in a ""criminal war"" he said Russia could not win. The chief of the Nato alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, lambasted Mr Putin's ""dangerous and reckless"" rhetoric but said his words were not new or surprising. ""He knows very well that a nuclear war should never be fought and cannot be won, and it will have unprecedented consequences for Russia,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. President Putin warned the West he wasn't bluffing when he mentioned the use of nuclear weapons But a former adviser to President Putin, political scientist Sergei Markov, accused Western leaders such as Ms Truss of being aggressors, not Russia. When asked if President Putin could use nuclear weapons against Western nations such as the UK, Mr Markov told the BBC the situation could arise if the ""Prime Minister of Great Britain Liz Truss still has plans to destroy Russia"". Mr Putin's escalation followed a sweeping counter-offensive by Ukraine in the country's north-east in the past weeks, with its forces retaking hundreds of towns and villages that had been controlled by Russia for months. A British defence intelligence update suggested Mr Putin was being forced to undermine his own public position that the war in Ukraine was a ""special military operation"" rather than a full-scale conflict. ""These new measures have highly likely been brought forwards due to public criticism and mark a further development in Russia's strategy,"" the Ministry of Defence said. Meanwhile, Western nations have condemned Moscow's plans to hold so-called referendums in parts of Ukraine that are currently under Russian control.

"Liz Truss met Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska in New York Downing Street says President Vladimir Putin's call-up of Russia's military reservists is a ""clear admission"" his invasion of Ukraine is failing. Mr Putin called the mobilisation a necessary step to protect Russia's territorial integrity. No 10 condemned Russia's ""reprehensible actions"" and said the UK would continue to support Ukraine. Prime Minister Liz Truss vowed to stand up for freedom in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York. On her first foreign trip as prime minister, Ms Truss argued that democratic nations should prioritise economic growth and security in a new era of strategic competition. West condemns Russian plans for 'sham' Ukraine vote Why is Russia calling 'votes' in occupied Ukraine? Who is winning the war in Ukraine? She also used her speech on Thursday to rally support for Ukraine and highlight the threat from authoritarian states such as Russia and China. Ms Truss said: ""The Ukrainians aren't just defending their own country, they're defending our values and the security of the whole world. That's why we must act."" The prime minister also pledged to ""sustain or increase"" the military support to Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"", telling the assembled UN  delegates that ""we will not rest until Ukraine prevails"". ""The time to act is now. This is a decisive moment in our history, in the history of this organisation and the history of freedom."" Earlier this week, the government said it would match or exceed the Â£2.3bn support given to Ukraine's ""inspirational"" troops since Mr Putin's forces invaded the country in February. On Wednesday, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""Putin's speech and his move to mobilise the Russian population are a clear admission that his invasion is failing. ""The UK alongside our international partners stand united in condemning the Russian government's reprehensible actions."" Downing Street said US President Joe Biden and Ms Truss both ""condemned Putin's recent belligerent statements on Ukraine"" when they held their first one-on-one meeting at the UN summit. ""They agreed his actions highlight the need for allies to continue their economic and military support to Ukraine,"" a read-out of the meeting said. Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska and prime minister Denys Shmyal were among the foreign leaders Ms Truss has already met in New York. Ms Truss's pledge to support Ukraine in the long term echoes a key policy plank of the previous UK government led by her predecessor, Boris Johnson. In a previous speech, when Ms Truss was foreign secretary, the prime minister said Russian forces must be pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"". On Tuesday, Ms Truss said ""we are facing incredibly tough economic times"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic ""pushed up energy prices"", but she said higher fuel bills were ""a price worth paying"" for the UK's long-term security. In her UN speech, Ms Truss called on democracies ""to harness the power of co-operation seen since Putin's invasion of Ukraine to constrain authoritarianism"". In a meeting ahead of her speech, Ms Truss and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen agreed that Mr Putin's mobilisation of reservists was a ""statement of weakness"". As the motorcades of innumerable world leaders clog the streets of Manhattan, in the corridors of the United Nations the war in Ukraine shapes every conversation. This international crisis has profound and obvious domestic implications that have forced the government to act to help businesses as well as households. Ms Truss's address to the UN here and what amounts to a Budget in all but formal title on Friday offers the clearest picture yet of her new government's worldview and strategy - and it is shaped by the war. The prime minister said the ""free world"", as she put it, must prioritise economic growth so it is ""no longer strategically dependent on those who seek to weaponise the global economy"". Hence, a desire to boost defence spending, and a commitment to turbocharge the economy, with tax cuts the preferred fuel. Mr Putin accused the West of wanting to destroy Russia and stressed he would use ""all available means"" to protect its territory. ""Those who are trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the wind can also turn in their direction,"" President Putin added. In an interview with Germany's Bild media group, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he did not think Mr Putin would resort to nuclear weapons. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denounced the call-up as ""an act of desperation"" in a ""criminal war"" he said Russia could not win. The chief of the Nato alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, lambasted Mr Putin's ""dangerous and reckless"" rhetoric but said his words were not new or surprising. ""He knows very well that a nuclear war should never be fought and cannot be won, and it will have unprecedented consequences for Russia,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. President Putin warned the West he wasn't bluffing when he mentioned the use of nuclear weapons But a former adviser to President Putin, political scientist Sergei Markov, accused Western leaders such as Ms Truss of being aggressors, not Russia. When asked if President Putin could use nuclear weapons against Western nations such as the UK, Mr Markov told the BBC the situation could arise if the ""Prime Minister of Great Britain Liz Truss still has plans to destroy Russia"". Mr Putin's escalation followed a sweeping counter-offensive by Ukraine in the country's north-east in the past weeks, with its forces retaking hundreds of towns and villages that had been controlled by Russia for months. A British defence intelligence update suggested Mr Putin was being forced to undermine his own public position that the war in Ukraine was a ""special military operation"" rather than a full-scale conflict. ""These new measures have highly likely been brought forwards due to public criticism and mark a further development in Russia's strategy,"" the Ministry of Defence said. Meanwhile, Western nations have condemned Moscow's plans to hold so-called referendums in parts of Ukraine that are currently under Russian control.

"Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot after a gunman chased another man into her home in Liverpool A record reward of up to Â£200,000 has been offered in the search for the gunman who killed Olivia Pratt-Korbel. The nine-year-oldwas shot during a strugglewhen two men burst into her home in Liverpool on 22 August. The reward has increased after Crimestoppers founder Lord Ashcroft doubled an initial pledge of Â£50,000 to match Â£100,000 put forward by a private donor. It will be paid for information leading to the conviction of Olivia's killer. The new amount was announced as police revealed details of the gun used in the shooting, and vowed to catch ""this toxic individual who robbed Olivia of her future"". Nine people have so far been arrestedbut no charges have been brought. Olivia's mother Cheryl Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door on the gunman, who was chasing and firing at another man. He continued shooting and hit the schoolgirl with a fatal shot to her chest. Neither of the men were known to the family, in the Dovecot area. This video can not be played Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen: ""I am determined to take these weapons off the streets"" Merseyside Police said it had identified two weapons used by the killer, with a .38 revolver responsible for the fatal shot. A Glock-type self-loading 9mm pistol was also used by the gunman the same night. Police released an image of a Glock pistol similar to one of two weapons used on the night of the killing Detectives have discovered that the pistol had been used in two other attacks in Dovecot over a two-and-a-half-year period. The first was in Wimbourne Close on 27 January 2020 when a 19-year-old man was shot through a front door. The second was on 8 August - two weeks before Olivia's death in Finch Way, just a short distance from her home. On this occasion two rival groups in cars and on motorbikes fired shots indiscriminately near some playing fields. Olivia's mum says heartfelt 'goodnight' at funeral Golf club weapon search in Olivia murder inquiry Praise for Olivia's 'devastated' school friends The force said officers had now worked for more than 15,000 hours on the investigation, trawled through thousands of hours of CCTV and investigated more than 400 pieces of intelligence passed on by the public. Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said: ""Those involved in this abhorrent crime are poison in the community and we are continuing to robustly target them. ""These people have crossed the line in every sense by shooting an innocent nine-year-old and we all have a responsibility to put all those involved behind bars."" Olivia's funeral was held on Thursday The detective called for people to reveal where the guns were being kept, and said evidence suggested they could still be in the Dovecot area. ""Why should we, or you, show them any loyalty at all? I want people to tell us where those guns are, now,"" he said. ""No-one should shoot a child and not face justice - silence is not an option for anyone."" He added the man the gunman was chasing - convicted burglar Joseph Nee - was continuing to be treated in hospital. The new reward is the biggest single financial incentive offered in the history of Crimestoppers. The charity reiterated that it works independently of the police and does not trace computers or phones used to contact them. Lord Ashcroft said: ""This case has been incredibly shocking, not just for those who are directly affected, but also for Liverpool and the nation as a whole. ""A precious young life has been lost so we need every effort to find those involved in this appalling killing."" Olivia's funeralwas held on Thursday at a packed St Margaret Mary's Church, just streets away from where the shooting happened.

If you missed Match of the Day,you can catch up now on BBC iPlayer. Listen back to full match commentaries on BBC Sounds: Chelsea 2-2 Bournemouth Nottingham Forest 1-1 Liverpool Everton 0-1 Aston Villa Everton manager David Moyes, speaking to Match of the Day:""You can definitely see over the years that the financial situation has played its part on the pitch and that's the outcome. All the supporters are aware of that. ""There was very little in the game, they had a couple of chances which we were fortunate with. We needed a better control of the game, a better level of possession. We didn't deliver at set pieces and we had six or seven corners and a good chance at the end. The game was really tight, just a slight lax allowed them to score. ""Obviously it's been a bit of a whirlwind. Sean Dyche left a group of players that have great character and a great attitude, I'm really pleased to take over that. What I need to do is add quality and find a way of getting results but you can't change the whole thing around straight away. ""Tonight we were the same as Aston Villa. The one at the end [for Dominic Calvert-Lewin] was a chance and Jesper [Lindstrom] should've scored with his header as well but you need those moments to go for you."" On the need to strengthen in the transfer window:""I think it's really important if we can add some of that quality and give the players a little lift as well. The crowd were good but I can sense them saying 'we've seen a lot of this before, we need to see something else'."" Were you at the game or following from elsewhere?

A 1-1 draw at second-placedNottingham Foreston Tuesday came after a home draw withManchester Unitedin the Premier League, while last Wednesday they lost atTottenhamin the Carabao Cup. ""So are we in a crisis now?"" said the central defender. ""It only confirms the Premier League is a very tough league where you play against opponents who are very good. ""Every game is tough - we have to find a way to win. We have been outstanding the whole season with everything we have been doing. In games sometimes things doesn't always go your way, [but] that's part of being a football player. ""We can't be perfect all the time, but all the hard work we have put in so far should give us the confidence to go out there and show who we are."" Saturday brings another away test, againstBrentfordwho came from two goals down with 10 minutes to go to draw againstManchester Cityon Tuesday. ""They scored twice in the last 10 minutes so that is a great result for them,"" said Van Dijk. ""I think they have been very good at home, so it is always going to be a tough game there. ""We will prepare in the best way possible. We have to make sure we are fully fit and make sure we are ready to go there on Friday, first travelling down and then having a good sleep and preparing for a very tough game."" Everton need stability and the appointment of David Moyes will bring that. He understands the club and the fans and that is what is needed right now. Everton never used to be a club at the bottom end of the table, so that is what Moyes needs to change. I am not saying Everton will be competing for the top four next season, but they are underachieving for a club so rich in history. Most importantly, Moyes needs to bring entertaining football back. Sean Dyche did a good job at steadying them through their financial uncertainty and he tightened up their defence, but it was at the cost of entertainment. Fans want to see fast, attacking football and that is what Moyes delivered in his previous spell and during his time atWest Ham. As a manager, I feel Moyes has been overlooked for what he has achieved. He guided the Hammers to a European finish and then in the following season, he won the Conference League. So he does know how to get the best out of players and climb the table. The only thing I am surprised by is the length of his contract. I thought he would be more of a short-term answer for them than long term. Nedum Onuoha was speaking to BBC Sport's Katie Stafford This video can not be played  Everton are in another relegation battle this season in the Premier League but with new owners, a new manager and a new stadium, can they emulateNottingham Forestand challenge for Europe next season? Everton fans Ped McPartland and Les Roberts discuss this possibility on The Football News Show and explain why spending money wisely is the best way to achieve this. Watch The Football News Show on iPlayer Everton have failed to score in eight of their past 10 Premier League games. In this time, they have three goals (excluding own goals) from 119 shots and an expected goals total of 8.8. This video can not be played  Former Everton forward Theo Walcott says the pressure Dominic Calvert-Lewin ""puts on himself is at a different level"" to what he has seen in his career and in order to find his form again the striker ""just needs to relax more."" Following a string of injuries, the Toffees striker has struggled to find consistent form and been criticised for prolonged goal droughts. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club, Walcott said the England international puts so much pressure on himself because he feels that if he does not score then no one else will. It is a mindset Walcott believes Calvert-Lewin has to change. ""It has been too predictable at times,"" he said about Everton's attack. ""It is about energy and pace - and recently they have been quite boring going forward. ""They are ranked seventh in the league for goals conceded so they are fine there but they need to find different ways of scoring. ""It is all about confidence. I have seen Dominic Calvert-Lewin in training and he just needs to relax more. He has put a lot of pressure on himself to be the main man but he shouldn't think of himself like that as it is about the team. ""The pressure he puts on himself is at a different level to what I have ever seen."" Listen to the Monday Night Club on BBC Sounds Josh SextonFan writer Liverpool's draw atNottingham Foresthad all the hallmarks of two teams at the top of their game, playing out a six-pointer at the top of the table. Make no mistake, Nuno Espirito Santo's team are a serious contender for a Champions League position based on the evidence they provided on Tuesday. The crowd was right up for it and created the noise that allowed their team to take an early lead and really trouble their opponents in several spells throughout the game. Arne Slot's team started well, but were too easily picked apart for the goal and there are definitely some concerns in the manner in which the Reds are both starting games and being cut apart by any opponent worth their salt over the past few weeks. They will need to ensure they send out another statement when they visitBrentford,in order to further cement their position as the league leaders. Liverpool have given themselves leeway to drop points against teams either  in-form teams with belief, like Forest andManchester United.However, they cannot afford to rest on their laurels and think the competition is out of sight. It would be nice to see the Reds strengthen in January to bring a little more solidity at the back, but there is still a genuine belief they can rediscover their early season form and deliver all of our wildest dreams in May. Find more from Josh Sexton atThe Anfield Wrap,external The second David Moyes era at Everton gets under way when they faceAston Villaat Goodison Park on Wednesday night - and he faces a mammoth task to revive this fallen giant of English football. Moyes has made a good impression on his return with ambitious talk about the brighter future and ""elite"" signings under new American owners, The Friedkin Group. All this will have to wait, however, following the sacking of Sean Dyche with Everton standing one point off the relegation places, just as they did when Moyes started his first spell in March 2002. Understandably, Moyes has made Premier League safety his priority but he must find a way to somehow revitalise a struggling side that has only three wins and 15 goals from 19 games. Fan reaction to Moyes' return has not been unanimously in favour, some regarding it as a retrograde step and an ultra-safe appointment, but many more accept this may just be exactly what Everton need in their current predicament. Dropping out of the Premier League is close to unthinkable with Everton moving into a new stadium at Bramley Moore Dock for the start of next season. Moyes is vastly experienced, comes after being successful from West Ham United and is finely attuned to the very least of what Everton supporters expect. He will not have too many concerns about Everton at the back, with an outstanding goalkeeper in Jordan Pickford and two solid central defenders in James Tarkowski and Jarrad Branthwaite. The very obvious problem is further forward, where he must somehow get main striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin firing again. Moyes has also made the very pertinent point that players who have seen off previous Everton managers on a regular basis must actually now take responsibility themselves, starting against Villa. The 61-year-old Scot is fully aware of Everton's problems - how quickly he can fix them will shape their immediate future. This video can not be played  ""When David Moyes was with us, we had an identity and we knew what Everton was about,"" said Warren Doyle from The Blue Room podcast on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club. Reflecting on how the Scotsman's return has been received by fans, Doyle said: ""For years we have struggled to find an identity again. One minute we are hiring managers who wants to play expansive football and then we bring in Sean Dyche and we are left with a mix of players who all different managers have signed. ""It's been a real mish-mash of a squad over the years. ""Moyes built a clear pathway to what Everton were about and it was great going to games knowing the team were going to be competitive. That can't really be said for the last few years. ""The supporters know there are limitations and expectations we can't quite reach at the moment but Moyes has given us that in the past and that is probably why there is a warm feeling around his re-appointment. ""Fans hope he can try and give us some of that back."" Listen to the full discussion on BBC Sounds Pat NevinFormer footballer and presenter Sean Dyche and Julen Lopetegui losing their jobs maybe weren't great surprises, even if the former Everton manager had personally saved the club last season and Lopetegui scarcely had enough time to stamp his authority atWest Ham. It is all because of the fear that grips clubs when the owners, and indeed the fans, start looking down instead of up in the Premier League. Like David Moyes, who was dismissed by West Ham only to be lured back by his old club to get them out of another fine mess, Dyche will soon be wanted again by clubs finding themselves in trouble. I am not sure if there has been a recent manager who has been more harshly undervalued for his efforts.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Putin announces a partial military mobilisation in Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin is calling up thousands of extra troops to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks on the battlefield. Mr Putin said the partial mobilisation was necessary to ensure Russian territorial integrity. Protests broke out in Russia following the announcement, with more than 750 people arrested, according to a Russian human rights organisation, OVD-info. The announcement applies to 300,000 military reservists. They make up a fraction of the about 25 million Russian reservists - people who have done their compulsory military service. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it showed Mr Putin wanted to drown Ukraine in blood - including that of his own soldiers. The mobilisation is the first since World War Two and comes after Ukraine made gains in a rapid counter-offensive this month, putting the Kremlin on the back foot. Ukrainian forces have recaptured key towns and villages in the northern Kharkiv region and have made a slower, but still significant progress in the southern Kherson region. Russia, however, still holds about a fifth of the country. The decree is short on detail. It says nothing about a cap on numbers or about any exceptions, such as not recruiting students or conscripts. Instead, it is left to regional heads to decide how to meet quotas. In theory, the net could be cast far wider than the Kremlin has specified. Russian officials said it would announce ""very soon"" those who would be exempt from its partial mobilisation. The call-up stops short of full conscription, a move that would have risked turning a public that has so far largely been in favour of the conflict against it. In his televised address, Mr Putin also issued a thinly veiled threat he could use nuclear weapons. He said the West was engaging in ""nuclear blackmail"" and that Moscow had ""lots of weapons to reply"". ""When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people. It's not a bluff,"" he said. US President Joe Biden slammed Mr Putin's actions and said ""A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""shamelessly violated"" the core tenets of being a member of the UN, he added. ANALYSIS:Steve Rosenberg: Putin raises stakes in deadly game EXPLAINER:How many nuclear weapons does Russia have? Mr Putin's announcement of a partial mobilisation drew immediate condemnation from Ukraine's allies. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the mobilisation ""a sign of panic"" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called it ""an act of desperation"". Mr Putin's address has raised fears that some men of fighting age would not be allowed to leave Russia, even though Russia's Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu said the call-up would be limited to those with combat experience. One Russian man told the BBC that the move means ""nothing guarantees that martial law won't be declared at some point in the future. And then it'll be really impossible for anyone to do anything at all"". There has also been a strong reaction on social media. One Twitter user wrote: ""I'm not going to go to war, go screw yourselves. Not only will I surrender right away, I'll also show you the way to the Kremlin."" Video shared on social media has shown protests in several places, including the capital Moscow. Signs of public dissent have become increasingly rare in Russia. The conflict in Ukraine is still referred to as a ""special military operation"" in Russian state media, with the word ""war"" banned. Flights out of Russia sold out fast following the announcement. Direct flights from Moscow to Istanbul in Turkey and Yerevan in Armenia, appear to have sold out for the next few days. Both destinations allow Russians to enter without a visa. However it is not possible to confirm when these flights were sold. What does Russia's troop call-up mean for Ukraine?

"Tax cuts, due to be announced on Friday, are likely to push UK borrowing and debt to unsustainable levels, a leading economic think tank has warned. The UK will spend billions helping households and firms with energy bills, but tax cuts will have a longer-term impact on public finances, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Even after that support ends, the UK will borrow Â£100bn a year, it says. Tax cuts amounted to a ""gamble"" that may not pay off, the IFS warned. In Friday's mini-budget the government is expected to reverse a rise in National Insurance and scrap a planned increase in corporation tax, which could cost Â£30bn. The Treasury has refused to publisha forecast of the UK's economic outlook alongside this Friday's mini-Budget. The IFS said it was publishing its own research, setting out ""how much red ink"" would be added to the country's financial position as a result of the strategy led by new prime minister Liz Truss. Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer? Firms' energy bills to be cut by half this winter Carl Emmerson, deputy director at the IFS and an author of the research, said the government's tax cutting plans meant borrowing would remain high, even after the cost of subsidising energy bills had fallen away, adding to overall debt. ""While we would get to enjoy lower taxes now, ever-increasing debt would eventually prove unsustainable,"" Mr Emmerson said. ""The government is choosing to ramp up borrowing just as it becomes more expensive to do so, in a gamble on growth that may not pay off."" The sums indicated by the IFS are staggering. No doubt the government will argue they do not take into account their growth plans, but the government rejected the OBR offer to bring out an official forecast. Hundreds of billions extra in borrowing seems a reasonable indication of the cost of the energy rescue packages, the economic shocks and then permanent planned tax cuts. An increase of this scale has not occurred in recent memory, without at the same time, the Bank of England in the market buying up government debts. The government's own recently legislated rules for limiting borrowing would also be broken, if these forecasts are right. While some of this is down to the spending on energy, much is down to the forecast increase in borrowing from permanent tax cuts. There appears to be a clear break occurring in tax and spending policy. An official forecast would have revealed this change clearly. The reality will come soon enough. The new prime minister has outlined her plans for the economy, arguing that cutting taxes will ""boost business-led growth and investment"". The pace of growth that would be required to keep national debt at sustainable levels was not impossible but would require ""a great deal of luck over a long period or a concerted change in policy direction,"" Mr Emmerson said. The government has said it wants the economy to grow by 2.5% a year on average. The IFS said finding a way to boost the UK's rate of economic growth would ""undoubtedly help"", but said the government should not underestimate the scale of that challenge. Borrowing of nearly Â£100bn a year is significantly higher than previously forecast. In March, borrowing was predicted to be Â£50bn next year and well below Â£40bn by the mid-2020s. The Â£100bn figure is equivalent to around 3.5% of national income, which is high in historical terms. In the 60 years before the financial crisis, borrowing averaged 1.9% of national income, the IFS said.âThe fluctuating wholesale price of energy means the cost of government subsidies for households, public bodies and private firms, is hard to estimate. However the think tank calculates the planned tax cuts would leave government revenues around Â£30bn lower than they would have been. Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer?

"The number of candy shops on Oxford Street has been steadily rising Sweet shops on Oxford Street are set to face stricter rules after Westminster City Council revealed plans to tackle those it believes are not paying tax. An investigation into 30 American-themed storesis already under way for alleged business rate evasion of Â£7.9m. Westminster claims it is waging a war. Council leader Adam Hug said: ""The people selling overpriced and often out-of-date sweets are cheating the UK taxpayer and very often swindling their customers into the bargain."" Concerns that shops are being used as hub for ""dirty money"" come as areport from the Centre for Public Data,externalfound the Westminster area had seen a 1,200% rise in the number of property owners registered to Russia and a 300% rise in owners registered in Jersey, since 2010. Measures proposed include increasing the fee to register a company at Companies House from Â£12 to Â£50, introducing more rigorous identity checks and tightening UK procurement laws to restrict the artificial use of tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions. Councillor Hug added: ""Westminster's dirty secret has been known for many years but those in power looked the other way for too long as money of questionable origin flooding into London and investors took advantage of our relatively lax laws."" ""We want to work with government ministers and agencies to crack down on dirty money and ensure agencies like HMRC and the National Crime Agency are properly resourced."" Mountains of counterfeit chocolate bars have been seized previously He added that not only do the stores ""diminish the status of Westminster as a place to do business"" but, by occupying the whole building, they reduce the housing supply for residents. ""We are proud of the diverse resident population of Westminster,"" said the Labour politician ""but this data suggests something troubling, that the use of Westminster as a location to hide ill-gotten gains in the property market is spiralling out of control"". ""With the cost-of-living crisis impacting the most vulnerable in our society, it is only right that the council takes the lead in the promotion of exemplary tax conduct and supports those businesses who pay their fair share of tax - contributing to the vital funding front-line services need."" Tax probe into Oxford Street US sweet shops 'Knock-off' chocolate seized in Oxford Street raids The council also wants to sign up to the Fair Tax Mark, a scheme that encourages businesses to pay the right amount of tax at the right time and place. By Tim Donovan, political editor, BBC London It's not often you get a London council feeling it can step up and address a global issue. But the City of Westminster is no ordinary place. It's where you find some of the most expensive property in the world - a good deal of it empty - and much of it where ownership is not clear. How much does that secrecy matter? The new Labour administration believes it's a basic: there could and should be more money coming into the public coffers. Through its ""fair tax measures"", it is saying it wants to target ""dirty money"" ie the sumptuous riverside apartments built and bought effectively as a gold deposit box. Let's see whether it proves more than a gesture. The test will be how far it can generate pressure for government to do more closing of loopholes. It also wants to ensure contractors pay their fair share and refuse to go along with offshore tax-dodging when buying land and property. The council said it also wanted to boost transparency and urge the government to quickly deliver a second Economic Crime Bill, reforming Companies House practices and making UK procurement stricter.

"Donald Trump and three of his children are hit by a fraud lawsuit following a three-year investigation into the family's business practices New York Attorney General Letitia James filed the lawsuit against the Trump Organization at a state court on Wednesday Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump are named as defendants and are accused of ""numerous acts of fraud and misrepresentation"" The lawsuit is seeking around $250m (Â£220m) from the former president and his three eldest children A lawyer for Mr Trump says ""absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place"" and accuses New York officials of ""unchecked abuse of authority"" Edited by Gareth Evans We're closing our live coverage of the lawsuit announced against former President Donald Trump and his three eldest children. To recap, here's what happened:  For the latest developments,read our story here. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York Today, New York's attorney general filed a civil lawsuit. But at her press conference, she also announced that she would pass her findings to other powerful law enforcement officials including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Justice. They could carry out potential criminal investigations. Miriam Baer, vice-dean at Brooklyn Law School, called this one of the more notable developments from todayâs press conference. âThe New York attorney general went one step further today,â Baer told the BBC. âIt announced that in addition to filing this civil complaint, it was also making a referral to federal law enforcement authorities for a criminal investigation.â âThis sends an additionally ominous signal, as the Department of Justiceâs Tax Division and the United States Attorneyâs Office for the Southern District of New York will now consider whether a criminal investigation is warranted,â Baer said. This development could open up additional fronts in Trumpâs multi-pronged legal war against both federal and state officials. In addition to the $250m (Â£220m) that New York's attorney general is seeking, today's announcement could have far-reaching implications for Donald Trump, his family members and their business dealings. For one, Attorney General Letitia James said her office is hoping that a court permanently bars Donald Trump - as well as Donald Trump Jr, Eric and Ivanka - from serving as an officer or director in any corporation or business entity in the entire state of New York. Additionally, Trump - and the entire Trump Organization - would be unable to acquire any commercial property in the state for the next five years, and would be barred from applying for loans from any institution registered with the state's Department of Financial Services. As one of the trustees of the Donald Trump Revocable Trust - which controls the former president's business interests - Donald Trump Jr would also be replaced with an independent trustee if the entity is replaced with a new trust. A judge would have to rule on all these measures before they come into effect. Donald Trump and sons Donald Trump Jr (centre) and Eric at an event on 31 July Mike WendlingReporting from Chicago At nearly 100 stories tall, the Trump International Hotel and Tower
in Chicago is the cityâs second-tallest building. Its shiny, stacked-box design and all-caps
TRUMP logo stands out even among the huge towers that line the Chicago River. But according to the New York lawsuit, Trump declared this luxury building
â stuffed with apartments, hotel rooms and restaurants â âworthlessâ. The lawsuit alleges the claim would help offset federal taxes.
At the same time, however, the former president was obtaining loans against the
tower from Deutsche Bank. The massive German financial institution loaned billions to
Trump over decades despite the ex-presidentâs defaults and lawsuits against the bank. Deutsche Bank vowed to stop lending Trump money shortly after
the 6 January riot at the US Capitol. Government lawyers say Trump has obtained tens of millions of
dollars of loans on the Trump Chicago building since 2011. The lawsuit alleges that Trump and his organisation misrepresented their financial position in
order to obtain favourable terms, not only on loans against the Chicago tower but
on property around the world. The 222-page lawsuit against Donald Trump and his three eldest children lists a number of properties that New York officials say were grossly misrepresented as part of the alleged fraud. Here are a few of the most well-known: Prosecutors alleged that the value of an apartment Trump had in Trump Tower in New York was listed at $327m after its ""wildly overstated"" size was tripled and given an ""unreasonable"" price per square foot. The record sale in the entire tower was $16.5m The Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was valued as high as $739m - although the attorney general's office alleges the real value was closer to $75m and that it generated less than $25m per year Prosecutors say Trump's golf course in Aberdeen, Scotland was valued at $327m based on the assumption that 2,500 homes could be developed there - 1,000 more than had been approved by local authorities A 2020 appraisal of Trump Park Avenue in New York valued it at $84.5m - but it was allegedly listed as $135.8m on a company statement that same year A commercial property at 40 Wall Street in New York was valued at $220m in a November 2012 appraisal. The same year, it was listed as being worth $527m in a company statement - a figure which rose to $530m the following year Even before she took office as New York's attorney general, Letitia James has had Donald Trump in her sights. On the night she was elected, the former New York City councilwoman from Brooklyn took aim at Trump. âHe should know that we here in New York - and I, in particular - we are not scared of you,â she said after her win in 2018. âAnd as the next attorney general of his home state, I will be shining a bright light into every dark corner of his real estate dealings, and every dealing, demanding truthfulness at every turn.â James has made good on her promise, officially launching a civil investigation into Trump and his family business in 2019. Trump, in turn, has responded with his customary name-calling, accusing ""Letitia Peekaboo James"" of a politically-motivated campaign against him. He's called James, who is black, a ""racist"" and a ""failed"" attorney general with bad poll numbers. On Wednesday, James appeared to shrug off the insults, saying they had no bearing on her investigation or the potential outcome in court. For those of you just joining us, here's the latest: The taxpayers of New York are paying for the attorney generalâs
investigation and other legal costs. Legal experts say these costs could eventually be charged to Trump as part of a settlement, or as part of a judge's order. But a large chunk of Trumpâs legal bills have so far been footed by the Republican National Committee. The RNC paid almost $2m (Â£1.76m) in legal fees to law firms representing the former president between October 2021 and July of this year, according to Federal Election
Commission (FEC) records. This could, however, end if Trump
decides to run for president again in 2024. RNC officials, quoted in various US media reports, say the payments would stop because the party has a
""neutrality policy"" that prohibits it from taking sides in the
presidential primary. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York Should he declare another run for president in 2024, Donald Trump would be running under the shadow of a fraud lawsuit that could ultimately be âruinousâ for his real estate business, Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who handled a fraud case against Trump University, tells the BBC. He would enter the campaign as the undisputed frontrunner of the Republican pack, but his legal jeopardy opens up lines of attack that a potential challenger could exploit. Snell says Trump and the Trump Organization may seek to settle, rather than go to a full trial, in an effort to deal with at least one of the multiple legal battles he faces. âFrom Trumpâs perspective, itâs better to rip off the Band-Aid and get it over with and out of the way ahead of any run that could happen next year,â he says. Mike WendlingDisinformation reporter Subscribers to a pro-Trump channel on Telegram react to a clip of the New York attorney general's announcement Donald Trump and some of his most staunch supporters reacted
with predictable fury against todayâs lawsuit, but for others the news was a bit ""meh"". On his Truth Social network, which has become Trumpâs main
megaphone following his removal from mainstream social networking platforms,
the ex-president railed against a âWitch Hunt by a racist Attorney Generalâ. On other outlets, including pro-Trump channels on the Telegram chat
app, users repeated Trumpâs main themes - angrily accusing New York
Attorney General Letitia James of ignoring violent crime and
driving businesses out of the state. âWhy doesnât James stop harassing President Trump?â one
supporter tweeted. Trumpâs sons also accused the attorney general of being
politically biased. At the same time, other big supporter accounts and pro-Trump
media outlets, perhaps wearied by yet another legal fracas involving the former
president, seemed to barely notice the news. On alternative social network Gab, populated mostly by fringe
and far-right characters, the most popular posts railed against immigration and
Covid vaccines, with little mention of the fraud case. As well as this civil investigation, there's also an active criminal investigation into the Trump Organization based out of New York. For months, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has been looking into whether Donald Trump or the Trump family business purposely inflated the value of the company's assets to potential lenders. In the last few moments, Bragg released a statement saying this investigation was ""active and ongoing"". It has already yielded criminal charges against the Trump Organization and its former Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg - who was also named by Letitia James today. Last month, Weisselberg pleaded guilty to 15 feloniesand admitted he had conspired with the company to avoid paying taxes. As part of a plea deal, Weissleberg must testify at the company's criminal trial if asked by prosecutors. Nada TawfikReporting from New York Remember the name Michael Cohen? This lawsuit can be traced back to President Trumpâs former lawyer and his dramatic testimony to Congress in 2019. He described the former president as a âcon-manâ who repeatedly exaggerated his wealth in financial documents to receive favourable loans from banks and insurance coverage. That caught the attention of New York stateâs Attorney General Letitia James, who said today that her investigation started only after Cohen had shed light on the alleged misconduct. Former President Trump fought her at every turn through the courts, insisting this was a witch-hunt by James, a Democrat. But his attempts to ignore her subpoenas and to block her investigation altogether were unsuccessful. When he sat for a four-hour, court ordered, deposition earlier this year he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 400 times. While that canât be held against Trump in a criminal trial, it very much can be in a civil one. Perhaps seeing the writing on the wall, his legal team tried to settle but were rebuffed. He has a long legal battle ahead and must now also worry whether this will turn into criminal charges. The lawsuit is long (more than 200 pages) and the result of a three-year investigation. Here's a look at what it alleges:  âThis conduct cannot be brushed aside and dismissed as some sort of good-faith mistake,â James said on Wednesday. âThe statements of financial condition were greatly exaggerated, grossly inflated, objectively false, and therefore fraudulent and illegal."" Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Donald Trump Jr - the former president's eldest son - has responded to the lawsuit on Twitter, saying Letitia James is ""weaponising her office"" to attack political opponents. ""This is all about politics,"" he wrote - echoing a statement made by his father's lawyer just moments ago. Donald Jr and two of his siblings, Eric and Ivanka, are defendants in the suit. They are accused of helping their father inflate his net worth by billions of dollars. Attorney General Letitia James was earlier asked whether she would be willing to settle the case with Donald Trump and his children out of court. ""I will not negotiate in public,"" she said, noting recent coverage saying her office had rejected settlement offers from Trump lawyers in recent days. ""Our doors are always open,"" she added. Kayla EpsteinReporting from New York The decision to move ahead with a fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children raises the political stakes for the former president. That's because this is one of several ongoing investigations into Trump. These range from his businesses, his efforts to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election, to his handling of classified government documents. Several of these have heated up in the last few weeks. The advancement of another major investigation into Trump gives his Democratic rivals more fodder as the midterm elections on 8 November loom ever nearer. While Trump is not on the ballot, Democrats have sought to tie Republican candidates to the former president, his policies and his alleged conduct. He has spun the multiple investigations as a partisan witch hunt, and has portrayed himself and his supporters as victims of political persecution. Trump, meanwhile, continues to hold rallies across the country and has not ruled out a run for president in 2024.  This video can not be played New York Attorney General announces lawsuit against Donald Trump Former President Donald Trump has responded to the lawsuit, calling it politically motivated. âTodayâs filing is neither focused on the facts nor the law,â he said in a statement through his lawyer Alina Habba. âIt is abundantly clear that the Attorney Generalâs Office has exceeded its statutory authority by prying into transactions where absolutely no wrongdoing has taken place,â it read. Trump and Attorney General James have repeatedly sparred over the past year, while her office conducted an investigation into his family's business affairs. The sweeping lawsuit
against Donald Trump and three of his adult children â Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric â alleges that they lied to lenders and insurers
for more than a decade in order to enrich themselves. In
the more than 200-page lawsuit, James alleges that the defendants ârepeatedly and
consistentlyâ manipulated the value of their assets to receive favourable loans
and lower tax rates. The
âastoundingâ fraud scheme, she said, helped Trump pad his bank account by at
least $250m (Â£220m). James,
a Democrat, is asking the court for these funds to be returned. She is also seeking to permanently
bar Trump, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric from serving
as the director of a business registered anywhere in New York state. She is also seeking
to cancel the Trump Organizationâs corporate certificate. If this motion is
granted by a judge, it could effectively force the company to cease operations
in the state. The attorney general of New York, Letitia James, has filed a fraud lawsuit against Donald Trump and three of his children. It is seeking around $250m (Â£220m) from the defendants. James said the former president's family business, the Trump Organization, had repeatedly used false statements to get banks to lend them money on favourable terms. ""[He] falsely inflated net worth by billions of dollars,"" she said in a press conference earlier. Trump has denied wrongdoing.

"This video can not be played Jeremey Vine: Stalker's YouTube was ""a fountain of hate"" Broadcaster Jeremy Vine has hit out at social media firms as he said his stalker had put out a video promising to be back. Alex Belfield wassentenced to five and a half yearslast week, after being found guilty of stalking four people. He posted videos and messages online about his victims and encouraged his followers to target them. Vine told BBC Two's Newsnight social media firms ""don't care"" about hosting such material, leaving him ""broken"". The BBC Radio 2 presenter, 57, said Belfield - a 42-year-old former BBC local radio presenter - had taken him to a ""really unhealthy place"" and described his YouTube channel as a ""fountain of hate"". He said: ""I was afraid of what he could do to my family. I was afraid because you have to think around corners with this stuff. ""And, you know, we've seen knife attacks on MPs, MPs being killed, people who are prominent being attacked. So I'm not trying to give myself undue status here, but I had to think this through."" Asked about the behaviour of social media giants YouTube and Twitter during the ordeal, Vine said he had been ""amazed"" how difficult it was to get YouTube to take action. ""They take down individual videos and then when he's convicted, they demonetised him. But half the videos about me are still out there,"" he said. Because Belfield told his viewers to copy and share the videos, they will ""always be out there"", Vine said, adding ""I've got to live with that"". ""But the fact that YouTube hosts this stuff, they have no responsibility. They don't care,"" the journalist said. He said he was ""disgusted by their lack of values"" and also criticised Twitter as he said Belfield still possessed an account despite being in prison. Vine said Belfield had put out a video saying he was going to be back up and running. He added while there were now restraining orders in eight people's cases he thought the one thing you could do was ""deprive people of their platform"". Alex Belfield has been jailed for five-and-a-half years for stalking four people The sentencing judge, Mr Justice Saini, told Belfield one of his victims had been ""seconds away from taking his own life as a result of your conduct"". Vine told Newsnight he thought if the courts had not stopped Belfield ""somebody would have died"". He said he feared that at some point one of the 400,000 people watching Belfield's videos was ""going to take a knife or acid to my home"". ""The danger came from the online traffic, not from the individual,"" he said, adding Belfield wanted to ""create so much hatred against me that someone acted by proxy"". Vine said he had to take it seriously as Belfield had put his home address out. ""I've got two teenage daughters, you know, I can't be casual about it. So at that point I was scared for them,"" he said. While Belfield never physically approached him, Vine said his actions had been worse than when he had had a physical stalker. ""That was a picnic compared to this, because what happened in this case is that you were fired on from all directions. Every time you open your phone he's there,"" he said. According to YouTube, following a review several videos have been removed from Belfield's ""Voice of Reason"" channel for violating its policies. A YouTube spokesperson said: ""Monetisation on the Voice of Reason channel remains suspended for violating our creator responsibility policy. ""Our community guidelines prohibit content that threatens individuals and we have removed several videos for violating these policies."" Twitter declined to comment.

"The number of candy shops on Oxford Street has been steadily rising Sweet shops on Oxford Street are set to face stricter rules after Westminster City Council revealed plans to tackle those it believes are not paying tax. An investigation into 30 American-themed storesis already under way for alleged business rate evasion of Â£7.9m. Westminster claims it is waging a war. Council leader Adam Hug said: ""The people selling overpriced and often out-of-date sweets are cheating the UK taxpayer and very often swindling their customers into the bargain."" Concerns that shops are being used as hub for ""dirty money"" come as areport from the Centre for Public Data,externalfound the Westminster area had seen a 1,200% rise in the number of property owners registered to Russia and a 300% rise in owners registered in Jersey, since 2010. Measures proposed include increasing the fee to register a company at Companies House from Â£12 to Â£50, introducing more rigorous identity checks and tightening UK procurement laws to restrict the artificial use of tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions. Councillor Hug added: ""Westminster's dirty secret has been known for many years but those in power looked the other way for too long as money of questionable origin flooding into London and investors took advantage of our relatively lax laws."" ""We want to work with government ministers and agencies to crack down on dirty money and ensure agencies like HMRC and the National Crime Agency are properly resourced."" Mountains of counterfeit chocolate bars have been seized previously He added that not only do the stores ""diminish the status of Westminster as a place to do business"" but, by occupying the whole building, they reduce the housing supply for residents. ""We are proud of the diverse resident population of Westminster,"" said the Labour politician ""but this data suggests something troubling, that the use of Westminster as a location to hide ill-gotten gains in the property market is spiralling out of control"". ""With the cost-of-living crisis impacting the most vulnerable in our society, it is only right that the council takes the lead in the promotion of exemplary tax conduct and supports those businesses who pay their fair share of tax - contributing to the vital funding front-line services need."" Tax probe into Oxford Street US sweet shops 'Knock-off' chocolate seized in Oxford Street raids The council also wants to sign up to the Fair Tax Mark, a scheme that encourages businesses to pay the right amount of tax at the right time and place. By Tim Donovan, political editor, BBC London It's not often you get a London council feeling it can step up and address a global issue. But the City of Westminster is no ordinary place. It's where you find some of the most expensive property in the world - a good deal of it empty - and much of it where ownership is not clear. How much does that secrecy matter? The new Labour administration believes it's a basic: there could and should be more money coming into the public coffers. Through its ""fair tax measures"", it is saying it wants to target ""dirty money"" ie the sumptuous riverside apartments built and bought effectively as a gold deposit box. Let's see whether it proves more than a gesture. The test will be how far it can generate pressure for government to do more closing of loopholes. It also wants to ensure contractors pay their fair share and refuse to go along with offshore tax-dodging when buying land and property. The council said it also wanted to boost transparency and urge the government to quickly deliver a second Economic Crime Bill, reforming Companies House practices and making UK procurement stricter.

"Germany is to nationalise gas giant Uniper in an effort to secure energy supplies amid the war in Ukraine. The deal will see the German government take on a 98.5% stake in the firm at a cost of â¬8.5bn (Â£7.4bn). Germany is Europe's biggest importer of Russian gas, and has been particularly squeezed as Russia has reduced supplies in recent months. Chief executive Klaus-Dieter Maubach said the deal would help Uniper's role as ""a system-critical energy supplier"". Before Russia invaded Ukraine it supplied Europe with about 40% of its natural gas, and it has responded to Western sanctions by gradually cutting off supplies. At the start of this month, Russia halted supplies through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, claiming repairs were needed - but later said flow would not resume until sanctions were lifted. Uniper, which operates gas, coal, and hydro plants across Europe and is currently controlled by Finnish state-owned energy company Fortum, is the biggest buyer of Russian gas in Germany. In recent months it has had to replace Russian supplies with alternatives from the open market, where prices have soared. Fortum said Uniper had accumulated close to â¬8.5bn (Â£7.4bn) in gas-related losses ""and cannot continue to fulfil its role as a critical provider of security of supply as a privately-owned company"". ""The role of gas in Europe has fundamentally changed since Russia attacked Ukraine, and so has the outlook for a gas-heavy portfolio,"" Fortum chief executive Markus Rauramo said in a statement. ""As a result, the business case for an integrated group is no longer viable."" The price of shares in Uniper, which also owns the coal-fired Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire, has fallen by more than 90% in the past year. Germany to limit heating and lighting this winter How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe How can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Under the terms of the deal, the German government will buy Fortum's shares in Uniper for â¬500m (Â£437m) and inject â¬8bn (Â£7bn) of cash into the business. Some assets in Russia will also come under Germany's control, a government spokesperson said, adding that it was still being decided what would be done with them. The government had already agreed to take on a 30% stake of Uniper as part of a bailout agreement in July. Earlier this month, it also entered discussions with another major gas supplier, VNG, over a possible bailout package. Economy minister Robert Habeck said nationalising Uniper was a ""necessary"" step that would help ""ensure security of supply for Germany"". He also said that, despite the loss of Russian supplies, Germany had succeeded in filling its gas storage facilities to over 90% capacity ahead of winter. ""This means that, as a whole, we have coped quite well with the situation,"" he said. ""But for Uniper the situation became significantly more dramatic and significantly worse."" Agas surcharge of 2.4 euro cents per kilowatt hour is also set to come into effect on October 1and remain in place until April 2024. Mr Habeck said the levy on consumers would make sure the country's energy providers remained viable. ""The state willâ¦ do everything necessary to keep companies stable on the market at all times,"" he said. At the start of September, Germany introduced aseries of measuresintended to cut energy use and stave off shortages over the coming months. Businesses are no longer allowed to keep their doors open throughout the day to reduce the need for heating, and illuminated advertising must be switched off after 10pm. The halls and corridors of most public buildings will no longer be heated, and offices can only be heated to a maximum of 19C. In July, energy ministers across Europe also agreed to reduce their natural gas consumption by 15%.

"This video can not be played New York attorney general Letitia James wants the Trumps to repay $250m that she says was illegally obtained Donald Trump and three of his children have been hit with a fraud lawsuit after a New York investigation into their family company - the Trump Organization. It alleges that they lied ""by billions"" about the value of real estate in order to get loans and pay less tax. Prosecutors say the Trump Organization committed numerous acts of fraud between 2011-21. Mr Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as ""another witch hunt"". The former president's eldest children, Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric Trump, were also named as defendants alongside two executives at the Trump Organization, Allen Weisselberg and Jeffrey McConney. The lawsuit has been brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is the state's most senior lawyer, after a three-year civil investigation. Her office does not have the power to file criminal charges, but is referring allegations of criminal wrongdoing to federal prosecutors and to the Internal Revenue Service. ""With the help of his children and senior executives at the Trump Organization, Donald Trump falsely inflated his net worth by billions of dollars to unjustly enrich himself and cheat the system,"" Ms James said in a statement. She said Mr Trump's own apartment in Trump Tower, which was valued at $327m (Â£288m), was among the properties whose values were allegedly misrepresented. ""No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount,"" Ms James added. Here's a look at what the 222-page document alleges: Donald Trump and three of his children lied about the value of his properties - hotels, golf courses and other assets - in order to secure better loans and lower tax rates Over the course of a decade, Trump and his family made more than 200 false or misleading valuations on financial statements The potential value of development on some estates was overstated, and used to gain higher tax benefits for forfeiting development in favour of conservation Each statement was personally certified as accurate by Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr, or former Trump Organization financial executive Allen Weisselberg The scheme enriched the Trump family by at least $250m (Â£220m) - the state wants to recover that money ""White collar financial crime is not a victimless crime,"" the attorney general said. ""When the well-connected break the law to take in more money than they are entitled to, it reduces resources available to working people, to regular people, to small businesses and to all tax payers."" Ms James is asking a court to bar the former president and his children from serving as officers or directors in any New York business. She also wants the Trump Organization banned from engaging in real estate transactions there for five years. The announcement comes after Ms James - a Democrat who is running for re-election in November - rejected at least one offer to settle the long-running civil investigation into the company's business practices. Blasting the lawsuit on his Truth Social site, Mr Trump branded Ms James, who is black, a racist. ""Another Witch Hunt by a racist Attorney General, Letitia James, who failed in her run for Governor, getting almost zero support from the public,"" he wrote. The Trumps have previously accused Ms James of pursuing a political vendetta, citing remarks she made before being elected as attorney general in 2018 in which she vowed to sue Mr Trump and branded him an ""illegitimate president"". Donald Trump Jr, Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump are named as defendants in the lawsuit On Twitter, Donald Trump Jr accused Ms James of ""weaponising her office to go after her political opponents"". While Mr Trump is not on the ballot in November's midterm elections, he remains the dominant force in the Republican Party - and is stoking speculation about another run for the White House in 2024. In August Mr Trump declined to answer questions during an interview at the attorney general's office connected to this civil investigation. Ms James said he repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to not self-incriminate, confirming only his name. Ms James said that Eric Trump did the same more than 500 times in a 2020 deposition. Tristan Snell, a lawyer and former prosecutor who worked on a separate case against Trump University, told the BBC that the lawsuit could take a year to go to trial. But the potential of such a trial could severely restrict Mr Trump's ability to do business in New York and profit from his marquee real estate holdings in New York City. It could trigger a series of financial consequences that would make it harder for him to raise capital and maintain credit, Snell said. ""It definitely could be ruinous for him,"" Snell said. The lawsuit lists some of the most well-known Trump properties: Prosecutors allege that the value of an apartment Trump had in Trump Tower in New York was listed at $327m after its ""wildly overstated"" size was tripled and given an ""unreasonable"" price per square foot. The record sale in the entire tower was $16.5m. The Mar-a-Lago club in Florida was valued as high as $739m by the Trump Organization. The attorney general's office alleges the real value was closer to $75m and that it generated less than $25m per year. Ms James's announcement that she would pass the findings of her investigation to other law enforcement agencies was ""an ominous signal"" for Mr Trump, according to Miriam Baer, vice-dean at Brooklyn Law School. ""The New York attorney general went one step further today,"" she told the BBC. ""It announced that in addition to filing this civil complaint, it was also making a referral to federal law enforcement authorities for a criminal investigation."" The lawsuit is one of a number of legal issues the former president is facing. On 8 August, the FBI conducted a search warrant at his home in Mar-a-Lago as part of an investigation into his handling of classified records. Federal investigators were then ordered by another judge to freeze their probe while a court-appointed official decides if any of the records should be private. But on Wednesday a federal appeals court ruled that the justice department can resume reviewing the classified documents. The decision reactivates the inquiry into whether Mr Trump withheld US national secrets after leaving office. He is also being investigated in Georgia in relation to efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. He has denied any wrongdoing in both those investigations.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Putin announces a partial military mobilisation in Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin is calling up thousands of extra troops to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks on the battlefield. Mr Putin said the partial mobilisation was necessary to ensure Russian territorial integrity. Protests broke out in Russia following the announcement, with more than 750 people arrested, according to a Russian human rights organisation, OVD-info. The announcement applies to 300,000 military reservists. They make up a fraction of the about 25 million Russian reservists - people who have done their compulsory military service. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it showed Mr Putin wanted to drown Ukraine in blood - including that of his own soldiers. The mobilisation is the first since World War Two and comes after Ukraine made gains in a rapid counter-offensive this month, putting the Kremlin on the back foot. Ukrainian forces have recaptured key towns and villages in the northern Kharkiv region and have made a slower, but still significant progress in the southern Kherson region. Russia, however, still holds about a fifth of the country. The decree is short on detail. It says nothing about a cap on numbers or about any exceptions, such as not recruiting students or conscripts. Instead, it is left to regional heads to decide how to meet quotas. In theory, the net could be cast far wider than the Kremlin has specified. Russian officials said it would announce ""very soon"" those who would be exempt from its partial mobilisation. The call-up stops short of full conscription, a move that would have risked turning a public that has so far largely been in favour of the conflict against it. In his televised address, Mr Putin also issued a thinly veiled threat he could use nuclear weapons. He said the West was engaging in ""nuclear blackmail"" and that Moscow had ""lots of weapons to reply"". ""When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will certainly use all the means at our disposal to protect Russia and our people. It's not a bluff,"" he said. US President Joe Biden slammed Mr Putin's actions and said ""A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""shamelessly violated"" the core tenets of being a member of the UN, he added.

Mr Putin's announcement of a partial mobilisation drew immediate condemnation from Ukraine's allies. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the mobilisation ""a sign of panic"" while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called it ""an act of desperation"". Mr Putin's address has raised fears that some men of fighting age would not be allowed to leave Russia, even though Russia's Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu said the call-up would be limited to those with combat experience.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Putin announces a partial military mobilisation in Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin is calling up thousands of extra troops to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks on the battlefield. Mr Putin said the partial mobilisation was necessary to ensure Russian territorial integrity. Protests broke out in Russia following the announcement, with more than 750 people arrested, according to a Russian human rights organisation, OVD-info. The announcement applies to 300,000 military reservists. They make up a fraction of the about 25 million Russian reservists - people who have done their compulsory military service. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said it showed Mr Putin wanted to drown Ukraine in blood - including that of his own soldiers.

"Molly Russell was aged 14 when she died in 2017 The father of a 14-year-old who took her own life has told her inquest he was shocked that such ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" was readily available to be seen by children online. Molly Russell, from Harrow in north-west London, died in November 2017 after seeing content about suicide and self harm. Ian Russell told North London Coroner's Court he looked at some of his daughter's web history after her death. He called it ""the bleakest of worlds"". Mr Russell told the inquest much of the content seemed to ""normalise"" self-harm and suicide and discouraged people to get help with mental health. In her own words - Molly Russell's secret Twitter account He said relentless images and videos promoted the idea that the world was dark and hopeless. ""I also looked briefly at Molly's YouTube account and saw aâ¦ pattern - many normal teenage 'likes' and 'follows', but a similar high number of disturbing posts concerning anxiety, depression, self harm and suicide. ""On the family computer I saw that Molly continued to receive emails after her death from another social media platform, Pinterest. ""I was shocked to see the subject lines of the emails clearly promoting depressing content."" Mr Russell earlier told North London Coroner's Court that he hoped Molly's death would remind people that it was ""OK not to be OK"" and to seek help. Molly Russell's father Ian Russell (centre), mother Janet Russell (right) and her sister (left) arrive at Barnet Coroner's Court He said the family noticed her change during the last year of her life, as she became more withdrawn. ""I knew Molly had an Instagram account and a Twitter account as I also had accounts on these platforms and we 'followed' each other, as did other members of the family. ""Molly closed the Twitter account of hers that we were all following and it was only after her death that I found out she had opened another account on Twitter."" Mr Russell told the inquest: ""Just as Molly would have wanted, it is important to seek to learn whatever we can and then to take all necessary action to prevent such a young life being wasted again."" Molly Russell's inquest to put focus on big tech Tech bosses ordered to appear at Molly Russell inquest A statement read out to the court on behalf of Molly's mother Janet outlined what happened when she discovered her daughter's body. Mrs Russell said on the morning of her daughter's death, she was doing household chores and said goodbye to one of her other daughters who was leaving for school, before she began looking around the house for Molly, but could not find her. Her statement said: ""I knew then something wasn't right. I saw a load of her clothes on the floor (of her bedroom). For some reason I thought Molly had run away. ""As I looked in her room, I found herâ¦ I had no doubt it was her."" Molly used her Instagram account up to 120 times a day In a witness statement read to the court on behalf of retired Metropolitan Police detective Michael Walker, the coroner was told Molly watched videos uploaded by an American social media influencer who spoke about ""suicide and depression on a regular basis"". The court was told the youngster had also followed a Twitter account which ""displays depressing quotes"". The account has since been suspended. Mr Russell said: ""Five years ago, Molly's feelings of worthlessness grew and her sense of helplessness deepened, and ending her life seemed to her like a solution - while to us her life seemed very normal. ""It's all too easy to forget the person she really was: someone full of love and hope and happiness, a young person full of promise and opportunity and potential. ""And so, as this inquest starts, we, her family, think it is essential to remember who Molly really was so we can each hold a picture in our minds of a caring individual, full of love and bubbling with excitement for what should have lay ahead in her life."" Senior employees from Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, and Pinterest, are due to give evidence in person at Molly's inquest.

"Liz Truss met Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska in New York Downing Street says President Vladimir Putin's call-up of Russia's military reservists is a ""clear admission"" his invasion of Ukraine is failing. Mr Putin called the mobilisation a necessary step to protect Russia's territorial integrity. No 10 condemned Russia's ""reprehensible actions"" and said the UK would continue to support Ukraine. Prime Minister Liz Truss vowed to stand up for freedom in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York. On her first foreign trip as prime minister, Ms Truss argued that democratic nations should prioritise economic growth and security in a new era of strategic competition. West condemns Russian plans for 'sham' Ukraine vote Why is Russia calling 'votes' in occupied Ukraine? Who is winning the war in Ukraine? She also used her speech on Thursday to rally support for Ukraine and highlight the threat from authoritarian states such as Russia and China. Ms Truss said: ""The Ukrainians aren't just defending their own country, they're defending our values and the security of the whole world. That's why we must act."" The prime minister also pledged to ""sustain or increase"" the military support to Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"", telling the assembled UN  delegates that ""we will not rest until Ukraine prevails"". ""The time to act is now. This is a decisive moment in our history, in the history of this organisation and the history of freedom."" Earlier this week, the government said it would match or exceed the Â£2.3bn support given to Ukraine's ""inspirational"" troops since Mr Putin's forces invaded the country in February. On Wednesday, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ""Putin's speech and his move to mobilise the Russian population are a clear admission that his invasion is failing. ""The UK alongside our international partners stand united in condemning the Russian government's reprehensible actions."" Downing Street said US President Joe Biden and Ms Truss both ""condemned Putin's recent belligerent statements on Ukraine"" when they held their first one-on-one meeting at the UN summit. ""They agreed his actions highlight the need for allies to continue their economic and military support to Ukraine,"" a read-out of the meeting said. Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska and prime minister Denys Shmyal were among the foreign leaders Ms Truss has already met in New York. Ms Truss's pledge to support Ukraine in the long term echoes a key policy plank of the previous UK government led by her predecessor, Boris Johnson. In a previous speech, when Ms Truss was foreign secretary, the prime minister said Russian forces must be pushed out of ""the whole of Ukraine"". On Tuesday, Ms Truss said ""we are facing incredibly tough economic times"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic ""pushed up energy prices"", but she said higher fuel bills were ""a price worth paying"" for the UK's long-term security. In her UN speech, Ms Truss called on democracies ""to harness the power of co-operation seen since Putin's invasion of Ukraine to constrain authoritarianism"". In a meeting ahead of her speech, Ms Truss and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen agreed that Mr Putin's mobilisation of reservists was a ""statement of weakness"". As the motorcades of innumerable world leaders clog the streets of Manhattan, in the corridors of the United Nations the war in Ukraine shapes every conversation. This international crisis has profound and obvious domestic implications that have forced the government to act to help businesses as well as households. Ms Truss's address to the UN here and what amounts to a Budget in all but formal title on Friday offers the clearest picture yet of her new government's worldview and strategy - and it is shaped by the war. The prime minister said the ""free world"", as she put it, must prioritise economic growth so it is ""no longer strategically dependent on those who seek to weaponise the global economy"". Hence, a desire to boost defence spending, and a commitment to turbocharge the economy, with tax cuts the preferred fuel. Mr Putin accused the West of wanting to destroy Russia and stressed he would use ""all available means"" to protect its territory. ""Those who are trying to blackmail us with nuclear weapons should know that the wind can also turn in their direction,"" President Putin added. In an interview with Germany's Bild media group, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he did not think Mr Putin would resort to nuclear weapons. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz denounced the call-up as ""an act of desperation"" in a ""criminal war"" he said Russia could not win. The chief of the Nato alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, lambasted Mr Putin's ""dangerous and reckless"" rhetoric but said his words were not new or surprising. ""He knows very well that a nuclear war should never be fought and cannot be won, and it will have unprecedented consequences for Russia,"" Mr Stoltenberg said. President Putin warned the West he wasn't bluffing when he mentioned the use of nuclear weapons But a former adviser to President Putin, political scientist Sergei Markov, accused Western leaders such as Ms Truss of being aggressors, not Russia. When asked if President Putin could use nuclear weapons against Western nations such as the UK, Mr Markov told the BBC the situation could arise if the ""Prime Minister of Great Britain Liz Truss still has plans to destroy Russia"". Mr Putin's escalation followed a sweeping counter-offensive by Ukraine in the country's north-east in the past weeks, with its forces retaking hundreds of towns and villages that had been controlled by Russia for months. A British defence intelligence update suggested Mr Putin was being forced to undermine his own public position that the war in Ukraine was a ""special military operation"" rather than a full-scale conflict. ""These new measures have highly likely been brought forwards due to public criticism and mark a further development in Russia's strategy,"" the Ministry of Defence said. Meanwhile, Western nations have condemned Moscow's plans to hold so-called referendums in parts of Ukraine that are currently under Russian control.

"This video can not be played Laura Ellis, whose baby Theo died at a maternity unit: ""There was just a catalogue of errors"" More than half of maternity units in England fail consistently to meet safety standards, BBC analysis of official statistics shows. Health regulator theCare Quality Commission (CQC),externalrates 7% of units as posing a high risk of avoidable harm. A further 48% require improvement. The figures are slightly worse than a few years ago, despite several attempts to transform maternity care. The regulator says the pace of improvement has been disappointing. In most cases, pregnancy and birth are a positive and safe experience for women and their families, says the CQC. But when things do go wrong, it is important to understand what happened and whether the outcome could have been different. Laura Ellis lost her newborn son. She checked out the CQC rating of her local hospital, Frimley Park, when she was pregnant. Maternity services were good. But Laura did not realise the unit had been told that it required improvement on safety. She went into labour after an easy pregnancy, and got to the birth centre around 16:40. But within an hour it became clear that the baby was breech, meaning that instead of being head-first in the womb, the legs or bottom were down, making delivery harder. Laura remembers that there seemed to be a ""complete sense of panic"" in the room and that no-one seemed to have any idea what they should be doing. Just after 18:00, the baby's legs and chest had been delivered and the midwife said she could feel a heartbeat. But a few minutes later, a senior midwife tried to listen for it with a stethoscope - and could not hear anything. Laura says she was told that the stethoscope was broken. When her son, Theo, was fully delivered at 18:13, his heart had stopped beating. Medical staff tried to resuscitate him. At one stage, the oxygen canister used on Theo ran out, before being replaced. Laura and her husband James watched, slowly coming to the realisation that their son was probably not going to survive. Doctors and midwives stopped resuscitation after 39 minutes. Laura describes Theo as ""the most perfect baby, just absolutely beautiful"". ""It was just so hard. So hard to deal with. So hard to leave as well. How would you leave your baby in hospital when you should be taking them home?"" Frimley Park NHS Foundation Trust says it is extremely sorry for what happened. It says it has made a number of changes since Theo died, including an emergency response if a baby is unexpectedly breech during advanced labour. If you are affected by issues raised in this article help and support is available via theBBC Action Line. If you or someone you know needs support for issues relating tobereavementand emotional distress,these organisations may be also able to help. The BBC analysed the most recent CQC safety ratings, published in September 2022, for 137 maternity units in England and found: Nine were given the lowest possible rating of inadequate for safety, meaning urgent action is required 66 required improvement to reduce risk to mothers and babies, and ensure legal requirements on safety are met 62 had a good rating for safety None were given the top rating of outstanding that would mean a comprehensive safety system is in place It is hard to give a direct comparison between the current ratings and older ones, because the CQC has changed its approach to inspections. Also, during the pandemic it moved to a risk-based approach, looking at units it was more concerned about. But in December 2016, 50% of maternity and gynaecology units had good safety ratings, compared to 45% now. Victoria Vallance, the CQC's director of secondary care, says inspectors often find the same problems in the maternity services they visit, for example, not managing risk when women are deteriorating. ""We are worried. We are concerned,"" she said. ""We have not seen the pace of improvement consistently, nationally, that we would hope and expect to see across maternity services."" The CQC only inspects in England. Northern Ireland's Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority has not inspected care in maternity units yet - but will in autumn next year. NHS Wales says it has recognised the need for improvement in maternity services. The Scottish government says  it is transforming maternity services with its Best Start programme. There have been a series of serious safety scandals at maternity units in England. Morecambe Bay, and Shrewsbury and Telford have been investigated. East Kent is expected to report back next - and another review has started into problems in Nottingham. Royal College of Midwives chief executive Gill Walton says there is an ""ongoing crisis in maternity services"" and more funds are badly needed. ""Every time there's an inquiry, there's a flurry of 'we're going to do this, this and this. And then it falls off the agenda,"" she said. The NHS in England needs 2,000 more midwives and almost 500 obstetricians. But more than 500 midwives left the profession last year. The government recently invested Â£127m to grow the NHS maternity workforce and improve neonatal care. This is on top of spending Â£95m a year to boost maternity staff numbers. England's chief midwifery officer, Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, admits this is one of the most challenging times in her career. ""One of my key priorities is to ensure a safe and personal care for everybody using our NHS services in England regardless of postcode, socio-economic status, or colour of their skin,"" she said.

After consultation with the CQC, the BBC analysed the overall and safe ratings for each unit that had a ""Maternity"" Service. For anyone pregnant or planning to deliver at their local hospital it is important to look at theCQC's,externallatest report into their local hospital, and check what it says about maternity care and safety. If anyone has any concerns they should talk to their GP, midwife or obstetrician. Every year the NHS in England pays compensation claims when care goes wrong. Last year, there were 10,284 negligence claims.  Of those, 12% - 1,243 - were for maternity. But the money paid out for these claims is far, far more than any other medical specialty. Maternity claims are expensive, partly because they tend to be an initial lump sum and then annual payments for the rest of the mum or baby's life. The NHS expects that 60% of the money it will pay out for medical mistakes that happened last year will be maternity cases. That would be just under Â£8bn, forecast to be paid out over many years. Another way to see that money is that it is over four times more than the annual salary of all midwives and maternity doctors and nurses. Professor Dunkley-Bent says: ""I'm keen that we reduce those claims. ""We want to ensure that our babies and mums are cared for safely, that they have safe and personal maternity care, which means that if we get it right first time, those claims will reduce. ""One baby dying is one to many. It's absolutely heart-wrenching."" The English picture is reflected across the UK. Of all clinical negligence claims NHS Wales handled last year, 18% were about maternity care. Northern Ireland's figures show 16%. Scotland does not break down maternity claims alone, but says 18% of the compensation cases it looks at involve maternity and gynaecology. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"The pound has hit a new 37-year low against the dollar after Russia accused the West of ""nuclear blackmail"" raising fears the Ukraine war could escalate. The comments unnerved traders, pushing them towards safer investments such as the dollar. The pound briefly touched $1.13040 - its lowest level since 1985 - before regaining ground. The fall also came after UK figures showed borrowing costs hit a fresh record for August as inflation soared. In a televised address, the Russian president said he had signed a decree on partial mobilisation - the first since World War Two - as he seeks to send up to 300,000 more soldiers into battle. He also accused the West of wanting to destroy Russia, adding the country had ""lots of weapons to reply"". Putin calls up reservists to fight in Ukraine after losing ground Exchange rates: Why has the value of the pound tumbled? The comments rattled investors who bought the dollar, gold and bonds, all of which are seen as less risky investments. Traders in sterling - which has been at low levels for weeks - were also looking ahead to a widely anticipated interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The US central bank has already raised interest rates four times this year to battle inflation. The Bank of England (BoE) is meanwhile expected to put up interest rates again on Thursday. Raising rates increases the cost of borrowing and encourages people to spend less, which can cool rising prices. However, central banks face a tough balancing act because higher rates may also slow the economy. Sterling investors are also nervous about the policy implications of a planned mini-budget from the government on Friday, which will reportedly contain Â£30bn of tax cuts. It comes as the UK borrows billions of pounds to cap energy bills for households and businesses, adding to the UK's already large debt pile. Official figures on Wednesday showed the government is also facing soaring interest payments on that debt due to rising inflation. This is because much of the interest paid on government bonds rises in line with the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation, which hit 12.3% in August. Where does the government borrow billions from? Firms could have energy bills cut by up to a third Interest due on public debt reached Â£8.2bn during the month - Â£1.5bn more than last year and the highest August figure since records began in 1997, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Meanwhile, total government borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£11.8bn. That is twice the level forecast for August by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's independent fiscal watchdog. If you're a half-empty sort of analyst, you'll point out that the amount of interest payable on the government's debt was Â£8.2bn in August - the highest August figure since records began 25 years ago. However, much of that was not so much because of rises in the Bank of England's official interest rate - which is likely to rise again on Thursday - but because about a quarter of the government's outstanding debt pays interest linked to the Retail Prices Index, which hit 12.3% in August. However, RPI is widely predicted to come down towards the second half of next year. Overall, UK debt as a proportion of economic output also fell by 0.8 percentage points to 83.8%. That's well below the historic average of around 100%. As in the early stages of the pandemic, the question to ask is not so much: Can the government afford to borrow more? Instead, it's more whether, given what government inaction might do to household borrowing and debt - which could have far more serious economic consequences -  it can afford not to. Martyn Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club and former Treasury economist, said the UK economy had been ""pretty weak over the last few months"". That meant less was being generated in taxes, while the government had to spend more on debt interest payments, he added. But he said he was ""not particularly"" worried about the high debt levels, as the UK's borrowing costs were ""still pretty low"" compared to long-term historical records. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng defended the government's decision to spend billions on helping families and businesses with their bills. He added that government's priority was to ""grow the economy and improve living standards for everyone - with strong economic growth and sustainable public finances going hand in hand"". ""As chancellor, I have pledged to get debt down in the medium term,"" he added. ""However, in the face of a major economic shock, it is absolutely right that the government takes action now to help families and businesses, just as we did during the pandemic.""

"Students are facing financial and mental health concerns as soaring prices take a toll on their wellbeing, a survey has suggested. More than eight in 10 of those asked said they worried about making ends meet, with the average maintenance loan falling short of living costs. The survey,external, run by the website Save The Student, suggested four in five had considered the prospect of dropping out of university. Half of those blamed money worries. ""This is the most worried I've ever been about the financial situation students are facing,"" said Save The Student's Jake Butler. ""In a decade of running the National Student Money Survey, this year's findings are bleak - and we expect much worse is yet to come."" Rent is by far the largest outgoing for students, followed by groceries. Living costs have seen a 14% increase since last year's survey, according to the responses, with the average student now spending Â£924 per month. That is higher than theofficial inflation rateof 9.9%, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time. Save The Student suggested that a typical maintenance loan in England fell Â£439 short of covering these costs every month. Many relied on parents or part-time jobs, or savings to make up the shortfall, but one in 10 students in the survey has used a food bank in the last academic year, the survey suggested. Of those who were worried about making ends meet, some 59% said their mental health had suffered, and 64% said their social life had taken a hit. One student, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that finding accommodation covered by the maintenance loan was impossible. ""Over the summer between A-levels and university, I managed to save Â£2,000 to go towards my rent, but after rent I had none left to pay for food, going out, train tickets to visit home and so on,"" she said. ""Not being able to afford to do anything had a massive impact on my mental health as it was very isolating.

"Prime Minister Liz Truss has travelled to New York to address the UN General Assembly President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Liz Truss have agreed on the ""priority"" of preserving peace in Northern Ireland as they discussed its post-Brexit trade arrangements in their first talks. They held their first one-on-one meeting at a UN summit in New York. There have been tensions between them over UK plans to override the Northern Ireland Protocol. Before the meeting, both said they were ""committed"" to maintaining an agreement that brought peace in Northern Ireland. Ms Truss's spokesperson said she and Mr Biden only had a ""short discussion"" about the Northern Ireland in a wide-ranging conversation dominated by the war in Ukraine. A Downing Street read-out of the meeting said the leaders talked about supporting Ukraine, energy security and preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. The prime minister's spokesperson said the tone of the meeting was ""warm"" and that they did not discuss a UK-US trade deal. Truss admits no US trade deal on horizon US repeats warning over unilateral protocol action In opening remarks at the beginning of their meeting, the US president told Ms Truss he was ""looking forward to hearing what's on your mind"" about Northern Ireland. He congratulated her on becoming prime minister and said he looked forward to working closely with her, calling the UK ""our closest ally in the world"". Ms Truss told the president the UK and the US were ""steadfast allies"" as she thanked him for his support following the death of the Queen. ""Of course I'm looking forward to discussing the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and how we make sure that's upheld into the future,"" she added. Earlier in the day, Ms Truss also discussed the Northern Ireland protocol with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. But Ms Truss declined to discuss the protocol with France's President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. Both Mr Biden and Ms Truss have said a negotiated resolution to the row between London and Brussels over the protocol is preferable. Mr Biden and Ms Truss were originally scheduled to meet in London on Sunday, after the president travelled to the UK for the Queen's funeral, but that meeting was postponed. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Irish Republic (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem The Northern Ireland Protocol is the post-Brexit agreement which allows for special trading arrangements between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, avoiding the need for a hard border between the UK and Ireland after Brexit. It was signed when Boris Johnson was prime minister. But it has been a source of tension since it came into force at the start of 2021. Currently there is no functioning devolved administration in Northern Ireland because the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - the second-largest party in the recent Stormont elections - oppose the protocol and refused to take part in a power-sharing government until its concerns are resolved. Earlier this week, the UK government told the EU it wouldcontinue delaying customs checkson goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, despite ongoing legal action from Brussels over this stance.

"This video can not be played Laura Ellis, whose baby Theo died at a maternity unit: ""There was just a catalogue of errors"" More than half of maternity units in England fail consistently to meet safety standards, BBC analysis of official statistics shows. Health regulator theCare Quality Commission (CQC),externalrates 7% of units as posing a high risk of avoidable harm. A further 48% require improvement. The figures are slightly worse than a few years ago, despite several attempts to transform maternity care. The regulator says the pace of improvement has been disappointing. In most cases, pregnancy and birth are a positive and safe experience for women and their families, says the CQC. But when things do go wrong, it is important to understand what happened and whether the outcome could have been different. Laura Ellis lost her newborn son. She checked out the CQC rating of her local hospital, Frimley Park, when she was pregnant. Maternity services were good. But Laura did not realise the unit had been told that it required improvement on safety. She went into labour after an easy pregnancy, and got to the birth centre around 16:40. But within an hour it became clear that the baby was breech, meaning that instead of being head-first in the womb, the legs or bottom were down, making delivery harder. Laura remembers that there seemed to be a ""complete sense of panic"" in the room and that no-one seemed to have any idea what they should be doing. Just after 18:00, the baby's legs and chest had been delivered and the midwife said she could feel a heartbeat. But a few minutes later, a senior midwife tried to listen for it with a stethoscope - and could not hear anything. Laura says she was told that the stethoscope was broken. When her son, Theo, was fully delivered at 18:13, his heart had stopped beating. Medical staff tried to resuscitate him. At one stage, the oxygen canister used on Theo ran out, before being replaced. Laura and her husband James watched, slowly coming to the realisation that their son was probably not going to survive. Doctors and midwives stopped resuscitation after 39 minutes. Laura describes Theo as ""the most perfect baby, just absolutely beautiful"". ""It was just so hard. So hard to deal with. So hard to leave as well. How would you leave your baby in hospital when you should be taking them home?"" Frimley Park NHS Foundation Trust says it is extremely sorry for what happened. It says it has made a number of changes since Theo died, including an emergency response if a baby is unexpectedly breech during advanced labour. If you are affected by issues raised in this article help and support is available via theBBC Action Line. If you or someone you know needs support for issues relating tobereavementand emotional distress,these organisations may be also able to help. The BBC analysed the most recent CQC safety ratings, published in September 2022, for 137 maternity units in England and found: Nine were given the lowest possible rating of inadequate for safety, meaning urgent action is required 66 required improvement to reduce risk to mothers and babies, and ensure legal requirements on safety are met 62 had a good rating for safety None were given the top rating of outstanding that would mean a comprehensive safety system is in place It is hard to give a direct comparison between the current ratings and older ones, because the CQC has changed its approach to inspections. Also, during the pandemic it moved to a risk-based approach, looking at units it was more concerned about. But in December 2016, 50% of maternity and gynaecology units had good safety ratings, compared to 45% now. Victoria Vallance, the CQC's director of secondary care, says inspectors often find the same problems in the maternity services they visit, for example, not managing risk when women are deteriorating. ""We are worried. We are concerned,"" she said. ""We have not seen the pace of improvement consistently, nationally, that we would hope and expect to see across maternity services."" The CQC only inspects in England. Northern Ireland's Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority has not inspected care in maternity units yet - but will in autumn next year. NHS Wales says it has recognised the need for improvement in maternity services. The Scottish government says  it is transforming maternity services with its Best Start programme. There have been a series of serious safety scandals at maternity units in England. Morecambe Bay, and Shrewsbury and Telford have been investigated. East Kent is expected to report back next - and another review has started into problems in Nottingham. Royal College of Midwives chief executive Gill Walton says there is an ""ongoing crisis in maternity services"" and more funds are badly needed. ""Every time there's an inquiry, there's a flurry of 'we're going to do this, this and this. And then it falls off the agenda,"" she said. The NHS in England needs 2,000 more midwives and almost 500 obstetricians. But more than 500 midwives left the profession last year. The government recently invested Â£127m to grow the NHS maternity workforce and improve neonatal care. This is on top of spending Â£95m a year to boost maternity staff numbers. England's chief midwifery officer, Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, admits this is one of the most challenging times in her career. ""One of my key priorities is to ensure a safe and personal care for everybody using our NHS services in England regardless of postcode, socio-economic status, or colour of their skin,"" she said.

After consultation with the CQC, the BBC analysed the overall and safe ratings for each unit that had a ""Maternity"" Service. For anyone pregnant or planning to deliver at their local hospital it is important to look at theCQC's,externallatest report into their local hospital, and check what it says about maternity care and safety. If anyone has any concerns they should talk to their GP, midwife or obstetrician. Every year the NHS in England pays compensation claims when care goes wrong. Last year, there were 10,284 negligence claims.  Of those, 12% - 1,243 - were for maternity. But the money paid out for these claims is far, far more than any other medical specialty. Maternity claims are expensive, partly because they tend to be an initial lump sum and then annual payments for the rest of the mum or baby's life. The NHS expects that 60% of the money it will pay out for medical mistakes that happened last year will be maternity cases. That would be just under Â£8bn, forecast to be paid out over many years. Another way to see that money is that it is over four times more than the annual salary of all midwives and maternity doctors and nurses. Professor Dunkley-Bent says: ""I'm keen that we reduce those claims. ""We want to ensure that our babies and mums are cared for safely, that they have safe and personal maternity care, which means that if we get it right first time, those claims will reduce. ""One baby dying is one to many. It's absolutely heart-wrenching."" The English picture is reflected across the UK. Of all clinical negligence claims NHS Wales handled last year, 18% were about maternity care. Northern Ireland's figures show 16%. Scotland does not break down maternity claims alone, but says 18% of the compensation cases it looks at involve maternity and gynaecology. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Jamal Edwards gave Ed Sheeran his first big break 12 years ago Pop singer Ed Sheeran has paid tribute to Jamal Edwards, saying he owed his career to his late friend's support. The star was speaking at a memorial for Edwards, who founded the online music platform SBTV and was made an MBE for services to music in 2014. The entrepreneur died in February at the age of 31. ""I really don't think I would have been given the opportunities that I was given had it not been for Jamal putting his arm around me,"" Sheeran said. ""I was slogging on the acoustic singer-songwriter scene for a very long time, just blending in... And Jamal was this sort of tastemaker."" Cocaine sparked Jamal Edwards death, coroner says Tributes flood in for entrepreneur Jamal Edwards Edwards gave Sheeran his first break on in 2010, getting him to perform the future single You Need Me, I Don't Need You on his YouTube channel. That video was how the star's manager, Stuart Camp, and record label Atlantic first discovered him. ""A lot of people assume that [because] I write songs and I perform, I probably would"" have become famous anyway, Sheeran said. ""I actually don't agree with that... I was one of many. ""I really don't think I would have been allowed through certain doors if it hadn't been for Jamal,"" he continued, adding: ""He was just all about finding people and showing people new opportunities, at a time where the industry was mostly based in London."" This video can not be played Jessie Ware and Lewis Capaldi perform at Jamal Edwards' memorial concert Tuesday's memorial also served as the inaugural fundraising event for the Jamal Edwards Self-Belief Trust, which aims to help young people at risk of homelessness, and to provide entry points to the media industry for people who might not otherwise have the opportunity. ""His generosity is what we want to continue,"" his mother, the Loose Women presenter Brenda Edwards, told BBC News. ""He was always about championing young people. That was his main aim."" Edwards had also devoted his free time to helping the homeless, she added. ""He would go to the homeless shelter and give food out and give talks to young people every single Christmas. I would cook Christmas dinner... and he wouldn't be back until 9:30 or 10 o'clock at night - and we'd have to wait until he came back. ""So we're just going to try and do our best to continue exactly what he's done,"" she added. ""Nobody can do what Jamal did, but I'm going to give it a good try."" Edwards founded SBTV ""on a Â£20 phone""  while he was still at school - but the channel went on to launch the careers of artists like Dave, Skepta, Ed Sheeran and Emeli SandÃ©. It was pivotal in documenting and promoting the rise of London's grime scene, which Edwards saw as ""like the punk movement, in terms of lyrics and rebellious attitude"". As his fortune grew, he expanded into other entrepreneurial ventures, often with a focus on improving the lives of disadvantaged young people; and shared his experiences in the best-selling book  Self Belief: How to Be a Success on Your Own Terms. He died suddenly in February from a heart attack after taking cocaine and drinking alcohol, a coroner concluded. Edwards' mother, Brenda, and Tracey Parry-Knight, CEO of the Jamal Edwards Trust, gave a heartfelt and emotional speech Tuesday's memorial, held in London's new Here at Outernet venue, also saw performances from Jessie Ware, Lewis Capaldi and Max Cyrus, with Hollywood star Terry Crews hosting the gala. The event featured a star-studded auction which had a host of ""money-can't-buy experiences"" including a meal-for-two with Luther star Idris Elba, and a David Beckham-signed Inter Miami t-shirt. Organisers said the event raised more than Â£100,000 on the night. Crews, who is best known for the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, said he had first met Edwards on a promotional trip to London in 2014. ""We did the media thing but afterwards, we started to talk. And I just was like, 'Man, I love what you're about. I love everything you're doing. How can I help you? ""So we exchanged numbers, and every time I came to London ever since, I sat down with Jamal and hung out with him. ""We had all these visions and all these plans... And man, when I found out that he passed, I couldn't believe it."" Crews said he wanted to be involved in the fundraiser to ""to continue the mission that Jamal started"", calling him a ""visionary"" who had changed hundreds of people's lives. Jessie Ware, who dedicated a cover of What You Won't Do For Love to Edwards, agreed that he had left a significant impact on Britain's music scene.

"More than Â£1.2m has been paid out to cyclists who have fallen off their bike on Edinburgh's tram line. New data shows a total of 196 successful claims have been made against Edinburgh City Council since 2012 by cyclists who sustained injuries or damage to their bike after slipping on tracks or getting wheels stuck. In total there have been 422 accidents involving cyclists on tram tracks. The vast majority of these occurred on Princes Street and around Haymarket. Edinburgh City Council said it hadmade a series of safety improvements for cyclistscrossing the tram lines in recent years. But campaigners say these have come ""slowly and too late"".

Prof Chris Oliver, of the Spokes Lothian Cycle Campaign, said: ""I'm not unsurprised that trams system related cycling injuries continue. ""Spokes originally advised prior to the construction of the Edinburgh Tram line that the infrastructure should be protected and that cyclists should not be freely mixed with trams. An expert even came over to advise but the advice was not heeded. ""There have been some recent improvements but these have come slowly and too late. I'm sure there will be continual waves of litigation from injured cyclists."" Data released under freedom of information laws shows that since 2012 - two years before the trams were first operating - a total of Â£1,262,141 in damages has been paid out by Edinburgh City Council. Edinburgh's transport convener Scott Arthur said:Â ""It is important to note that some of these claims pre-date the opening of the line and the many safety improvements made since then. ""Nonetheless, the number of claims submitted is concerning to me. I am committed to ensuring the safety of all road users, and I know that over the last five years the council has been working on a phased package of improvements to cycle safety along the tram route. ""The council is now in the process of completing phase three of the project, which includes significant changes to the road layouts at six junctions to give greater priority to people on bikes."" He went on to voice his dismay that more safety improvements had not been made at the junction where medical student Zhi Min Soh, 23, died in 2017. Mr Arthur told the BBC: ""It really disappoints me that five years after the death of that Edinburgh University student we've still not got those fixes in place for that junction. ""It is something I have been prioritising since becoming transport convener."" Safety changes made in recent years have included newÂ red-surfaced cycle lanes at key points along the tram route to direct cyclists on the safest route to cross the tram tracks to avoid getting their wheels stuck.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Liz Truss announces energy price guarantee for next two years New Prime Minister Liz Truss will limit energy bill rises for all households for two years as the new prime minister tries to prevent widespread hardship. A typical household energy bill will be capped at Â£2,500 annually until 2024. The huge support scheme could cost up to Â£150bn, but Ms Truss refused to put a figure on it, saying ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". Businesses will get help, with prices capped for six months, a shorter period of protection than many had hoped for. The help will be for everyone in England, Scotland and Wales with equivalent assistance for Northern Ireland. But there are concerns the measures are not targeted enough, with no additional support for the most vulnerable. As a result, millions are still expected to be in fuel poverty this winter. The energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to Â£3,549 for a typical household from October. To limit the amount customers' bills go up by, the unit price will be capped, although household energy bills will vary according to how much gas and electricity they use. The government will compensate energy firms for the difference between the wholesale price for gas and electricity they pay and the amount they can charge customers. 'Government help on energy bills is no use to me' What the new energy plan means for you How much are energy bills rising under the new plan? Where does the government borrow billions from? Commenting on what steps households should now take, Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy, said firms were still working through the details and customers should ""sit tight and wait to hear from their energy supplier"". ""Nothing will change until 1 October and we'll be in touch with everyone before then."" The dramatic state intervention will be funded by government borrowing, adding to the UK's already large debt pile. The total cost of the support will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets, which can be extremely volatile. This comes after Ms Truss rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the refusal to fund it with a windfall tax showed she was ""driven by dogma"" and ""it's working people who will pay for that"". Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey accused the government of bringing in a ""phony freeze"" while ""refusing to properly tax the eye-watering profits of oil and gas companies."" ""This will still leave struggling families and pensioners facing impossible choices this winter as energy bills almost double,"" he said. Ms Truss argued it was ""the moment to be bold"". ""We are facing a global energy crisis, and there are no cost-free options,"" she said. Gas prices have soared this year, largely due to the conflict in Ukraine which has reduced supplies of Russian gas. Experts and charities warned that without help with soaring energy bills, lives would have been at risk this winter, with people struggling to afford basic day-to-day living costs. Citizens Advice chief executive Dame Clare Moriarty, told the BBC the package will provide ""much-needed relief for millions"" but said she was concerned it is not going to reverse the trends it was seeing. ""We're seeing problems turn up in the summer, which we would normally expect to be winter."" Ms Truss also outlined plans ""to make sure we have security of [energy] supply for the long-term"". This includes issuing new oil and gas exploration licences for the North Sea and lifting the ban on fracking for shale gas ""where there is local support for it"". In addition the government will: Scrap green levies - which add Â£150 to bills each year - which the Â£2,500 cap accounts for Continue with a previously announced Â£400 energy bills discount for all households. Taken together, the government said this ""will bring costs close to where the energy price cap stands today"". Launch a new oil and gas licensing round as early as next week, boosting production in the North Sea Seek to negotiate lower-priced long-term contracts with renewable and nuclear power companies Launch a joint scheme with the Bank of England to provide emergency support to struggling UK energy firms Launch a review to ensure the UK is meeting its Net Zero 2050 target in ""an economically-efficient way"", given the altered economic landscape. The decision to lift the ban on fracking will be controversial.The practice was halted in 2019- as outlined in the Tory Party 2019 manifesto - amid opposition from environmentalists and local concerns over earth tremors. The scheme to limit energy costs for businesses will also cover public sector groups like schools and charities. It will be in place for six months though it will be reviewed in three month's time ""to consider where this should be targeted to make sure those most in need get support"". The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) welcomed the help but said the announcement was ""sparse on detail"". ""Small businesses' instant reaction is that this is not enough information, yet, for them to plan,"" said Martin McTague, chairman of the FSB. Downing Street said the price cap would boost economic growth and curb inflation by as much as 5%. The rate at which prices rise is currently at a 40-year high of 10.1%, largely driven by soaring energy prices. The energy plan is a huge emergency intervention in keeping with the pandemic rescue package. It will lessen the anticipated pain in households and businesses, but not eliminate it. The recession the economy is heading for should be shallower. But these are the headlines of what the plan promises. It is unprecedented for an announcement of this size, to have so few details on the mechanisms involved, and no details on the costs. There is much up for grabs. Some allowance could be given for the fact the administration is only two days old. But it is clear from our reporting up and down the country that more businesses that have closed could have been saved if this package had come more quickly. And the uncertainty for business will not be settled until the actual unit price of energy is announced. The size of the intervention, which looks well in excess of Â£100bn, looks likely to raise questions about whether the PM can deliver her complete programme of promised immediate tax cuts. Much will depend on negotiations with renewables producers and a plan to buy gas on long-term contracts. There is a long queue of nations currently doing the same. Expect to see the new PM in Oslo, Ottawa and the Gulf before long. The plans for long-term production reflect a strategic decision not to be dependent on imported energy, that will take some time to come to fruition. The idea, however, is to address the root cause of a problem years in the making.

"Government support for businesses struggling with energy bills may not arrive until November. However, the help would be backdated, and cover the period from 1 October, a government spokesperson said. Last week Prime Minister Liz Truss said firms would get ""equivalent support"" to the help that was announced for households. But companies have been in the dark as to what that actually means, including how much support they will get. A government spokesperson said: ""We will confirm further details of the business support scheme next week. The scheme will support businesses with their October energy bills, including through backdating if necessary."" The help may be backdated because the precise mechanism and amount of support may not be finalised till November, a government source said. The support for business was also time-limited to six months, with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but there was little indication of what that means either. Energy bills to be capped at Â£2,500 for typical household Energy bills: 'The government help is no use to me' Alan Soady from The Federation for Small Business told the BBC ""all businesses are vulnerable if they are energy users and let's face it, the problems in the gas market don't look they are going away in six months"". Unlike households - where a cap on the unit price for gas and electricity means an average household will pay Â£2,500 per year for energy - there is no such mechanism for businesses. Firms have a huge variety of different contracts based on the intensity of their usage and the mix between gas and electricity. Many big businesses also have their own energy buying departments and systems to insure themselves, or ""hedge"", against extreme price movements. Also, unlike households, there is no price cap, and therefore no moment when everyone's bills will change. Firms typically have one or two-year fixed contracts, but a significant number - the CBI estimates a third - traditionally come up for renewal before winter and in October. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said meetings continue, to thrash out the details of their approach, and the business of government goes on during the official mourning period. That will be little comfort to a business owner I spoke to last week agonising over whether to hand back the keys to his premises ahead of this winter. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have written a blank cheque trying to avert a recession. Households' knowledge their bills are fixed for the next two years will help in that endeavour, but few businesses will invest, hire, or sign a new lease until they know what help is coming their way, when and for how long. If recession is to be avoided, the government will need to provide more detail, and reassurance as soon as possible.

"Russia has begun implementing plans to call up reservists to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks there President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 more Russians with military experience sparked protests on Wednesday More than 1,000 anti-mobilisation protesters are reported to have been arrested Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has not denied media reports that some protesters were given draft papers Meanwhile the BBC has spoken to young men fleeing over the border into Georgia - one of the few remaining countries Russians can get to without a visa And Ukraine is celebrating a prisoner exchange which saw more than 200 prisoners of war released by Russia They include more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, hailed as heroes for mounting resistance at a steelworks in Mariupol Five British nationals also freed have arrived back in the UK Edited by Jeremy Gahagan Our live page coverage is now pausing. Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech.

Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry

"Steel manufacturing requires a lot of energy Energy bills for UK businesses will be cut by around half their expected level this winter under a huge government support package. The scheme will fix wholesale gas and electricity prices for firms for six months from 1 October, shielding businesses from crippling costs. Hospitals, schools and charities will also get help, the government said. It comes after ministers announced a multi-billion pound plan to help households with bills for two years. Analysts suggest the help for firms and households combined could cost up to Â£150bn. Industry groups welcomed the package but warned further support may be needed after the winter. It is understood the scheme will be reviewed after three months with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but it is not known what sectors come under the category. Wholesale prices, which are what suppliers pay for energy in bulk before they distribute it to customers, are expected to be fixed for all non-domestic energy customers at Â£211 per MWh for electricity and Â£75 per MWh for gas. Those rates will be the base cost, to which other add-ons, such as standing charges will be added by suppliers. Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Pubs warning: 'My energy bill tripled to Â£35,000' Independent analysts Cornwall Insight said the plan marked a ""substantial"" 45% discount on wholesale energy prices at the end of last week. The government said the scheme would apply to companies which had agreed fixed deals at higher prices on or after 1 April, when energy bills started to surge. Those on variable and flexible tariffs will also be eligible. Companies do not need to contact suppliers as the discount will automatically be applied to their bills, with savings seen from October but received from November. Josh Farrant, manager at The Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, said the pub was facing a hike in energy bills from Â£44,000 to around Â£124,000 a year before the government's wholesale cap was announced. ""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" he said. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things."" ""It doesn't mean the panic is over. It's going to run for six months, then we'll see."" Read more reaction to the energy support for businesses,here. Guy Adams, who runs the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel in the Hebrides, said he had been quoted a 377% increase in his energy bills before the cap, which ""would probably have finished us off"". ""At present our cheapest room rate is Â£110 per night. We would have had to raise that to Â£415 per night,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. However, he said because his seasonal hotel will close for the winter and reopen in May, it was ""absolutely impossible"" to set prices for bookings given the support package will only run until April. ""The fact that it is going to be reviewed in six months is not practical,"" he added. Prime Minister Liz Truss said the government understood the ""huge pressure"" businesses, charities and public sector organisations faced with bills. She added that the new scheme would provide ""certainty and peace of mind"". Bur Labour business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said there were still questions about ""how much this will cost and who will pay for it"". Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the ""delayed announcement"" left businesses ""under a cloud of damaging uncertainty"". ""The government have no plan beyond these next six months, paralysing businesses who need to make decisions for the long term,"" she added. The support will apply to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. A scheme offering comparable support will be established in Northern Ireland. Officials have not said how much the package will cost the taxpayer, but Cornwall Insight estimates it at around Â£25bn. Energy-intensive industries, such as steel-making, have warned that businesses could go bust due to their energy costs, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine. Unlike households, businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, which is the maximum amount a supplier can charge per unit of energy. It means non-domestic bills have soared even higher. The government announced earlier this month that bills for a typical household would be limited to Â£2,500 annually until 2024 under a separate scheme. On Wednesday, it also said: New laws would be introduced to ensure landlords passed the discount on to tenants who pay all-inclusive bills. An additional Â£100 payment would go to households that do not receive support for their heating costs, such as those not served by the gas grid. The big problem with this support for business is its shelf life. Few businesses plan with only a six-month time horizon and there will be some whose plans to cut production, close premises and let staff go will not change as a result of this intervention. But many others - particularly those in retail and hospitality - may see this giving them a fighting chance over the commercially crucial Christmas trading period. The government has thrown an emergency blanket over the economy this winter, but longer term, more fundamental reform to the energy supply market, its pricing and mechanics will be needed. Developing more cheap renewables, securing foreign supplies of liquid gas, drilling for more domestic fossil fuels, breaking the link between gas prices and electricity and pushing ahead with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and small and large scale nuclear have been part of the government's plan for nearly two years. What's new is the pressure applied by Vladimir Putin to do it as fast as possible. Stephen Phipson of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said businesses would ""warmly welcome"" the government support package. ""Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector and making immediately available the much-needed help companies have been calling for across the board."" However, he warned that energy prices were likely to remain high for more than six months and firms may need ""support for a longer period if we are to protect jobs and remain competitive"". Director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the price cap would give steelmakers ""the chance to get through the winter"". But he called on the government to ""rapidly reform the energy market to ensure longer-term competitive prices"". Smaller businesses have also been struggling with rising bills, with brewery bosses warning that pubs and restaurants could be forced to close after energy costs soared by as much as 300%. A landlord of one Essex pub told the BBC his energy bill had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the industry was ""relieved"" by the support ahead of the busy Christmas trading period, adding it would secure jobs.

"Home heating oil customers in Northern Ireland are to get a one-off payment Home heating oil customers in Northern Ireland are to get a one-off payment of Â£100 to help with rising energy costs. That will be in addition to a cap on the unit price of electricity announced by the government on Wednesday. People who use gas to heat their homes will also benefit from a cap on the unit price of that fuel. The modest support for oil users reflects the fact that gas prices have risen much more sharply than oil in the last year. The Â£100 will be delivered as a top-up to the Â£400 Energy Bills Support payment, which is going to all UK households. In a statement, the government said: ""The government will also provide an additional payment of Â£100 to households across the UK who are not able to receive support for their heating costs through the Energy Price Guarantee. ""This might be because they live in an area of the UK that is not served by the gas grid and is to compensate for the rising costs of alternative fuels such as heating oil."" The Northern Ireland Consumer Council said heating oil currently costs more than Â£520 for 500 litres, compared with about Â£220 for the same amount a year ago. Peter McClenaghan from the council said: ""The commitment from the prime minister that support will be provided to Northern Ireland consumers whether they use heating oil or natural gas is welcome. ""The Consumer Council is keen to see more progress in the development of support for consumers who primarily use home heating oil to heat their homes. ""This should be support over and above the additional payment of Â£100 to all households across the UK who are not served by the gas grid."" Stormont Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said he did not believe the offer of Â£100 of oil would ""cut it in any way, shape or form"" and revealed he had not been made aware of the plan prior to its announcement. ""I'm in the process of continuing to raise this with various government ministers to make sure that they realise that this is not going to go far enough for people in Northern Ireland,"" he toldBBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons told BBC a Â£100 oil voucher wouldn't ""cut it in any way, shape or form"" Mr Lyons welcomed price caps but acknowledged that price rises due in October would go ahead and consumers may not see any benefit until November. ""It's not going to take away all of the pain that people are going to be facing but it does stop it from getting worse,"" he added. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the government plan for the Â£100 heating oil payment as an ""insult"". ""They have no idea what real people are going through,"" he tweeted. ""The â¦âªSDLPâ¬â© are proposing 1,000 litres of oil for households. Only radical action will protect families this winter."" Colum Eastwood said the government had no idea ""what real people are going through"" The broader scheme means energy suppliers in Northern Ireland will reduce bills by up to 17p/kWh for electricity and 4.2p/kWh for gas. When the cap was announced for the rest of the UK, the government said it was expected to save the typical household Â£1,000 a year based on current energy prices from October. Northern Ireland businesses are also being promised an energy cap similar to that which has beenannounced for the rest of the UK. Wholesale energy prices for businesses will be capped at ""less than half"" anticipated winter levels under a huge government support package. The Energy Bill Relief Scheme will offer discounts for all firms for six months from 1 October. Hospitals, schools and other settings such as community halls and churches will also get help. Northern Ireland is in a different energy market from the rest of the UK so Northern Ireland businesses will get a scheme based on the same criteria and offering comparable support but ""recognising the different market fundamentals"". Households have been dealing with big increases in their energy bills Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said the announcement did ""not provide the support that citizens and businesses here need"". ""The promise of equivalent support without the underpinning detail does nothing to reassure businesses,"" he added. ""Most businesses are anxious about how they will make it through the winter. ""Businesses need certainty now to enable them to plan and to provide reassurance to their employees."" The trade body Retail NI said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that more clarity was not provided on the energy cap. ""The government needs to ensure that a clear date is provided for the introduction of the energy bill cap, a business rates holiday and VAT reductions to support local small businesses,"" chief executive Glyn Roberts said. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said it was ""simply unacceptable"" that businesses in Northern Ireland did not yet have the full details of how support would be provided. ""We need urgent clarity on how these measures will be carried forward, thousands of businesses are on the brink with many concerned how they will get through the winter,"" he said.

"Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf says the latest figures are unacceptable Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf expects to see an ""immediate"" improvement in A&E waiting times after they hit the worst level on record. Newfigures show,external63.5% of patients were dealt with within four hours â well below the government's 95% target. Mr Yousaf said he expected to see the statistics rebound when new figures are published next week. Scottish Tory health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said he was ""outraged"" by the government's response. The latest headlines from Scotland,external Scotland's A&E waiting times worst on record Figures for the week ending 11 September showed just 63.5% of patients attending A&E were seen and subsequently admitted or discharged within four hours. The Scottish government target is 95%. One medic warned that such delays could lead to the loss of about 40 lives. Mr Yousaf singled out three sites â the Forth Valley Hospital in Larbert, the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh and the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow â as having performed particularly poorly, while acknowledging that the low figures were ""across the board"" in all parts of Scotland. ""That level of performance that we saw over the weekend of 11 September was just not acceptable and those health boards know that I expect immediate improvement,"" he told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme. He said capacity in hospitals was the principal reason for the A&E waiting times. He also cited recruitment issues and pressures in the social care system, including rising energy bills making it harder for care homes to run their businesses. ""Because of those issues, that means that demand at the front door [of hospitals] increases and also makes it more difficult to get those delayed discharges out the back door which means that capacity is actually the most significant issue that we're facing,"" Mr Yousaf said. ""Length of stay is also a problem. People are sicker."" The SNP minister explained hospital patients were staying on average a day longer than in previous years. ""That might not seem like a lot. But times that by the 22,000-odd people that attend A&E in any given week and that adds up very quickly."" The health secretary said he hoped to set out an NHS action plan to parliament within the next fortnight. He will set out measures to increase the NHS workforce and to invest in social care to tackle delayed discharges. ""We are anticipating an exceptionally difficult winter, because we expect we might get a resurgence of flu which we haven't seen in the last couple of years,"" Mr Yousaf said. New health guidance on alcohol link with cancer Deaths in Scotland spike to 10% above average He added that there was a ""high possibility"" of another Covid-19 wave, as well as expected injuries from slips, trips and falls in colder conditions. He pointed to his government's efforts to recruit further staff, with 200 nurses brought in from overseas last year. And in efforts to retain staff, he said he was meeting soon with trade unions representing NHS staff to get a pay deal ""over the line"". ""I don't begrudge trade unions for asking for more than 5% given where we are with the cost-of-living crisis,"" Mr Yousaf said. ""Equally of course I have to be really upfront that any additionality to 5% is going to have to be found within my health budget and that means having to take money away from other crucial services and that can be really difficult."" Although he is facing criticism over NHS waiting times, the health secretary said he would not scrap the targets altogether. Performance on waiting times targets at Scotland's hospital A&E units has hit a new low. This came after it was reported new UK health secretary Therese Coffey was considering axing the figures as part of her ""emergency"" NHS plan. ""They keep government focused,"" Mr Yousaf said. ""I think scrapping them is the wrong move."" Dr Gulhane, Scottish Conservative health spokesman, said he was ""alarmed"" by Mr Yousaf's response to the record-low figures. He pointed to the health secretary's warning that people are staying in hospital an extra day longer on average because they were ""sicker"". ""That's because people are waiting so long to get seen by their GP,"" Dr Gulhane said. ""They're waiting to get seen in outpatients. They're not having their operations, they're in more pain. ""Of course they're going to be sicker. It's because of the long waiting times."" He called for the government to increase pensions to help increase the number of doctors and nurses in the NHS, as well as freeing up cash to recruit more staff. Dr Gulhane said recruitment had done little to plug a gap of 6000 nursing vacancies. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane has called for action from the government He added: ""The reason I'm outraged, the reason I'm so upset about this is because people are suffering. ""People are actually dying for no reason because they are waiting in A&E."" Dr John-Paul Loughrey, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine Scotland, said the latest delays could lead to about 40 deaths in the following 30 days. He told BBC Scotland: ""What we have now is full hospitals resulting in full emergency departments and that pressure backwashes through the emergency department meaning we can't offload ambulances in time. ""So what we end up with are large number of patients spending excessive times in emergency departments which we know is very harmful to patients in terms of an increased risk of death at 30 days. ""Also it is an increase in the amount of burnout and attrition of our staff. This is harmful to patients, it is harmful to staff and we really need urgent action to correct this."" He explained that studies suggested a mortality rate of one patient for every 82 who spend more than six to eight hours in an emergency department. ""In Scotland there were about 3,400 patients who spent more than eight hours in an ED (emergency department) in the week-ending statistics we've just seen which means that we could estimate that 40 additional lives will be lost because of these delays, within the 30 days.""

"Students are facing financial and mental health concerns as soaring prices take a toll on their wellbeing, a survey has suggested. More than eight in 10 of those asked said they worried about making ends meet, with the average maintenance loan falling short of living costs. The survey,external, run by the website Save The Student, suggested four in five had considered the prospect of dropping out of university. Half of those blamed money worries. ""This is the most worried I've ever been about the financial situation students are facing,"" said Save The Student's Jake Butler. ""In a decade of running the National Student Money Survey, this year's findings are bleak - and we expect much worse is yet to come."" Rent is by far the largest outgoing for students, followed by groceries. Living costs have seen a 14% increase since last year's survey, according to the responses, with the average student now spending Â£924 per month. That is higher than theofficial inflation rateof 9.9%, which tracks how the cost of living changes over time. Save The Student suggested that a typical maintenance loan in England fell Â£439 short of covering these costs every month. Many relied on parents or part-time jobs, or savings to make up the shortfall, but one in 10 students in the survey has used a food bank in the last academic year, the survey suggested. Of those who were worried about making ends meet, some 59% said their mental health had suffered, and 64% said their social life had taken a hit. One student, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that finding accommodation covered by the maintenance loan was impossible. ""Over the summer between A-levels and university, I managed to save Â£2,000 to go towards my rent, but after rent I had none left to pay for food, going out, train tickets to visit home and so on,"" she said. ""Not being able to afford to do anything had a massive impact on my mental health as it was very isolating. I wasn't able to go out for a quick coffee with friends or go on all the nights out, so I feel as if I missed out of opportunities to make friends quite a lot. ""I couldn't try out for sports teams or societies as even they have fees."" Crisis cash for students doubled last year Tricky Â£400 energy rebate cases cause anxiety How much will university cost me? Everything you need to know about student loans She suggested students finding it difficult financially should research part-time job opportunities, talk to their families, and ask about bursaries and support payments. Recent research by BBC News found thatthe number of students asking for emergency cashnearly tripled between 2018-19 and 2020-21 at 95 UK universities. Responses also suggest the amount of hardship funding given out nearly doubled last year. Save The Student surveyed 2,370 university students in the UK between May and August. Since then, the government has introduced further support to help people with energy bills. Students should benefit fromthe cap on gas and electricity bills, with ministers saying that landlords should pass on any discounts. ""We welcome the news that energy bills will be capped for two years, but the new rate is still nearly double what households were paying last year. Students are getting the same rate and support as millionaires, despite being among the groups that will continue to struggle,"" Mr Butler said. The National Union of Students' vice president of higher education, Chloe Fields, said that the survey results were ""shocking, but sadly not surprising"". Despite recent support measures, she called for further assistance for those studying: ""We need an emergency student support package for every single person studying and we need it now."" A Department for Education spokeswoman said the government understood the pressures being faced. ""To support students with living costs, we have increased maintenance loans every year, meaning disadvantaged students now have access to the highest ever amounts in cash terms,"" she said. ""Students who are worried about making ends meet should speak to their university about the support they can access. This year universities can boost their hardship funds by drawing on up to Â£261m we have made available through the Office for Students."" Crisis cash for students doubled last year Tricky Â£400 energy rebate cases cause anxiety 'Sex work paid my student bills. Now I regret it' What are cost of living payments and who gets them?

"Steel manufacturing requires a lot of energy Energy bills for UK businesses will be cut by around half their expected level this winter under a huge government support package. The scheme will fix wholesale gas and electricity prices for firms for six months from 1 October, shielding businesses from crippling costs. Hospitals, schools and charities will also get help, the government said. It comes after ministers announced a multi-billion pound plan to help households with bills for two years. Analysts suggest the help for firms and households combined could cost up to Â£150bn. Industry groups welcomed the package but warned further support may be needed after the winter. It is understood the scheme will be reviewed after three months with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but it is not known what sectors come under the category. Wholesale prices, which are what suppliers pay for energy in bulk before they distribute it to customers, are expected to be fixed for all non-domestic energy customers at Â£211 per MWh for electricity and Â£75 per MWh for gas. Those rates will be the base cost, to which other add-ons, such as standing charges will be added by suppliers. Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Pubs warning: 'My energy bill tripled to Â£35,000' Independent analysts Cornwall Insight said the plan marked a ""substantial"" 45% discount on wholesale energy prices at the end of last week. The government said the scheme would apply to companies which had agreed fixed deals at higher prices on or after 1 April, when energy bills started to surge. Those on variable and flexible tariffs will also be eligible. Companies do not need to contact suppliers as the discount will automatically be applied to their bills, with savings seen from October but received from November. Josh Farrant, manager at The Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, said the pub was facing a hike in energy bills from Â£44,000 to around Â£124,000 a year before the government's wholesale cap was announced. ""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" he said. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things."" ""It doesn't mean the panic is over. It's going to run for six months, then we'll see."" Read more reaction to the energy support for businesses,here. Guy Adams, who runs the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel in the Hebrides, said he had been quoted a 377% increase in his energy bills before the cap, which ""would probably have finished us off"". ""At present our cheapest room rate is Â£110 per night. We would have had to raise that to Â£415 per night,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. However, he said because his seasonal hotel will close for the winter and reopen in May, it was ""absolutely impossible"" to set prices for bookings given the support package will only run until April. ""The fact that it is going to be reviewed in six months is not practical,"" he added. Prime Minister Liz Truss said the government understood the ""huge pressure"" businesses, charities and public sector organisations faced with bills. She added that the new scheme would provide ""certainty and peace of mind"". Bur Labour business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said there were still questions about ""how much this will cost and who will pay for it"". Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the ""delayed announcement"" left businesses ""under a cloud of damaging uncertainty"". ""The government have no plan beyond these next six months, paralysing businesses who need to make decisions for the long term,"" she added. The support will apply to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. A scheme offering comparable support will be established in Northern Ireland. Officials have not said how much the package will cost the taxpayer, but Cornwall Insight estimates it at around Â£25bn. Energy-intensive industries, such as steel-making, have warned that businesses could go bust due to their energy costs, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine. Unlike households, businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, which is the maximum amount a supplier can charge per unit of energy. It means non-domestic bills have soared even higher. The government announced earlier this month that bills for a typical household would be limited to Â£2,500 annually until 2024 under a separate scheme. On Wednesday, it also said: New laws would be introduced to ensure landlords passed the discount on to tenants who pay all-inclusive bills. An additional Â£100 payment would go to households that do not receive support for their heating costs, such as those not served by the gas grid. The big problem with this support for business is its shelf life. Few businesses plan with only a six-month time horizon and there will be some whose plans to cut production, close premises and let staff go will not change as a result of this intervention. But many others - particularly those in retail and hospitality - may see this giving them a fighting chance over the commercially crucial Christmas trading period. The government has thrown an emergency blanket over the economy this winter, but longer term, more fundamental reform to the energy supply market, its pricing and mechanics will be needed. Developing more cheap renewables, securing foreign supplies of liquid gas, drilling for more domestic fossil fuels, breaking the link between gas prices and electricity and pushing ahead with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and small and large scale nuclear have been part of the government's plan for nearly two years. What's new is the pressure applied by Vladimir Putin to do it as fast as possible. Stephen Phipson of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said businesses would ""warmly welcome"" the government support package. ""Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector and making immediately available the much-needed help companies have been calling for across the board."" However, he warned that energy prices were likely to remain high for more than six months and firms may need ""support for a longer period if we are to protect jobs and remain competitive"". Director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the price cap would give steelmakers ""the chance to get through the winter"". But he called on the government to ""rapidly reform the energy market to ensure longer-term competitive prices"". Smaller businesses have also been struggling with rising bills, with brewery bosses warning that pubs and restaurants could be forced to close after energy costs soared by as much as 300%. A landlord of one Essex pub told the BBC his energy bill had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the industry was ""relieved"" by the support ahead of the busy Christmas trading period, adding it would secure jobs.

"Russia has begun implementing plans to call up reservists to fight in Ukraine after suffering setbacks there President Vladimir Putin's order to mobilise 300,000 more Russians with military experience sparked protests on Wednesday More than 1,000 anti-mobilisation protesters are reported to have been arrested Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has not denied media reports that some protesters were given draft papers Meanwhile the BBC has spoken to young men fleeing over the border into Georgia - one of the few remaining countries Russians can get to without a visa And Ukraine is celebrating a prisoner exchange which saw more than 200 prisoners of war released by Russia They include more than 100 members of the Azov Battalion, hailed as heroes for mounting resistance at a steelworks in Mariupol Five British nationals also freed have arrived back in the UK Edited by Jeremy Gahagan Our live page coverage is now pausing. Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October. Following Russia's announcement yesterday thatthousands of extra troops will be called up to fight the war in Ukraine, a Russian military spokesman has said that around 10,000 Russians have already volunteered of their own accord on the first day of the mobilisation drive. ""About 10,000 citizens arrived at recruitment offices of their own accord without waiting for a summons,"" Vladimir Tsimlyansky said in comments quoted by Russian news agency Interfax. The BBC is unable to verify the figure. Over 1,300 protesters have been detained for protesting against the mobilisation announcement between Wednesday and today, according to the latest figures from Russian human rights NGO OVD-Info. Ben TobiasBBC News Mariana Mamonova appears heavily pregnant in a video of the prisoner exchange Mariana Mamonova, a Ukrainian medic who is more than eight months pregnant, is among the prisoners released by Russia. She can be seen in a video of the prisoner exchange, released by Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday. She was being held in the notorious Olenivka prison camp in the unrecognised Donetsk People's Republic after being captured in April in Mariupol. Speaking to the BBC before her release, her husband spoke about his fears over the wellbeing of his wife and unborn baby - the couple's first. ""A baby can't be kept in those conditions, so they could just take it away,"" Vasilii said. Mariana was reportedly held under extremely difficult conditions at the prison camp. A fellow prisoner, Anna Vorosheva, said she was in a cell with more than 20 other women when she first arrived and had to sleep on the floor. ""Straight away, everyone tried to help her - giving her food, making sure she got fresh air,"" Ms Vorosheva, who was released in July, told the BBC. Eventually she was moved to a smaller room with fewer people, and her cellmates ensured that she was able to sleep on one of the room's two beds each night. At first, Mariana assumed that she would be a priority for a prisoner swap. But as her due date at the end of September approached, she began to fear she would give birth in captivity, and became increasingly worried that her baby would be taken from her. Frustrated at the lack of news, her family decided to go public with Mariana's story in August, drawing attention to her case in the Ukrainian media. Still weeks passed with no progress, but finally - just days before she is due to give birth - her family received the good news that she had been released. Read Mariana's story here. Mariana Mamonova is a medic in the Ukrainian armed forces The mother of Aiden Aslin, one of the Britonsreleased in the prisoner swap last night, has expressed her elation at her son's return to the UK. ""I thought this day would never happen,"" Angela Wood told the BBC's Emma Vardy. ""I'm still in shock"". Aslin was sentenced to death in June in a Russian proxy courtafter being accused of being a mercenary in Ukraine. Wood said the sentencing had caused ""emotional stress"" for the family. âAt times I never thought I would see him alive again,"" she said. She said some of the details she's learned of Aslin's time in captivity have ""horrified"" her, and said he will need time to recover from the ordeal. She added that âAiden loved Ukraine and he loved the people,"" adding that he is now rebuilding his life with his fiancÃ©e. Frank GardnerSecurity correspondent Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman had chosen to make it a priority to help resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war Let's return briefly tolast night's prisoner swap. A well-placed Saudi source has
told BBC News that the 10 prisoners released by Russia yesterday, including 5
Britons, were not exchanged for anything tangible in return. A separate
prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia was brokered by Turkey but the release
of the 10 non-Ukrainians was reached through the personal involvement of the
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. The source said the Prince had chosen to make it a priority to help
resolve the issue of the ten prisoners of war and had been in conversation with both the
Russians and Ukrainians on the issue since April. Saudi Arabia already has a relationship with Russia through the oil
cartel Opec, but there is also a personal relationship between Vladimir Putin and the Crown Prince, known by his initials as MBS. The source explained that with Saudi Arabia taking a largely neutral
stance in the Ukraine war, Moscow was more likely to listen to a Saudi request
to release the 10 men than one coming from a Western leader. The source did not rule out the possibility of building on the success
of this release to look for further opportunities for Saudi Arabia to offer its
connections as a mediator. It is also possible, though, that Moscow now considers the Saudis owe
them a favour for this release. Sergei Lavrov has delivered his speech before the UN Security Council, one day after Russia's leader Vladimir Putin called forpartial military mobilisation. The Russian foreign minister rejected Western accusations of Russian abuses in Ukraine, calling instead for punishment of Kyiv's government. ""The United States and their allies, with the connivance of international human rights organisations, have been covering the crimes of the Kyiv regime,"" Lavrov claimed, after the Council had earlier heard multiple accounts of human rights abuses committed by Russian officials during the war. In his address, just after Lavrov, UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly described the invasion of Ukraine as nothing more than a ""war of conquest"" and an ""assault on the UN charter"". Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The UK foreign secretary says Britain and its allies now have information that Russia is planning to conduct sham referenda in parts of Ukraine it now occupies. James Cleverly wouldnât describe it as an escalation in the seven-month long war. But he emphasised that Britain would continue to support Ukraine with military and financial support â although that would not include British troops. It was essential, he told me in New York, to defend the principle that powerful countries with big armies could not invade their neighbours with impunity. He recognised that people in Britain and across the world were now feeling the pressure of rising food and energy prices, but he underlined the greatest pressure was being felt by Ukrainians. Asked about calls from some countries for a negotiated end to this war, Cleverly said Ukraine would decide when the time was right â when it did, Britain would support them. But, quoting Winston Churchill, he said you don't negotiate with a tiger when you have your head in its mouth. Over in New York City, where leaders are currently attending the UN General Assembly, we're hearing that Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers are staying away from each other. Dmytro Kuleba, of Ukraine, said he planned to ""keep a safe and social distance"" from Russia's Sergei Lavrov, Reuters news agency reported. Lavrov is due to address the UN Security Council at the Assembly - which has so far featured various high profile speeches condemning the war in Ukraine - this afternoon. Yesterday, in hisaddress, US President Joe Biden accused Russia of wanting to strip Ukraine of its right to ""exist as a state, as a people"". The UN's Secretary General Antonio Guterres has been speaking at a Security Council meeting in New York, where representatives of Ukraine and Russia are both present. Here are the key takeaways from his speech: From tomorrow to 27 September, four Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine - Donetsk and Luhansk
in the east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - will hold so-called referendums on joining Russia. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic declared the fourth and fifth days of voting as
public holidays, while the Luhansk People's Republic authorties have promised to announce
vote results on 28 September. Moscow-backed separatists have controlled large parts of the
industrial Donbas area since 2014, while the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia were
occupied after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. In a televised address on Wednesday, Putin said Russia needed to
support those in Ukraine who wanted to ""determine their own future"".
The EU has said it will not recognise the results of the votes. Today Russian news agency RIA Novosti shared an image
showing flyers it says are being handed out in  Luhansk. Under the headline ""Russia is the future"", the flyer
reads: ""We are united by a 1,000-year history. For centuries we were
part of the same great country. The break-up of the united state was a huge
political catastrophe: millions of relatives suddenly found themselves
separated by an artificial border. It's time to restore historical
justice."" This statement encapsulates Russia's claims to the region, which it says is part of ""the historical lands of Novorossiya"" - the 18th century area that was part of during the Russian Empire and which later became part of Ukraine. Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev has weighed in on the referendums, saying that once they are over ""it won't be Russia's right but its duty to protect the those regions"" - adding an attack on those lands will be an attack on Russia ""with all its consequences"". Former Russian President Dmitry
Medvedev seemed to square away any ambiguity with regards to the use of nuclear weapons. Medevedev said any weapons in Moscow's arsenal,
including strategic nuclear weapons, could be used to defend
territories joined to Russia from Ukraine, Reuters reported. Medvedev, who also serves as deputy chairman of Russia's
Security Council, said that referendums planned by Russian-installed and separatist authorities in large swathes of
Ukrainian territory will take place, and ""there is no going
back"", according to the news agency. ""The Western establishment and all citizens of Nato countries in general need to understand that Russia has chosen
its own path,"" he said. Laura GozziBBC News Returning to the news about last night's major prisoner exchange which saw Ukrainian Azov
fighters released alongside foreign nationals who fought for Ukraine. Azov fighters are part of Ukraine's national guard and have long been reviled in Russia, where they are described as Nazis. From the start of the war, President Putin has said that Russian troops have been fighting to liberate Ukraine from the Neo-Nazi regime. Many members of the Azov Regiment were entrenched in the Azovstal steel plant for weeks earlier this year, until they were taken captive by Russia. In July, the Russian Supreme Court recognised Ukraine's Azov Regiment as a terrorist organisation and banned its activities in Russia. At the time, the chairman of the Public Monitoring Commission of Moscow, Georgy Volkov, alleged that cannibalism was practised by Azov members, referring to what he said was the testimony of a captured militant. Yet, among those released last night were Azov
commander Denys Prokopenko and his deputy, Svyatoslav Palamar. The development has caused considerable anger and confusion among Russian pro-war commentators online. ""Will anyone explain what just happened? Will
anyone be held responsible for all this? Shame Stalin is not with us anymore,â
said one Telegram account. ""This
is worse than a crimeâ¦ and worse than a mistake. This is unbelievable stupidity. Or deliberate sabotage,â said
former military chief of pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk
Igor Strelkov. And
Telegram channel Rybar said: ""A serious
reputational blow no matter how you look at it."" The number of people crossing Finland's eastern border ""intensified"" overnight, but the Finnish Border Guard said the situation was under control. Earlier today, Finnish Defence Minister Antti Kaikkonen said Finland is closely monitoring the situation in light of President Vladimir Putin's order of military mobilisation for the war in Ukraine. Yesterday, Finnish border authorities issued a statement to combat misinformation circulating on social media, which suggested an alarming number of people were crossing the Russian-Finnish border. Following Vladimir Putinâs announcement of a call-up for thousands of extra reservists to fight in Ukraine, rumours were circulating online that people were fleeing Russia and crossing the border to neighbouring Finland. A Twitter post,externalpurported to show a border queue stretching âover 35kmâ (16 miles), it was liked and retweeted many thousands of times. But the video embedded in the tweet was originally posted three days ago on a TikTok account and is unconnected with President Putinâs speech. Finland has the longest land border with Russia in the European Union, spanning 1,300km (800 miles). If you're just joining us, here is a round-up of the day's main events so far: Â© 2025 BBC.

Thanks for joining us. Read more on our main storyhere. Before we close our live page coverage, here is a round-up of today's main events: Nada TawfikBBC News, New York The debate going on
in the UN Security Council meeting in New York reflects the dynamics we have seen
during this high-level week when it comes to the Ukrainian conflict. Ministers
from the West have again been urging accountability for Russia's
""crimes"" and its invasion. The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken
told the council chamber that the very international order was being shredded
before their eyes and that they could not let President Putin get away with it. Failure to do so, he said, would lead to a less secure, less peaceful world. It is important to remember that in March, 141 nations voted in an emergency
General Assembly session to rebuke Russia for its invasion and demand it
withdraw its forces immediately, completely and unconditionally. The majority
of the world does not dispute that Putinâs actions are a violation of
the UN charter. Today, again almost every nation expressed alarm over threats
of nuclear conflict and reiterated their support for investigations into
atrocities committed against civilians. But that doesnât mean they agree
that the best way forward is the diplomatic and economic isolation of Russia. Heavyweights on the council, China and non-permanent member India, said the
immediate priority should be a ceasefire and talks to end the conflict, not
unilateral sanctions. Responding to that argument. Blinken said: ""Diplomacy cannot and must not be used as a cudgel to impose on Ukraine a
settlement that cuts against the UN charter or rewards Russia for violating
it."" Many Ukrainian Prisoners of War (POWs) who were released in a prisoner swap yesterday show signs of having been tortured while in Russian detention, according to the head of Ukraine's military intelligence. ""Many of them have been brutally tortured,"" Kyrylo Budanov said in comments cited by AFP. Ukraine's interior minister, Denys Monastyrskyi, added that some of the Ukrainian POWs released are currently in hospital receiving rehabilitation treatment, Reuters reports. Cars queue to cross the border from Russia to Finland at the Nuijamaa check point Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin has told a news conference her government is looking at reducing Russian tourism and transit through Finland. The Nordic country shares a 1,300km (800 miles) land border with Russia, which is the largest in the European Union. Finland has been concerned about growing tensions between the West and Russia and it joined Nato a couple of months ago as a way of protecting its sovereignty and defending its territory. But now that Vladimir Putin has decided to draft up more Russians to fight in his war in Ukraine, Finland has experienced an ""intensified"" influx of people crossing over into its territory from its eastern border with Russia. In August, EU foreign ministers agreed to suspend a visa agreement with Moscow, making it harder for Russian citizens to obtain entry to the bloc. Ukraine and some member states had called for a blanket ban, but others like France and Germany were opposed. More than a million Russian citizens have travelled to the EU since the invasion of Ukraine in February. Russian men fleeing Vladimir Putin's military call-up will be ""warmly welcomed"" in Germany, the country's justice minister has said. In a tweet, Marco Buschmann extended his welcome to ""anyone who hates Putin's path and loves liberal democracy"". Separately, Germany's interior minister Nancy Faeser told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper that Russian deserters threatened with ""serious repression"" could ""as a rule"" receive protection. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has said his country will
not issue humanitarian visas to Russian men fleeing mobilisation
orders. Lipavsky told the Czech news server Novinky.cz that while he
understood their motivations, such cases did not meet the conditions for a
humanitarian visa. The Czech Republic joins other countries such as Latvia which has
said it will not provide sanctuary to Russians seeking to avoid the draft on
humanitarian grounds. Germany, on the other hand, says it will do so. The Czech Foreign Ministry has also confirmed it has written to
two NHL teams to say Prague would not issue visas to Russian ice hockey players
wishing to travel to the Czech capital to take part in the NHL's Global Series
games. Prague will host two matches between the San Jose Sharks and the
Nashville Predators, both of which have Russian players, on 7 and 8 October.

"This video can not be played Laura Ellis, whose baby Theo died at a maternity unit: ""There was just a catalogue of errors"" More than half of maternity units in England fail consistently to meet safety standards, BBC analysis of official statistics shows. Health regulator theCare Quality Commission (CQC),externalrates 7% of units as posing a high risk of avoidable harm. A further 48% require improvement. The figures are slightly worse than a few years ago, despite several attempts to transform maternity care. The regulator says the pace of improvement has been disappointing. In most cases, pregnancy and birth are a positive and safe experience for women and their families, says the CQC. But when things do go wrong, it is important to understand what happened and whether the outcome could have been different. Laura Ellis lost her newborn son. She checked out the CQC rating of her local hospital, Frimley Park, when she was pregnant. Maternity services were good. But Laura did not realise the unit had been told that it required improvement on safety. She went into labour after an easy pregnancy, and got to the birth centre around 16:40. But within an hour it became clear that the baby was breech, meaning that instead of being head-first in the womb, the legs or bottom were down, making delivery harder. Laura remembers that there seemed to be a ""complete sense of panic"" in the room and that no-one seemed to have any idea what they should be doing. Just after 18:00, the baby's legs and chest had been delivered and the midwife said she could feel a heartbeat. But a few minutes later, a senior midwife tried to listen for it with a stethoscope - and could not hear anything. Laura says she was told that the stethoscope was broken. When her son, Theo, was fully delivered at 18:13, his heart had stopped beating. Medical staff tried to resuscitate him. At one stage, the oxygen canister used on Theo ran out, before being replaced. Laura and her husband James watched, slowly coming to the realisation that their son was probably not going to survive. Doctors and midwives stopped resuscitation after 39 minutes. Laura describes Theo as ""the most perfect baby, just absolutely beautiful"". ""It was just so hard. So hard to deal with. So hard to leave as well. How would you leave your baby in hospital when you should be taking them home?"" Frimley Park NHS Foundation Trust says it is extremely sorry for what happened. It says it has made a number of changes since Theo died, including an emergency response if a baby is unexpectedly breech during advanced labour. If you are affected by issues raised in this article help and support is available via theBBC Action Line. If you or someone you know needs support for issues relating tobereavementand emotional distress,these organisations may be also able to help. The BBC analysed the most recent CQC safety ratings, published in September 2022, for 137 maternity units in England and found: Nine were given the lowest possible rating of inadequate for safety, meaning urgent action is required 66 required improvement to reduce risk to mothers and babies, and ensure legal requirements on safety are met 62 had a good rating for safety None were given the top rating of outstanding that would mean a comprehensive safety system is in place It is hard to give a direct comparison between the current ratings and older ones, because the CQC has changed its approach to inspections. Also, during the pandemic it moved to a risk-based approach, looking at units it was more concerned about. But in December 2016, 50% of maternity and gynaecology units had good safety ratings, compared to 45% now. Victoria Vallance, the CQC's director of secondary care, says inspectors often find the same problems in the maternity services they visit, for example, not managing risk when women are deteriorating. ""We are worried. We are concerned,"" she said. ""We have not seen the pace of improvement consistently, nationally, that we would hope and expect to see across maternity services."" The CQC only inspects in England. Northern Ireland's Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority has not inspected care in maternity units yet - but will in autumn next year. NHS Wales says it has recognised the need for improvement in maternity services. The Scottish government says  it is transforming maternity services with its Best Start programme. There have been a series of serious safety scandals at maternity units in England. Morecambe Bay, and Shrewsbury and Telford have been investigated. East Kent is expected to report back next - and another review has started into problems in Nottingham. Royal College of Midwives chief executive Gill Walton says there is an ""ongoing crisis in maternity services"" and more funds are badly needed. ""Every time there's an inquiry, there's a flurry of 'we're going to do this, this and this. And then it falls off the agenda,"" she said. The NHS in England needs 2,000 more midwives and almost 500 obstetricians. But more than 500 midwives left the profession last year. The government recently invested Â£127m to grow the NHS maternity workforce and improve neonatal care. This is on top of spending Â£95m a year to boost maternity staff numbers. England's chief midwifery officer, Professor Jacqueline Dunkley-Bent, admits this is one of the most challenging times in her career. ""One of my key priorities is to ensure a safe and personal care for everybody using our NHS services in England regardless of postcode, socio-economic status, or colour of their skin,"" she said.

After consultation with the CQC, the BBC analysed the overall and safe ratings for each unit that had a ""Maternity"" Service. For anyone pregnant or planning to deliver at their local hospital it is important to look at theCQC's,externallatest report into their local hospital, and check what it says about maternity care and safety. If anyone has any concerns they should talk to their GP, midwife or obstetrician. Every year the NHS in England pays compensation claims when care goes wrong. Last year, there were 10,284 negligence claims.  Of those, 12% - 1,243 - were for maternity. But the money paid out for these claims is far, far more than any other medical specialty. Maternity claims are expensive, partly because they tend to be an initial lump sum and then annual payments for the rest of the mum or baby's life. The NHS expects that 60% of the money it will pay out for medical mistakes that happened last year will be maternity cases. That would be just under Â£8bn, forecast to be paid out over many years. Another way to see that money is that it is over four times more than the annual salary of all midwives and maternity doctors and nurses. Professor Dunkley-Bent says: ""I'm keen that we reduce those claims. ""We want to ensure that our babies and mums are cared for safely, that they have safe and personal maternity care, which means that if we get it right first time, those claims will reduce. ""One baby dying is one to many. It's absolutely heart-wrenching."" The English picture is reflected across the UK. Of all clinical negligence claims NHS Wales handled last year, 18% were about maternity care. Northern Ireland's figures show 16%. Scotland does not break down maternity claims alone, but says 18% of the compensation cases it looks at involve maternity and gynaecology. Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Daniel Evans and Tamara Harvey will join the RSC next June The Royal Shakespeare Company is to have a woman as a permanent artistic director for the first time in its 60-year history. Tamara Harvey, who currently runs the Theatr Clwyd in Mold, north Wales, will share the job with Daniel Evans, who runs Chichester Festival Theatre. The two new joint artistic directors will replace Gregory Doran, who stepped down earlier this year after a decade. The pair will join the RSC, based in Stratford-upon-Avon, next June. Harvey said in a statement: ""We bring a shared belief in all that the RSC can be - a home for radical, relevant theatre made by artists from across the UK and the wider world. A global community inspired by Shakespeare, bringing together myriad voices to tell the stories of our time - and of all time."" Theatre boss rescues panto by starring in it Theatre childcare needs 'culture change' Harvey's first professional theatre job was as assistant director at Shakespeare's Globe under Mark Rylance, and she took over Theatr Clwyd in 2015. Under her leadership, the venue has staged shows ranging from the Olivier Award-winning Home, I'm Darling to a musical titledThe Assassination of Katie Hopkins. She is now directing a new musical adaptation of Enid Blyton's The Famous Five, which will get its world premiere in Mold on Friday. Evans, meanwhile, was a member of the RSC as an actor before turning to directing. He ran Sheffield Theatres for seven years and was shortlisted for the artistic director job at the National Theatre in 2013.

"Home heating oil customers in Northern Ireland are to get a one-off payment Home heating oil customers in Northern Ireland are to get a one-off payment of Â£100 to help with rising energy costs. That will be in addition to a cap on the unit price of electricity announced by the government on Wednesday. People who use gas to heat their homes will also benefit from a cap on the unit price of that fuel. The modest support for oil users reflects the fact that gas prices have risen much more sharply than oil in the last year. The Â£100 will be delivered as a top-up to the Â£400 Energy Bills Support payment, which is going to all UK households. In a statement, the government said: ""The government will also provide an additional payment of Â£100 to households across the UK who are not able to receive support for their heating costs through the Energy Price Guarantee. ""This might be because they live in an area of the UK that is not served by the gas grid and is to compensate for the rising costs of alternative fuels such as heating oil."" The Northern Ireland Consumer Council said heating oil currently costs more than Â£520 for 500 litres, compared with about Â£220 for the same amount a year ago. Peter McClenaghan from the council said: ""The commitment from the prime minister that support will be provided to Northern Ireland consumers whether they use heating oil or natural gas is welcome. ""The Consumer Council is keen to see more progress in the development of support for consumers who primarily use home heating oil to heat their homes. ""This should be support over and above the additional payment of Â£100 to all households across the UK who are not served by the gas grid."" Stormont Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said he did not believe the offer of Â£100 of oil would ""cut it in any way, shape or form"" and revealed he had not been made aware of the plan prior to its announcement. ""I'm in the process of continuing to raise this with various government ministers to make sure that they realise that this is not going to go far enough for people in Northern Ireland,"" he toldBBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons told BBC a Â£100 oil voucher wouldn't ""cut it in any way, shape or form"" Mr Lyons welcomed price caps but acknowledged that price rises due in October would go ahead and consumers may not see any benefit until November. ""It's not going to take away all of the pain that people are going to be facing but it does stop it from getting worse,"" he added. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the government plan for the Â£100 heating oil payment as an ""insult"". ""They have no idea what real people are going through,"" he tweeted. ""The â¦âªSDLPâ¬â© are proposing 1,000 litres of oil for households. Only radical action will protect families this winter."" Colum Eastwood said the government had no idea ""what real people are going through"" The broader scheme means energy suppliers in Northern Ireland will reduce bills by up to 17p/kWh for electricity and 4.2p/kWh for gas. When the cap was announced for the rest of the UK, the government said it was expected to save the typical household Â£1,000 a year based on current energy prices from October. Northern Ireland businesses are also being promised an energy cap similar to that which has beenannounced for the rest of the UK. Wholesale energy prices for businesses will be capped at ""less than half"" anticipated winter levels under a huge government support package. The Energy Bill Relief Scheme will offer discounts for all firms for six months from 1 October. Hospitals, schools and other settings such as community halls and churches will also get help. Northern Ireland is in a different energy market from the rest of the UK so Northern Ireland businesses will get a scheme based on the same criteria and offering comparable support but ""recognising the different market fundamentals"". Households have been dealing with big increases in their energy bills Stormont Finance Minister Conor Murphy has said the announcement did ""not provide the support that citizens and businesses here need"". ""The promise of equivalent support without the underpinning detail does nothing to reassure businesses,"" he added. ""Most businesses are anxious about how they will make it through the winter. ""Businesses need certainty now to enable them to plan and to provide reassurance to their employees."" The trade body Retail NI said it was ""hugely disappointing"" that more clarity was not provided on the energy cap. ""The government needs to ensure that a clear date is provided for the introduction of the energy bill cap, a business rates holiday and VAT reductions to support local small businesses,"" chief executive Glyn Roberts said. Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said it was ""simply unacceptable"" that businesses in Northern Ireland did not yet have the full details of how support would be provided. ""We need urgent clarity on how these measures will be carried forward, thousands of businesses are on the brink with many concerned how they will get through the winter,"" he said.

"Steel manufacturing requires a lot of energy Energy bills for UK businesses will be cut by around half their expected level this winter under a huge government support package. The scheme will fix wholesale gas and electricity prices for firms for six months from 1 October, shielding businesses from crippling costs. Hospitals, schools and charities will also get help, the government said. It comes after ministers announced a multi-billion pound plan to help households with bills for two years. Analysts suggest the help for firms and households combined could cost up to Â£150bn. Industry groups welcomed the package but warned further support may be needed after the winter. It is understood the scheme will be reviewed after three months with an option to extend support for ""vulnerable businesses"" - but it is not known what sectors come under the category. Wholesale prices, which are what suppliers pay for energy in bulk before they distribute it to customers, are expected to be fixed for all non-domestic energy customers at Â£211 per MWh for electricity and Â£75 per MWh for gas. Those rates will be the base cost, to which other add-ons, such as standing charges will be added by suppliers. Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Pubs warning: 'My energy bill tripled to Â£35,000' Independent analysts Cornwall Insight said the plan marked a ""substantial"" 45% discount on wholesale energy prices at the end of last week. The government said the scheme would apply to companies which had agreed fixed deals at higher prices on or after 1 April, when energy bills started to surge. Those on variable and flexible tariffs will also be eligible. Companies do not need to contact suppliers as the discount will automatically be applied to their bills, with savings seen from October but received from November. Josh Farrant, manager at The Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, said the pub was facing a hike in energy bills from Â£44,000 to around Â£124,000 a year before the government's wholesale cap was announced. ""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" he said. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things."" ""It doesn't mean the panic is over. It's going to run for six months, then we'll see."" Read more reaction to the energy support for businesses,here. Guy Adams, who runs the Isle of Barra Beach Hotel in the Hebrides, said he had been quoted a 377% increase in his energy bills before the cap, which ""would probably have finished us off"". ""At present our cheapest room rate is Â£110 per night. We would have had to raise that to Â£415 per night,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. However, he said because his seasonal hotel will close for the winter and reopen in May, it was ""absolutely impossible"" to set prices for bookings given the support package will only run until April. ""The fact that it is going to be reviewed in six months is not practical,"" he added. Prime Minister Liz Truss said the government understood the ""huge pressure"" businesses, charities and public sector organisations faced with bills. She added that the new scheme would provide ""certainty and peace of mind"". Bur Labour business spokesman Jonathan Reynolds said there were still questions about ""how much this will cost and who will pay for it"". Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney said the ""delayed announcement"" left businesses ""under a cloud of damaging uncertainty"". ""The government have no plan beyond these next six months, paralysing businesses who need to make decisions for the long term,"" she added. The support will apply to all non-domestic energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. A scheme offering comparable support will be established in Northern Ireland. Officials have not said how much the package will cost the taxpayer, but Cornwall Insight estimates it at around Â£25bn. Energy-intensive industries, such as steel-making, have warned that businesses could go bust due to their energy costs, which have surged since Russia invaded Ukraine. Unlike households, businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, which is the maximum amount a supplier can charge per unit of energy. It means non-domestic bills have soared even higher. The government announced earlier this month that bills for a typical household would be limited to Â£2,500 annually until 2024 under a separate scheme. On Wednesday, it also said: New laws would be introduced to ensure landlords passed the discount on to tenants who pay all-inclusive bills. An additional Â£100 payment would go to households that do not receive support for their heating costs, such as those not served by the gas grid. The big problem with this support for business is its shelf life. Few businesses plan with only a six-month time horizon and there will be some whose plans to cut production, close premises and let staff go will not change as a result of this intervention. But many others - particularly those in retail and hospitality - may see this giving them a fighting chance over the commercially crucial Christmas trading period. The government has thrown an emergency blanket over the economy this winter, but longer term, more fundamental reform to the energy supply market, its pricing and mechanics will be needed. Developing more cheap renewables, securing foreign supplies of liquid gas, drilling for more domestic fossil fuels, breaking the link between gas prices and electricity and pushing ahead with hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, and small and large scale nuclear have been part of the government's plan for nearly two years. What's new is the pressure applied by Vladimir Putin to do it as fast as possible. Stephen Phipson of Make UK, which represents manufacturers, said businesses would ""warmly welcome"" the government support package. ""Government has delivered a scheme which is simple to understand, giving reassurance to the business sector and making immediately available the much-needed help companies have been calling for across the board."" However, he warned that energy prices were likely to remain high for more than six months and firms may need ""support for a longer period if we are to protect jobs and remain competitive"". Director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, said the price cap would give steelmakers ""the chance to get through the winter"". But he called on the government to ""rapidly reform the energy market to ensure longer-term competitive prices"". Smaller businesses have also been struggling with rising bills, with brewery bosses warning that pubs and restaurants could be forced to close after energy costs soared by as much as 300%. A landlord of one Essex pub told the BBC his energy bill had risen from about Â£13,000 a year to Â£35,000. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, said the industry was ""relieved"" by the support ahead of the busy Christmas trading period, adding it would secure jobs.

"Jamal Edwards gave Ed Sheeran his first big break 12 years ago Pop singer Ed Sheeran has paid tribute to Jamal Edwards, saying he owed his career to his late friend's support. The star was speaking at a memorial for Edwards, who founded the online music platform SBTV and was made an MBE for services to music in 2014. The entrepreneur died in February at the age of 31. ""I really don't think I would have been given the opportunities that I was given had it not been for Jamal putting his arm around me,"" Sheeran said. ""I was slogging on the acoustic singer-songwriter scene for a very long time, just blending in... And Jamal was this sort of tastemaker."" Cocaine sparked Jamal Edwards death, coroner says Tributes flood in for entrepreneur Jamal Edwards Edwards gave Sheeran his first break on in 2010, getting him to perform the future single You Need Me, I Don't Need You on his YouTube channel. That video was how the star's manager, Stuart Camp, and record label Atlantic first discovered him. ""A lot of people assume that [because] I write songs and I perform, I probably would"" have become famous anyway, Sheeran said. ""I actually don't agree with that... I was one of many. ""I really don't think I would have been allowed through certain doors if it hadn't been for Jamal,"" he continued, adding: ""He was just all about finding people and showing people new opportunities, at a time where the industry was mostly based in London."" This video can not be played Jessie Ware and Lewis Capaldi perform at Jamal Edwards' memorial concert Tuesday's memorial also served as the inaugural fundraising event for the Jamal Edwards Self-Belief Trust, which aims to help young people at risk of homelessness, and to provide entry points to the media industry for people who might not otherwise have the opportunity. ""His generosity is what we want to continue,"" his mother, the Loose Women presenter Brenda Edwards, told BBC News. ""He was always about championing young people. That was his main aim."" Edwards had also devoted his free time to helping the homeless, she added. ""He would go to the homeless shelter and give food out and give talks to young people every single Christmas. I would cook Christmas dinner... and he wouldn't be back until 9:30 or 10 o'clock at night - and we'd have to wait until he came back. ""So we're just going to try and do our best to continue exactly what he's done,"" she added. ""Nobody can do what Jamal did, but I'm going to give it a good try."" Edwards founded SBTV ""on a Â£20 phone""  while he was still at school - but the channel went on to launch the careers of artists like Dave, Skepta, Ed Sheeran and Emeli SandÃ©. It was pivotal in documenting and promoting the rise of London's grime scene, which Edwards saw as ""like the punk movement, in terms of lyrics and rebellious attitude"". As his fortune grew, he expanded into other entrepreneurial ventures, often with a focus on improving the lives of disadvantaged young people; and shared his experiences in the best-selling book  Self Belief: How to Be a Success on Your Own Terms. He died suddenly in February from a heart attack after taking cocaine and drinking alcohol, a coroner concluded. Edwards' mother, Brenda, and Tracey Parry-Knight, CEO of the Jamal Edwards Trust, gave a heartfelt and emotional speech Tuesday's memorial, held in London's new Here at Outernet venue, also saw performances from Jessie Ware, Lewis Capaldi and Max Cyrus, with Hollywood star Terry Crews hosting the gala. The event featured a star-studded auction which had a host of ""money-can't-buy experiences"" including a meal-for-two with Luther star Idris Elba, and a David Beckham-signed Inter Miami t-shirt. Organisers said the event raised more than Â£100,000 on the night. Crews, who is best known for the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, said he had first met Edwards on a promotional trip to London in 2014. ""We did the media thing but afterwards, we started to talk. And I just was like, 'Man, I love what you're about. I love everything you're doing. How can I help you? ""So we exchanged numbers, and every time I came to London ever since, I sat down with Jamal and hung out with him. ""We had all these visions and all these plans... And man, when I found out that he passed, I couldn't believe it."" Crews said he wanted to be involved in the fundraiser to ""to continue the mission that Jamal started"", calling him a ""visionary"" who had changed hundreds of people's lives. Jessie Ware, who dedicated a cover of What You Won't Do For Love to Edwards, agreed that he had left a significant impact on Britain's music scene. ""He was the platform for so many artists that are leading the way in music,"" she said, remembering him as a ""generous, warm, funny"" friend, with whom she shared a dance at Sheeran's wedding. ""His legacy lives everywhere, which is such a special, important thing,"" she added. ""I'm sure he'll be somewhere watching this [event] and be really annoyed that he's not in the room, on the dance floor."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Liz Truss: ""I will always work to make sure we are helping those who are struggling."" Prime Minister Liz Truss has said she is prepared to take ""difficult decisions"" such as removing a cap on bankers' bonuses to boost the economy. In an interview with the BBC, Ms Truss said that spurring economic growth may mean doing unpopular things. Her government is considering removing a cap on bankers' bonuses as part of a post-Brexit shake-up of City rules. Speaking in New York ahead of a meeting with President Joe Biden, the PM said she was about ""delivering for people"". BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asked Ms Truss whether she was happy to see bankers getting bigger bonuses and for the rich to get richer. ""What I want to see is a growing economy,"" Ms Truss said. ""If that means taking difficult decisions which are going to help Britain become more competitive, help Britain become more attractive, help more investment flow into our country, yes, I'm absolutely prepared to make those decisions."" Tax cuts expected in mini-budget Treasury refuses to publish UK economic forecast Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Funeral honours Queen's 'lifelong sense of duty' Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Pat McFadden, said there was nothing difficult about lifting the cap on bankers' bonuses. ""This is a bizarre move that will do nothing to support growth, and comes straight from the tired Tory playbook on trickle-down economics which haven't worked for them over the last decade,"" the Labour MP said. President Biden tweeted earlier that he was ""sick and tired"" of the theory that cutting taxes for business and the wealthy would see the benefits ""trickle down"" into the pockets of poorer workers. Although apparently not intended as a swipe at Ms Truss, the comment underlines the political differences between the two leaders ahead of their meeting. The prime minister's official spokesman said it was ""ludicrous"" to suggest President Biden was referring to Ms Truss in the tweet. He said the world's democracies were ""not prescriptive"" in how they achieve economic growth. Ms Truss hasadmitted a new trade deal with the United Statesis unlikely in the ""short-to-medium term"" and that no discussions are currently underway. The UK government had previously promised a post-Brexit trade deal with the US by 2022. There has been lots of talk of a new era in the last few weeks, for obvious reasons. Now, with political argument returning, it is language the prime minister is embracing, about her premiership and the challenges she - we - face. 'We are entering a new era. It is a more insecure era,' she told me. Insecure abroad, insecure at home. The core of her political strategy is turbo-charging economic growth â and, for now at least, being willing to embrace the unpopular. ""Difficult decisions"" as she put it - such as allowing bankers to get bigger bonuses. There are two big questions for her: will it work, and will people like it? She doesn't have long to find out the answers, with a general election two-ish years away. In her Chris Mason interview, Ms Truss said she wanted to forge closer ties with the UK's allies. ""It is a more insecure era. We face an increasingly aggressive Russia, an assertive China. We need to work more closely with our allies, and we also need to get the British economy growing so that we have that security for all of our citizens."" In a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in New York, Ms Truss agreed to enhance UK-France co-operation on energy to cut costs for households. In Downing Street's account of the meeting, there was no mention of contentious issues that have strained Anglo-French relations since the UK left the European Union. Neither the unauthorised migrant crossings of the English Channel, nor the post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland were discussed, in a meeting described as ""constructive"" by Downing Street. Mr Macron and Ms Truss were meeting face-to-face for the first time, weeks after the she questioned whether the French President was a friend or foe. ""I now believe in proof, in results,"" Mr Macron said. ""There is a will to re-engage, to move on and to show that we are allies and friends in a complex world."" Speaking earlier, Ms Truss said ""we are facing incredibly tough economic times"" after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the aftershocks of the Covid-19 pandemic ""pushed up energy prices"". She said higher energy bills were ""a price worth paying"" for the UK's long-term security. Typical household energy bills will rise to Â£2,500 a year from 1 October, in part due toreductions in Russian gas exportsduring the war in Ukraine. Under Ms Truss's plans, energy bills will be frozen at that level for the next two years. The scheme is likely to be paid for by increased government borrowing, but the full details will be announced on Friday as part of a mini-Budget. On Wednesday, Ms Truss will use her speech to the United Nations General Assembly to rally support for Ukraine and highlight the threat from authoritarian states such as Russia and China. The PM will argue that democratic nations should prioritise economic growth and security to win the new era of strategic competition. Ms Truss will also reiterate her commitment to protecting the UK and its allies, including by increasing defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2030. ""Just as we are building a plan for growth at home, we are also developing a new blueprint for our engagement with the world,"" the PM is expected to say. ""We will build resilience and collective security - because they are vital for freedom and democracy.""

"Hundreds of thousands of people filed past the Queen's coffin as she lay in state A man who tried to grab the flag draped over the Queen's coffin as she lay in state did not believe she was dead, a court has heard. The prosecution claims Muhammad Khan wanted to look in the coffin to ""check for himself"" the Queen was there. Mr Khan, 28, also allegedly planned to go to royal residences to ""try to make contact"" with the monarch. He was granted bail on condition he remains in a mental health hospital until his next court hearing. Doctors assessed Mr Khan as not fit to take part in proceedings at Westminster Magistrates' Court, where he appeared charged with two offences under the Public Order Act. The court heard he was suffering from delusions and the judge told him: ""At the time when you were in Westminster you didn't accept that the Queen was dead and that was the reason you were moving towards the coffin to satisfy yourself that she was."" He added: ""He is delusional still and thinks the Queen is not dead, thinks King Charles has something to do with it and may go to Windsor Castle to pay his respects, but also because he still thinks she is alive."" Prosecution lawyer Luke Staton, told the court Mr Khan had reached Westminster Hall when he was seen by officers to approach the coffin. ""He stepped off the carpet in the direction of the catafalque, then grabbed hold of the Royal Standard flag draped over the coffin with both of his hands,"" Mr Staton said. The court heard Mr Khan was quickly detained, arrested and interviewed by police. ""The defendant did express the idea that the Queen is not dead and that he approached the coffin because he wanted to check for himself,"" said Mr Staton. ""He did say, prior to the state funeral, he was planning on going to the funeral. ""He planned to write to the Royal Family and if they did not reply he planned to go to Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace and Balmoral to try to speak to the Queen."" The court heard Mr Khan said if he was unsuccessful that he ""would have to trespass in order to try and make contact"", and when asked how many times he would try, replied: ""As long as I'm living."" Mr Khan was among about 250,000 people who filed through the hall between 17:00 Wednesday and early on Monday morning to pay their respects.

"Prepare for the roaring return of politics. Families, businesses and the country face grave threats: soaring prices, crippling fuel costs and the prospect of recession. It is two-and-a-half months - 76 days - since Boris Johnson said he was resigning as prime minister, draining his already crippled government of its remaining authority. And then, a little over 48 hours after Liz Truss became prime minister, the Queen died. What many described as a zombie government had been replaced by a Trappist one; politics understandably falling silent during the period of mourning. But, with the funeral of Queen Elizabeth now over, the arguments resume - and the demands for action will be loud. Tax cuts expected in mini-budget Chris Mason: No honeymoon period for Liz Truss Truss-Biden meeting postponed until after Queen's funeral The prime minister is already on her first foreign trip in the job, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. While there, Ms Truss will meet plenty of world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, for a re-arranged one-on-one conversation that had originally been scheduled to happen in London. No matter that it felt like the United Nations gathered in London for the funeral of the late Queen. This is the actual UN. It will mean the returning political conversation will have a diplomatic air - in its opening few hours at least - rather than an intense domestic scrappiness. But that will be back before you know it. This is a government that wants to give the impression that it is in a hurry, and it has catching up to do. So there will be a blitz of announcements between now and the weekend. We're told the new government's overriding mission is delivering economic growth. And, in the short term, there are two other priorities: help with energy bills and a plan for the NHS. Expect a sense of continuity Johnson on some issues, such as support for Ukraine. And expect a hawkish scepticism about China from Ms Truss when she addresses the UN. The long journey from the warmth ofDavid Cameron taking Chinese President Xi Jinping for a pintjust seven years ago to the current downright frostiness continues. On the economy, there is a markedly different approach. The strategy is economic growth, even if the hoped-for means of delivering it cause a row. It is in that context that we should seethe plan to lift the cap on bankers' bonuses, an idea which, in isolation, would appear to many to be politically crazy when so, so many people are struggling to pay for their groceries or fill up their car. But expect to hear ministers argue it means the very best (read very best paid bankers in the world) will want to ply their lucrative, economy-expanding trade here again, and in so doing - or at least so the theory goes - pay lots of tax in the UK. The call for growth means we'll also hear about fracking and the licensing of drilling for oil in the North Sea, with the added justification of increasing the UK's energy security in an uncertain world. These ideas, alongside the tax cuts promised by Ms Truss in her leadership campaign, will be at the core of the mini Budget presented by the new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng on Friday. Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng will deliver a mini Budget this week Long gone will be the mantra of balancing the books from the era of Mr Cameron and George Osborne. Instead, we see the prospect of falling taxes, a vast rise in spending to help with energy bills and little expectation of spending cuts elsewhere. And so key among the tools and techniques deployed in the hope of economic growth: borrowing. Big time. Incidentally, central to the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's diagnosis of Britain's contemporary problems is a fascinating overlap with his new opponent, Ms Truss - the sclerotic growth of the last decade. But expect the suggested remedies and medicines from the two sides to differ considerably. And so the rows will be stark, the ideological dividing lines clear, and the stakes high. What then of energy bills and the NHS? The public row about bills may have paused when the Queen died. But the pain did not. One reporter friend of mine once told me about news that ""it is not old until it's told"". The government's plan to help with energy billshas been announced but it was rapidly overtaken by events at Balmoral, where the Queen died. This video can not be played WATCH: Liz Truss announces energy price guarantee for next two years The precise nature and cost of the help hasn't been comprehensively explained, examined and scrutinised. In the coming days, that process will begin - and the plan to help businesses will be set out too. The rather more sluggish help for companies compared to households is, those in government explain, because the energy market for businesses is much more complicated. Despite Ms Truss's initial aversion to what she called ""handouts"", the scale of the crisis had the capacity to bankrupt people and firms - and so bankrupt her government before she began, making a big intervention inevitable. And the intervention is big. It is considerably more expensive than the furlough scheme and, in reality, a blank cheque, for it is impossible to know what the overall cost will be given the fluctuating price of gas. The argument inside government is that the alternative would have been more expensive, both in its social costs and on the exchequer. And then there is the NHS. We can expect an announcement about plans for the winter from the new Health Secretary for England and Deputy Prime Minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey. Waits to get an ambulance, waits to get a GP appointment, waits to get an operation are long, long and long for many. That matters for millions and, politically, is potentially incredibly dangerous for ministers. A tough winter for the NHS, the prospect of industrial action looming, added towhat we are already seeing in the justice system, leaves some senior figures in the Labour Party pondering whether a critique of the government centred on examples of state failure - where the infrastructure of what ministers manage is simply not working - would hit home. If examples of this really start to stack up, the political peril for the prime minister is obvious. The best ministers can hope for is to keep the NHS out of the headlines. That would be a metric of success. But achieving it will, I suspect, be near impossible. Ms Truss has inherited a party that has spent the summer scrapping with itself and where a chunk of her backbenchers are sceptical of both her and her economic strategy. She inherits, too, a party that has been in government for 12 years. Eternal youth is no easier to achieve in politics than it is in life, although Conservative MPs hope yet another facelift at the top, a new leader, may tempt the electorate to look at them afresh. The opinion polls, for now at least, suggest the new prime minister has quite the challenge ahead. Labour, the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats each have their tails up and a general election is just two-ish years away. From the silence and solemnity of the last 10 days, politics is now back and it's going to be noisy.

"New Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng The Treasury is considering removing a cap on bankers' bonuses as part of a post-Brexit shake-up of City rules. Sources said no final decisions had been made, but confirmed chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng considered it a way of making London a more attractive place for global banks to do business. City bosses have long complained about the EU-wide bonus rules which cap bonuses at twice an employee's salary. They say they lead to higher base pay that pushes up banks' fixed costs. Those costs cannot be adjusted in line with the firm's financial performance, they add, making the UK less attractive than the US or Asia. People close to Mr Kwarteng confirmedreports in the Financial Times,externalthat the new chancellor is considering the move. Kwasi Kwarteng: Chancellor who likes a challenge Review of workers' employment rights scrapped Critics have argued that uncapped bonuses lead to the kind of excessive risk taking that spawned the financial crisis of 2008. But others argue that other new rules that can hold senior managers personally and potentially criminally responsible for misconduct, plus the ability to claw back bonuses years after they are granted, achieve a sufficient disincentive. Taking the lid off bankers' pay at a time when many households are facing hardship from the rising cost of living will undoubtedly provoke outrage in many quarters. The proposal ""sends a rather confused signal when people are being squeezed in terms of the cost of living, and the government is trying to encourage pay restraint in the public sector"", Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, told the BBC. ""To appear to allow bankers to have bigger bonuses at the same time, doesn't look very well timed. There may be some longer term arguments for pursing this policy but I think the timing would be very bad if they did it now."" Rachel Winter, from Killick & Co, told the BBC: ""It's an absolutely terrible time for this headline when you've got inflation [at] a 40-year high, you've got so many people struggling with the cost of living, do we really want to be reading headlines about banker bonuses? ""Arguably the banks do pay a lot of tax, so I think the chancellor is looking at ways to boost the UK economy to get more banks to come to London, to stay in London and pay more tax."" Removing the cap is just one of a number of deregulation initiatives being considered. The government is also keen to relax rules limiting the amount insurance and pension funds can invest in assets that are harder to sell at short notice - such as long-term infrastructure projects. These rules are part of pan-European regulations collectively known as Solvency II. But the Bank of England is concerned that relaxing the rules could expose pensioners' savings to greater long-term risk and that lowering the amount of ready cash firms are required to hold could see them pay out any money freed up to their shareholders rather than invest in projects favoured by the government. Pitting the Treasury and the financial services industry against the Bank of England is seen as a key test of the Bank's independence and senior officials at the Bank have privately conceded the fight over Solvency II is a political one they could well lose. Kwasi Kwarteng laid out his ""unashamedly pro-growth plan"" for the economy at a gathering of senior bankers two weeks ago. He would argue that the instincts that persuade him to cut banking regulations are the same instincts that persuaded him to throw a Â£100bn-plus shield over businesses and households to prevent high energy prices causing a job-and-growth-killing recession.

"The Treasury is refusing to publish a forecast of the UK's economic outlook alongside this Friday's mini-Budget. Independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has already provided a draft to Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, the BBC understands. The Treasury Select Committee says a forecast is ""vital"" given recent government moves to curb living costs. Action to cap annual energy billscould cost about Â£150bn, andtax cuts are expected on Friday. The mini-Budget is expected to see the government reverse a rise in National Insurance and scrap a planned increase in corporation tax, which reports say could cost Â£30bn. The draft forecast the OBR has provided does not include the impact of the energy bill help. It has offered to provide a forecast including this impact, but that has been rejected. The fact the offer has not been taken up is raising some concerns about whether the government's tax and spending policy is ""flying blind"", given predictions that the UK is facing a lengthy recession. MPs on the Treasury Select Committee wrote to the chancellor on Tuesday seeking assurance that an OBR forecast would be published. ""These forecasts are a vital indicator of the health of the nation's finances, and provide reassurance and confidence to international markets and investors,"" said the committee's chairman, Mel Stride. ""There has been a deterioration in our economic outlook since the last OBR forecast in March. There have been significant fiscal interventions since then and we are told there will be further significant interventions including major permanent tax cuts to be announced on Friday. ""Under these circumstances, it is vital that an independent OBR forecast is provided."" Will Liz Truss's economic plans make us richer? Tax-cutting mini Budget on Friday next week The OBR is obliged to produce economic forecasts twice a year, usually accompanying the Autumn Budget and Spring Statement. On Friday, there will be no independent assessment about whether permanent tax cuts and some one-off spending increases are consistent with the government's Budget rules. The lack of OBR forecast also means it will not cast judgement on the impact of the new tax measures on growth - a key target for the government which wants to increase the trend rate of growth to 2.5%. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""Given the exceptional circumstances our country faces, we have moved at immense speed to provide significant energy bill support for households and businesses, and are acting swiftly to set out further plans to kickstart economic growth later this week. ""We remain committed to maintaining the usual two forecasts in this fiscal year, as is required."" In its latest long-term forecast in July, the OBR said trend growth had fallen from 2.2% to 1.4%, partly because of a declining size of the workforce. In the City, where in recent weeks the value of the pound sterling has fallen and the cost of borrowing for the UK government has risen, there is some expectation that the Treasury will imminently have to formally increase its ""remit"" for borrowing. The Financing Remit is given to the Debt Management Office based on a forecast for borrowing. Extra sales of government loans, known as gilts, also need to be co-ordinated with the Bank of England, which is planning to sell off some of the gilts it owns, as it starts to reverse its long-running programme of stimulus. Government insiders say that the main motivation behind Friday's announcements is to enact the PM's leadership campaign promises as quickly as possible, and that a full forecast will accompany an upcoming Budget statement. The cost of the energy package, for example, could vary considerably depending on market prices for gas, and the ability of the government to renegotiate expensive contracts for renewable energy.
