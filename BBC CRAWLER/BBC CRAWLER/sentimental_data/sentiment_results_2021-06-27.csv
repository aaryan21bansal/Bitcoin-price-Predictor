"Shelter Cymru said Wales' system ""won't cope"" when the ban on evictions ends ""Hundreds"" of people could be forced from their homes after the ban on evictions comes to an end next week. Shelter Cymru said Wales' system ""won't cope"" with the fresh demand that may be placed on it after 30 June. The evictions ban in Walescame into force in December,external""to protect public health and support Welsh tenants"". The Welsh government said the decision had been made to lift the measure, in line with easing other Covid restrictions. The ban on evictions initially ran to the end of March, but was then extended. Ministers have now confirmed the ban would not be extended further ""in line with the lifting of other restrictions as we are inalert level one,external"". A similar ban in England ended on 31 May. Homeless Hotel: 'We can make it work' Meet the hairdressers helping the homeless Women offenders being released to homelessness - MPs Landlords will still have to give tenants six months' notice before evicting them. Shelter Cymru campaigns head, Jennie Bibbings, said suspending evictions ""saved lives"". Ms Bibbings told the BBC'sPolitics Walesthe numbers that could be affected were ""likely to be in the hundreds rather than the thousands"". She said: ""It's not just about the ones that are already in the system, it's about all of the new evictions that are going to start coming through once landlords get the message that the ban is lifted."" Sarah Davies, of Ynyswen, Powys, is facing eviction Sarah Davies, who lives in Ynyswen, Powys, with her five-year-old daughter, is facing eviction. She said she stopped paying rent after her landlord ignored requests for maintenance work to be carried out on the house. The landlord strongly rejects that version of events. Now, Ms Davies is waiting for a knock on the door. ""I'm kind of half-prepared for it. Obviously, I don't want to get my daughter too upset, so I've got friends in place if that does happen and they can come and grab her away so she doesn't have to go through that trauma. ""It would just be nice to have some more time."" She said the Welsh government needed to ""look at the bigger picture"". ""If everything goes into lockdown again and the B&Bs shut again, what are you going to do? ""We'll all be out on the street."" Ms Bibbings said a third wave of the virus could mean the eviction ban has to be reintroduced. ""We've all just got to hope that not too much damage has been done in the meantime,"" she said. ""Our system in Wales won't cope with a new wave of homelessness."" The National Residential Landlords Association said the announcement did ""provide some more stability"" for landlords, but warned the sector's rent arrears crisis was ""not going away"". The Welsh government said a scheme to help people ""struggling to pay their rent due to financial hardship caused directly by the pandemic"" would be announced this week. A spokeswoman said: ""In the meantime, we continue to urge anybody experiencing problems to speak to their landlord and contact Citizen's Advice Cymru or Shelter Cymru for further advice and support.""

"Classified Ministry of Defence documents containing details about HMS Defender and the British military have been found at a bus stop in Kent. One set of documents discusses the likely Russian reaction to the ship's passage through Ukrainian waters off the Crimea coast on Wednesday. Another details plans for a possible UK military presence in Afghanistan after the US-led Nato operation there ends. The government said an investigation had been launched. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it is investigating ""an incident in which sensitive defence papers were recovered by a member of the public"". The MoD employee concerned reported the loss at the time, it said. Russian jets and ships shadow British warship What will be the fallout from Black Sea incident? UK confirms 'drawdown' of Afghan troops The documents, almost 50 pages in all, were found in a soggy heap behind a bus stop in Kent early on Tuesday morning. A member of the public, who wishes to remain anonymous, contacted the BBC when he realised the sensitive nature of the contents. The BBC believes the documents, which include emails and PowerPoint presentations, originated in the office of a senior official at the MoD. The documents relating to the Royal Navy's Type 45 destroyer, HMS Defender, show that a mission described by the MoD as an ""innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters"", with guns covered and the ship's helicopter stowed in its hangar, was conducted in the expectation that Russia might respond aggressively. On Wednesday more than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships shadowed the warship as it sailed about 12 miles (19km) off Crimea's coast. Moscow's defence ministry said a patrol ship fired warning shots and a jet dropped bombs in the destroyer's path but the UK government rejected this account, denying any warning shots had been fired. The mission, dubbed ""Op Ditroite"", was the subject of high-level discussions as late as Monday, the documents show, with officials speculating about Russia's reaction if HMS Defender sailed close to Crimea. ""What do we understand about the possible 'welcome party'â¦?"" asked an official at Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ), the UK's tri-service headquarters at Northwood. Recent interactions in the eastern Mediterranean between Russian forces and a Carrier Strike Group led by HMS Queen Elizabeth had been unremarkable and ""in line with expectations"", the document said. But officials knew this was about to change. ""Following the transition from defence engagement activity to operational activity, it is highly likely that RFN (Russian navy) and VKS (Russian air force) interactions will become more frequent and assertive,"" one presentation warned. A series of slides prepared at PJHQ shows two routeing options, one described as ""a safe and professional direct transit from Odessa to Batumi"", including a short stretch through a ""Traffic Separation Scheme"" (TSS) close to the south-west tip of Crimea. This route, one slide concluded, would ""provide an opportunity to engage with the Ukrainian governmentâ¦ in what the UK recognises as Ukrainian territorial waters."" Three potential Russian responses were outlined, from ""safe and professional"" to ""neither safe nor professional"". In the event, Russia chose to react aggressively, with radio warnings, coastguard vessels closing to within 100 metres and repeated buzzing by warplanes. An alternative route was considered, which would have kept HMS Defender well away from contested waters. This would have avoided confrontation, the presentation noted, but ran the risk of being portrayed by Russia as evidence of ""the UK being scared/running away"", allowing Russia to claim that the UK had belatedly accepted Moscow's claim to Crimean territorial waters. ""As the public would expect, the Ministry of Defence plans carefully,"" an MoD spokesperson said. ""As a matter of routine, that includes analysing all the potential factors affecting operational decisions."" Alongside the military planning, officials anticipated competing versions of events. ""We have a strong, legitimate narrative"", they said, noting that the presence of the embedded journalists (from the BBC and Daily Mail) on board the destroyer ""provides an option for independent verification of HMS Defender's action"". Following the controversy generated by HMS Defender's mission, the documents discovered in Kent confirm that passage through the TSS was a calculated decision by the British government to make a show of support for Ukraine, despite the possible risks involved. Was this gunboat diplomacy? It was certainly the use of a warship in pursuit of diplomatic goals. But its primary objective was not to ""poke the Russian bear"" (a phrase and sentiment conspicuously absent from the documents). This was all about freedom of navigation and a clear endorsement of Ukraine's sovereignty, following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Under the terms of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the passage of a foreign ship is regarded as ""innocent"" when ""it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state."" In the eyes of much of the world, that state is Ukraine, not Russia. The documents don't stop there. The bundle includes updates on arms exports campaigns, including sensitive observations about areas where Britain might find itself competing with European allies. There's a whiff of post-Brexit anxiety in comments attributed to ""SofS"" (Defence Secretary Ben Wallace), who insists that the six-member European Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), of which Britain is a member, ""must not be hijacked"" by ""entryism"" from the European Commission. And there are briefing notes for last Monday's session of the UK-US Defence Dialogue, including observations on President Joe Biden's first months in office. The Biden administration's early focus on China and the Indo-Pacific, they say, show ""there is still much continuity from the previous administration."" There are also suggestions of what Britain should be asking for. ""We should use the meeting to see how much the administration is prepared to share, or whether its stated ambition of consulting more with allies is truer in principle than in practice."" Most of the papers are marked ""official sensitive"", a relatively low level of classification used, according to the government, ""where there is a clear and justifiable requirement to reinforce the 'need to know'"". But one document, addressed to Ben Wallace's private secretary, and marked ""Secret UK Eyes Only"", outlines highly sensitive recommendations for the UK's military footprint in Afghanistan, following the end of Operation Resolute Support, the Nato operation currently winding down in the wake of President Biden's decision earlier this year to withdraw American forces. The document discusses an American request for British assistance in several specific areas, and addresses the question of whether any British special forces will remain in Afghanistan once the withdrawal is complete. Media reports have already suggested Britain is considering leaving some forces behind. Due to the sensitivity of the document, the BBC has decided not to report details which could endanger the security of British and other personnel in Afghanistan. But amid reports of a worsening security situation in the country, it sounds several warnings. ""Any UK footprint in Afghanistan that persists... is assessed to be vulnerable to targeting by a complex network of actors,"" it says, noting that ""the option to withdraw completely remains."" Afghanistan, it says, is already becoming more dangerous. The reduced presence of Nato forces ""is already impairing the situational awareness that we (and the US) used to enjoy across the country"". No Britons have been killed in Afghanistan since the US-Taliban deal in February 2020, it says, but ""this would be unlikely to remain the status quo"". Rarely has a collection of lost documents covered such a wide range of important areas. This is a major embarrassment for the Ministry of Defence, which is currently carrying out a detailed investigation into how the papers came to be lying on a street corner, in the rain, in the early hours of Tuesday morning. John Healey, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said he was surprised documents had got out of the Ministry of Defence at all. He said he wants Mr Wallace to complete the investigation quickly and report to the House of Commons this week to reassure the public that no military operations had been put at risk.

"MicheÃ¡l Martin, pictured here at the British Irish Council summit earlier in the month, insisted he listens to unionist concerns The taoiseach (Irish PM) has insisted he is listening to unionist concerns over the Northern Ireland Protocol.

It is thepart of the Brexit deal which creates a border in the Irish Sea. Sir Jeffrey wasspeaking after being endorsed as party leader by MLAs and MPs. He said the protocol was ""dragging our politics backwards"". The Lagan Valley MP said the Irish government had ignored unionist concerns over the imposition of Irish Sea trade barriers. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, DUP leader-designate, accused the Irish government of ""cheerleading"" for the protocol But on Sunday, Mr Martin told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that he wants to engage with unionists on the issue. ""We do listen to unionists and I think Jeffrey knows that I certainly do,"" he said. He said he wanted unionists' concerns over the protocol to be resolved in the context of the EU-UK negotiations. Earlier on Sunday, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said work has to be done tofix the ""big disruption"" to businesses and consumers in Northern Ireland.

"Police are aiming to locate the woman and charge her over the incident Police say they are trying to trace a spectator in connection with a multi-rider pile-up during the first stage of the Tour de France on Saturday. The female spectator was spotted leaning into the path of the speeding peloton, holding a sign, in the FinistÃ¨re region of Brittany. German rider Tony Martin brushed into the sign and fell to the ground, with others behind him following suit. Police say they have launched a criminal investigation. They aim to charge the woman with ""deliberately violating safety regulations and causing injuries that might prevent someone working for up to three months"". Alaphilippe wins crash-affected stage one Froome to 'try to get through' after crash Video footage of the incident has been widely shared online. The woman, wearing a yellow coat, can be seen holding a sign with ""granny and granddad"" written in German. She is looking away from the peloton coming towards her and does not see them approach. One rider has had to pull out of the Tour completely and another eight riders were treated by an official doctor. According to police, the woman fled the scene after the crash. Investigators have appealed for witnesses to get in touch. Tour de France Deputy Director Pierre-Yves Thouault said the tour would take legal action against the woman. ""We are suing this woman who behaved so badly. We are doing this so that the tiny minority of people who do this do not spoil the show for everyone,"" he told AFP news agency. France has relaxed its coronavirus restrictions and many people have flocked to see the riders. Those hoping to watch the riders have been told to keep off the route and maintain their distance.

"This video can not be played The moment China's Zhurong robot landed on Mars China's space agency has released video of its Zhurong rover trundling across the surface of Mars. The pictures were acquired by a wireless camera that the robot had placed on the ground. The new media release also includes sequences from Zhurong's landing in May, showing the deployment of its parachute system and the moment of touchdown. The six-wheeled robot is investigating a region known as Utopia Planitia. The China National Space Agency (CNSA) says Zhurong has driven 236m in 42 Mars sols (as of 27 June). A sol is a Martian day. It lasts slightly longer than an Earth day, at 24 hours and 39 minutes. China lands its Zhurong rover on Mars Chinese Mars rover returns first pictures US satellite looks down on China's Mars rover This video can not be played The Zhurong robot wiggles its wheels as it stands next to its landing platform The latest movies were relayed back to Earth via the Tianwen-1 satellite which orbits the Red Planet. ""The orbiter and the Mars rover are in good working condition, reporting safely from Mars to the party and the motherland, and sending distant blessings on the century of the party's founding,"" a CNSA press statement said. The first of July will mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party. A video release was expected, especially of the landing, which occurred on 14 May. Some preview stills looking up at the parachute system from the rover's entry capsule were handed out last week. In the movie version, however, we see the envelope inflate in the rarefied Martian atmosphere. We also see Zhurong and its landing platform drop away from the ""backshell"" of the capsule; and finally a look-down camera captures the moment of touchdown as the platform's braking rocket motor blasts the surface clear of dust. This video can not be played The Zhurong robot backs away from a wireless camera on the ground There are three videos on the surface. The first, presumably taken shortly after Zhurong put the wireless camera on the ground, shows the robot backing away. The second video shows Zhurong wiggling its wheels while sitting next to its landing platform. The CNSA had previously released a still from this scene. And, finally, the third video details the rover's roll down the ramp that got it off the landing platform on to the surface. What's interesting about this movie is that we get sound as well. We can hear the robot's locomotion system in action. The nature of Mars' atmosphere means noises don't sound quite the same as they do on Earth. They seem somewhat muffled. This video can not be played Listen to Zhurong as it rolls off its landing platform Scientists are hoping to get at least 90 Martian days of service out of Zhurong. The robot looks a lot like the American space agency's (Nasa) Spirit and Opportunity vehicles from the 2000s. It weighs some 240kg. A tall mast carries cameras to take pictures and aid navigation; five additional instruments will investigate the mineralogy of local rocks and the general nature of the environment, including the weather. Like the current American rovers (Curiosity and Perseverance), Zhurong has a laser tool to zap rocks to assess their chemistry. It also has a radar to look for sub-surface water-ice - a capability it shares with Perseverance. Videos of the landing of Perseverance were released by Nasa shortly after its descent to the Martian surface on 18 February.

"Classified Ministry of Defence documents containing details about HMS Defender and the British military have been found at a bus stop in Kent. One set of documents discusses the likely Russian reaction to the ship's passage through Ukrainian waters off the Crimea coast on Wednesday. Another details plans for a possible UK military presence in Afghanistan after the US-led Nato operation there ends. The government said an investigation had been launched. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said it is investigating ""an incident in which sensitive defence papers were recovered by a member of the public"". The MoD employee concerned reported the loss at the time, it said. Russian jets and ships shadow British warship What will be the fallout from Black Sea incident? UK confirms 'drawdown' of Afghan troops The documents, almost 50 pages in all, were found in a soggy heap behind a bus stop in Kent early on Tuesday morning. A member of the public, who wishes to remain anonymous, contacted the BBC when he realised the sensitive nature of the contents. The BBC believes the documents, which include emails and PowerPoint presentations, originated in the office of a senior official at the MoD. The documents relating to the Royal Navy's Type 45 destroyer, HMS Defender, show that a mission described by the MoD as an ""innocent passage through Ukrainian territorial waters"", with guns covered and the ship's helicopter stowed in its hangar, was conducted in the expectation that Russia might respond aggressively. On Wednesday more than 20 Russian aircraft and two coastguard ships shadowed the warship as it sailed about 12 miles (19km) off Crimea's coast. Moscow's defence ministry said a patrol ship fired warning shots and a jet dropped bombs in the destroyer's path but the UK government rejected this account, denying any warning shots had been fired. The mission, dubbed ""Op Ditroite"", was the subject of high-level discussions as late as Monday, the documents show, with officials speculating about Russia's reaction if HMS Defender sailed close to Crimea. ""What do we understand about the possible 'welcome party'â¦?"" asked an official at Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ), the UK's tri-service headquarters at Northwood. Recent interactions in the eastern Mediterranean between Russian forces and a Carrier Strike Group led by HMS Queen Elizabeth had been unremarkable and ""in line with expectations"", the document said. But officials knew this was about to change. ""Following the transition from defence engagement activity to operational activity, it is highly likely that RFN (Russian navy) and VKS (Russian air force) interactions will become more frequent and assertive,"" one presentation warned. A series of slides prepared at PJHQ shows two routeing options, one described as ""a safe and professional direct transit from Odessa to Batumi"", including a short stretch through a ""Traffic Separation Scheme"" (TSS) close to the south-west tip of Crimea. This route, one slide concluded, would ""provide an opportunity to engage with the Ukrainian governmentâ¦ in what the UK recognises as Ukrainian territorial waters."" Three potential Russian responses were outlined, from ""safe and professional"" to ""neither safe nor professional"". In the event, Russia chose to react aggressively, with radio warnings, coastguard vessels closing to within 100 metres and repeated buzzing by warplanes. An alternative route was considered, which would have kept HMS Defender well away from contested waters. This would have avoided confrontation, the presentation noted, but ran the risk of being portrayed by Russia as evidence of ""the UK being scared/running away"", allowing Russia to claim that the UK had belatedly accepted Moscow's claim to Crimean territorial waters. ""As the public would expect, the Ministry of Defence plans carefully,"" an MoD spokesperson said. ""As a matter of routine, that includes analysing all the potential factors affecting operational decisions."" Alongside the military planning, officials anticipated competing versions of events. ""We have a strong, legitimate narrative"", they said, noting that the presence of the embedded journalists (from the BBC and Daily Mail) on board the destroyer ""provides an option for independent verification of HMS Defender's action"". Following the controversy generated by HMS Defender's mission, the documents discovered in Kent confirm that passage through the TSS was a calculated decision by the British government to make a show of support for Ukraine, despite the possible risks involved. Was this gunboat diplomacy? It was certainly the use of a warship in pursuit of diplomatic goals. But its primary objective was not to ""poke the Russian bear"" (a phrase and sentiment conspicuously absent from the documents). This was all about freedom of navigation and a clear endorsement of Ukraine's sovereignty, following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Under the terms of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, the passage of a foreign ship is regarded as ""innocent"" when ""it is not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state."" In the eyes of much of the world, that state is Ukraine, not Russia. The documents don't stop there. The bundle includes updates on arms exports campaigns, including sensitive observations about areas where Britain might find itself competing with European allies. There's a whiff of post-Brexit anxiety in comments attributed to ""SofS"" (Defence Secretary Ben Wallace), who insists that the six-member European Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), of which Britain is a member, ""must not be hijacked"" by ""entryism"" from the European Commission. And there are briefing notes for last Monday's session of the UK-US Defence Dialogue, including observations on President Joe Biden's first months in office. The Biden administration's early focus on China and the Indo-Pacific, they say, show ""there is still much continuity from the previous administration."" There are also suggestions of what Britain should be asking for. ""We should use the meeting to see how much the administration is prepared to share, or whether its stated ambition of consulting more with allies is truer in principle than in practice."" Most of the papers are marked ""official sensitive"", a relatively low level of classification used, according to the government, ""where there is a clear and justifiable requirement to reinforce the 'need to know'"". But one document, addressed to Ben Wallace's private secretary, and marked ""Secret UK Eyes Only"", outlines highly sensitive recommendations for the UK's military footprint in Afghanistan, following the end of Operation Resolute Support, the Nato operation currently winding down in the wake of President Biden's decision earlier this year to withdraw American forces. The document discusses an American request for British assistance in several specific areas, and addresses the question of whether any British special forces will remain in Afghanistan once the withdrawal is complete. Media reports have already suggested Britain is considering leaving some forces behind. Due to the sensitivity of the document, the BBC has decided not to report details which could endanger the security of British and other personnel in Afghanistan. But amid reports of a worsening security situation in the country, it sounds several warnings. ""Any UK footprint in Afghanistan that persists... is assessed to be vulnerable to targeting by a complex network of actors,"" it says, noting that ""the option to withdraw completely remains."" Afghanistan, it says, is already becoming more dangerous. The reduced presence of Nato forces ""is already impairing the situational awareness that we (and the US) used to enjoy across the country"". No Britons have been killed in Afghanistan since the US-Taliban deal in February 2020, it says, but ""this would be unlikely to remain the status quo"". Rarely has a collection of lost documents covered such a wide range of important areas. This is a major embarrassment for the Ministry of Defence, which is currently carrying out a detailed investigation into how the papers came to be lying on a street corner, in the rain, in the early hours of Tuesday morning. John Healey, Labour's shadow defence secretary, said he was surprised documents had got out of the Ministry of Defence at all. He said he wants Mr Wallace to complete the investigation quickly and report to the House of Commons this week to reassure the public that no military operations had been put at risk.
