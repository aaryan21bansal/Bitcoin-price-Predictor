"This video can not be played The Venezuelans are fleeing their country's political and economic crises Hundreds of Venezuelans have requested asylum in Peru, an official has said, just hours after the country tightened its entry requirements. New rules require Venezuelans trying to enter Peru to have a passport, and not just an identity card as before. Similar regulations were introduced in Ecuador last week, only to be overturned by a court. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing their country amid chronic shortages of food and medicines. The country's longstanding economic crisis has seen more than two million citizens leave since 2014, causing regional tensions as neighbouring countries struggle to accommodate them. How Venezuela's crisis drove out millions of people Venezuelan's bridge of desperation My first week as a BBC Venezuela correspondent Like other South American nations, Peru is trying to control the influx of people escaping Venezuela's economic crisis. The UN - whose migration agency has warned that the continent faces a refugee ""crisis moment"" similar to that seen in the Mediterranean in 2015 - is setting up a special team to co-ordinate the regional response. The authorities in Lima set a deadline of midnight on Friday for the new passport rules to come into force. Many Venezuelans have been looking to start a new life in Peru - which has one of the region's fastest growing economies - travelling there via Colombia and Ecuador. Ecuador provided buses to take Venezuelans across its territory from the Colombian border to the Peruvian border On Friday there was a rush of people heading to the Peruvian border and Ecuador created what it called a ""humanitarian corridor"" by laying on buses to take migrants through the country. Peruvian Prime Minister CÃ©sar Villanueva said requiring Venezuelans to show their passport at the border did not mean that Peru was ""closing the door"" to migrants. He said ID cards did not provide enough information and could easily be forged. Citizens of most South American nations can visit countries in the region without needing a visa or even a passport. The Andean Community trading bloc - which includes Ecuador and Peru - also allows visa and passport-free travel for its citizens, although Venezuela withdrew from the grouping in 2006. Peru is already home to about 400,000 Venezuelan migrants, most of whom arrived in the past year. On Friday, more than 2,500 crossed into the small Peruvian border town of Aguas Verdes, with thousands more trying to reach Peru at the main crossing point at Tumbes. The Tumbes crossing has seen about 3,000 arrivals per day in recent weeks. By Katy Watson, BBC News, Huaquillas, on the Peru-Ecuador border Throughout Friday evening Venezuelans kept arriving, many in government-commandeered buses that had brought them from the Colombia-Ecuador border. It was called a humanitarian corridor but, of course, it was one that was in Ecuador's interests, too. They didn't want to be left with stranded Venezuelans once midnight had passed. With less than 10 minutes to go before the deadline, there were more than 100 people with no passports waiting in the queue hoping to be allowed into Peru. Migration officials handed out a small pink ticket to those lining up. Those who were in the queue before midnight would be allowed to cross the border. Anyone else arriving after midnight would not. A seemingly insignificant piece of paper but one that would define the future for these Venezuelans heading to Peru to find work. Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - a UN agency - said increasing border restrictions coupled withan outbreak of violence on the Brazilian border last week, was an early warning sign that the region was in need of help. ""This is building to a crisis moment that we've seen in other parts of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean,"" he told reporters. Chiara Cardoletti of the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), said other countries in the region had welcomed Venezuelans and were helping to ""avoid a situation like the one we have seen in Europe"". This video can not be played ""This is the largest exodus Latin America has experienced"" - UNHCR's Chiara Cardoletti ""What we are seeing is a continent that has opened its doors to people who are fleeing and who need support,"" she told the BBC. Ms Cardoletti added that Colombia had registered more than 450,000 Venezuelans and given them regular status. Ecuador brought in new passport regulations last week, leaving hundreds of migrants stranded on it border with Colombia. However, on Friday, a judge found that requiring Venezuelans to carry valid passports broke regional agreements on freedom of movement. Allow Twitter content?

More than half a million Venezuelans have crossed into Ecuador this year alone and more than a million have entered Colombia in the past 15 months. Brazil's northern state of Roraima has also had its attempt to close the border with Venezuela thrown out by a judge. Violence erupted in the border town of Pacaraima last week when local residents attacked makeshift camps housing Venezuelan migrants. The camps were burned down and the occupants temporarily fled back across the border. Despite the violence, the number of Venezuelans crossing daily into Brazil has continued to rise. The government took drastic measures to stabilise the economy last week, issuing new banknotes that slashed five zeros off the bolÃ­var. Runaway inflation had been predicted to hit one million per cent by the end of the year. On Friday, Venezuela's information minister Jorge Rodriguez said the measures would persuade those Venezuelans who had left to return. Economists have warned that the new measures do not address the root causes of inflation in Venezuela and that the printing of new notes could exacerbate inflation rather than curb it.

"Logan Paul (left) had the better of the early action at the Manchester Arena The much-hyped boxing fight between rival YouTubers KSI and Logan Paul has ended in a draw. Briton KSI, who boasts 19.4 million subscribers, took on US star Paul, who has 18.2 million, in the tightly-contested bout at Manchester Arena. One ringside judge had KSI ahead by one point but the other two scored it even, meaning a majority draw was declared. The decision was greeted by booing in the arena, but both men immediately called for a rematch. In reality, the fight was just the first of two planned bouts, with the second set to take place in the US. More than 15,000 tickets were sold for the Manchester fight, with thousands more paying Â£7.50 each to watch it live on YouTube. KSI and Logan Paul had whipped their fans into a frenzy before the bout with insult-filled videos flying back and forth and angry news conferences held in Los Angeles and London. After the six-round fight, both insisted they thought they had won. KSI declared: ""I think there's only one thing to do. I think we have to have a rematch. Let's do it. That was fun."" Paul said: ""I think it's what the people want. Let's give them a rematch."" KSI did get one last verbal dig in at his opponent, telling him: ""I can't wait to see your bloody face all over the internet."" Both fighters performed typically elaborate ring walks, with Paul dressed all in black and KSI wearing a black mask as well as a jacket emblazoned with ""the Nightmare"" on the back Paul taunted his rival during the bout after making a stronger start But he seemed to flag later on, stumbling to the canvas at one point Paul dominated the first two rounds, but KSI had boasted of his greater stamina before the fight and fought his way back the longer the two men's battle went on. They regularly taunted each other during the fight itself and exchanged insults. One dramatic moment came when Jake Paul - Paul's brother, who had himself fought on the undercard - ran into the ring at the end of the second round to remonstrate with KSI for throwing a punch after the bell had sounded. Both fighters landed a series of blows as the rounds progressed Both KSI and Paul claimed victory at the end of the bout - and the judges took several minutes to announce their scores Paul looked exhausted at the end of the match When the draw was announced, many people declared the result an anti-climax - with some saying it was a fix to make the pair even more money. Others, however, were impressed by what they saw. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It was streamed live on YouTube for free, with 1.8 million people watching live and 36 million more watching on the pair's official channels since.

"Veteran protester Emine Ocak, aged in her 80s, is detained by police Police in the Turkish city of Istanbul have forcefully broken up a regular protest by mothers remembering relatives who disappeared during violence in the 1990s. Officers used water cannon and tear gas and detained about 50 people, including veteran protester Emine Ocak, said to be in her 80s. The group, called the Saturday Mothers, have met in central Istanbul since 1995 and this was to be their 700th protest. Rights groups condemned the crackdown. It was ""shameful, cruel treatment of families seeking justice for state crimes"", said Emma Sinclair-Webb from Human Rights Watch. The sit-in was banned by the authorities because it had been publicised on social media accounts linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a local government statement said.

Some viewers suggested he should have been removed from the show immediately after using the highly offensive racial term. Instead, producers gave him a ""final warning"" and said if he repeated the language he would be evicted from the house. Channel 5 has been approached for further comment, but declined. Rodrigo Alves entered the Celebrity Big Brother house on August 16th Born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Alves describes himself as a TV personality and showman. Known as The Human Ken Doll,  he has admitted to undergoing 62 plastic surgeries, including 10 nose jobs, a face and eye lift, jaw re-shaping and four ribs removed ""to look better when I'm wearing a blazer"". He is a regular on red carpets and has more than 700,000 followers on Instagram, where he is often seen on beaches, partying on yachts and flaunting his collection of corsets. The show's latest controversy comes one day after the boss of Channel 5 appeared to confirm the show is taking a break. Controller Ben Frow, speaking at the Edinburgh International TV Festival, said: ""I'm planning for a year without Big Brother."" It's not clear whether he was referring to both the celebrity and non-celebrity version of the show. The broadcaster's deal to air the programme ends this year.

"This video can not be played Alex Salmond: 'I have not sexually harassed anyone' The  investigation into sexual harassment claims against Alex Salmond has been ""entirely confidential"", the Scottish government has insisted. The Daily Record claims to have seen the wording of an allegation by a Scottish government staff member She alleges the former first minister touched her bottom and breasts through her clothing while she was alone with him at Bute House, the paper reports. Mr Salmond has strenuously denied any claims or harassment or criminality. Salmond denies sexual misconduct claims Alex Salmond profile He has described the allegations as ""patently ridiculous"" and said he is taking the Scottish government to court to contest the complaints process activated against him. In a tweet on Saturday, he reaffirmed his denial - but said he could make no further comment until his petition for a judicial review was heard at the Court of Session. Allow Twitter content?

The alleged incident reported by the Daily Record is said to have taken place at the first minister's official residence Bute House in Edinburgh in the first week of December 2013. The paper claims the woman alleges ""multiple incidences of harassment and conduct of an unwanted sexual nature"". The newspaper, which broke the story late on Thursday, says the allegations, and those of a second complainer have been passed to the police. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We are carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and enquiries are at an early stage."" Mr Salmond has hosted a show on the controversial RT station since last November In a BBC interview on Friday Mr Salmond said he had ""made many mistakes"" in life but strenuously denied the sexual harassment complaints. He said the complaints procedure activated against him was unjust and did not allow him to present his case. Mr Salmond said that ""with great reluctance"" he had now launched a judicial review against the Scottish government at the Court of Session. He said that if he lost the case he would answer the complaints against him ""both comprehensively and publicly"" but also warned that if the court finds in his favour,  ""the administration at the senior levels of the Scottish government will have the most serious questions to answer"". A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: ""This process been under way within the Scottish government for eight months and has been entirely confidential throughout that period"". An internal review was launched last year into the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace in light of wider concerns about harassment at Westminster and Holyrood. As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced. Leader of Scottish National Party 1990-2000 and 2004-2014 First Minister of Scotland 2007 - 2014 Stood down after Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom Leslie Evans, permanent secretary at the Scottish government, has said two complaints were raised in January against Mr Salmond and he was notified in March about an investigation. Mr Salmond's successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the situation was ""difficult for me to come to terms with"" given her long history with Mr Salmond, but claims ""could not be ignored"". Ms Sturgeon revealed that she was first informed of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself in April and had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him. Mr Salmond was first minister and SNP leader until September 2014, stepping down after Scottish voters rejected independence by a margin of 55% to 45%. The following year he was elected as the SNP MP for Gordon in 2015 and became the party's foreign affairs spokesman before losing the seat in the snap general election two years later. Recently he has faced heavy criticism for hosting the Alex Salmond Show on Russian broadcaster RT, which has been described as a propaganda channel for the Kremlin - a claim Mr Salmond has denied.

"The Waverley was delayed at Helensburgh for a time, before breaking down near Greenock Hundreds of passengers on board The Waverley paddle steamer were left stranded when it broke down in the middle of the Clyde. The ship was stuck between Greenock and Helensburgh for several hours but later made it to Greenock. Waverley Excursons Ltd said it was due to a problem with boiler controls and it regretted the inconvenience and disappointment of passengers. Specialist engineers will now try to repair the ship. Tommy Barnes, who was on board the steamer, told BBC Radio Scotland: ""There are worse places to be stranded but after a while it does start to wear thin."" The Waverley set off from the centre of Glasgow at 10:00 on Saturday, and it was due to stop in Helensburgh, Dunoon and Rothesay. However, the vessel began experiencing some difficulties at Helensburgh, where it was delayed. Passengers were told that it would continue its journey to Rothesay but it would no longer be stopping at Dunoon. Some passengers chose to leave the paddle steamer at Helensburgh It is understood the vessel was carrying some people planning to spend the day at the Cowal Highland Gathering, near Dunoon. All passengers were also given the option of leaving the boat at Helensburgh. Mr Barnes said: ""After that we set sail and we sailed for approximately 15 to 20 minutes before all engines seemed to cut out."" Waverley Excursions said it tried to book coaches to transport passengers who disembarked at Helensburgh, but none were available. Instead passengers were advised to continue their journeys by train and apply to have their fares reimbursed.

"This is the first papal visit to Ireland since half of the island's population turned out to greet Pope John Paul II in 1979 It could be a case of expectations versus reality - the expectation of a charismatic kneel to the ground and a kiss on the tarmac, of fanfare and hysteria. But that was in 1979 and this is now. Nearly 40 years after Pope John Paul II received an emphatic welcome,Pope Francis is visiting a different Ireland. The Republic of Ireland today is more secular, far more liberal and, in many cases, angry. LIVE: Pope Francis in Ireland Longform: What happened to Catholic Ireland? In graphs - Irish flock without shepherds? The clerical sex-abuse scandals, the mother-and-baby homes, and the history of a Church covering its tracks has lessened theinstitution's influence over its Irish flock. Protesting outside Dublin Castle as the Pope made a quick-stop tour of the city's streets, Savia, a group of survivors and victims of institutional abuse, laid out children's shoes tied in black ribbon in memory of those who had been robbed of their childhood by priests. This video can not be played Pope Francis said he was ashamed of his Church's failure to adequately address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse by clergy Even the country's prime minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, an openly gay man, set aside the pleasantries when he asked the Pope to ""bring justice and truth and healing for victims and survivors"". Perhaps it is no wonder that Pope Francis's visit is more of a sombre affair than that of his Polish predecessor. For those who have been campaigning for abuse victims, some might take solace in the Pope's admission that he was ashamed by the Church's failure to address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse. They might also be consoled by the fact he spent 90 minutes in private with eight abuse survivors on Saturday afternoon. But others might think that is not enough. Savia, a group of survivors and victims of institutional abuse, laid out children's shoes tied in black ribbon as part of a protest In the last three years,Ireland has voted in liberal abortion lawsandsame sex marriage. Neither referendum had the same tight margins as the divorce referendum in 1995. Both were a landslide in favour of a more liberal order. While you might still come across the odd Sacred Heart statue in a more traditional home in rural stretches of Ireland,strong faith is less common than it was in 1979. Catholic Ireland is now home to many who go to Mass for Christmas, weddings and funerals, but generally ignore the Sunday ritual. Pope Francis was greeted by crowds in Dublin - but not the masses who turned out to welcome John Paul II in 1979 Crowds lining the streets of Dublin to greet the Pope on Saturday were one-person deep. Moving through these crowds was easier than trying to get through the city for the St Patrick's Day parade. Plenty in the crowd had come from abroad especially for the visit. While Ireland has also become more international in the last 39 years, as Dubliners wandered past the barriers en route to the shops, it was difficult to grasp the Irish enthusiasm. Memorabilia marking the Pope's visit to Ireland has been on sale across Dublin At Saturday night's Festival of Families event - complete with performances by world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter, and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell - the Croke Park stadium of 82,300 was not full to capacity. And the weather dampened proceedings - if not spirits - on Sunday morning as the Pope visited the Marian shrine at Knock. Eyes will now be on Dublin's Phoenix Park later on Sunday, to see if crowds will show up for the visit's closing Mass in greater numbers. In his speech welcoming the Pope, Mr Varadkar said the time had come for Ireland to build a new relationship - ""a more mature relationship"" - between Church and state. These words were indicative of the Republic of Ireland's move towards an arms-length relationship with an organisation that once wielded its power over all arms of the state.

"There was little fanfare as Pope Francis arrived at Dublin Airport for the first papal visit in four decades. The wind was the first thing to greet Pope Francis as he stepped off Shepherd One onto Irish soil. Pope Francis is making a return to the country he first visited in 1980 as Father Jorge Mario Bergoglio. There have been protests against the Pope's visit, which comes amid ongoing criticism of the Catholic Church's handling of clerical sex-abuse cases. The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, greeted the Pope at Dublin Airport. His first appointment was with Irish President Michael D Higgins, pictured here with his wife Sabina Coyne, at the president's residence, Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in. In a message in the Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in guest book, Pope Francis wrote of his ""gratitude for the warm welcome"". The Pope is due to meet victims of clerical sex abuse, but the Vatican has not said when or where, and campaigners wait to hear what action he will take. Pope Francis and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar were applauded by political leaders, diplomats and other dignitaries as they arrived at Dublin Castle. Mr Varadkar challenged the Pope over clerical child abuse, referring to ""dark aspects"" of the Church's history. He went on to state that wounds were still open and asked the pontiff to use his influence to bring about ""healing, truth and justice"". Crowds lined the streets of Dublin to welcome Pope Francis as he travelled through the city on a brief popemobile tour - but not in the numbers that greeted Pope John Paul II in 1979. There were many supporters of the Pope, who cheered and sang hymns as he approached. But there were also protesters. The Catholic Church has been criticised for its attitude towards LGBT people. Here, a man can be seen waving a rainbow flag behind a model of Pope Francis as the Pope toured Dublin. The Republic of Ireland legalised same-sex marriage in a referendum in 2015. Savia, a group of survivors and victims of institutional abuse, set up a protest outside Dublin Castle, right on the Popemobile route. Savia chairwoman Margaret McGuckin said each shoe represented a child who had been abused by priests. She said the Church should be held accountable for its actions and cover-up of clerical sex abuse over the years. Young and old listened on as the Pope addressed married and recently engaged couples at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral. The Pope prayed in front of a candle dedicated to victims of abuse at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Dublin. Pope Francis shares a joke with members of the congregation at St Mary's Pro-Cathedral. A crowd of 70,000 people are expected to attend the Festival of Families event at Croke Park on Saturday evening. Attendees take part in a 'Mexican Wave' at the Festival of Families event at Croke Park. It is the first time Ireland has hosted the World Meeting of Families, a global gathering of the Catholic Church. Pope Francis addressed crowds on Saturday evening at Croke Park - ending the first day of his visit to Ireland.

"This video can not be played One British tourist said it was a ""bit scary"" No trace of poisonous gas has been found in the hotel room occupied by a British couple who died, according to Egyptian investigators. John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, from Burnley, died at the hotel in Hurghada on Tuesday. The couple's daughter, who was also at the hotel, said she believed the deaths were not from natural causes. A number of British holidaymakers who were staying there have been flown home early by tour operator Thomas Cook. Following the deaths, the firm said it wasremoving all its customersas a ""precautionary measure"", with 301 holidaymakers offered the option of moving to different hotels or being flown home. A plane carrying people who had stayed at the hotel arrived at Manchester Airport in the early hours of Saturday. Investigations into the deaths of John and Susan Cooper are continuing Passengers told BBC News they had not been informed of the deaths until two days after they occurred. One woman said: ""No-one had said a word until Thursday. But it is a bit scary."" Another said: ""When you find out at 10:00-10:30 at night that two people have died two days ago, and nobody knows why... ""If they'd been open and transparent, I wouldn't have got on that plane."" In a statement, Egyptian prosecutor Nabil Sadeq said a technical inspection of the hotel room could find no trace of toxic or harmful gas emissions or leaks. The result of forensic analysis of samples taken from the bodies was still awaited, said the statement. The Red Sea governorate said medical checks by a health inspector revealed ""no criminal suspicions"". The couple's daughter, Kelly Ormerod, said: ""I believe their deaths are not due to natural causes. ""My parents went to sleep on the Monday evening, fit, healthy and in good spirits, and awoke the following morning in very poor health."" Mr Cooper died in his hotel room at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic resort at 11:00 local time on Tuesday, according to a statement by the Egyptian authorities. He had suffered a ""sharp drop in blood circulation"" and his cause of death was listed as ""sudden failure in the heart muscle and respiratory failure"". Mrs Cooper was taken to hospital five hours later in a ""state of fainting"" and, although heart recovery work took place for 30 minutes, she died at 17:12. Kelly Ormerod, pictured with her mother, says her parents were healthy the day before they died The statement said her cause of death was a ""drop of blood circulation and respiratory functions"". Sven Hirschler, senior director of corporate communications for Deutsche Hospitality, which owns the Steigenberger brand, said there was not an unusual level of illness among the 1,600 guests staying at the hotel. He said that Mr Cooper had complained of low blood pressure and was treated by the hotel's on-site doctor on the day he died. Janette Rawlingson, 43, from Chelmsford, Essex, who arrived at the hotel with her husband and two children on Tuesday, said Thomas Cook staff told guests at a meeting samples from the restaurant and swimming pool were being tested. ""Other guests are saying there are 40 people ill at the hotel with vomiting and diarrhoea,"" she said. ""A reasonable person can't help but wonder if there's a link between that illness and these deaths.""

"Witnesses say the sports car was driving at more than 100mph in the wrong direction A popular YouTuber known as McSkillet has killed a mother and daughter by driving his car at high speed the wrong way down a California highway. Trevor Heitmann, best known for playing Counter Strike and designing and selling custom content online, was also killed in the crash near San Diego. Police say his McLaren sports car collided with a car being driven by a woman with her daughter on Thursday. They have been named locally as 43-year-old Aileen and Aryana Pizarro, 12. Heitmann's car was destroyed in the impact, while Aileen Pizarro's SUV burst into flames. A number of other cars were also involved in the crash, which happened at about 16:30 local time (23:30 GMT). Witnesses told police the McLaren had been travelling at more than 100 mph (160km/h) at the time, and was driving southbound in a northbound lane on the Interstate-805 freeway. Heitmann's sports car was also involved in an earlier incident where it drove into the fence of an elementary school but no one was injured. The son of victim Aileen Pizarrodescribed his mother and sister to CBS News,externalas the ""kindest, most caring people in the world"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Zoe Weldon had to lie on a bench on a Tube platform when her abortion pill took effect Women in England will be allowed to take an early abortion pill at home, under a government plan due to take effect by the end of the year. Currently, women ending a pregnancy in its first 10 weeks must take two pills at a clinic, 24 to 48 hours apart. Under the new plans, which will bring Englandinto line with ScotlandandWales, the second pill can be taken at home. This avoids the risk of women miscarrying while on the journey home. The chief medical officer said the move would increase choice for women, and ensure they received ""safe and dignified care"". Professor Dame Sally Davies said: ""Abortion can be a difficult experience so it is important that women feel safe and as comfortable as possible."" 'My abortion pill took effect on Tube home' Women 'illegally taking abortion pill at home' England rules 'out of step' Claudia Craig, whobegan a campaign for home use of the abortion pill,externalfollowing her own experience last year, said the announcement showed that ""women's voices have been heard"". Ms Craig had to take a taxi home after taking an abortion pill and her symptoms had begun in the back of the cab. She said sharing her story was ""one of the hardest and scariest things I have ever done"" but she was relieved ""experiences like mine will now be a thing of the past"". Claudia Craig says ""women's voices have been heard"" Legalising the home use of misoprostol was also welcomed by leading gynaecologists. Professor Lesley Regan, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said it was ""a major step forward for women's healthcare"". ""This simple and practical measure will provide women with significantly more choice and is the most compassionate care we can give them"" she added. ""It will allow women to avoid the distress and embarrassment of bleeding and pain during their journey home from an unnecessary second visit to a clinic or hospital."" Paula - not her real name - says she was shocked to discover she was pregnant last summer at the age of 17 and wanted a termination. ""I was young and inexperienced, making it a scary event in my life,"" she said. ""I was upset to learn I couldn't go to my local hospital and had to drive one hour to a specialist clinic."" She had to make the trip three times - first for the initial scan and then for both pills. ""On the return journey from the second pill the effects I'd been told about kicked in quickly and more violently than I'd expected,"" she said. ""I began to miscarry on the way home. I just wanted to be in bed, not in a car on a motorway, as I started to feel ill really quickly."" Paula says the government's new plan will particularly help young people as abortion can be ""an alarming and sometimes traumatising experience"" for them. Pills used to perform medical abortions But the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said the move ""further trivialises abortion"". ""The abortion pill puts women through a terrible emotional and physical ordeal,"" a spokesperson said. ""The determination of the abortion industry to push women to undergo this in their own home with no real medical supervision illustrates their cavalier attitude when it comes to the well-being of women."" Right To Life is also concerned about the ability to adequately monitor who takes the pills and if they are taken freely, without force or coercion. Official government figures show that each year around 180,000 abortions are carried out in England, with medical abortions the most common way of ending an unwanted pregnancy. Medical abortion involves taking two types of tablet. The first, mifepristone, stops the hormone that allows the pregnancy to continue working. The second, misoprostol, is normally taken 24 to 48 hours later, and encourages the womb to contract to pass the pregnancy. After four to six hours, the lining of the womb breaks down, causing bleeding and loss of the pregnancy. The Department of Health said the change would come into force by the end of 2018. It said it would work closely with doctors to develop clinical guidance for all professionals to follow when providing the abortion pill to patients. Four in five terminations are early medical abortions, carried out before 10 weeks gestation, so the majority of women seeking abortions will now have the option for home-use. They will still be free to choose to take the second abortion pill in a clinic if they wish. Women wanting an early abortion will be given the usual checks under the Abortion Act - although this does not apply in Northern Ireland where the law is much stricter than the rest of the UK and terminations are all but outlawed.

" A tale of two pontiffs It is nearly 40 years since Pope Saint John Paul II's aeroplane swooped on to the runway at Dublin Airport. Roman Catholic Ireland held its breath as the Polish Pope knelt to kiss the tarmac, cape whipped by the wind. People called it a once-in-a-lifetime event. In Galway, thousands cheered as Pope John Paul II was welcomed on to a stage by the Right Reverend Eamonn Casey to celebrate a youth Mass. Few people knew at the time that Bishop Casey had a five-year-old son. When the news finally broke in 1992, the idea of an Irish Catholic bishop having sex, never mind fathering a child, was shocking to many believers. But that scandal paled in comparison with the deep fault lines within the Church that were to be exposed. The Catholic Church has been rocked by revelations of paedophile priests, sexual abuse in Catholic-run orphanages, and the exploitation of women in mother-and-baby homes. The Ireland that Pope Francis will visit is a very different country to that which greeted his Polish predecessor. Ireland has seen seismic changes in public attitudes to social issues including abortion, contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage. Pope Francis has won hearts the world over for his humility. He speaks out against economic injustice, conflict, the death penalty and the destruction of our environment. When elected in 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose his papal name to honour St Francis of Assisi, because of the saint’s devotion to the poor. The charismatic Argentine can expect a warm welcome in the Republic of Ireland - but not the same breathtaking devotion inspired by Pope John Paul II - who was declared a saint by Pope Francis in 2014. Father Brendan Hoban has recently retired - he’s 70; it was time. The Republic of Ireland is a country of ageing clerics - 70 is now the average age of its priests. With few young men to step into older men’s shoes, this papal visit comes at a time when almost every Irish diocese is facing a vocations “crisis”. Fr Hoban is a founding member of the Association of Catholic Priests. He stepped down as parish priest of Moygownagh, County Mayo, at the end of July, and his situation illustrates why so many parishes are struggling. ""There's nobody to replace me,"" he laments. A parish council has taken over the day-to-day running of Moygownagh and a neighbouring priest is coming in to celebrate Mass and the sacraments. The picture was very different when, as a teenager, he entered Ireland’s national seminary - St Patrick's College, Maynooth, County Kildare - in 1966. ""There were 84 students in my class and about 50 of those were ordained,"" Fr Hoban recalls. ""The class ahead of me had about 110.” Last year, six men enrolled at Maynooth seminary, the lowest in its 223-year history, according to the Irish Times. Founded in 1795 and designed to house 500 trainees, Maynooth was once the largest seminary in the world. It currently houses 35 seminarians - a handful of men preparing to cater for a country of more than 3.7 million Catholics. Maynooth used to be supported by a network of smaller diocesan seminaries across the Republic of Ireland, but they shut one by one. Northern Ireland’s only Catholic seminary - St Malachy's in Belfast - is to close later this year. ""If you have no priest, then you have no Mass, and if you've no Mass, then you have no Church,"" Fr Hoban warns. The Church must embrace change to survive, he says. The priesthood should be opened to women and married Catholics, he argues, ending the centuries-old rule that only single, celibate men can be ordained. In 1979, there were more than 6,200 priests throughout the island of Ireland. That figure has fallen to just over 3,900 but their age is the bigger problem. ""I'm just over 70 and I'm still the average age of priests in Ireland, which is absolutely bizarre,"" says Fr Hoban. An increasing burden is falling on the shoulders of the country's elderly clerics. Several are working beyond the age of 70, and many retired clerics are regularly called upon to help out. Five years ago, Fr Hoban wrote a book on Ireland's ""disappearing priests"" which warned that the country was facing a ""Eucharistic famine"". Now, he says his predictions are “coming true”. He criticises the Irish Bishops' Conference for failing to take decisive action. ""We need immediately to ordain married deacons,"" Fr Hoban says. ""We need immediately to decouple celibacy from the priesthood; we need immediately to invite back priests who have left to get married."" He argues there are enough men who gave up their vocation to start a family who could now ""come back to tide us over the crisis”. Fr Hoban also believes that the ordination of women is almost inevitable and suggests such a move may be ""only down the road"". He has previously accused the institution of thinking it had a ""God-given right to patronise, condescend, disrespect, ignore, and presume that women today will accept the excruciatingly embarrassing efforts we make, as a Church, to limit their role"". The Association of Catholic Priests represents more than a quarter of all the priests in Ireland. This summer, it carried out a survey ahead of Pope Francis’s visit, asking almost 1,400 people what they wanted to say to the pontiff about the Church in Ireland. The ACP said the results revealed “huge support for a radical reform” of the priesthood, with the number one proposal being “an equal role for women in the Church”. The status of Catholic women is a ""neuralgic issue"" for the Church, says Fr Hoban. If the Church doesn't sort that very soon, we're going to lose an awful lot of our people. We've lost their minds already, but we're going to lose their bodies in the Church, in a sense. Ireland remains a “predominantly Catholic country”, according to the Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO), but the percentage of the population who identify as Catholic has fallen. A census carried out in 1981, just two years after the last papal visit, showed that Catholics made up 93% of the population. By 2011, that figure had dropped to 84%. And the most recent census, in 2016, showed a further decline - to 78%. The CSO said the 2011-2016 drop was accompanied by a corresponding rise in the number with no religion, who now account for nearly 10% of the Irish population. Describing yourself as Catholic on a census form does not necessarily mean you actively practise your faith, but religious service attendance levels in Ireland are still relatively high, compared with other European countries. Of the 1,770 Irish Catholics who took part in the latest European Social Survey (ESS), 44% said they attended religious services at least once a week, second only to Poland. Almost two-thirds (62%) of Irish Catholics said they attend services at least once a month. Just under a quarter (24%) of young Irish Catholics, aged between 16 and 29, claim to go to Mass every week, according to analysis of ESS data from 2014 and 2016. Only their peers in Poland and Portugal professed to be more devout. The Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Reverend Diarmuid Martin, has warned about the “growing alienation"" of young people from the Church - acknowledging the crisis is larger than the lack of vocations. Fr Hoban says the Irish bishops have a moral responsibility to ensure there are enough priests to minister to future populations and to look after ageing clergy. After 45 years of ministry - does he ever regret his vocation and would he make the same decision now?""I certainly would look at it differently,"" he says. I've had a good life as a priest and I've got a lot of satisfaction and happiness out of it, but... if I was a married priest, I think I would have been a better priest. Mark Vincent Healy is one of the thousands of people in Ireland living with painful memories of child abuse. From the age of nine until he was 12, he was sexually abused by two priests from the Spiritans order. Picture: Mark Vincent Healy It happened more than 40 years ago when he was at St Mary's College, Rathmines. Mr Healy says it inflicted a ""lifelong injury"". ""There is a dark world, that has not been portrayed for people to understand, what it is like to live with post-traumatic stress disorder, caused in your childhood over issues of such violation and degradation as sexual abuse."" Mr Healy campaigns on behalf of other victims and took his fight for redress to the top of the Catholic Church. Four years ago, he was the first male survivor of Irish clerical sex abuse to meet Pope Francis. It was a ""significant moment in history” for him but he says the institution must realise it is only at the beginning of its journey of restitution. In the past 25 years, the Catholic Church in Ireland has been rocked by a catalogue of child-abuse scandals. Smyth was at the centre of one of the first paedophile priest scandals One of the most infamous was the case of Belfast-born paedophile priest Brendan Smyth, whose mishandled extradition led to the downfall of the Irish government in 1994. Since then, the physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children by priests and members of religious orders across Ireland has been laid bare. The 2009 Ryan Report collated evidence from 1,090 men and women who alleged they were abused as children in institutions in the Irish Republic, most of which were Catholic-run. About half of them said they had been sexually abused. The inquiry team concluded that ""sexual abuse was endemic in boys' institutions"" but that it was ""impossible to determine"" the full extent of the problem. Although the Church did not sanction child abuse, its hierarchy was condemned for trying to cover up scandals, thus placing even more children at risk. Priests and members of religious orders accused of abuse were often transferred to a different school or diocese or even sent to another continent. The practice enabled some offenders to groom new victims unaware of their past, and it also allowed some to evade justice completely as they were moved outside the jurisdiction. Picture: Mark Vincent Healy Mr Healy says the full international ramifications of shuffling suspects in and out of Ireland is still unknown and it is an issue he hopes will be addressed during the Pope's visit. The campaigner has personally experienced both success and failure in his attempts to hold suspects to account. One of the priests he accused, Henry Moloney, received multiple criminal convictions for abusing Mr Healy and other schoolboys, one of whom later took his own life. The second priest,  Arthur Carragher, was transferred to ministry in Canada and could not be extradited to Ireland. Before his death in Canada in 2011, Carragher admitted abusing two other Irish boys who took a civil action against him. Mr Healy wants to know how many paedophile priests were sent abroad where they continued to abuse. In 2006, the Church set up its own abuse watchdog - the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland (NBSCCCI). Between 2011 and 2017, it published a series of reports outlining the history and known extent of child abuse in every diocese on the island, including separate reviews into religious orders who ran schools and residential institutions. The data revealed that in one order alone - the Christian Brothers - 870 allegations were made against 325 brothers, 12 of whom were convicted. But the island-wide audit did not tell the full story. In its latest annual report, the watchdog noted a ""significant increase"" in the number of new claims and concerns about child abuse. It recorded 135 new allegations in 2017-2018, most of them historical, compared with a total of 86 the previous year. The board's spokesman said when a clerical abuse story gets significant national media coverage, it often prompts more victims to come forward. Earlier this year, several victims of the late paedophile priest Malachy Finegan broke decades of silence to say he had sexually abused them at a school in Newry, County Down, and in the nearby parish of Clonduff, Hilltown. More than 30 people say they were abused by Malachy Finegan The Police Service of Northern Ireland has since set up a dedicated team to investigate Finegan's crimes. More than 30 people have come forward to say they were abused. Almost a quarter of a century after the Brendan Smyth case, the Church still has sins to confess. Mr Healy has carried out his own research into abuse statistics, using data from the NBSCCCI’s all-island reports, and he highlights the low conviction rate in cases involving foreign missionaries. ""There were 2,086 accusations in the national audit against 811 missionary priests, of whom 43 were held to account,"" he says. He laments the fact that of these cases, almost 95% did not result in a conviction. In 1996, the Church began to set up dedicated helplines and cross-border counselling services for victims who suffered at the hands of priests and members of Catholic orders. Over the last two decades, Towards Healing and its predecessor, Faoiseamh Counselling Service, have supported 5,470 people and provided 365,820 counselling sessions. Mr Healy welcomes the efforts made, but argues that much more must be done for those who were robbed of their childhood. I want to see far better, lifelong support for those who are abused, because their trauma doesn't end. “This is an injury, sadly, which lasts a lifetime."" In the 40 years since Pope John Paul II visited Ireland, one of the country’s most noticeable changes has been in its attitude to sexuality. Today, in a country where the prime minister is an openly gay man, a high-profile figure declaring their homosexuality would not merit much controversy. Joni Crone featured on RTÉ's Late Late Show But for Joni Crone, the stomach-churning moment in 1980 when she came out as lesbian on Irish television is etched in her memory. Somebody offered her a vodka to calm her nerves. This was an Ireland where people could be treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to ""cure""  them of homosexuality. A night out for anyone who was gay or lesbian could end in a beating. Homosexuality was a crime. Ms Crone's decision to speak out was prompted by the despairing women who rang the lesbian helpline. She knew that coming out to a million viewers on the Late Late Show was risky. She had friends lined up to whisk her out of the country, if things turned nasty. The Late Late Show was hosted by Gay Byrne She knew the eyes of Ireland were on her. Byrne pulled no punches. ""What would compel a girl like you to appear on a programme like this and blow, as it were, her cover?"" he asked. She thought she was coming on to promote the lesbian helpline, but he stuck with personal questions. He asked if her parents saw her as ""somehow mentally deficient, sinful or culpably ignorant?"" ""We often have the impression that people like you go about like ravenous wolves seeking whom you may devour,"" he told her. ""We're not all so promiscuous or so highly sexed as people imagine,"" she countered. The following Monday, in work, the youngest man in the office came to shake her hand. The managing director praised her courage. But a trader on Camden Street, Dublin, spat at her and said she would not serve the “likes of her”. Two years later, in 1982, 31-year-old Declan Flynn was kicked and beaten to death with sticks in Fairview Park, Dublin, by a gang of ""queer-bashing teenagers"". The youths pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to between one and five years - the sentences were suspended. Mr Justice Sean Gannon, the presiding judge, said: ""It's important the public should know it could never have been murder, although it was an appalling thing for Declan Flynn and his family."" He allowed the five accused to walk free because, he said, there was ""no element of correction required"" as they had ""come from good homes and have experienced care and affection"". His ruling caused public outrage and led to one of the first big gay rights demonstrations in Dublin. The switch in attitudes came slowly, says Ms Crone. ""We had the Irish trade unions and we had the women's council. We kept talking in small ways to maybe 20 people at a time. It was like a pebble in a pond."" The ripples spread, gathered force, swelled to a tidal wave. It would be 1993 before consensual homosexual acts between adults were decriminalised in Ireland. In May 2015, the Republic of Ireland became the first in the world to legalise same-sex civil marriage by popular vote. Last year, Leo Varadkar was appointed Taoiseach - Irish prime minister. He is the son of an immigrant and openly gay - a symbol of a new Ireland. Earlier this year, the Irish voted by 66.4% to 33.6% to overturn the country's ban on abortion. ""In 1979 when Pope John Paul II came to Ireland, there was so much reverence for him. Dublin was like a ghost town. Everybody was there,"" says Ms Crone. With Pope Francis, it feels like he's coming to bolster the old guard. It's no surprise after the two referendums that he's here. Now gay and lesbian people are integrated into Irish culture. At this year's Pride celebrations, bus driver fathers picked up their gay sons and drove them joyfully in a rainbow bus through the streets of Dublin. Within the Church, change is in the air. At this week’s World Meeting of Families (WMOF) in Dublin, US priest Father James Martin will speak on “Showing Welcome and Respect in our Parishes for LGBT People and their Families”. The Jesuit scholar is known for his liberal views on homosexuality and Pope Francis has appointed him to the Vatican's Secretariat for Communication. Thousands signed a petition protesting against Fr Martin’s inclusion at the Dublin event, but it will go ahead. Meanwhile, for Joni Crone, it is the country’s young who inspire her. ""Young people in their 20s have fire in their bellies,"" she says. ""They are just not going to take it anymore. I think that's brilliant."" One of the most chilling effects on people’s attitude to the Irish Church has come after revelations about its treatment of unmarried mothers and their babies. In Tuam, Galway, in the 1950s and 60s, the clatter of hobnail boots on the road was the signal the ""home babies"" were passing. They were poor, their hair clipped short. They lived in the mother-and-baby home run by the Catholic Bon Secours sisters. Their badge of shame was that they had been born ""out of wedlock"". These were the children of ""fallen women"". The mother-and-baby homes and the Magdalene Laundries were institutions run by the Irish state and the Catholic Church for such women. The regime was cruel. There are stories of women being forced to give birth without pain relief and in silence and then having the baby whisked away for adoption. Many of the women ended up in the laundries - Catholic-run workhouses where 10,000 women and girls were forced to do unpaid, manual labour between 1922 and 1996. The last Magdalene asylum in Ireland closed in Waterford in 1996. A 2013 report found the Irish state was involved in the scandal. As a little girl growing up in County Galway in the 1960s, Catherine Corless shared the classroom with the ""home babies"". The town children were not encouraged to mix with them. Once she saw another girl offer a fake sweet to a home baby. ""She said, ‘If you hand that girl an empty sweet paper, she'll take it,’"" she recalls. ""So I wrapped up an empty sweet paper and pretended it was a sweet to the other girl and she grabbed it. It was only in later years, I realised that those children never got any sweets - no treats whatsoever, not even at Christmas. ""My mind went back to that day and that little child who thought she was getting a treat and I would have laughed at her. ""That has horrified me since, it has haunted me really."" The Tuam home was one of 10 institutions across Ireland to which about 35,000 unmarried pregnant women were sent. It operated between 1925 and 1961. Conditions were poor and hundreds of babies and children died of natural causes: At the Tuam mother-and-baby home between 1925 and 1961, a child died nearly every two weeks. After the Tuam home closed, a housing estate was built. In the 1970s, two boys discovered bones and the local people built a shrine to what they believed were famine dead. In 2011, Corless set out on a personal crusade. She looked for the death certificates of the 796 children who had died at the home, for whom there were no burial records. She paid for each death certificate herself. She wanted to put up a plaque in their memory. What she found made headlines across the world. The skeletons of hundreds of babies and children lay in an unmarked mass grave. It was a shame that the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny called ""a chamber of horrors"". ""We buried our compassion, humanity and mercy,"" he told the Irish parliament. Bedsheets with the names of victims have been put on the shrine's gates A public inquiry into Ireland's mother-and-baby homes was established in 2015. It is due to report by February 2019. Ms Corless remains saddened by the Catholic Church's response. ""If we could get an apology from the Pope when he comes that might help,"" she says. The Church has said it is shocked and horrified by the discovery of the children's remains. Ms Corless would like more. ""I'm saddened at those who preach and tell us how to live,"" she says. This was a golden opportunity but they chose to protect themselves and to protect the institution that is the Church. Their numbers may have dwindled, but there are still men who want to devote their lives to God and the Catholic Church. Fr David Vard was ordained in 2017 When Father David Vard was ordained at the age of 25 last summer, he became the youngest priest in Ireland making national headlines as he took holy orders in his hometown of Newbridge, County Kildare. His vocation was almost a decade in the making. A year before he told anyone he wanted to be a priest, he was not even a practising Catholic. “I wasn't religious in the slightest. ""My mother would have to bribe me to go to Mass at Christmas,” he says. As a 16-year-old schoolboy, he travelled to Lourdes, the Catholic shrine in south-west France. It changed his life. He reluctantly agreed to go after his teachers said their parish needed young people to push wheelchairs. The people he met in Lourdes had a profound effect on him. “There were no great miracles,” he says. “It was just that I saw the Church, and a Church alive that I'd never seen before. This was people who were living out a faith, who were living out their Christianity. A celibate life might not be the most attractive prospect to many 16-year-old boys, but Fr Vard had a frank conversation with a priest he met on the pilgrimage. Fr David Vard was ordained in 2017 ""I got to ask him very honest questions, like, 'Did you never want to have children? Did you never want to have a girlfriend?' ""His responses made me see that priests were normal people."" Shortly after his final school exams, aged 18, he entered Maynooth seminary, and began the seven-year course for the priesthood. Telling his teenage friends was daunting. ""I told a lot of them when they were drunk, which was the best thing to do,"" he jokes. ""My very good friends supported me... I'm still friends with all of them."" Some of his elder, more outspoken colleagues say the vow of celibacy is one of the reasons why few young men contemplate the priesthood. Fr Vard understands why some are hesitant, but supports a celibate clergy. ""We're giving our life to the Church, we're giving our life to God,” he says. ""I think it would be exceptionally unfair to a wife, to children. ""I could get moved from my parish tomorrow. Does that mean that if I was married with a wife and kids, I would have to move all of them out of their schooling? Would my wife have to change her job? ""There is a whole practical reason around it but there are also very deep theological reasons which I do support."" Fr Vard says Maynooth seminarians have a spiritual director and are encouraged to speak openly about celibacy - he says they have seven years to consider their decision. Fr David Vard was ordained in 2017 After ordination, he took his first appointment as a curate in Portlaoise Parish, County Laois, where, he says, his first year has been ""very happy"". But the attention that comes with being Ireland's youngest priest has brought its own challenges, as he tries to balance expectations. ""You have to live up to that pressure of being 'the cool priest', or whatever,"" Fr Vard says. ""Someone asked me to do their wedding recently because they found out I was on Instagram and they thought that was so cool. ""Why wouldn't I be on Instagram? All my friends are on Instagram. Find me a 26-year-old that's not on Instagram.""Fr Vard has tickets to see his boss in Dublin. He hopes that Pope Francis will acknowledge the trauma caused by clerical sex abuse and the treatment of women and children in homes for unmarried mothers. In Ireland and other countries there has been a complete deviation from the central person who is Jesus Christ, who is a man of love and compassion. ""We did not show that to every one of our members and we have to acknowledge that. “We can't bury our head in the sand, we also have to apologise for it."" He suggests that perhaps the papal visit could resurrect an institution that has struggled with painful issues in recent years. Throughout the history of the Church we've these cycles of ups and downs and we have certainly been on the down in recent years. ""Maybe this papal visit will signal that turning of the corner."" Lisa O'Hare knows more than most what it takes to raise the next generation of Irish Catholics. The 41-year-old County Tyrone mother has seven children under the age of 12 - two of whom have special needs - and is expecting her eighth. Three years ago, she helped set up the Rise of the Roses, a movement aimed at encouraging young women to consider ""consecrated life"" - becoming a nun. Girls aged from 14 to young women in their 20s were taken to visit convents across Ireland. ""We wanted to open the girls' minds, to go and visit these religious sisters to see how happy and joyful they were in this calling,"" she explains. ""We were trying to open their hearts to answering the call from God, whether he was calling them to religious life or married life; both are equally important vocations. ""Obviously I am in the married vocation, but we wanted to create a culture of saying yes to God."" She says Rise of the Roses was an attempt to break stereotypical preconceptions about nuns and religious vocations. “In this culture, if someone came home to their parents and said, ‘I’m thinking of becoming a religious sister,’ even their family and their friends would be really shocked, it’s so counter cultural.” The full-time mother juggles family life with her part-time role with Human Life International, a group promoting traditional Catholic teachings on abortion, euthanasia, marriage and family. She says she was devastated by the Irish abortion referendum result earlier this year, when two-thirds of the electorate voted to overturn the ban. ""Many of us described it almost like a death, "" she says. ""We described it as a crucifixion. ""You have to endure the crucifixion and look forward with great hope to the resurrection."" She fears that Ireland has ""turned away from God"" in recent years and Catholics who try to follow the Church's teachings on social issues are becoming increasingly isolated. Such secularism has entered the Church that people take or leave parts of the challenges of our faith, and those that want to live it authentically often feel that they are called radical or fundamentalists. The Rise of the Roses was her attempt to rekindle the culture of consecrated women. At the last official count, there were 5,730 sisters in Ireland’s 26 dioceses, outnumbering all the priests and brothers put together. But with fewer younger women joining religious orders, nuns who retire from teaching and nursing posts are more likely to be replaced by lay people. Many argue that the vow of celibacy puts young people off becoming nuns and priests, but Mrs O'Hare dismisses this. ""It is sacrificial, but every single Christian and Catholic is called to a sacrificial life,"" she says. ""My middle child had extensive brain surgery, so most people would think we're crazy for having any more children, that we've enough to contend with. ""My baby, Michael, has Down's Syndrome and yet we're expecting again, and that's because I have ultimate trust in Jesus and I know that he will guide me."" Mrs O'Hare believes the Catholic Church in Ireland has experienced a ""perfect storm"" in the last 20 years. This individualist culture where it's all 'Me, what I need and what I can get from certain aspects of life. ""That has been catastrophic,"" she says. However, she adds that storm also included ""shocking"" revelations about paedophile priests and mother-and-baby homes. She says the abuse was ""pure evil"". ""The people who inflicted these terrible atrocities didn't only affect those directly involved, they have affected a generation,"" she says. ""They've affected the priests' and the religious [community’s] ability to communicate a message, because it has been absolutely undermined."" What is her hope for the future of the Church in Ireland? ""I'm so passionate about our nation, about our country, about the culture that we have. ""It's something that I hope to build up in my own personal way by providing children and a family and working hard in my small parish and community - we can do that from the grassroots up and everyone has to play their part."" She adds: ""Ireland has faced many a trial and the faith has been under many an attack over the centuries and God has never let us down, so we will just continue with that hope in our hearts."" Between then and now lies a vast chasm. From the visit of Pope John Paul II to the visit of Pope Francis, the change has been seismic. Tremors have rocked Irish society, politics and culture. Modern Ireland is unrecognisable to that of Pope John Paul II's 1979 visit. Pope Francis will be aware of that. Much is expected of the Argentine Pope, not least from the thousands of abuse survivors who will want an official acknowledgement of the Church’s role in their suffering. The story of abuse and the Church’s response to that abuse leaves ugly scars. Days before his Irish visit, Pope Francis wrote a letter to all Catholics begging forgiveness for “our sins and the sins of others”. “We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,” he said. The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Reverend Eamon Martin, says people “want to know that the Church accepts that abuse within the Church was systemic, that it was facilitated and that this will happen no more”. What people want, he says, is to know that they and their children will be as safe in a Catholic church as they would be at home. Despite all this, excitement for the papal visit is strong. Pope Francis’s words could have a significant impact. Although he will step off that plane on to the tarmac of a markedly different Ireland, like Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis is a charismatic figure. He is also more nuanced than the Polish Pope. His official stance on sexual ethics may be similar, but his tone is strikingly different. Pope Francis is attempting to change the conversation from one focused on sexual ethics to one centred on social justice and a politically relevant version of the Christian gospel. If that is a message he can deliver in Ireland this weekend, it may be the breath of fresh air needed to help halt the Church’s decline in this traditionally Catholic country.

"Manchester Pride, Leeds Festival and Creamfields are among several large events taking place on Saturday Workers at train company Northern have begun a 24-hour strike in a long-running row over driver-only operated trains.

"The impact of a no-deal Brexit on British science could be worse than previously thought, according to a new analysis. UK researchers risk losing access to much of the EU funding that's currently available to them, it says. The campaign group Scientists for EU has studied the Brexit technical notes released by the government on Thursday. One of the documents states the UK would no longer be eligible for three of the EU's major funding programmes. The analysis estimates that those streams of research cash provide up to 45% of the total of EU science funding coming Britain's way. The government says it hopes to avoid leaving the EU without a deal and that it is working to ensure that the UK will continue to take part in European research projects. EC hopes for big science funding uplift PM 'will pay' for post-Brexit science deal UK scientists have been highly successful at bidding for European research grants, winning 4.6bn euros since 2014 from the EU's Horizon 2020 science programme. When Britain becomes a non-EU country it should still be eligible to participate - countries like Israel have an associate status that allows them to take part. And the government says it is a priority for relations to continue. But three related research programmes are only open to EU countries, as the government's technical briefing makes clear, and these can be highly valuable. The European Research Council (ERC) issues prestigious grants which have so far been worth a total of â¬1.29bn to the UK. The government is considering what other measures are needed to support UK research in the event of a no-deal Brexit Another set of grants, known as Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions, have totalled nearly â¬0.7bn for researchers here. And a third programme, SME instrument grants, which are designed to encourage small innovative businesses, has seen nearly 140m euros heading to the UK. According to Dr Mike Galsworthy of Scientists for EU, a non-deal Brexit ""would mean losing over half a billion a year in high value grants"". He explained: ""No deal would wreck nearly half the funding we're eligible for, it would be absolutely devastating."" Dr Galsworthy also highlights a potential problem with British applications to the elements of the Horizon 2020 programme that will still be open to the UK. One of the conditions is that the coordinator of any grant must be from an EU member state or from a developing country. So far, British researchers have had an enviable track record of leading EU-funded science projects - this role may now be at risk and may affect the scale of cash secured here. For many in the UK science community, the best hope lies in the government negotiating a deal that sees a close science relationship continuing with the EU. And that's the emphasis too from the government itself. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: ""The government's priority is to conclude and finalise the Withdrawal Agreement. This would ensure that the UK's participation in Horizon 2020 would be unaffected when we leave the EU."" Ministers have repeatedly stressed that bids for EU funding will be underwritten up to 2020. The ERC funds activity across all fields of research, with the emphasis squarely on excellence The BEIS spokesperson added: ""The UK has announced support for third-country participation in a no-deal scenario via the extension to the underwrite guarantee. ""We are considering what other measures may be necessary to support UK research and innovation in the unlikely event of no-deal."" Some figures in the world of science are putting their faith in Europe's next big science programme, Horizon Europe, which is due to start in 2020, and may be more open to countries outside the EU. Dr Sarah Main of the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) told me: ""It looks like the hints about greater openness are part of a genuine ambition to be more accessible to the rest of the world ""So that's a chink of light, and we do know that there's an appetite in the research community to find ways for UK and European researchers to work together in future."" But Dr Main also says that, in the meantime, the uncertainty of Britain's future relations with the EU is having an impact. University College London has seen a drop in the number of fellowship applications from EU researchers and UK business has slipped from being the second largest recipient of Horizon 2020 funding to the fifth largest. For Leave campaigners, the argument has long been that British science will benefit from being free of EU regulations on developments such as GM and being more open to collaborations beyond Europe.

"The Catholic Church in Ireland is organised on an all-island basis Pope Francis is coming to the Republic of Ireland in the wake of two referendums which illustrate a country moving away from its traditional Catholic roots. Church and state were once deeply entwined in a nation that used to be among the most conservative in Europe. Over the past three years, theIrish electorate has voted to legalise same-sex marriageand toend the constitutional ban on abortion. But despite groundbreaking changes in social attitudes, official figures show the Republic of Ireland remains a predominantly Catholic country. The latest census, carried out in 2016, showed that more than three quarters of the population describe themselves as Catholic. The rate of attendances at religious services also remains relatively high in Ireland, at least when compared to other European nations with large Catholic populations. One of the main problems for the Church, at present, is finding the manpower to minister to its flock. A country that was once home tothe largest seminary in the world,external, and which sent thousands of its missionaries around the globe, no longer has enough priests to staff all its parishes. At present, the Catholic population in the Republic of Ireland stands at just over 3.7m people, according tothe 2016 census,external. However, the last four decades have seen a falling trend, in terms of the proportion of the population as a whole. Maynooth is the largest seminary in Ireland In 1981, two years after Pope John Paul II toured Ireland, Catholics accounted for 93% of the population. The 1991 census, carried out shortly before the Church was engulfed in clerical abuse scandals, recorded little change at 92%. But by 2011, the figure had fallen to 84% and over the next five years, there was a further decline. The latest available statistic, from the 2016 census, puts the percentage of Catholics in Ireland at 78%. The Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) said that decline has been accompanied by a ""corresponding rise in the number with no religion"". There are now more than 468,000 Irish residents who say they are not religious, equating to almost one tenth of the population. The Republic of Ireland is still a predominantly Catholic country The Catholic Church in Ireland is historically organised on an all-island basis, with some of its 26 dioceses and archdioceses stretching along both sides of the Irish border. In Northern Ireland,the Catholic population is growing, especially among younger age groups. Between Census Day 2001 and Census Day 2011,Northern Ireland's Catholic population increased by almost 80,000,external. The census in 2011 stated that Catholics made up 45% of the population, while Protestants accounted for 48%. But more recent figures, taken from the 2016 Labour Force Survey, showed that 44% of the working-age population are now Catholic while 40% are Protestant. The older population is more likely to describe themselves as Catholic The difference is even more marked among Northern Ireland's schoolchildren, where more than half (51%) are Catholic and 37% are Protestant. Age is a particularly significant factor in religious demographics. Data from the most recent European Social Survey (EES) showed that young people in the Republic of Ireland are three times more likely to say they have no religion than the oldest citizens of the state. Just over 40% of 15-25 year olds who took part in the survey in 2016/17 said they were not religious, while only 13% of those aged over 85 had no faith. However, among the remaining 60% of 15-25 years who said they are religious, the vast majority (87%) described themselves as Catholic. Although Mass attendances have fallen, they remain high compared to Europe A generation ago, Sunday Mass was a regular feature of life in Ireland, while now many churches struggle to fill their pews on the Sabbath. However, religious service attendance among younger Irish Catholics continues to be relatively high, perhaps not by traditional Irish standards, but certainly compared to their European peers, St Mary's University, Twickenham, has analysed data from ESS surveys in 2014 and 2016,external, and found that almost a quarter of Irish Catholics aged 16-29 claim to attend church at least once a week. Young Catholics in Poland, native land of Pope John Paul II, top the list with 47% of them attending weekly Mass, followed by their Portuguese counterparts at 27%. Looking at the wider population, fewer than half (44%) of Irish Catholic adults who took part in the 2016/17 ESS said they went to church at least once a week. However, the figure still suggests that Irish respondents are more devout than those in other traditionally Catholic nations like Portugal, Italy and Spain. Loaves to loos: Pope Francis' visit in numbers 'Lollipopes' to bunting: The Papal products flying off the shelves On the bus: Remembering Pope John Paul II's 1979 visit Even if they are not regular Mass-goers, Irish Catholics still turn to the Church to mark significant occasions in their lives. In 2016, there were just over 14,700 Catholic wedding ceremonies throughout Ireland, both north and south of the border, and more than 68,000 baptisms. However, the figures are lower compared to 1979, when Ireland last hosted a papal visit. Back then there were more than 82,700 baptisms and the number of weddings was 38% higher with almost 23,900 Catholic couples tying the knot. Such celebrations still require a celebrant, and with few young men joining the ranks of the clergy, parish priests are in short supply. The 2018 Irish Catholic Directory states that there are more than 3,900 priests on the island, but that figure includes members of religious orders as well as clerics who are retired, sick or on study leave. This video can not be played Church and state were once deeply entwined in the Republic of Ireland Vocations have plummeted over the last 30 years, contributing to a rise in the average age of a priest which is now about 70. Ireland's national seminary, St Patrick's College Maynooth, was home to more than 300 trainee priests when Pope John Paul visited the building in 1979. Within 20 years, their numbers had more than halved. Currently, there are just 35 seminarians studying in an institution that was designed to house more than 500 trainee priests. Maynooth is not the only facility that trains Irish priests but it is soon to be the only one left on the island. During the last academic year, there were 13 seminarians at the Irish College in Rome. There were also three trainees at St Malachy's in Belfast, the only seminary in Northern Ireland, but it is due to close at the end of this year. Dioceses which have been unable to replace retiring priests have asked their colleagues to take charge of more than one parish, and some parishes have been clustered into ""pastoral areas"" for the provision of Masses. The seminary in Maynooth was designed to house 500 trainees priests (photo circa 1935) Earlier this month, the Diocese of Clogher published a pastoral letter entitled ""The Future Mission of Our Parishes"" which outlined the ""current reality in the diocese in terms of the diminishing number of priests and their increasing age profile"". ""During the past year alone, the diocese has lost the service of seven priests through death, serious illness and other reasons,"" a diocesan statement said. ""While there was one new priest ordained, the letter makes it is clear that the number of active priests in our diocese will continue to decline."" The letter set out a ""vision for a wide range of lay ministries"" within the Diocese of Clogher and added that ""great possibilities lie ahead"". BBC News NI contacted each of the 26 dioceses to get a picture of how they are dealing with the demographic consequences of the drop in vocations. The Catholic Church in Ireland is organised on an all-island basis Each diocese was asked for their latest statistics on the numbers of active, retired, newly ordained and non-national priests, and whether they had to cut services due to a shortage of priests. The figures show the parish staffing situation across the island is very mixed, with about half of the dioceses saying there has been no significant effect on services over the past five years. However, the rest said they have either reduced or readjusted Mass times, or indicated that they are increasingly dependent on lay Catholics to take on more parish responsibilities. Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""There may have been some re-adjustments but no significant loss in services provided.""

Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""There has not been any significant change in the number of Masses in the Diocese of Derry over the past five years."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?A spokesman said the times of services ""are reviewed on an ongoing basis"", but added that it is ""difficult to attribute these changes to a shortage of priests"".  He said Down and Connor ""continues to meet the needs"" of all its parishes. Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?A spokesman said services have been changed for a ""wide range of reasons"", including changing population trends, so it is not correct ""to link this simply to a reduction in the number of priests"". Has the archdiocese been forced to reduce services?""There are enough priests for the celebration of Sunday Mass - however, the number of Masses has been reduced in some parishes."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Not significantly, thanks to the generosity of priestsâ¦ Priests are experiencing greater pressure to meet pastoral needs and especially to find energy for new initiatives and challenges.""  *Elphin has a strong missionary tradition and its 35 diocesan priests are supported full-time by 28 non-diocesan priests. Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Yes."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Mass schedules change for a variety of reasons, it is incorrect to characterize such changes as 'forced'. Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Yes. We have six parishes without a resident priest."" Their spokeswoman added that a ""key priority is resourcing the laity to take up roles of responsibility"". Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Some parishes have rearranged Masses... but priests continue to do all the things they normally would with the assistance of the parish family."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""No."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Yes."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""The number of priests has been reduced by up to half. Where once there were two priests ministering, now there is only one."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""It is clear that with fewer priests [not as many] will be involved in various pastoral activities; there are however many lay people taking up new rolesâ¦ In the last year more than 120 parish volunteers have been trained to lead public prayer."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?A spokesman said: ""There have been no considerable changes in general to provision of Masses, sacraments or pastoral services over the past five years.""  But they added that lay people are ""playing a more active role"". Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?Their spokesman said Mass times have been adjusted in recent years and adds that it is ""certainly true to say this also reflects the number of clergy"". Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""No."" Has the archdiocese been forced to reduce services?""Not necessarily, the restructuring was planned well in advance."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""There has been a small reduction in the number of scheduled Masses, particularly at weekends.

"This video can not be played British tourist: ""It was a bit scary."" British holidaymakers have been flown home early from the Egyptian hotel where a British couple died. John Cooper, 69, and his wife Susan, 63, from Burnley, died at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic resort in Hurghada on Tuesday. The couple's daughter, who was also staying at the hotel, said she believed their deaths were suspicious. Following the deaths, Thomas Cook said it wasremoving all its customersfrom the hotel as a ""precautionary measure"". A plane carrying people who had been staying at the hotel arrived at Manchester Airport in the early hours. One of the passengers told the BBC: ""When you find out at 10:00-10:30 at night that two people have died two days ago, and nobody knows why... If they'd been open and transparent, I wouldn't have got on that plane."" Another woman said: ""No-one had said a word until Thursday. But it is a bit scary."" The tour operator has said the circumstances of the deaths are ""unclear"". The Red Sea governorate said medical checks by a health inspector revealed ""no criminal suspicions"". There are ""no criminal suspicions"" over the deaths of John and Susan Cooper, the Egyptian authorities say The couple's daughter Kelly Ormerod, who was on holiday with her three children, said something ""doesn't add up"" about the explanations of her parents' deaths. ""I believe their deaths are not due to natural causes,"" she said. ""My parents went to sleep on the Monday evening, fit, healthy and in good spirits, and awoke the following morning in very poor health."" Mrs Ormerod said the authorities had failed to keep her updated on the situation and were preventing her from leaving the country. ""I need answers,"" she said. In a statement, authorities in Egypt said Mr Cooper died in his hotel room at 11:00 local time on Tuesday. He had suffered a ""sharp drop in blood circulation and a sudden stop in the heart muscle"", and his cause of death was listed as ""sudden failure in the heart muscle and respiratory failure"". Mrs Cooper was taken to hospital five hours later in a ""state of fainting"" and, although heart recovery work took place for 30 minutes, she died at 17:12. Kelly Ormerod, pictured with her mother, says her parents were healthy the day before they died The authorities said her cause of death was a ""drop of blood circulation and respiratory functions"". Egypt's tourism minister Rania Al-Mashat told the BBC the public prosecution office was investigating and would report ""within the next week or 10 days"". Thomas Cook said it had no evidence that carbon monoxide was a factor. On Thursday, it said it had received ""further reports of a raised level of illness among guests"" at the hotel. It said 301 holidaymakers would have options for different hotels from Friday and those wishing to go home would be flown back. Sven Hirschler, senior director of corporate communications for Deutsche Hospitality, which owns the Steigenberger brand, said there was not an unusual level of illness among the 1,600 guests staying at the hotel. He said that Mr Cooper had complained of low blood pressure and was treated by the hotel's on-site doctor on the day he died. This video can not be played Janine Traviss and her husband fell ill during a stay at the same hotel Janette Rawlingson, 43, from Chelmsford, Essex, who arrived at the hotel with her husband and two children on Tuesday, said Thomas Cook staff told guests at a meeting it was testing samples from the restaurant and swimming pool. ""Other guests are saying there are 40 people ill at the hotel with vomiting and diarrhoea,"" she said. ""A reasonable person can't help but wonder if there's a link between that illness and these deaths."" Other holidaymakers have told the BBC about their experiences with illness during stays at the Steigenberger Aqua Magic. Janine Traviss, from Oldham, said she and her partner fell ill with a stomach bug during a holiday earlier this month. ""I subsequently have been ill for several weeks now since returning and had to visit the doctor on two occasions with two full weeks of antibiotics,"" she said. ""I am still recovering and still feel very tired and exhausted most days."" Thomas Cook said it was working closely with the hotel and supporting the local authorities with their investigations. It stated the hotel was last audited late last month and received an overall score of 96%. ""We will be contacting those customers due to travel to the Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel in Hurghada in the next four weeks to offer alternative holiday options,"" the tour operator said. Susan Cooper worked at the Thomas Cook branch in Burnley Mrs Cooper worked at the travel firm's Burnley branch, which remained closed for a second day on Friday. She has been described as a ""loyal and long-serving"" member of staff by the company. Alban Barker, 70, who lives close to the Coopers' home, paid tribute to a ""really great couple"" who were season ticket holders at Burnley. He said Mr Cooper, a clay pigeon shooting enthusiast, was an ""extremely good, very reliable builder"". ""I bumped into them the other week and told him 'it's about time you retired' and he just laughed and said, 'I'm fine, I'm fit enough'. ""He looked well, he was a strong man.""

"Tesla chief executive Elon Musk says he will no longer be taking the electric car maker private, just two weeks after saying he was considering a deal. The plan was cancelled after a board meeting on Thursday,external, he wrote in a post published on the company's site. Since Mr Musk announced his plan to delist Tesla, its share price has dropped by 20%. He said he had told the board ""that I believe the better path is for Tesla to remain public,"" and that they agreed. Mr Musk, who owns about a fifth of the company, said he had spoken with shareholders and major banks to consider the privatisation but found the sentiment was ""please don't do this"".

Tesla shares rose sharply on 7 August following Mr Musk's suggestion he would take Tesla private, but have continued to fall since then. The slide has been good news for short sellers, who bet that Tesla's share price would fall. Mr Musk has a well-known dislike of short sellers, whom he has called ""jerks who want us to die"" and has argued that taking Tesla off the stock exchange would shield it from their attacks. Tesla saw its share price fall after Mr Musk's tweet Shares fell even further after Mr Musk gave an emotional interview to the New York Times, in whichhe said he was working 120 hour weeks and had been using sedatives,external.

"An estimated half the population of the island of Ireland turned out to see John Paul II on his visit to Ireland in 1979 Rewind to Ireland 1979. When Pope John Paul II's plane touched down at Dublin airport, the crowds waved yellow and white papal flags; held up babies; pushed forward wheelchairs; cheered. The figure of John Paul II emerged from the plane, moved down the steps and, cloak whipping in the wind, knelt to kiss Irish soil. It was an historic moment. Almost a third of the population turned up to cheer him at Dublin's Phoenix Park. Across the country, in the weeks and year that followed, midwives and doctors in Irish maternity hospitals held up newborns, announced: ""It's a boy"" and one in ten mothers opted for ""John Paul"". The past is a distant country. That was 39 years ago. Ireland has changed. BBC News NI asked some of the John Pauls their thoughts on the Pope, Catholicism and living with that moniker. John Paul Feeley is proud to be a Catholic John-Paul Feeley is a solicitor, a councillor for Cavan County Council, a member of Fianna FÃ¡il and Shannon Gaels GAA, a Cavan supporter... and a proud Catholic. ""I was born in 1981 and I was a seventh son,"" he says. ""I was named after the Pope and I wasn't alone. There were John Pauls in my school and there were also Karols - after the Pope's Polish Christian name. ""The world has changed since 1979. We are no different in Ireland - it's just that we think we're extremely different. ""I'll see the Pope. I hope to attend the World Meeting of Families on both Saturday and Sunday. As for being a Catholic - that is is one of the organisations of which I'm happy to say I'm a member. ""I go to Mass. Shock! Horror! Disbelief! Loaves to loos: Pope Francis' visit in numbers 'Lollipopes' and bunting: The Papal products flying off the shelves On the bus: Remembering John Paul II's 1979 visit Irish Church in graphs - a flock without shepherds? ""One of the underlying ideas being put out there is that Ireland has changed so much and there is nobody going to see the Pope. ""In society, when you're a practising Catholic, you're looked down on by those who think they're your betters. ""Listen to radio and the idea that anyone would practise religion is scoffed at, it's a kind of running joke. ""I don't regard myself as a Holy Joe or religious, but there's a lot of people who don't practise because they think that's the thing to do. ""It takes no courage or conviction to say they don't go to Mass. Monkey see; monkey do. ""All I would like to hear is if people want to go, then they go and if they don't, they don't. ""I wouldn't be militant about it, but I have no time for the Church,"" says John-Paul Whearty John-Paul Whearty is a stand-up comic and creator of the satirical Loyalists Against Democracy (LAD) group. ""I was named after Pope John Paul II,"" he says. ""I was going to be called something else. but my mum ended up going into labour just at the time the Pope was flying out of Ireland in his aeroplane, so that's how I got the name. ""I have a picture of John Paul II up in my kitchen, but I'm an atheist. ""When I was a kid, I used to tell people I was called after John Paul Jones from Led Zeppelin instead. ""The name used to embarrass me when I was younger, but now that I'm older, I own it. ""As for Catholicism, I would have no interest in it at all. John-Paul Whearty used to tell his friends he was named after John Paul Jones from Led Zeppelin - as it seemed cooler than being named after a pope ""My mum goes to Mass every day. She goes up and opens the church in the morning and closes it in the evening, but she's very much a follower of Jesus rather than the Church. ""I'm absolutely proud of my name. There are lots of John Pauls... John Paul Jones, John Paul Getty and it's a name that comes from the Pope, so it resonates. ""I know two other John Pauls among my close friends and because we were all born around 1979-80, I bump into John Pauls all the time. The last Pope's  visit was such a momentous occasion for Irish society.  The babies were born, we got education, then came the boom and the money - that's progress."" John Paul Deehan likes Pope Francis' approach John Paul Deehan is an award-winning fashion designer and florist based in his native Derry. His first commission was doing the flowers for his cousin's wedding when he was just 10 years old. He recently turned 40. ""I'm John Paul but I wasn't named after for the last Pope,"" he says. ""I was born in June 1978 and my parents couldn't choose between John and Paul. ""They were toying between the names. So, they put the two names together. My great grandmother said she didn't like it. Then John Paul I was made pope and she said: 'You can't change it.' ""I could have been something else until the Pope came along and my great granny put her foot down. ""As a florist, I'm in churches and chapels practically every day of the week, but I'm rarely at Mass. ""I go now and again but I have no plans to go and see Pope Francis. ""Still, his visit  can only be for the better. He has a very modern approach. He will attract young people to the Church. ""And it seems that a lot of the younger generation want to embrace religion. ""My nieces and nephews would have an attraction to go. They would look to go to Mass. People of my age might say: 'Maybe next week.' ""But they go of their own accord, there is a real swing back to the church. ""What I like about Pope Francis is his very modern approach. He includes everybody and that's important."" John-Paul Coyle is business manager for Lissan House John-Paul Coyle is business manager with Lissan House, Cookstown. His mother included the hyphen when he was born so he would be called the full name. ""I was born on 21 October 1980, so I went to school with a few John Pauls as well as Joannes and Paulas,"" he says. ""I used to hate my name when I was younger. It felt like a political thing. There was an element of sectarianism. ""My mother said she was putting the hyphen in my name because it was John-Paul but there were people who would choose just to call me John or Paul - it took me a while to get my head around that. ""As for Catholicism, when you think of the whole cover-up of paedophilia within the Church - John Paul knew, so why did he do nothing? ""There were pompous, arrogant men who were involved. But I feel sorry for the priests who have done nothing wrong but feel they are guilty by default. It must be very lonely and difficult for them. ""I would still regard myself as a Catholic but I wouldn't agree with all the rules. I'm a supermarket Catholic, I like the bits I like. ""I really like Pope Francis. I think he is what the Church needs. He could be more of a reformer but you cannot expect radical changes in a 2,000-year-old institution. ""Francis instils that sense of humility that has been lacking for so long. He has banished that level of extravagance.

"Organisers are expecting 500,000 people to see the Pope in Dublin's Phoenix Park next week God works in mysterious ways, but when it comes to a Papal visit, it's a miracle of engineering. Pope Francis needs an army of the faithful backing him up for his Ireland visit next week for the culmination of the World Meeting of Families. The country is bracing itself for a holy show in the best possible sense. And the advice to those travelling is: Get your jabs. Ireland's health authority has warned that large gatherings pose their own risks. Saint John Paul is 'top of the Popes' Pope tickets scooped up within hours Francis to visit 'a very different' Ireland So it's highly advisable to be up-to-date with vaccinations. Setting the stage: the scene at Phoenix Park More than 1,000 nurses, doctors and paramedics will be stationed in Dublin's Phoenix Park during the Papal Mass on Sunday 26 August. Being prepared means that there will even be a mortuary, so that if anyone dies their body can be held until undertakers get to the scene. Babies might be born too: At the last World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia 2015, six women were whisked to hospital to give birth. The organisers are expecting a total of 500,000 people to come to Phoenix Park to see the Pope. By comparison, the 1916 Centenary Easter Sunday Parade in Dublin in 2016 was attended by 350,000 people. But it's not quite the estimated 1.25m who were in Phoenix Park to see Pope John Paul II in 1979, the last Papal visit to Ireland. MCD productions, the team behind Pope Francis' Phoenix Park Mass, has staged concerts for Beyonce, Westlife, Coldplay and U2. Wearing the green: Fr Damian McNeice shows off the vestments that the Pope will be wearing in Phoenix Park Designers Arcana have been engaged to create the perfect stage. On hand will be Arcana's Johnny Donnelly, formerly of the Saw Doctors. In operational terms, the Phoenix Park faithful will be more than relieved to know that there will be 2,500 toilets available and 20,000 directional signs - as well as 5,000 traffic cones marking neighbouring streets. More than 4,000 Communion servers will be deployed for the Mass, each responsible for one or more ""corrals"" of 1,000 people into which the expected crowd of 500,000 will be organised. The goal is to be able to ensure that everyone who wants Communion will get it within 20 minutes. Roughly 2,500 extra train runs are being planned by Irish Rail in order to move the throngs of pilgrims expected to descend on the Pope's public events. On Sunday, 2,500 police will be on duty, including 700 at Phoenix Park for the Papal Mass. As the Irish can go nowhere without a cup of tea, there will be 150 food and drink outlets in Phoenix Park. In the spirit of Mrs Doyle of Father Ted fame: ""You will, you will, you will."" And they will. Organisers have worked out that if just half of the people at the event have a cuppa, 31,250 litres of milk will be used. They also estimate that about 25,000 sliced pan loaves will be used for sandwiches. The overall cost of the Pope's visit is being estimated at about 35m euros (Â£31m). Of that, 22m euros is being raised by the Catholic Church in Ireland and the remainder from the Irish government. This is a green visit - Pope Francis will be wearing green and those who attend are being asked to think green. A strict ""leave no trace"" policy will be in place - and green bags will be given out so visitors can collect all their rubbish to take home. The tills are ringing across Ireland as Pope memorabilia hits the shop shelves. You can buy Pope T-shirts, mugs, fridge magnets, bunting, flags and umbrellas. There is even a lollipop - or lollipope - and a collapsible cardboard chair featuring the pontiff, which is, its makers reassure, fully biodegradable. 500,000 people have tickets for the papal Mass - six times the capacity of Dublin's Croke Park stadium You can also buy an Irish-dancing Pope Francis waving a Guinness, as well as a solar powered one who can swivel his hips. Meanwhile behind the scenes, there is the pressing matter of priests' vestments. Volunteers have been working to iron the robes to be worn by priests taking part in the Mass. A call went out for people happy to do a day's ironing for free - they just need to bring their own iron and board. No reward is offered for the work... that, presumably, will be in Heaven. 08:15 - Departure by plane from Rome for Dublin 10:30 - Arrival at Dublin Airport for official welcome 10:45 - Transfer to Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in (Irish president's residence) 11:15 - Welcome ceremony with President Michael D.

"Pope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday The waiting is nearly over. Pope Francis is due to touch down on Irish soil on Saturday for a 32-hour stay. It will be the first papal visit to Ireland in almost four decades, since Pope John Paul II came in 1979. Ahead of the weekend's events, BBC News NI's Mark Simpson answers all the essential questions about the upcoming papal trip. If you don't have a ticket for the main events, your best bet is the centre of Dublin on Saturday afternoon. He will be travelling down O'Connell Street in the popemobile just after 16:00 BST, then travelling along Dame Street. Croke Park in Dublin on Saturday evening and Phoenix Park in the city for a Papal Mass on Sunday afternoon. But all the tickets have gone. Shops are preparing for the Pope's visit No, he is going to the Knock Shrine in County Mayo on Sunday morning but againthat is a ticketed event, and again they have all been snapped up. The Catholic Church in Ireland asked the Vatican to include a cross-border trip but they politely refused. The fact that there is political deadlock at Stormont may have been a big factor. With no first and deputy first ministers to meet the Pope, it would have been diplomatically awkward. If the trip to Dublin goes well, pressure will grow for a specific visit to Belfast or Armagh in the near future ... if Stormont returns. Once. In 1980 he came for about a month to study English. Not good at all. He is fluent in Italian, and coming from Argentina his native tongue is Spanish. 81. Two days. 32 hours to be exact. He arrives on Saturday morning and leaves on Sunday evening. Yes, but the Vatican has not said when and where.Whatever happens, it is likely to be private. No cameras. We will probably only find out about it after it happens. He will certainly say something. It is the first papal visit to Ireland since the abuse scandal broke. Recent revelations about the widespread abuse by priests in Pennsylvania in the United States have ensured the issue cannot be avoided. Campaigners for victims of abuse want to hear more than an apology. They want to know what action the Pope is going to take. The first opportunity for him to speak about the issue will be at a state reception at Dublin Castle at lunchtime on Saturday. Yes, wherever the Pope goes, demonstrators say they will not be far away. The main protest is at Dublin's Garden of Remembrance on Sunday afternoon at the same time as the Papal Mass at Phoenix Park. Pope souvenirs are in demand Some people snapped up the free tickets to papal events with no intention of attending. It was a form of protest to try to reduce the crowds. It is not clear how widespread the tactic was, and whether it will have an impact. Ireland between Popes Church in graphs: Is Catholicism still central to Irish life? Loaves to loos: Pope Francis' visit in numbers 'Lollipopes' to bunting: The Papal products flying off the shelves On the bus: Remembering Pope John Paul II's 1979 visit Young people look ahead to Pope's visit Yes, the Presbyterian, Methodist and Church of Ireland leaders have all been invited to the reception at Dublin Castle. Ian Paisley's old party, the DUP, also received an invitation to Dublin Castle, butcurrent leader Arlene Foster turned it down. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Robin Swann also said he was double-booked that day, but unlike the DUP, he is sending a representative, Robbie Butler, who is an assembly member for Lagan Valley. An estimated 35 million euros (Â£31m). This is not a formal state visit. He is coming to attend the World Meeting of Families, a global event for Catholics held every three years. A total of 1,200 from 31 different countries. The Catholic Church no longer enjoys the place in society that it once held in many countries, especially Ireland, but global fascination with the Pope remains. In a word, enormously. There has been a seismic shift on social issues. Politically, church and state have gone through a separation. Economically, Ireland has been transformed since 1979. Oh, and in Dublin pubs, a pint of Guinness is no longer 50p. Pope John Paul II was the last pontiff to visit Ireland, in 1979 The last census, carried out in 2016, showed that more than three quarters of the population still describe themselves as Catholic. The rate of attendance at religious services also remains relatively high, compared to other European nations with large Catholic populations. It is estimated that there will be about 80,000 at Croke Park, 45,000 in Knock and 500,000 at Phoenix Park. Around 4,000 servers will be deployed, each responsible for groups of 1,000 people. Mixed. Pilgrims are advised to prepare for rain, especially on Sunday. The crowds are expected to get close to him.

" A tale of two pontiffs It is nearly 40 years since Pope Saint John Paul II's aeroplane swooped on to the runway at Dublin Airport. Roman Catholic Ireland held its breath as the Polish Pope knelt to kiss the tarmac, cape whipped by the wind. People called it a once-in-a-lifetime event. In Galway, thousands cheered as Pope John Paul II was welcomed on to a stage by the Right Reverend Eamonn Casey to celebrate a youth Mass. Few people knew at the time that Bishop Casey had a five-year-old son. When the news finally broke in 1992, the idea of an Irish Catholic bishop having sex, never mind fathering a child, was shocking to many believers. But that scandal paled in comparison with the deep fault lines within the Church that were to be exposed. The Catholic Church has been rocked by revelations of paedophile priests, sexual abuse in Catholic-run orphanages, and the exploitation of women in mother-and-baby homes. The Ireland that Pope Francis will visit is a very different country to that which greeted his Polish predecessor. Ireland has seen seismic changes in public attitudes to social issues including abortion, contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage. Pope Francis has won hearts the world over for his humility. He speaks out against economic injustice, conflict, the death penalty and the destruction of our environment. When elected in 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio chose his papal name to honour St Francis of Assisi, because of the saint’s devotion to the poor. The charismatic Argentine can expect a warm welcome in the Republic of Ireland - but not the same breathtaking devotion inspired by Pope John Paul II - who was declared a saint by Pope Francis in 2014. Father Brendan Hoban has recently retired - he’s 70; it was time. The Republic of Ireland is a country of ageing clerics - 70 is now the average age of its priests. With few young men to step into older men’s shoes, this papal visit comes at a time when almost every Irish diocese is facing a vocations “crisis”. Fr Hoban is a founding member of the Association of Catholic Priests. He stepped down as parish priest of Moygownagh, County Mayo, at the end of July, and his situation illustrates why so many parishes are struggling. ""There's nobody to replace me,"" he laments. A parish council has taken over the day-to-day running of Moygownagh and a neighbouring priest is coming in to celebrate Mass and the sacraments. The picture was very different when, as a teenager, he entered Ireland’s national seminary - St Patrick's College, Maynooth, County Kildare - in 1966. ""There were 84 students in my class and about 50 of those were ordained,"" Fr Hoban recalls. ""The class ahead of me had about 110.” Last year, six men enrolled at Maynooth seminary, the lowest in its 223-year history, according to the Irish Times. Founded in 1795 and designed to house 500 trainees, Maynooth was once the largest seminary in the world. It currently houses 35 seminarians - a handful of men preparing to cater for a country of more than 3.7 million Catholics. Maynooth used to be supported by a network of smaller diocesan seminaries across the Republic of Ireland, but they shut one by one. Northern Ireland’s only Catholic seminary - St Malachy's in Belfast - is to close later this year. ""If you have no priest, then you have no Mass, and if you've no Mass, then you have no Church,"" Fr Hoban warns. The Church must embrace change to survive, he says. The priesthood should be opened to women and married Catholics, he argues, ending the centuries-old rule that only single, celibate men can be ordained. In 1979, there were more than 6,200 priests throughout the island of Ireland. That figure has fallen to just over 3,900 but their age is the bigger problem. ""I'm just over 70 and I'm still the average age of priests in Ireland, which is absolutely bizarre,"" says Fr Hoban. An increasing burden is falling on the shoulders of the country's elderly clerics. Several are working beyond the age of 70, and many retired clerics are regularly called upon to help out. Five years ago, Fr Hoban wrote a book on Ireland's ""disappearing priests"" which warned that the country was facing a ""Eucharistic famine"". Now, he says his predictions are “coming true”. He criticises the Irish Bishops' Conference for failing to take decisive action. ""We need immediately to ordain married deacons,"" Fr Hoban says. ""We need immediately to decouple celibacy from the priesthood; we need immediately to invite back priests who have left to get married."" He argues there are enough men who gave up their vocation to start a family who could now ""come back to tide us over the crisis”. Fr Hoban also believes that the ordination of women is almost inevitable and suggests such a move may be ""only down the road"". He has previously accused the institution of thinking it had a ""God-given right to patronise, condescend, disrespect, ignore, and presume that women today will accept the excruciatingly embarrassing efforts we make, as a Church, to limit their role"". The Association of Catholic Priests represents more than a quarter of all the priests in Ireland. This summer, it carried out a survey ahead of Pope Francis’s visit, asking almost 1,400 people what they wanted to say to the pontiff about the Church in Ireland. The ACP said the results revealed “huge support for a radical reform” of the priesthood, with the number one proposal being “an equal role for women in the Church”. The status of Catholic women is a ""neuralgic issue"" for the Church, says Fr Hoban. If the Church doesn't sort that very soon, we're going to lose an awful lot of our people. We've lost their minds already, but we're going to lose their bodies in the Church, in a sense. Ireland remains a “predominantly Catholic country”, according to the Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO), but the percentage of the population who identify as Catholic has fallen. A census carried out in 1981, just two years after the last papal visit, showed that Catholics made up 93% of the population. By 2011, that figure had dropped to 84%. And the most recent census, in 2016, showed a further decline - to 78%. The CSO said the 2011-2016 drop was accompanied by a corresponding rise in the number with no religion, who now account for nearly 10% of the Irish population. Describing yourself as Catholic on a census form does not necessarily mean you actively practise your faith, but religious service attendance levels in Ireland are still relatively high, compared with other European countries. Of the 1,770 Irish Catholics who took part in the latest European Social Survey (ESS), 44% said they attended religious services at least once a week, second only to Poland. Almost two-thirds (62%) of Irish Catholics said they attend services at least once a month. Just under a quarter (24%) of young Irish Catholics, aged between 16 and 29, claim to go to Mass every week, according to analysis of ESS data from 2014 and 2016. Only their peers in Poland and Portugal professed to be more devout. The Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Reverend Diarmuid Martin, has warned about the “growing alienation"" of young people from the Church - acknowledging the crisis is larger than the lack of vocations. Fr Hoban says the Irish bishops have a moral responsibility to ensure there are enough priests to minister to future populations and to look after ageing clergy. After 45 years of ministry - does he ever regret his vocation and would he make the same decision now?""I certainly would look at it differently,"" he says. I've had a good life as a priest and I've got a lot of satisfaction and happiness out of it, but... if I was a married priest, I think I would have been a better priest. Mark Vincent Healy is one of the thousands of people in Ireland living with painful memories of child abuse. From the age of nine until he was 12, he was sexually abused by two priests from the Spiritans order. Picture: Mark Vincent Healy It happened more than 40 years ago when he was at St Mary's College, Rathmines. Mr Healy says it inflicted a ""lifelong injury"". ""There is a dark world, that has not been portrayed for people to understand, what it is like to live with post-traumatic stress disorder, caused in your childhood over issues of such violation and degradation as sexual abuse."" Mr Healy campaigns on behalf of other victims and took his fight for redress to the top of the Catholic Church. Four years ago, he was the first male survivor of Irish clerical sex abuse to meet Pope Francis. It was a ""significant moment in history” for him but he says the institution must realise it is only at the beginning of its journey of restitution. In the past 25 years, the Catholic Church in Ireland has been rocked by a catalogue of child-abuse scandals. Smyth was at the centre of one of the first paedophile priest scandals One of the most infamous was the case of Belfast-born paedophile priest Brendan Smyth, whose mishandled extradition led to the downfall of the Irish government in 1994. Since then, the physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children by priests and members of religious orders across Ireland has been laid bare. The 2009 Ryan Report collated evidence from 1,090 men and women who alleged they were abused as children in institutions in the Irish Republic, most of which were Catholic-run. About half of them said they had been sexually abused. The inquiry team concluded that ""sexual abuse was endemic in boys' institutions"" but that it was ""impossible to determine"" the full extent of the problem. Although the Church did not sanction child abuse, its hierarchy was condemned for trying to cover up scandals, thus placing even more children at risk. Priests and members of religious orders accused of abuse were often transferred to a different school or diocese or even sent to another continent. The practice enabled some offenders to groom new victims unaware of their past, and it also allowed some to evade justice completely as they were moved outside the jurisdiction. Picture: Mark Vincent Healy Mr Healy says the full international ramifications of shuffling suspects in and out of Ireland is still unknown and it is an issue he hopes will be addressed during the Pope's visit. The campaigner has personally experienced both success and failure in his attempts to hold suspects to account. One of the priests he accused, Henry Moloney, received multiple criminal convictions for abusing Mr Healy and other schoolboys, one of whom later took his own life. The second priest,  Arthur Carragher, was transferred to ministry in Canada and could not be extradited to Ireland. Before his death in Canada in 2011, Carragher admitted abusing two other Irish boys who took a civil action against him. Mr Healy wants to know how many paedophile priests were sent abroad where they continued to abuse. In 2006, the Church set up its own abuse watchdog - the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland (NBSCCCI). Between 2011 and 2017, it published a series of reports outlining the history and known extent of child abuse in every diocese on the island, including separate reviews into religious orders who ran schools and residential institutions. The data revealed that in one order alone - the Christian Brothers - 870 allegations were made against 325 brothers, 12 of whom were convicted. But the island-wide audit did not tell the full story. In its latest annual report, the watchdog noted a ""significant increase"" in the number of new claims and concerns about child abuse. It recorded 135 new allegations in 2017-2018, most of them historical, compared with a total of 86 the previous year. The board's spokesman said when a clerical abuse story gets significant national media coverage, it often prompts more victims to come forward. Earlier this year, several victims of the late paedophile priest Malachy Finegan broke decades of silence to say he had sexually abused them at a school in Newry, County Down, and in the nearby parish of Clonduff, Hilltown. More than 30 people say they were abused by Malachy Finegan The Police Service of Northern Ireland has since set up a dedicated team to investigate Finegan's crimes. More than 30 people have come forward to say they were abused. Almost a quarter of a century after the Brendan Smyth case, the Church still has sins to confess. Mr Healy has carried out his own research into abuse statistics, using data from the NBSCCCI’s all-island reports, and he highlights the low conviction rate in cases involving foreign missionaries. ""There were 2,086 accusations in the national audit against 811 missionary priests, of whom 43 were held to account,"" he says. He laments the fact that of these cases, almost 95% did not result in a conviction. In 1996, the Church began to set up dedicated helplines and cross-border counselling services for victims who suffered at the hands of priests and members of Catholic orders. Over the last two decades, Towards Healing and its predecessor, Faoiseamh Counselling Service, have supported 5,470 people and provided 365,820 counselling sessions. Mr Healy welcomes the efforts made, but argues that much more must be done for those who were robbed of their childhood. I want to see far better, lifelong support for those who are abused, because their trauma doesn't end. “This is an injury, sadly, which lasts a lifetime."" In the 40 years since Pope John Paul II visited Ireland, one of the country’s most noticeable changes has been in its attitude to sexuality. Today, in a country where the prime minister is an openly gay man, a high-profile figure declaring their homosexuality would not merit much controversy. Joni Crone featured on RTÉ's Late Late Show But for Joni Crone, the stomach-churning moment in 1980 when she came out as lesbian on Irish television is etched in her memory. Somebody offered her a vodka to calm her nerves. This was an Ireland where people could be treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to ""cure""  them of homosexuality. A night out for anyone who was gay or lesbian could end in a beating. Homosexuality was a crime. Ms Crone's decision to speak out was prompted by the despairing women who rang the lesbian helpline. She knew that coming out to a million viewers on the Late Late Show was risky. She had friends lined up to whisk her out of the country, if things turned nasty. The Late Late Show was hosted by Gay Byrne She knew the eyes of Ireland were on her. Byrne pulled no punches. ""What would compel a girl like you to appear on a programme like this and blow, as it were, her cover?"" he asked. She thought she was coming on to promote the lesbian helpline, but he stuck with personal questions. He asked if her parents saw her as ""somehow mentally deficient, sinful or culpably ignorant?"" ""We often have the impression that people like you go about like ravenous wolves seeking whom you may devour,"" he told her. ""We're not all so promiscuous or so highly sexed as people imagine,"" she countered. The following Monday, in work, the youngest man in the office came to shake her hand. The managing director praised her courage. But a trader on Camden Street, Dublin, spat at her and said she would not serve the “likes of her”. Two years later, in 1982, 31-year-old Declan Flynn was kicked and beaten to death with sticks in Fairview Park, Dublin, by a gang of ""queer-bashing teenagers"". The youths pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to between one and five years - the sentences were suspended. Mr Justice Sean Gannon, the presiding judge, said: ""It's important the public should know it could never have been murder, although it was an appalling thing for Declan Flynn and his family."" He allowed the five accused to walk free because, he said, there was ""no element of correction required"" as they had ""come from good homes and have experienced care and affection"". His ruling caused public outrage and led to one of the first big gay rights demonstrations in Dublin. The switch in attitudes came slowly, says Ms Crone. ""We had the Irish trade unions and we had the women's council. We kept talking in small ways to maybe 20 people at a time. It was like a pebble in a pond."" The ripples spread, gathered force, swelled to a tidal wave. It would be 1993 before consensual homosexual acts between adults were decriminalised in Ireland. In May 2015, the Republic of Ireland became the first in the world to legalise same-sex civil marriage by popular vote. Last year, Leo Varadkar was appointed Taoiseach - Irish prime minister. He is the son of an immigrant and openly gay - a symbol of a new Ireland. Earlier this year, the Irish voted by 66.4% to 33.6% to overturn the country's ban on abortion. ""In 1979 when Pope John Paul II came to Ireland, there was so much reverence for him. Dublin was like a ghost town. Everybody was there,"" says Ms Crone. With Pope Francis, it feels like he's coming to bolster the old guard. It's no surprise after the two referendums that he's here. Now gay and lesbian people are integrated into Irish culture. At this year's Pride celebrations, bus driver fathers picked up their gay sons and drove them joyfully in a rainbow bus through the streets of Dublin. Within the Church, change is in the air. At this week’s World Meeting of Families (WMOF) in Dublin, US priest Father James Martin will speak on “Showing Welcome and Respect in our Parishes for LGBT People and their Families”. The Jesuit scholar is known for his liberal views on homosexuality and Pope Francis has appointed him to the Vatican's Secretariat for Communication. Thousands signed a petition protesting against Fr Martin’s inclusion at the Dublin event, but it will go ahead. Meanwhile, for Joni Crone, it is the country’s young who inspire her. ""Young people in their 20s have fire in their bellies,"" she says. ""They are just not going to take it anymore. I think that's brilliant."" One of the most chilling effects on people’s attitude to the Irish Church has come after revelations about its treatment of unmarried mothers and their babies. In Tuam, Galway, in the 1950s and 60s, the clatter of hobnail boots on the road was the signal the ""home babies"" were passing. They were poor, their hair clipped short. They lived in the mother-and-baby home run by the Catholic Bon Secours sisters. Their badge of shame was that they had been born ""out of wedlock"". These were the children of ""fallen women"". The mother-and-baby homes and the Magdalene Laundries were institutions run by the Irish state and the Catholic Church for such women. The regime was cruel. There are stories of women being forced to give birth without pain relief and in silence and then having the baby whisked away for adoption. Many of the women ended up in the laundries - Catholic-run workhouses where 10,000 women and girls were forced to do unpaid, manual labour between 1922 and 1996. The last Magdalene asylum in Ireland closed in Waterford in 1996. A 2013 report found the Irish state was involved in the scandal. As a little girl growing up in County Galway in the 1960s, Catherine Corless shared the classroom with the ""home babies"". The town children were not encouraged to mix with them. Once she saw another girl offer a fake sweet to a home baby. ""She said, ‘If you hand that girl an empty sweet paper, she'll take it,’"" she recalls. ""So I wrapped up an empty sweet paper and pretended it was a sweet to the other girl and she grabbed it. It was only in later years, I realised that those children never got any sweets - no treats whatsoever, not even at Christmas. ""My mind went back to that day and that little child who thought she was getting a treat and I would have laughed at her. ""That has horrified me since, it has haunted me really."" The Tuam home was one of 10 institutions across Ireland to which about 35,000 unmarried pregnant women were sent. It operated between 1925 and 1961. Conditions were poor and hundreds of babies and children died of natural causes: At the Tuam mother-and-baby home between 1925 and 1961, a child died nearly every two weeks. After the Tuam home closed, a housing estate was built. In the 1970s, two boys discovered bones and the local people built a shrine to what they believed were famine dead. In 2011, Corless set out on a personal crusade. She looked for the death certificates of the 796 children who had died at the home, for whom there were no burial records. She paid for each death certificate herself. She wanted to put up a plaque in their memory. What she found made headlines across the world. The skeletons of hundreds of babies and children lay in an unmarked mass grave. It was a shame that the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny called ""a chamber of horrors"". ""We buried our compassion, humanity and mercy,"" he told the Irish parliament. Bedsheets with the names of victims have been put on the shrine's gates A public inquiry into Ireland's mother-and-baby homes was established in 2015. It is due to report by February 2019. Ms Corless remains saddened by the Catholic Church's response. ""If we could get an apology from the Pope when he comes that might help,"" she says. The Church has said it is shocked and horrified by the discovery of the children's remains. Ms Corless would like more. ""I'm saddened at those who preach and tell us how to live,"" she says. This was a golden opportunity but they chose to protect themselves and to protect the institution that is the Church. Their numbers may have dwindled, but there are still men who want to devote their lives to God and the Catholic Church. Fr David Vard was ordained in 2017 When Father David Vard was ordained at the age of 25 last summer, he became the youngest priest in Ireland making national headlines as he took holy orders in his hometown of Newbridge, County Kildare. His vocation was almost a decade in the making. A year before he told anyone he wanted to be a priest, he was not even a practising Catholic. “I wasn't religious in the slightest. ""My mother would have to bribe me to go to Mass at Christmas,” he says. As a 16-year-old schoolboy, he travelled to Lourdes, the Catholic shrine in south-west France. It changed his life. He reluctantly agreed to go after his teachers said their parish needed young people to push wheelchairs. The people he met in Lourdes had a profound effect on him. “There were no great miracles,” he says. “It was just that I saw the Church, and a Church alive that I'd never seen before. This was people who were living out a faith, who were living out their Christianity. A celibate life might not be the most attractive prospect to many 16-year-old boys, but Fr Vard had a frank conversation with a priest he met on the pilgrimage. Fr David Vard was ordained in 2017 ""I got to ask him very honest questions, like, 'Did you never want to have children? Did you never want to have a girlfriend?' ""His responses made me see that priests were normal people."" Shortly after his final school exams, aged 18, he entered Maynooth seminary, and began the seven-year course for the priesthood. Telling his teenage friends was daunting. ""I told a lot of them when they were drunk, which was the best thing to do,"" he jokes. ""My very good friends supported me... I'm still friends with all of them."" Some of his elder, more outspoken colleagues say the vow of celibacy is one of the reasons why few young men contemplate the priesthood. Fr Vard understands why some are hesitant, but supports a celibate clergy. ""We're giving our life to the Church, we're giving our life to God,” he says. ""I think it would be exceptionally unfair to a wife, to children. ""I could get moved from my parish tomorrow. Does that mean that if I was married with a wife and kids, I would have to move all of them out of their schooling? Would my wife have to change her job? ""There is a whole practical reason around it but there are also very deep theological reasons which I do support."" Fr Vard says Maynooth seminarians have a spiritual director and are encouraged to speak openly about celibacy - he says they have seven years to consider their decision. Fr David Vard was ordained in 2017 After ordination, he took his first appointment as a curate in Portlaoise Parish, County Laois, where, he says, his first year has been ""very happy"". But the attention that comes with being Ireland's youngest priest has brought its own challenges, as he tries to balance expectations. ""You have to live up to that pressure of being 'the cool priest', or whatever,"" Fr Vard says. ""Someone asked me to do their wedding recently because they found out I was on Instagram and they thought that was so cool. ""Why wouldn't I be on Instagram? All my friends are on Instagram. Find me a 26-year-old that's not on Instagram.""Fr Vard has tickets to see his boss in Dublin. He hopes that Pope Francis will acknowledge the trauma caused by clerical sex abuse and the treatment of women and children in homes for unmarried mothers. In Ireland and other countries there has been a complete deviation from the central person who is Jesus Christ, who is a man of love and compassion. ""We did not show that to every one of our members and we have to acknowledge that. “We can't bury our head in the sand, we also have to apologise for it."" He suggests that perhaps the papal visit could resurrect an institution that has struggled with painful issues in recent years. Throughout the history of the Church we've these cycles of ups and downs and we have certainly been on the down in recent years. ""Maybe this papal visit will signal that turning of the corner."" Lisa O'Hare knows more than most what it takes to raise the next generation of Irish Catholics. The 41-year-old County Tyrone mother has seven children under the age of 12 - two of whom have special needs - and is expecting her eighth. Three years ago, she helped set up the Rise of the Roses, a movement aimed at encouraging young women to consider ""consecrated life"" - becoming a nun. Girls aged from 14 to young women in their 20s were taken to visit convents across Ireland. ""We wanted to open the girls' minds, to go and visit these religious sisters to see how happy and joyful they were in this calling,"" she explains. ""We were trying to open their hearts to answering the call from God, whether he was calling them to religious life or married life; both are equally important vocations. ""Obviously I am in the married vocation, but we wanted to create a culture of saying yes to God."" She says Rise of the Roses was an attempt to break stereotypical preconceptions about nuns and religious vocations. “In this culture, if someone came home to their parents and said, ‘I’m thinking of becoming a religious sister,’ even their family and their friends would be really shocked, it’s so counter cultural.” The full-time mother juggles family life with her part-time role with Human Life International, a group promoting traditional Catholic teachings on abortion, euthanasia, marriage and family. She says she was devastated by the Irish abortion referendum result earlier this year, when two-thirds of the electorate voted to overturn the ban. ""Many of us described it almost like a death, "" she says. ""We described it as a crucifixion. ""You have to endure the crucifixion and look forward with great hope to the resurrection."" She fears that Ireland has ""turned away from God"" in recent years and Catholics who try to follow the Church's teachings on social issues are becoming increasingly isolated. Such secularism has entered the Church that people take or leave parts of the challenges of our faith, and those that want to live it authentically often feel that they are called radical or fundamentalists. The Rise of the Roses was her attempt to rekindle the culture of consecrated women. At the last official count, there were 5,730 sisters in Ireland’s 26 dioceses, outnumbering all the priests and brothers put together. But with fewer younger women joining religious orders, nuns who retire from teaching and nursing posts are more likely to be replaced by lay people. Many argue that the vow of celibacy puts young people off becoming nuns and priests, but Mrs O'Hare dismisses this. ""It is sacrificial, but every single Christian and Catholic is called to a sacrificial life,"" she says. ""My middle child had extensive brain surgery, so most people would think we're crazy for having any more children, that we've enough to contend with. ""My baby, Michael, has Down's Syndrome and yet we're expecting again, and that's because I have ultimate trust in Jesus and I know that he will guide me."" Mrs O'Hare believes the Catholic Church in Ireland has experienced a ""perfect storm"" in the last 20 years. This individualist culture where it's all 'Me, what I need and what I can get from certain aspects of life. ""That has been catastrophic,"" she says. However, she adds that storm also included ""shocking"" revelations about paedophile priests and mother-and-baby homes. She says the abuse was ""pure evil"". ""The people who inflicted these terrible atrocities didn't only affect those directly involved, they have affected a generation,"" she says. ""They've affected the priests' and the religious [community’s] ability to communicate a message, because it has been absolutely undermined."" What is her hope for the future of the Church in Ireland? ""I'm so passionate about our nation, about our country, about the culture that we have. ""It's something that I hope to build up in my own personal way by providing children and a family and working hard in my small parish and community - we can do that from the grassroots up and everyone has to play their part."" She adds: ""Ireland has faced many a trial and the faith has been under many an attack over the centuries and God has never let us down, so we will just continue with that hope in our hearts."" Between then and now lies a vast chasm. From the visit of Pope John Paul II to the visit of Pope Francis, the change has been seismic. Tremors have rocked Irish society, politics and culture. Modern Ireland is unrecognisable to that of Pope John Paul II's 1979 visit. Pope Francis will be aware of that. Much is expected of the Argentine Pope, not least from the thousands of abuse survivors who will want an official acknowledgement of the Church’s role in their suffering. The story of abuse and the Church’s response to that abuse leaves ugly scars. Days before his Irish visit, Pope Francis wrote a letter to all Catholics begging forgiveness for “our sins and the sins of others”. “We showed no care for the little ones; we abandoned them,” he said. The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Reverend Eamon Martin, says people “want to know that the Church accepts that abuse within the Church was systemic, that it was facilitated and that this will happen no more”. What people want, he says, is to know that they and their children will be as safe in a Catholic church as they would be at home. Despite all this, excitement for the papal visit is strong. Pope Francis’s words could have a significant impact. Although he will step off that plane on to the tarmac of a markedly different Ireland, like Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis is a charismatic figure. He is also more nuanced than the Polish Pope. His official stance on sexual ethics may be similar, but his tone is strikingly different. Pope Francis is attempting to change the conversation from one focused on sexual ethics to one centred on social justice and a politically relevant version of the Christian gospel. If that is a message he can deliver in Ireland this weekend, it may be the breath of fresh air needed to help halt the Church’s decline in this traditionally Catholic country.

"The Catholic Church in Ireland is organised on an all-island basis Pope Francis is coming to the Republic of Ireland in the wake of two referendums which illustrate a country moving away from its traditional Catholic roots. Church and state were once deeply entwined in a nation that used to be among the most conservative in Europe. Over the past three years, theIrish electorate has voted to legalise same-sex marriageand toend the constitutional ban on abortion. But despite groundbreaking changes in social attitudes, official figures show the Republic of Ireland remains a predominantly Catholic country. The latest census, carried out in 2016, showed that more than three quarters of the population describe themselves as Catholic. The rate of attendances at religious services also remains relatively high in Ireland, at least when compared to other European nations with large Catholic populations. One of the main problems for the Church, at present, is finding the manpower to minister to its flock. A country that was once home tothe largest seminary in the world,external, and which sent thousands of its missionaries around the globe, no longer has enough priests to staff all its parishes. At present, the Catholic population in the Republic of Ireland stands at just over 3.7m people, according tothe 2016 census,external. However, the last four decades have seen a falling trend, in terms of the proportion of the population as a whole. Maynooth is the largest seminary in Ireland In 1981, two years after Pope John Paul II toured Ireland, Catholics accounted for 93% of the population. The 1991 census, carried out shortly before the Church was engulfed in clerical abuse scandals, recorded little change at 92%. But by 2011, the figure had fallen to 84% and over the next five years, there was a further decline. The latest available statistic, from the 2016 census, puts the percentage of Catholics in Ireland at 78%. The Irish Central Statistics Office (CSO) said that decline has been accompanied by a ""corresponding rise in the number with no religion"". There are now more than 468,000 Irish residents who say they are not religious, equating to almost one tenth of the population. The Republic of Ireland is still a predominantly Catholic country The Catholic Church in Ireland is historically organised on an all-island basis, with some of its 26 dioceses and archdioceses stretching along both sides of the Irish border. In Northern Ireland,the Catholic population is growing, especially among younger age groups. Between Census Day 2001 and Census Day 2011,Northern Ireland's Catholic population increased by almost 80,000,external. The census in 2011 stated that Catholics made up 45% of the population, while Protestants accounted for 48%. But more recent figures, taken from the 2016 Labour Force Survey, showed that 44% of the working-age population are now Catholic while 40% are Protestant. The older population is more likely to describe themselves as Catholic The difference is even more marked among Northern Ireland's schoolchildren, where more than half (51%) are Catholic and 37% are Protestant. Age is a particularly significant factor in religious demographics. Data from the most recent European Social Survey (EES) showed that young people in the Republic of Ireland are three times more likely to say they have no religion than the oldest citizens of the state. Just over 40% of 15-25 year olds who took part in the survey in 2016/17 said they were not religious, while only 13% of those aged over 85 had no faith. However, among the remaining 60% of 15-25 years who said they are religious, the vast majority (87%) described themselves as Catholic. Although Mass attendances have fallen, they remain high compared to Europe A generation ago, Sunday Mass was a regular feature of life in Ireland, while now many churches struggle to fill their pews on the Sabbath. However, religious service attendance among younger Irish Catholics continues to be relatively high, perhaps not by traditional Irish standards, but certainly compared to their European peers, St Mary's University, Twickenham, has analysed data from ESS surveys in 2014 and 2016,external, and found that almost a quarter of Irish Catholics aged 16-29 claim to attend church at least once a week. Young Catholics in Poland, native land of Pope John Paul II, top the list with 47% of them attending weekly Mass, followed by their Portuguese counterparts at 27%. Looking at the wider population, fewer than half (44%) of Irish Catholic adults who took part in the 2016/17 ESS said they went to church at least once a week. However, the figure still suggests that Irish respondents are more devout than those in other traditionally Catholic nations like Portugal, Italy and Spain. Loaves to loos: Pope Francis' visit in numbers 'Lollipopes' to bunting: The Papal products flying off the shelves On the bus: Remembering Pope John Paul II's 1979 visit Even if they are not regular Mass-goers, Irish Catholics still turn to the Church to mark significant occasions in their lives. In 2016, there were just over 14,700 Catholic wedding ceremonies throughout Ireland, both north and south of the border, and more than 68,000 baptisms. However, the figures are lower compared to 1979, when Ireland last hosted a papal visit. Back then there were more than 82,700 baptisms and the number of weddings was 38% higher with almost 23,900 Catholic couples tying the knot. Such celebrations still require a celebrant, and with few young men joining the ranks of the clergy, parish priests are in short supply. The 2018 Irish Catholic Directory states that there are more than 3,900 priests on the island, but that figure includes members of religious orders as well as clerics who are retired, sick or on study leave. This video can not be played Church and state were once deeply entwined in the Republic of Ireland Vocations have plummeted over the last 30 years, contributing to a rise in the average age of a priest which is now about 70. Ireland's national seminary, St Patrick's College Maynooth, was home to more than 300 trainee priests when Pope John Paul visited the building in 1979. Within 20 years, their numbers had more than halved. Currently, there are just 35 seminarians studying in an institution that was designed to house more than 500 trainee priests. Maynooth is not the only facility that trains Irish priests but it is soon to be the only one left on the island. During the last academic year, there were 13 seminarians at the Irish College in Rome. There were also three trainees at St Malachy's in Belfast, the only seminary in Northern Ireland, but it is due to close at the end of this year. Dioceses which have been unable to replace retiring priests have asked their colleagues to take charge of more than one parish, and some parishes have been clustered into ""pastoral areas"" for the provision of Masses. The seminary in Maynooth was designed to house 500 trainees priests (photo circa 1935) Earlier this month, the Diocese of Clogher published a pastoral letter entitled ""The Future Mission of Our Parishes"" which outlined the ""current reality in the diocese in terms of the diminishing number of priests and their increasing age profile"". ""During the past year alone, the diocese has lost the service of seven priests through death, serious illness and other reasons,"" a diocesan statement said. ""While there was one new priest ordained, the letter makes it is clear that the number of active priests in our diocese will continue to decline."" The letter set out a ""vision for a wide range of lay ministries"" within the Diocese of Clogher and added that ""great possibilities lie ahead"". BBC News NI contacted each of the 26 dioceses to get a picture of how they are dealing with the demographic consequences of the drop in vocations. The Catholic Church in Ireland is organised on an all-island basis Each diocese was asked for their latest statistics on the numbers of active, retired, newly ordained and non-national priests, and whether they had to cut services due to a shortage of priests. The figures show the parish staffing situation across the island is very mixed, with about half of the dioceses saying there has been no significant effect on services over the past five years. However, the rest said they have either reduced or readjusted Mass times, or indicated that they are increasingly dependent on lay Catholics to take on more parish responsibilities. Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""There may have been some re-adjustments but no significant loss in services provided.""

Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""There has not been any significant change in the number of Masses in the Diocese of Derry over the past five years."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?A spokesman said the times of services ""are reviewed on an ongoing basis"", but added that it is ""difficult to attribute these changes to a shortage of priests"".  He said Down and Connor ""continues to meet the needs"" of all its parishes. Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?A spokesman said services have been changed for a ""wide range of reasons"", including changing population trends, so it is not correct ""to link this simply to a reduction in the number of priests"". Has the archdiocese been forced to reduce services?""There are enough priests for the celebration of Sunday Mass - however, the number of Masses has been reduced in some parishes."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Not significantly, thanks to the generosity of priestsâ¦ Priests are experiencing greater pressure to meet pastoral needs and especially to find energy for new initiatives and challenges.""  *Elphin has a strong missionary tradition and its 35 diocesan priests are supported full-time by 28 non-diocesan priests. Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Yes."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Mass schedules change for a variety of reasons, it is incorrect to characterize such changes as 'forced'. Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Yes. We have six parishes without a resident priest."" Their spokeswoman added that a ""key priority is resourcing the laity to take up roles of responsibility"". Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Some parishes have rearranged Masses... but priests continue to do all the things they normally would with the assistance of the parish family."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""No."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""Yes."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""The number of priests has been reduced by up to half. Where once there were two priests ministering, now there is only one."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""It is clear that with fewer priests [not as many] will be involved in various pastoral activities; there are however many lay people taking up new rolesâ¦ In the last year more than 120 parish volunteers have been trained to lead public prayer."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?A spokesman said: ""There have been no considerable changes in general to provision of Masses, sacraments or pastoral services over the past five years.""  But they added that lay people are ""playing a more active role"". Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?Their spokesman said Mass times have been adjusted in recent years and adds that it is ""certainly true to say this also reflects the number of clergy"". Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""No."" Has the archdiocese been forced to reduce services?""Not necessarily, the restructuring was planned well in advance."" Has the diocese been forced to reduce services?""There has been a small reduction in the number of scheduled Masses, particularly at weekends.

"The family of the late US musician Prince is suing his doctor, alleging he failed to properly treat the singer for an opioid addiction. A lawsuit filed in Minnesota, reported by ABC news, alleges that failures by Dr Michael Schulenberg played a ""substantial part"" in the star's death. Prince died in 2016, aged 57, from an accidental overdose of the painkiller fentanyl, a powerful opioid. Dr Schulenberg has denied any wrongdoing. Earlier this year,prosecutors said no criminal charges would be brought over Prince's death. But the family's lawsuit, filed in Hennepin County District Court on Friday, alleges that Dr Schulenberg's actions had played a part. Fentanyl: The drug that killed Prince Prince: 12 things we've learned since his death Sixteen pivotal songs ""He failed to appropriately evaluate, diagnose, treat and counsel Prince for his recognisable opioid addiction, and further failed to take appropriate and reasonable steps to prevent the foreseeably fatal result of that addiction,"" the lawsuit read, according to ABC. ""These departures from the standard of acceptable medical practice had a substantial part in bringing about Prince's death."" The family of the singer - whose real name was Prince Rogers Nelson - is seeking unspecified damages in excess of $50,000 (Â£39,000). Dr Schulenberg's lawyer said they intended to defend the case,external, the Associated Press reported. Paul Peterson said in a statement: ""We understand this situation has been difficult on everyone close to Mr Nelson and his fans across the globe. Be that as it may, Dr Schulenberg stands behind the care that Mr Nelson received. We intend to defend this case."" As well as Dr Schulenberg, the lawsuit also names North Memorial Health Care, where Dr Schulenberg worked, Walgreens stores, which dispenses medication, and UnityPoint Health. Prince's sudden death shocked people around the world Prince was found unresponsive in a lift at his Paisley Park Studios, Minnesota, on 21 April 2016. An investigation revealed he had experienced significant pain for a number of years, and hundreds of painkillers of various types were found at his house. Evidence showed Prince had thought he was taking the prescription drug, Vicodin, when in fact he was taking a counterfeit Vicodin pill laced with potentially deadly fentanyl. Prosecutors said there was no evidence that the pills that killed Prince had been prescribed by a doctor. In April, following a two-year investigation, they said they had found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing.

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We are carrying out an assessment of information which we have received and enquiries are at an early stage."" Mr Salmond has hosted a show on the controversial RT station since last November In a BBC interview on Friday Mr Salmond said he had ""made many mistakes"" in life but strenuously denied the sexual harassment complaints. He said the complaints procedure activated against him was unjust and did not allow him to present his case. Mr Salmond said that ""with great reluctance"" he had now launched a judicial review against the Scottish government at the Court of Session. He said that if he lost the case he would answer the complaints against him ""both comprehensively and publicly"" but also warned that if the court finds in his favour,  ""the administration at the senior levels of the Scottish government will have the most serious questions to answer"". A spokesperson for the Scottish government said: ""This process been under way within the Scottish government for eight months and has been entirely confidential throughout that period"". An internal review was launched last year into the Scottish government's procedures for handling complaints in the workplace in light of wider concerns about harassment at Westminster and Holyrood. As part of that review, a new procedure on handling harassment complaints involving current or former ministers was introduced. Leader of Scottish National Party 1990-2000 and 2004-2014 First Minister of Scotland 2007 - 2014 Stood down after Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom Leslie Evans, permanent secretary at the Scottish government, has said two complaints were raised in January against Mr Salmond and he was notified in March about an investigation. Mr Salmond's successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the situation was ""difficult for me to come to terms with"" given her long history with Mr Salmond, but claims ""could not be ignored"". Ms Sturgeon revealed that she was first informed of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself in April and had no prior knowledge of complaints being made against him. Mr Salmond was first minister and SNP leader until September 2014, stepping down after Scottish voters rejected independence by a margin of 55% to 45%. The following year he was elected as the SNP MP for Gordon in 2015 and became the party's foreign affairs spokesman before losing the seat in the snap general election two years later. Recently he has faced heavy criticism for hosting the Alex Salmond Show on Russian broadcaster RT, which has been described as a propaganda channel for the Kremlin - a claim Mr Salmond has denied.

"Women in England should be allowed to take abortion pills at home rather than in the clinic, as they already can in Scotland and Wales, experts say. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) is calling on the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, to change legislation and create parity. Current laws require women to take two doses of medication in a clinic to end a pregnancy. This means some experience cramping and bleeds on their journey home. One woman from London, who chose to remain anonymous, told us: ""Within a few minutes, I began miscarrying. I was bleeding heavily and the cramping was disabling. ""My friend had to help me walk from the car to his flat. It was humiliating and unnecessary.  I remember feeling ashamed of myself and that maybe the pain and humiliation was necessary."" RCOG president Prof Lesley Regan said: ""We sincerely hope that one of the first things the new health secretary will do is to demonstrate his commitment to women's health by enabling women to take misoprostol, the second drug used to effect an early medical abortion, at home. ""He has the opportunity to follow Wales and Scotland's compassionate lead, giving women access to the care they want and need."" Anti-abortion group Society for the Protection of Unborn Children Scotland is challenging the changes already introduced in Scotland and says they trivialise abortion and leave women with physical and mental harm. SPUC Scotland chief executive John Deighan said: ""In legal terms we believe the policy is outside the scope of the 1967 Abortion Act, so principally doctors have to act in accordance with the law and so does the Scottish government."" Early medical abortions take place in the first nine weeks of pregnancy and involve two sets of medication. Under the 1967 Abortion Act, terminations can be carried out only on licensed premises. In England, women must take both doses in a clinic or hospital but the Scottish and Welsh governments now permit the final dose to be administered at home. Prof Sharon Cameron, a consultant gynaecologist in Edinburgh, said the changes, which came into effect in Scotland in October 2017, had increased trust between staff and patients. ""Women are hugely appreciative of this service. We know that we are significantly improving the wellbeing of thousands of women requesting an abortion each year in Scotland."" Dr Jonathan Lord, a consultant gynaecologist based in Truro, Cornwall, said some of his patients had not made it home in time after taking the medication in his clinics. ""In a rural community such as Cornwall, where the travel times can be quite long and some of our patients are wholly reliant on public transport, it means they can be caught short on the journey home. ""Whereas if they were allowed to take the tablets at home, they have the privacy of their own home but also they don't have the incredible trauma and embarrassment of losing the abortion on public transport."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""Around 180,000 women have an abortion each year in England - our priority is always to ensure that care is safe and of a high quality. We will continue to monitor the evidence surrounding home-use.""

"This video can not be played Pope Francis spoke out on abuse on a visit to Ireland Pope Francis has said he is ashamed of the Catholic Church's failure to adequately address the ""repellent crimes"" of sex abuse by clergy. The Irish prime minister earlier delivered a strong warning to the Pope to take action against clergy involved in child abuse and keeping it secret. The Pope spent 90 minutes with abuse survivors, reportedly telling them he viewed clerical sex abuse as ""filth"". The papal visit is the first to the Irish Republic for 39 years. It coincides with the World Meeting of Families, a global Catholic gatheringheld every three years,external. LIVE: Pope Francis in Ireland Longform: What happened to Catholic Ireland? How Ireland received a penitent Pope In graphs - Irish flock without shepherds? The Argentine Pope's opening remarks echoed a letter he sent to the world's 1.2bn Roman Catholics this week, in which he condemned the""atrocities"" of child abuse and clerical cover-ups. This video can not be played Pope Francis travels through Dublin city centre on his Popemobile ""I cannot fail to acknowledge the grave scandal caused in Ireland by the abuse of young people by members of the Church charged with responsibility for their protection and education,"" the Pope told political leaders and dignitaries at Dublin Castle. ""The failure of ecclesiastical authorities - bishops, religious superiors, priests and others - adequately to address these repellent crimes has rightly given rise to outrage, and remains a source of pain and shame for the Catholic community,"" he said. ""I myself share those sentiments."" The Pope veered off his script when speaking out about abuse, saying he had set out a ""greater commitment to eliminating this scourge in the Church, at any cost"". The Pope smiled and waved as at Dublin Airport, but his arrival was more understated than the dramatic tarmac kiss of Pope John Paul II in 1979 He was speaking after Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the failures of the Church, the state and wider society had created a ""bitter and broken heritage for so many, leaving a legacy of pain and suffering"". ""Magdalene Laundries, mother-and-baby homes, industrial schools, illegal adoptions and clerical child abuse are stains on our state, our society and also the Catholic Church,"" he said,referring to a series of scandals that have rocked the Irish Church. ""People kept in dark corners, behind closed doors, cries for help that went unheard... Above all, Holy Father, I ask to you to listen to the victims and survivors."" A rainbow flag is flown next to a likeness of Pope Francis as crowds wait on Christchurch, Dublin Mr Varadkar said there could be zero tolerance for those who abuse children or who facilitate that abuse and that from words action must flow. He referred to an investigation in the US state of Pennsylvania thatfound that more than 1,000 identifiable minors had been abused by 300 priests. Mr Varadkar said the ""heartbreaking stories"" of ""unspeakable crimes"", perpetrated by religious officials and then obscured to protect the institutions, was a story ""all too tragically familiar"" to people in Ireland. By BBC News NI's Leanna Byrne in Dublin It could be a case of expectations versus reality - the expectation of a charismatic kneel to the ground and a kiss on the tarmac, of fanfare and hysteria. But that was in 1979 and this is now. Nearly 40 years after Pope John Paul II received an emphatic welcome,Pope Francis is visiting a different country. The Republic of Ireland today is more secular, far more liberal and, in many cases, angry. Read more: How Ireland received a penitent Pope Leo Varadkar said he hoped action, not just words would flow from the Catholic Church Colm O'Gorman of Amnesty International Ireland, who was abused by a priest for more than two years as a teenager, said the Pope's comments did not go far enough. ""He could have talked to us all in a way that was blunt, that was clear, that was frank, that was human, that was accessible,"" he said. Two of the abuse survivors who met the Pope said afterwards he condemned corruption and cover-ups within the Church as ""caca"". ""Literally filth as one sees in a toilet, his translator clarified,"" said a statement from Clodagh Malone and Paul Redmond. Another abuse survivor who was at the meeting, west Belfast priest Fr Patrick McCafferty, said the Pope had promised to ""make people resign"". He said: ""I got the strong impression that no-one will be exempt from just penalties who have offended, who have covered up. ""The damage [by] those who have covered up could even be said to be worse than [that of] the offenders."" Having been presented with flowers and vestments by children after his aeroplane Shepherd One touched down at Dublin Airport, the Pope was welcomed by President Michael D Higgins at Ãras an UachtarÃ¡in (the president's residence). At St Mary's Pro-Cathedral in Dublin, Pope Francis prayed silently in front of a candle that commemorates abuse victims, before answering questions from couples of all ages on the subject of marriage. He also visited a Capuchin day centre for the homeless. On Saturday evening, he presided over a Festival of Families concert in Dublin's Croke Park stadium, which drew a crowd of some 80,000 people. The world-renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli, country singer Nathan Carter, and acclaimed Irish singer Daniel O'Donnell were among those who performed. The pontiff will travel to County Mayo on Sunday morning for a visit to Knock Shrine, before returning to Dublin to close the World Meeting of Families at an afternoon Mass in front of an estimated 500,000 people in Phoenix Park. The Pope held a silent prayer in front of a candle that commemorates abuse victims The Ireland that he is visiting is a different country to that whichgreeted Pope John Paul II in 1979. Since the Polish pope's visit, there have been huge changes in public attitudes to social issues including abortion, contraception, divorce and same-sex marriage. The older population is more likely to describe themselves as Catholic The countryvoted for constitutional change on gay marriage in 2015andvoted overwhelmingly to overturn its strict abortion law in May. The Pope heard Mr Varadkar, a gay man, speak out against the traditional Catholic teaching on the family. He said that the Republic of Ireland had modernised its laws, ""understanding that marriages do not always work, that women should make their own decisions and that families come in many forms"" - including those headed by a lone parent, same-sex parents or parents who are divorced and remarried.

"The US has cut aid meant for people living in Gaza US President Donald Trump has ordered more than $200m (Â£155m) in economic aid which was to be allocated to Gaza and the West Bank be redirected elsewhere. A State Department official said the decision was made after a review ""to ensure these funds are spent in accordance with US national interests"". It has already withheld $65m from the UN relief agency for the Palestinians. Relations between the Palestinians and the US have been difficult since Mr Trump took power. They hit a low point after the US recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017. As a result, the Palestinians said the US was unable to continue its mediation role in the peace process and suspended contact. Why Trump's embassy move was not about peace UN alarmed as US cuts aid to Palestinian refugee agency Palestinian territories profile The US administration, meanwhile, suspended aid to the Palestinians pending a review in the light of the Taylor Force Act back in June. The act aimed to force the Palestinian Authority to cease paying stipends to families of individuals convicted of terrorism against Israel. Donald Trump's administration has already withheld millions in aid On Friday, a State Department spokesman said the decision to ""redirect"" the funds to other ""high-priority projects"" was made as a result of the review, but did not say where the money would now go. Both the Palestinians and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency warned cutting funding would make everyday life harder for the territories' citizens However, the US official said the decision took into account ""the challenges the international community faces in providing assistance in Gaza, where Hamas control endangers the lives of Gaza's citizens and degrades an already dire humanitarian and economic situation"".

"Thousands of Venezuelan migrants are queuing at the main Ecuador-Peru crossing point in Tumbes The UN's migration agency says Venezuela is heading for the same refugee ""crisis moment"" seen in the Mediterranean in 2015. The warning comes as its neighbours try to halt the movement of people fleeing Venezuela's economic crisis. Peru brought in stricter border regulations on Saturday - a day after a court overturned Ecuador's attempt to strengthen its own controls. More than two million Venezuelans have fled their country since 2014. They are fleeing a dire economic situation, with Venezuelans facing shortages of food, medicine and basic goods. Hundreds of Venezuelans were bussed through Ecuador to the Peruvian border before the midnight deadline on Friday. Jonathan Zambrano, 18, who is at Tumbes on the border between Ecuador and Peru, told news agency AFP he had been on the road for five days along with many others. How Venezuela's crisis drove out millions of people Venezuelan's bridge of desperation My first week as a BBC Venezuela correspondent More than 2,500 crossed into the small Peruvian border town of Aguas Verdes on Friday, with thousands more trying to reach Peru at the main crossing point at Tumbes. The Tumbes crossing has seen about 3,000 arrivals per day in recent weeks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Peru is home to about 400,000 Venezuelan migrants, most of whom arrived in the past year, according to Peru's immigration agency. The new rules coming into force on Saturday require them to have valid passports. Until now, Venezuelans have been allowed to enter Peru with just their ID cards. Ecuador brought in a similar law last week. However, on Friday, a judge found requiring Venezuelans to carry valid passports broke regional agreements on freedom of movement. The state ofRoraima, in Brazil's Amazon region, also had its attempt to close the border thrown outby a judge earlier this month. A hardening attitude towards Venezuelans seeking a new life could also be heard on the streets in Peru. Giannella Jaramillo, who runs a clothes stall in a town near the border, told AFP: ""On the one hand we're sorry for the Venezuelan people, but they are taking a job away from a Peruvian. It's hard to help more people."" Her words were echoed by Ecuadoran Gerardo Gutierrez. ""Walk two blocks and you see 10 Venezuelans, walk another two and you see 10 Venezuelans. ""In economically poor countries, it's hard to help more people with what little there is."" Peruvian Prime Minister CÃ©sar Villanueva has said requiring Venezuelans to show their passport at the border did not mean that Peru was ""closing the door"" on Venezuelan migrants. He said ID cards did not provide enough information and could easily be forged. Peruvian Foreign Minister NÃ©stor Popolizio said Venezuelans could apply for visas in Peruvian consulates in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador or even at the border crossing in Tumbes. Joel Millman, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said that all this - as well as recent violence at the border in Brazil - was an early warning sign that the region was in need of help. ""This is building to a crisis moment that we've seen in other parts of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean,"" he told reporters. ""A difficult situation can become a crisis situation very quickly and we have to be prepared,"" he added. This video can not be played ""This is the largest exodus Latin America has experienced"" - UNHCR's Chiara Cardoletti However, Chiara Cardoletti of the UN's refugee agency (UNHCR), said other countries in the region had welcomed Venezuelans and were helping to ""avoid a situation like the one we have seen in Europe"". ""What we are seeing is a continent that has opened its doors to people who are fleeing and who need support,"" she said. Ms Cardoletti added that Colombia had registered more than 450,000 Venezuelans and given them regular status. The UN says more than 870,000 Venezuelans are in Colombia, many of them in vulnerable situations. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is to set up a special UN team to co-ordinate a regional response to the crisis, while Ecuador is to host a 13-nation regional summit in September.

"Manchester Pride, Leeds Festival and Creamfields are among several large events taking place on Saturday Workers at train company Northern have begun a 24-hour strike in a long-running row over driver-only operated trains. Members of the RMT union plan to walk out on six consecutive Saturdays until 29 September. People attending major events on Saturday, including Manchester Pride, Creamfields and Leeds Festival, are told to be aware of a reduced service. Northern said it would operate about 30% of its usual services. Very few of its trains will run before 09:00 BST and after 18:00, a spokesperson warned. The rail union has accused Northern of ""refusing point blank to engage in serious and meaningful talks"". The union claimed driver-only operation was being extended ""in the name of increased profits"". Northern deny a lack of communication, and in response said: ""We maintain that talking costs nothing, whilst strike action causes inconvenience to customers and damages the case for long-term investment in rail.""

The firm is facing refund demands from couples who paid for room dressing and other services in advance. The BBC has not yet received a comment from Bridezillas. Rachel Loughney, who got married last week, said Bridezillas owed her Â£950 after failing to provide flowers and failing to ""dress"" her venue. Rachel Loughney says she was let down by the firm Bridezillas ""I had no flowers, no decorations for the room, nothing,"" she said. Another customer, Rachel Treble, said she had paid Bridezillas Â£500 to decorate her wedding venue in two weeks' time. ""I'm gutted - I'm heartbroken - but I need to let it go otherwise it will end up spoiling the day,"" she said. She said she was planning to make alternative arrangements. Rachel Treble said she was ""heartbroken"" but vowed not to let it spoil her big day Others vented their anger on social media. Jemma Benton wrote: ""This so-called company have been fobbing me off for three weeks after only turning up with half of what I had paid for at my wedding. ""Now I know why.""

"This video can not be played The fish and chip shop in North Yorkshire has become a hit with visitors from China A fish and chip shop in North Yorkshire has translated its menu for Mandarin and Cantonese speakers to cope with an influx of Chinese tourists. Scotts Fish and Chips near York has seen coachloads of visitors wanting to try the traditional dish. The passion for the chippy has been put down to the fish and chips Chinese president Xi Jinping shared with then Prime Minister David Cameron in 2015. Manager Roxy Vasai said more than 100 Chinese tourists were visiting a week. The restaurant on the A64 is about six miles from York Staff said dining at the chippy was a real occasion for the visitors, with many taking photographs with employees both inside and outside the restaurant on the A64 at Bilbrough Top. The restaurant's location is also thought to be one of the reasons for the influx because it is on the main route for tour groups visiting York from London. Yorkshire breaking news: 'Urgent' appeal over missing woman; Wayward wallaby 'could be 100 miles away' Ms Vasai said: ""We look out for a coach and when they're coming we shout 'they're here, there are 20, 30, 40, let's make it ready for them'. ""We are very impressed by the Chinese tourists. They are very friendly, smiley and happy."" As well as translating the menu, Scotts has launched a website and a messaging app on one of China's most popular social media platforms to promote the business. Will Zhuang, ambassador for Make It York, an organisation which promotes the city, said many Chinese visitors had been influenced by their president sampling afish and chip supper during his visit to the UK in 2015. He added that because of this many Chinese tour operators had added the ""fish and chip experience"" to their itineraries. He said: ""Most of the Chinese tour groups will visit London, Cambridge and then to York and on their way to York they will pass the A64, so this is an ideal location for the coach to park up."" York is already a popular destination for tourists from East Asia, with China estimated to be the city's second largest overseas market.

"Penny Reeve punched the man after he twice grabbed her genitals on a dance floor A woman who punched a man when he grabbed her genitals twice in a club says she does not endorse violence but is proud of standing up for herself. Penny Reeve, 34, said people have been ""really supportive"" since she spoke out about what happened on social media. It has also encouraged people to share their own stories of ""pretty awful descriptions of abuse"", she said. Police in Nottinghamshire, where the assault happened, have asked people to report incidents like this to them. Miss Reeve, from Nottingham, said: ""I don't endorse violence at all, though I do endorse the right to self-defence and a woman's right to agency over her own body and who's allowed to touch it. ""Post the #MeToo movement I think there's much less patience for this kind of behaviour and people would like to see it challenged on a more regular basis."" Penny Reeve was grabbed by the man while she was at Mojo in Nottingham The man grabbed Miss Reeve while she was dancing with friends at Mojo in Nottingham city centre on Saturday 11 August. She initially thought the first contact may have been accidental, but when the man did it a second time she ""immediately"" punched him in the ribs, then challenged him. ""He just looked very embarrassed and ashamed of himself and kind of mumbled sorry and went to the other side of the club,"" she said. Sex assaults 'just part of a night out' Nearly half of young women harassed at festivals Misogyny hate crime pilot 'shocking' She later posted about what happened on Twitter and Facebook. ""People have been really supportive of the way I reacted to the situation and really interesting discussions have opened up as a result,"" she said. ""On nights out I think often sexual harassment and assault is a way of men 'trying their luck' in a club, they often don't think of it as an offence."" Penny Reeve said some men touch women sexually as a way of ""trying their luck"" Touching another person sexually without their consent is sexual assault. Nottinghamshire Police said it also treats such incidents as misogyny hate crime. ""Unwanted sexual contact is an offence and will not be tolerated and we would urge anyone who experiences it to ring us on 101,"" a force spokesman said. ""If it happens in a bar or club, where possible, people can also go to a member of door staff."" Miss Reeve said she did not report the incident because she felt she had dealt with it herself, but encouraged anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation to do so. Miss Reeve's social media post prompted people to share their own stories of women being harassed or assaulted by men in public places. One woman posted: ""A bloke in town bit me on the arm a few years ago. I was so shocked I did nothing, didn't even report it which I regret now. ""I salute you for punching him, wish my reaction had been the same. Sometimes a physical response is warranted and proportionate - this is one of those cases."" One man posted about witnessing a group of men pulling a young woman's skirt over her head while she was walking alone on a Saturday night. ""She's yelling and flailing, they're all laughing,"" he said. ""Eventually they let her go and she jogs off, yelling at them a bit. This all happens in front of Yates's - where the bouncer then gives them a 'Hey, lads!' and lets them all in."" One woman described how she hit a man when he put his hand inside her bra while she was crowd surfing One woman described how a group of men surrounded her car, then one got in and they took photos and videos ""of me freaking out as they held the door closed"". The woman said she rang 999 and was told someone would come but they never did. ""I rang [the police] so many times to file a report and get an update and I was treated with total indifference and a 'boys will be boys' attitude,"" she said. ""My point is, I don't really trust the police anymore. And if we don't trust those who are supposed to protect us, what else are we to do but defend ourselves with violence if that's the only option as we see it?"" Another woman said: ""Once, at a festival, I crowd surfed to get out the pit and some guy stuck his hand up my top AND bra and grabbed my boob so I turned round and booted him in the face."" Someone else described how a man pinched her friend's bottom in the street, then walked away giggling with his friends. ""She and I squared up to them and made it massively clear that what one of them had just done was not only assault but just stupid,"" she said. ""My friend wasn't embarrassed, but she was angry.

"The helicopter picked up midwife Linda Benson (left), before flying to St Mary to collect parents-to-be Sandy and Alicia MacDonald A baby boy has been born mid-flight on the way to hospital in a coastguard helicopter over Cornwall. Emergency crews received a call on Saturday night to urgently assist a woman who had gone into labour while visiting the Isles of Scilly. There was no midwife on the islands in south-west England, so the family needed to get to the mainland quickly. Baby Torran, who was born 1,400ft (426m) over Penzance, was ""doing well"", a coastguard spokesman said. More news from Devon and Cornwall The Newquay Coastguard helicopter was scrambled at about 19:00 BST and collected midwife Linda Benson. It then touched down at St Mary's Airport, picked up Alicia and Sandy MacDonald - who were visiting from Inverness - and began the trip to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro. Torran decided he was not going to wait to finish the flight, a hospital spokeswoman said There is a midwife based on the Isles of Scilly, but she was not on call when Mrs MacDonald started going into labour, so a standby team based on the mainland stepped in. However, the baby decided to make an appearance on board the aircraft, and at just before 21:00 BST, with the help of midwife Linda and aircrew, 7lb 8oz (3.4kg) Torran was born. Mrs MacDonald said: ""Torran is doing fine and we'd like to thank the coastguard, the midwife and the midwifery team at the hospital.""

"Lawrence Rivers called Scottish Power but they were unable to help him find his car A man spent 12 hours looking for his car after finding only a large hole in the street where he had parked it. Lawrence Rivers left his Mercedes on a road in Edinburgh, but contractors from Scottish Power had it moved in order to carry out emergency repairs. After being unable to contact the firm, Mr Rivers, 52, from Leicestershire, spent hours searching the area. His wife eventually helped locate the vehicle after phoning ""every car recovery company she could find"". Scottish Power has apologised and said it would look into what happened. At least two other cars were moved to allow contractors to dig up the road Mr Rivers, from Misterton near Lutterworth, parked his car on Dryden Street on Thursday night, while staying in a nearby lodgings. He returned to pick it up at about 07:00 BST on Saturday. ""I was there with my bag, with my clothes on hangers, and was looking forward to going somewhere for breakfast but my car was not there. ""There was just a great big hole."" He saw that Scottish Power was carrying out work and said he was ""quite relaxed"" at that point thinking it would be ""over in an hour"". He rang the company's general inquiry line, but the operator told him he needed to ""speak to the engineers who do not work at the weekend"". He then called the police, who said they would try to help, but at 15:00 they told him they had not had any luck. Mr Rivers then walked around the area searching until 18:30. Meanwhile, his wife Asha, 46, was calling ""every recovery company she could find"" until she found the firm which had moved the car, and was given a description of its location. Mr Rivers followed her instructions and found it ""parked in the middle of the road"" in Tennant Street - about a mile away. ""It was quite a day,"" he added. Mr Rivers found his car in Tennant Street, about a mile away from where he left it in Dryden Street Mr Rivers said at least two other cars were also moved for the work, and his wife's detective work meant the police were able help the other motorists find their missing vehicles. A spokesperson for SP Energy Networks said: ""Engineers had to carry out emergency repairs on Dryden Street to fix a cable fault that could have resulted in power supplies being affected. ""It is very rare that we need to remove cars to get to a fault, and when we do, our contractors inform the police. We apologise for any concern caused, and we will speak to Mr Rivers to investigate the issues raised."" George McPhie, from McPhie Recovery - which moved Mr Rivers' car - said they had put the vehicle where Scottish Power had asked, and that it was not their responsibility to contact the owner.

"Reports that North Korea is continuing its weapons programme, despite pledges to denuclearise, have cast doubt on its sincerity in peace talks. The recent reports, based on US intelligence leaks, suggest the country is still upgrading its nuclear enrichment sites, among other activities. So what's actually going on? Here's what has been reported across US media: North Korea's only official nuclear enrichment site at Yongbyon is being upgraded. The country is stepping up enrichment at two or more secret sites besides Yongbyon. Pyongyang continues to produce more mobile launch vehicles for its ballistic missiles. It has also expanded missile production of solid fuel engines which are more mobile and easier to launch. How reliable are these reports? They are ""only"" reports but they are deemed accurate by respected North Korea watchers. The information is based on multiple unnamed sources from the US intelligence community as well as the38 North study of satellite images of the Yongbyon site,external. Allow Twitter content?

""None of that activity is in violation of any agreements made at the Singapore summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un,"" explains Vipin Narang, MIT professor for political science and specialist on nuclear proliferation. In the declaration wrapping up that summit, Pyongyang merely agreed to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, something it sees as a phased process. Details of the process still remain to be worked out by the two sides. ""This was never going to be unilateral and immediate,"" says Mr Narang. ""So Kim Jong-un is free to continue operating the existing sites."" To trust or not to trust, that is the question Yet the reports that the North is continuing its nuclear activity is still seen as undermining the spirit of the summit and casts doubt on Pyongyang's sincerity to denuclearise. ""The bigger picture here is that North Korea's nuclear programme continues as directed by Kim Jong-un in his speech in January, where he urged the continued production of warheads and ballistic missiles,"" explains Ankit Panda, editor at The Diplomat magazine. What were the results of the Trump-Kim summit? North Korean propaganda changes its tune N Korea still poses major threat - Trump Solid fuel engines are more mobile and hence a big step for Pyongyang. Together with the mobile launchers, it means that North Korea can fire missiles from sites that can be quickly set up and not be detected ahead of time by South Korea or the US. Yet the biggest revelation has been the details about North Korea's secret enrichment sites. So far, Pyongyang has only ever admitted to one enrichment site: Yongbyon. Solid fuel and mobile launchers would be a major step for Pyongyang It's been a longstanding suspicion though that there are more, secret sites. An exclusive NBC report based on US intelligence sources confirmed and named one such site and says there is at least one more secret enrichment site. ""You can imagine a North Korean strategy where - without a full disclosure of all their facilities - they can offer to shut down some of the known sites in order to get sanctions relief,"" explains Mr Narang. ""At the same time they would clandestinely push ahead at the secret sites."" A sacred mountain and other ideologies On board the train to Korea's music festival for peace Inside the North Korean place that âdoesnât existâ The information coming from the US intelligence sources is presumably something they have known for quite some time. Mr Trump is likely to have been briefed about that very information in the run-up to the Singapore summit. So why is it now being leaked to the media? ""The sheer number of leaks on nuclear activity makes it look like an authorised attempt to get that intel out into the public sphere,"" says Andray Abrahamian of the Griffith Asia Institute. Experts believe there are two reasons why the US intelligence community might have chosen to disclose its information at this point in time. Scenario one would be ""to counter the narrative coming from the White House that it's 'mission accomplished' and that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat,"" explains Mr Narang. It may therefore ""constrain Trump a bit so he can't claim successes that have not yet be reached"", agrees Mr Abrahamian. ""It gets the foreign policy community riled up and increases pressure on Trump not to be soft on the [North] Koreans."" The other scenario would be that it's in fact co-ordinated by the Trump administration to generate leverage. By revealing the extent of US intel, Washington can put pressure on North Korea to admit to its secret sites and operations. The leaked intel could be a way to say 'Mr Kim, we're watching you' ""The assumption was always that we would let the North Koreans disclose their own sites and check that against the list the US intelligence community maintains,"" explains Mr Panda. ""Immediately you would have a sense of whether or not the North Koreans are negotiating in good faith. ""Now that we have put out what we know about the covert enrichment sites, we can see if the North Koreans will choose to disclose those or not."" What remains is the bigger question of whether post-Singapore summit, this kind of pressure will really be able to steer Pyongyang into line. The flurry of recent reports of North Korea's continued nuclear and military efforts suggest the country is intent on maintaining its nuclear and ballistic capabilities and even to continuing to produce them. ""It could be that Pyongyang is calculating that no matter what, China is already off the maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against North Korea. And the US really can't sustain it without China,"" warns Mr Narang. ""Kim Jong-un might simply say 'I've done what I have to in order to break the maximum pressure campaign' - and I think he might be right."" On board Korea's peace train at the DMZ.

"Problem solved - according to Mr Trump after his June summit with Kim Jong-un US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not be travelling to North Korea in the immediate future after Donald Trump asked him to call off a planned trip. The president tweeted that insufficient progress was being made in dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear programme. He also suggested China was not doing enough to put pressure on North Korea - due to trade tensions with the US. After his summit with the North Korean leader in June, Mr Trump said the country was no longer a nuclear threat. But since then there have been several reports that it is failing to dismantle nuclear facilities. One of the most recent warnings came from unnamed US officials, who told the Washington Post that North Korea appeared to be building new intercontinental ballistic missiles. The UN's nuclear agency (IAEA) has also said North Korea is continuing with its nuclear programme. Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? Who are Kim Jong-un's running bodyguards?

Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.
