"Natalia Jones-Pinkney was a school pupil in the class that US President George W Bush was visiting when he was told of the 9/11 attacks. The media descended on her community - but much of what they reported was at odds with what Natalia had seen for herself. The experience shaped the way she views the current election. For weeks, her family had been reminding her that she would remember this day for the rest of her life. On this particular Tuesday morning, in Sarasota Florida, seven-year-old Natalia Jones-Pinkney's mother, Stephanie, woke her up earlier than usual, to put extra tight half-braids in her hair. ""Remember what we talked about,"" she said as she smoothed out Natalia's crisp white shirt and grey shorts. ""You're going to keep it down and be on your best behaviour. The world is going to see you today."" The girl nodded. It was a valuable reminder. Natalia knew that she had a theatrical streak. When she played in the road, she told anyone who'd listen that she was going to be famous one day, that she would make millions, and she'd help her whole family. But that outgoing persona had to be contained every now and then, her mother would tell her, especially on a day like this Tuesday. As they approached the grounds of Emma E. Booker Elementary school, only a short walk away, Natalia was in awe of the scene. ""There were limousines everywhere. There were police on horses,"" she says. ""I thought 'Oh my God!' There were men in suits and sunglasses, the secret service, it was like a scene out of Men in Black. And there were so many white people."" School was an extension of home for Natalia. Her aunt Josephine worked in the cafeteria there, and it was less than a minute's walk. This was the first time Natalia had seen so many unfamiliar faces in the area. Ushered through a metal detector, Natalia was taken to a classroom where rows of chairs were positioned facing the whiteboards. These were for her and 15 of her second grade classmates. She took a seat on the edge of the row. Behind her were several adults, all in suits, whom she didn't recognise - and many stood next to cameras, all pointed toward her and her friends. ""And then Mrs Daniels walked in and I wasâ¦ 'Wow!'"" Natalia laughs. ""She always looked pretty but today, wow, she looked beautiful. Beautiful."" Kay Daniels in 2002 - remembering the events of 9/11 one year on Kay Daniels, had her hair freshly curled, and more makeup than usual. She had been Natalia's teacher since she started school and she was a firm favourite of the class. ""Mrs Daniels made an effort with everyone to make sure they learned. She taught on your level,"" Natalia says. On seeing familiar faces again, Natalia relaxed. The children fell into easy chatter with each other, giggling at how smart each of them looked. All their parents had taken extra care. Just before 09:00, the room fell silent as the children were instructed to stand up to welcome a special guest. President George W Bush walked into the classroom. As cameras clicked at the back of the room, he stopped in front of Natalia to shake her hand. ""I was not expecting this,"" she says. Smiling at the children, he moved to the front of the class where he took a seat opposite Kay Daniels, who then began a lesson with the class, which included reading from a book called The Pet Goat. A few minutes into the class, Andrew Card, the White House chief of staff walked up to the president and bent down to whisper something into his ear. ""After that moment, the president just checked out,"" says Natalia. ""He was gone. He mentally just left the room, he turned bright red. We thought he may have needed to pee real bad."" Andy Card whispers in George Bush's ear What Natalia didn't see was that White House press secretary Ari Fleischer had positioned himself behind her, holding a card towards the president, with a message written on it: ""Don't Say Anything Yet."" For the next seven minutes the president sat in the room, before he praised the children for their reading skills and excused himself to leave, ahead of the scheduled time. Moments later the class would learn why. And years after that, Natalia wouldsee herself in news reports and documentaries, on the edge of the frame, just before Andy Card bent down to George W Bush and whispered: ""A second plane has hit the second tower. America is under attack."" Newtown isn't mentioned in tourist sites or glossy travel brochures. In 2019, according to the Visit Sarasota website, the city had more than 2.7 million tourists from around the world coming to enjoy its white sand Gulf Coast beaches. But head directly north for around two miles, past the city's business centre, and you'll reach Newtown, where Natalia was born. It's different there. ""It's the 'black area',"" she says. ""It is about 10 blocks that are entirely black, almost 100%, and it's very different to the rest of Sarasota, which is wealthy - it has golf clubs and country clubs. That's the white area. It's separate."" Natalia was born into a large and loving family and brought up by her biological mother's sister, who was unable to have children of her own. Natalia was born and raised in Sarasota, Florida ""I had two mothers,"" says Natalia. ""And lots of aunts and uncles, two sisters and a brother and many cousins. We were in and out of each other's houses and it was a great childhood. And our teachers were like extra aunties and uncles."" Emma E. Booker school was a central part of the community. It had been named after one of the first African American teachers in Sarasota, who was determined to ensure black children had a good environment in which to learn. In 2001, children at the elementary school were overperforming in the state in terms of literacy, and this had been flagged up to the politicians in Washington. To promote his administration's recent promise to ensure education was equally available to America's diverse communities, George W Bush had then arranged to visit, and 16 pupils with good reading skills were chosen to meet him. The president walked in minutes after hearing that a plane had crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center. He was seated opposite Mrs Daniels and facing the children, when the second plane hit the south tower at 09:03. Two minutes later that information was relayed to the president, and after remaining in his seat for a while as the children read, he got up to leave. President Bush confers with White House staff in another room at Emma E. Booker school ""I thought, 'What happened? Did I do something wrong, did I say something wrong?'"" Kay Daniels says. ""It got strange after that,"" Natalia says. ""Someone bought a TV into the room and put on the news and that's when we saw what had happened. ""As a kid watching the buildings on fire, watching people jumping out of buildings, screaming, yelling, it was traumatising. Most of us began to cry."" Mrs Daniels switched the TV off, turned to the children and began to sing a gospel song, Hold On, Change is Coming. It would be a song the students would sing together many times while they remained at the school. News programmes all over the globe picked up the statements President Bush gave in the cafeteria of the school less than half an hour later, addressing what he knew about the largest foreign attacks on American soil. He left soon after, and with him went the cameras, horses and men in black. One by one the parents of the children arrived to take them home, the teachers soon followed and by noon the school was empty. In the weeks that followed, Natalia felt more eyes on her. While she played with her friends or siblings, she could see adults in the area, be it an auntie or a neighbour, regularly taking turns to step outside to look out for the children. ""The media made out that America was now a place where people were angry and scared but I saw people in Newtown come together and look out for each other more. I felt taken care of,"" she says. The 16 children reunited for a group photo in 2002 - Natalia is third from left in the front row There were camera crews around the neighbourhood, and local and international media asked the children to speak about their experiences. Natalia and the others who were in the room that day bonded as they visited news stations and met reporters. ""We did interview after interview after interview,"" she says. ""They were all asking the same questions: 'What was the president thinking?' 'What was the president saying?' 'How did the president look?' We didn't say much, we were kids."" Years later, Natalia read accounts of the day that didn't tally with what she had seen with her own eyes. She read articles that said the president remained calmly reading from The Pet Goat after the terror attack. In fact, he didn't read to the children at all. ""If they could get that detail wrong, when there were so many cameras present, what else could they get wrong?"" A letter from President Bush to Booker apologising for cutting his visit short She also took issue with those who criticised the president for his behaviour that day. ""It wasn't fair to say he was just casually sitting there doing nothing while America was under attack,"" she says. He left as soon as he could without causing the children to worry, she says. And she disliked the way the children were sometimes described just as ""inner-city kids"", which felt reductive, or how it was assumed they came from troubled backgrounds and couldn't possibly succeed in life. The group of children stayed close all through primary and middle school, and in a happy turn of events,  Mrs Daniels remained their teacher and taught them several years after second grade. But by high school the group began to drift apart, and were only recently all reunited when a documentary crew asked them to appear in 9/11 Kids, a film about where they all are now. ""The children in that classroom represent all of America,"" says Elizabeth St. Philip, the director. ""There is no one singular story there. One joined the military, inspired by the events of that day, one earns six figures as a business consultant, another is sadly in jail. ""This is a unique generation. They watched people die on TV at primary school and came of age through the rise of social media, the economic crash of 2008, the first black president and the polarisation of recent years, including Black Lives Matter. And they aren't even 30 yet!"" Natalia (again in the front row, third from left) joins her classmates and Kay Daniels for the documentary, 9/11 Kids Tensions between the community and the police emerge as one of the key themes of the film, and Natalia has first hand experience of them. Growing up, she says she saw cousins being beaten by police for not carrying ID. She says police would stop her and her friends in the area and imitate and mock their accent. ""We were a joke to them,"" she says. ""Our culture was a joke to the police."" Crime rates in Newtown are some of the highest in the state of Florida, a statistic that some community leaders, and Natalia, put down to the area being ""over-policed"". ""It's the kind of area where if you call them for help, it'd take them about an hour to get to you,"" Natalia says. ""But if you have a party, the police will be there in five minutes to arrest people for small amounts of drugs."" The tensions came to a head in 2018, when Natalia's brother, Jeremy, a state football player with a scholarship to university, was shot three times by a police officer. He was 19, unarmed, and sitting in his car with a friend. Jeremy survived the attack but was subsequently jailed for a minor drug offence, which Natalia says is often what happens when young black men are targeted by the police. His arrest prompted Black Lives Matter protests in Newtown. ""They found a way to lock him up,"" she says. ""He had his whole career in front of him with his football. When he's out we have to get him back on track and make sure he can fulfil that."" Natalia is now 26, and lives in Newtown with her boyfriend and her two children. She runs a babysitting business, caring for children in the community and helps out in a pop-up business making and selling teddy bears. Her mother, Stephanie, died of a longstanding illness in August, a blow to a family still reeling from Jeremy's imprisonment. ""Right now everyone is on a pause,"" she says. ""But I'm keeping my mindset optimistic. I'm not angry. I honestly feel I'm destined for greatness and when I rise, I'll take my family with me."" Natalia embraces Kay Daniels Natalia's experience of reading reports of 9/11, and hearing inaccurate stories about her brother's arrest, means she doesn't believe everything people say, or what they write in the media, or on social media. She is careful about coming to conclusions. ""I don't make snap decisions. I weigh everything up."" Thinking things through for herself, she has even found herself defending politicians, including President Trump, to her friends. ""I think he's made life easier for people to start businesses and the economy was good under him,"" she says. ""But he's done a whole lot of bad too."" Although more than a quarter of a million voters under 30 in Natalia's home state of Florida have already cast votes in this election - five times more than in 2016 - she isn't sure how, or if, she'll vote. She's voted in the past but things feel different this time. A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Who will be the next US president? You decide Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climate Full coverage of the US election ""I've seen what it's like to have politicians and the media come by our communities every four years and pretend that they care - and nothing changes,"" she says. ""The people wanting our votes aren't from and don't speak for the community."" Natalia thinks something has changed since 2001, when the media and politicians ""controlled the narrative"" - the rise of social media, for one thing, and the Black Lives Matter movement. ""Now we're getting to have our voices heard and our generation has lots of ways to express ourselves,"" she says. Florida is one of the most influential swing states in US presidential elections; how it votes is a strong indication of who the next president will be - its choice has been the country's choice in the case of the last six presidents. Natalia's vote most definitely counts. ""I don't want to say that votes don't count, they do count, but at the end of the day will they make the change of what we want to see happen in our communities - or do we have to do that ourselves?"" James Smith has never wanted much to do with the police but he called them to check on his neighbour in the Texas city of Fort Worth, because it was late at night and her front door was wide open. Soon afterwards he heard a gunshot, and later saw the dead body of a 28-year-old woman, his neighbour's daughter, carried out on a stretcher.

"Access to government-provided laptops in England has been cut at some schools, head teachers have said. The government pledged to offer the devices to disadvantaged pupils who are at home because of coronavirus and do not own a computer. However, on Friday some schools were told the number of laptops they were promised had been cut by 80% after the government allocation process changed. The government says the devices will be sent to the areas of greatest need. One head teacher told the BBC he was ""flattened"" when he learned his school's allocation had been cut from 61 laptops to 13. 'Digital poverty' in schools where few have laptops Laptops offered for online school lessons at home The Department for Education has pledged to provide devices for children in Years 3 to 11 on free school meals who do not have laptops and whose face-to-face education is disrupted, as well as any disadvantaged children shielding. Some schools have received the entire batch, but others who have applied recently for the devices were told by the DfE on Friday they would now receive 20% of the laptops they were expecting. The notification came the day after a new legal duty on schools to provide immediate access to remote learning to pupils at home because of Covid-19 came into force. Chris Dyson logged on hoping for more laptops, only to find his school's allocation had been cut Chris Dyson, head teacher at Parklands School in Leeds, told the BBC his school had been allocated 61 laptops. When he received an email from the DfE on Friday saying it had secured an extra 100,000 laptops and was updating its allocation process he hoped that number would increase. He said: ""I actually needed 168. So I logged on expecting to hopefully see my 61 had gone up, and it destroyed me, it flattened me, when I saw it's actually been cut to 13. ""Thirteen laptops in a worst-case scenario to share amongst 380 children. I thought it was absolutely scandalous."" Michael Tidd, head teacher at East Preston Junior School in Sussex, said his allocation of laptops has been cut from 17 to three. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Tidd said schools had been putting plans in place to meet the new remote learning legal duty. ""And then the day after all those plans had to be finalised, then we get told that the number of laptops we were expecting... it's been reduced massively."" Another school told the BBC it was informed it would receive 66 laptops instead of the 332 originally promised. The school leaders union NAHT said the timing of the changes to laptop allocation numbers ""beggars belief"". Nick Brook, NAHT deputy general secretary, said: ""The government has been quick to mandate what it expects schools to be able to do when it comes to remote learning, but is clearly unable to deliver the necessary tools that schools and their pupils need."" LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? The DfE calculates the number of devices available to schools based on the number of children in years 3 to 11, free school meals data and how many devices a school already has. It said more than 340,000 laptops and tablets were being made available to schools this term to support disadvantaged children, with deliveries expected to total half a million by Christmas. A DfE spokesperson said: ""As we move into half term, and in the context of significant global demand, we're updating our allocation process to more accurately align orders with the number of students schools typically have self-isolating, ensuring as many children as possible benefit from receiving a device this term. ""We have already purchased an additional 96,000 devices and continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure delivery despite the increased global demand.""

"The body of the woman, believed to be in her 60s, was found at a National Trust estate A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of a woman was discovered at a National Trust estate. Police found the body in woodland on the Watlington Hill estate, Oxfordshire, just before 18:00 BST on Friday. The arrested man is being treated in hospital for serious injuries. Thames Valley Police said it was linking the murder to reports of a man seen acting suspiciously near a pub a few hours earlier. The victim is believed to be in her 60s, the force added. Officers have appealed for anyone who saw a man behaving strangely near the Fox and Hounds pub in the Christmas Common area of Oxfordshire at about 15:30 to get in touch. Anyone who saw anything suspicious in the Watlington Hill area at about 17:30 has also been asked to contact detectives. Det Supt Craig Kirby said: ""We are carrying out a thorough investigation to piece together what has happened to lead to this woman's death.""

"Pressure is mounting on the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meals over the holidays in England. Several Conservative MPs are opposing No 10's stance, as Labour threatens to push for another Commons vote and some 2,000 doctors call for a U-turn. It comes as the PM faces calls to meet footballer Marcus Rashford to discusshis free school meals campaign. The government has said it has increased welfare support.

Labour has said it will force a new Commons vote on the issue if the government does not change its position before the Christmas Commons recess. Tulip Siddiq, shadow minister for children, said she was sorry the issue had ""become a political football"" but some Conservative MPs ""are realising this is principles before party"" and she appealed for more to stand against the government. She told BBC Breakfast that, with some local councils agreeing to supply meal vouchers during the holidays, the issue had become ""a postcode lottery"" because not every council had ""stepped up"". On Wednesday, Conservative MPs rejected Labour's Opposition Day motion to extend free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling. One of those rebels, Mr Halfon, called on Mr Johnson to meet Rashford, telling the BBC: ""It may be that they don't agree with everything that Marcus Rashford is proposing, but it would give us a chance to come up with a long-term plan to combat child food hunger once and for all.""

Businesses have been offering to provide children with food during half-term This puts it at odds with the other UK nations, which have all extended the policy beyond term time. However, hundreds of cafes, restaurants and some local councils have since pledged to help feed children facing hardship during the October half term - prompting Rashford to say he""couldn't be more proud to call myself British"". Rashford's petition on child food poverty was approaching 800,000 names on Sunday morning. Meanwhile, two Conservative MPs have said comments they made about the issue were ""taken out of context"" after their remarks were criticised. Commenting on a school in Mansfield, Ben Bradley said that ""one kid lives in a crack den, another in a brothel"". Another Twitter user responded, saying that ""Â£20 cash direct to a crack den and a brothel sounds like the way forward with this one"", to which Mr Bradley replied: ""That's what FSM [free school meal] vouchers in the summer effectively did..."" Mr Bradley said the tweet, which has since been deleted,had been ""totally taken out of context"". Similarly, Conservative MP, Selaine Saxby, used the same defence after writing in a since-deleted Facebook post that she hoped businesses who were giving away food for free ""will not be seeking any further government support"".

Rashford's petition on child food poverty was approaching 800,000 names on Sunday morning. Meanwhile, two Conservative MPs have said comments they made about the issue were ""taken out of context"" after their remarks were criticised. Commenting on a school in Mansfield, Ben Bradley said that ""one kid lives in a crack den, another in a brothel"". Another Twitter user responded, saying that ""Â£20 cash direct to a crack den and a brothel sounds like the way forward with this one"", to which Mr Bradley replied: ""That's what FSM [free school meal] vouchers in the summer effectively did..."" Mr Bradley said the tweet, which has since been deleted,had been ""totally taken out of context"". Similarly, Conservative MP, Selaine Saxby, used the same defence after writing in a since-deleted Facebook post that she hoped businesses who were giving away food for free ""will not be seeking any further government support"".

"This video can not be played Marcus Rashford and his mother Melanie helped out at FareShare Greater Manchester Footballer Marcus Rashford has said he ""couldn't be more proud to call myself British"" after the community response to his campaign to get free meals for children during the half-term holiday. The England striker told BBC Newsnight he was ""overwhelmed"" by the support offered by councils and businesses. It comes after a Labour bid to extend free school meals was rejected by MPs. The government says it has already introduced more effective measures to support families. Meanwhile, two Conservative MPs have said comments they made about the issue were ""taken out of context"" after their remarks were criticised. Councils promise free meals after Rashford campaign Restaurants rally for Rashford's free meal crusade Is there really no money for free school meals? The government has ruled out extending free meals nationwide beyond term time - as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have done - saying it has given councils Â£63m for families facing financial difficulties due to pandemic restrictions, as well as increasing welfare support by Â£9.3bn. On Wednesday, Conservative MPs rejected Labour's Opposition Day motion to extend the provision of free school meals by 322 votes to 261, with five Tory MPs rebelling. However, many Conservative and Labour councils have since agreed to supply meal vouchers for pupils. Fish and chip shops, pubs, restaurants and cafes have also been amongthose to support the initiative, many of them directly commenting on Rashford's Twitter feed. Rashford,who became an MBE earlier this year, said in a statement to Newsnight: ""Even at their lowest point, having felt the devastating effects of the pandemic, local businesses have wrapped arms around their communities today, catching vulnerable children as they fell. ""I couldn't be more proud to call myself British tonight."" He added if people wanted ""to talk about 'superstars' and 'celebrities'"" they should look no further than his Twitter feed. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Ben Bradley has defended his position after being accused of stigmatising working-class families in a tweet. Commenting on a school in Mansfield, Mr Bradley said that ""one kid lives in a crack den, another in a brothel"". Another Twitter user responded, saying that ""Â£20 cash direct to a crack den and a brothel sounds like the way forward with this one"", to which Mr Bradley replied: ""That's what FSM [free school meal] vouchers in the summer effectively did..."" Mr Bradley said the tweet, which has since been deleted, had been ""totally taken out of context"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""I was merely making the point that there are kids who live in really chaotic situations, really difficult lives, where actually giving them an unrestricted voucher to spend on whatever isn't helpful."" He said the government had given money to local government which was better placed to provide targeted support, adding: ""We need to wrap our arms, as a society, around those families."" Labour called for him to apologise for the tweet, with deputy leader Angela Rayner saying: ""Notwithstanding the fact that the vouchers in summer could only be used to purchase food, this stigmatisation of working class families is disgraceful and disgusting."" Another Conservative MP, Selaine Saxby, has also responded to criticism of comments she made on local businesses giving free food away. A screenshot of a since-removed post in her name on Facebook said: ""I am delighted our local businesses have bounced back so much after lockdown they are able to give away food for free, and very much hope they will not be seeking any further government support."" The MP later claimed her comments were taken ""out of context"" and added: ""I of course deeply regret any offence which may have been caused.""

Nicola Mason, headteacher at the Chase Terrace Academy in Burntwood, Staffordshire, praised the Conservative-led county council in her area for providing vouchers over the holiday saying it was ""absolutely the right thing to do"". She told the Today programme: ""Over the pandemic, it's definitely necessary. There are so many families that have found themselves in a crisis position where they can't feed their children as well as they could before."" Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said the council's decision to back the campaign would provide meals for 19,800 pupils in the city, while Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street said the government should have made ""a clear decision"" on whether it would or would not fund free school meals during the holidays ""well in advance"". Rebecca Horton, who is owner of the Taste Sandwich Bar in Dingle in Liverpool, said she signed up to Rashford's campaign because she comes from a deprived area and wanted to support her community. ""I see families struggling, I see children hungry - it was an absolute no brainer for me to jump on the bandwagon, rally round and organise something,"" she told the Today programme. Businesses have been offering to provide children with food during half-term However, MP David Simmonds, who represents Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, said the scheme ""on its own is not going to get the help to people that need it"". He told Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""a very complex situation"" which was not addressed by a ""one-size-fits-all response like free school meals"", adding that more effective measures include the extension of Universal Credit and extra money for local authorities. Robert Halfon, who was one of the five Conservative MPs to vote in support of extending free school meal provision, called on Mr Johnson to meet Rashford to come up with a long-term strategy. Mr Halfon told BBC Breakfast: ""It may be that they don't agree with everything that Marcus Rashford is proposing, but it would give us a chance to come up with a long-term plan to combat child food hunger once and for all."" The England player has urged people to ""unite"" to protect the most vulnerable children Earlier this year, Rashford's campaign led tothe government changing its policyto allow the 1.3 million children in England who receive free school meal vouchers to claim them during the summer holidays. His efforts have been widely praised, with ex-England striker and Match of the Day host Gary Lineker tweeting: ""Extraordinary from a remarkable young man.""

"Parents are being urged to hold celebrations at home The Scottish government has told children to stay at home this Halloween. In guidance issued a week ahead of 31 October, people have been told guising (going door-to-door) and parties are not encouraged. Instead, people have been asked to have safe Halloween celebrations at home. It comes as clinical director Jason Leitch suggested to the BBC that the central belt could be put into tier three restrictions. The Halloween move was announced on the Scottish government'sParent Club website,external. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said allowing children to go guising to neighbours this year would increase the risk of the spread of Covid-19. Covid: Scotland to enter new five-level alert system How will Scotland's five-level system work? ""Under the current restrictions it is not possible to meet up indoors or in large groups outdoors, so the safest thing to do this year is to stay at home,"" he said. ""I know guising is a big part of Halloween and children will be sad to miss out, but as door-to-door guising brings an additional and avoidable risk of spreading the virus, our clear advice for families is to avoid it. ""Children can still get dressed up and share jokes with their families, and our Parent Club guidance has lots of fun and creative ideas for families to enjoy a safe celebration at home."" Scots have also been told not to hold large gatherings in their gardens for Bonfire Night due to the cancellation of organised events. Mr Swinney said it was vital the public adhered to the rules on meeting up with other households to stop transmission of the virus. Trick-or-treating has been discouraged due to a high risk of spreading Covid infection ""We know that some people may consider using fireworks in their back gardens,"" he said. ""If you do plan on using fireworks this Bonfire Night, please do so responsibly and safely. ""Adapting alternative celebrations and sticking to the rules in place can go a huge way to ensuring everyone's safety."" The announcement of the guidance follows comments by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Thursday, who said it was ""not safe"" for guising to be allowed this year, due to Covid-19. At the coronavirus briefing, she said: ""It's not safe right now to do these things as normal, and it would not be fair of me or right of me to say otherwise. ""To parents, to children; think of ways you can celebrate in a way that is safe and doesn't have children or others coming into unnecessary contact with others."" On Friday, the first minister announced that Scotland would be entering a new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions from 2 November.. Prof Leitch toldBBC Breakfaston Saturday that preparations were being made to decide which level of restrictions each area of Scotland would be placed in. He said: ""There is a meeting later today with a small team of analysts, advisers, who will look at the early stages of what that allocation might look like. Then there will be conversations with local government, conversations with  central government, with the first minister and deputy first minister about where that goes. ""But roughly speaking, the central belt Glasgow, Edinburgh, Ayrshire and Arran, that strip across the middle, where 3.5m of Scots live, that would be tier three and roughly, north and south of that - tier two."" Talking aboutcomments he made about being prepared for a ""digital Christmas""earlier this week, Prof Leitch said he may have been too harsh. He said he was trying to be ""realistic"" but to also encourage people that ""what we do now matters for eight weeks from now"". Nicola Sturgeon said she may make Prof Leitch dress up as The Grinch following his comments He said: ""Realistic looks like some kind of family Christmas but it will depend how well we get the numbers down. ""I could have perhaps been gentler in my use of the phrase digital Christmas but I just mean you won't be flying to visit relatives probably, you may not have large multi-household gatherings in your home. You won't be having six families but you may well be allowed to have two or three families if that is allowed. ""Nobody can cancel Christmas, not even the national clinical director for Scotland. It's happening, it is just to make it as safe as we possibly can."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Gwent Police said it issued six fixed penalty tickets for breach Covid regulations on Friday night Wales' second national lockdown is more challenging to police than the first because people are ""fatigued"" with Covid, a police chief has warned. But Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime commissioner said it was important people took ""personal responsibility"". Walesentered a national 17-day lockdownat 18:00 BST on Friday. People can leave home for limited reasons, including to provide care, buy food and medication, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. A further16 deaths of people with coronavirus were reported in Wales on Saturday- the highest total since 28 May - while 1,324 more people tested positive. All but essential shops have closed and on Friday supermarkets began covering up non-essential goods, which the Welsh Retail Consortium labelled an""ill-conceived policy"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has said supermarkets should also stop selling items such as clothes as a matter of ""fairness"" to non-essential shops that have closed. However aSenedd petitionagainst the move has become the fourth-ever to be signed by more than 45,000 people, and will be considered for a debate in the Welsh Parliament. Jodi Merry, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said the ban has come at an awkward time as she was planning to buy new clothes, including winter pyjamas, for her eight-year-old son after she gets paid next week. ""Everything is essential when it's something you desperately need,"" she said. Plastic has been seen over goods in supermarkets including clothes, microwaves and cat baskets Travel into or out of Wales to go on holiday or to visit a second home is illegal under the rules, and people are being told only to travel for ""essential reasons"". Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said: ""The public... I guess there's fatigue that has set in in relation to the rules and regulations. ""Which is why it's really important we get the message out for people to take personal responsibility."" He said officers would be engaging and educating the public in the first instance and enforcement would only happen at the ""latter stage of that process"". Meanwhile, the Law Society of England and Wales, which represents solicitors, said it was keen to make people aware of the powers that enforcement officers have during the firebreak. It said police had the power to enter homes and other premises if they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the lockdown restrictions are being contravened or are about to be contravened. Its president David Greene said: ""These are extraordinary powers and it is important that the public are fully informed about them so that they don't fall foul of them inadvertently. ""It is vital that laws of this nature are both visible and understandable. ""We will be concerned to ensure they are being used in a proportionate fashion."" Responding to these concerns, Mr Llywelyn said: ""I think it's really important for the police to act in a proportionate way. ""We mustn't also forget that we're in an emergency situation with this being a global pandemic so these are short-term measures that are here to safeguard the communities across the whole of Wales."" Chief constables in England and Wales have received an extra Â£30m to pay for overtime costs Dyfed-Powys Police tweeted it was not patrolling the border with England, but officers were out across the road network and in communities. ""Truth be told, we're really hoping that we can all work together to do what we've been asked to do,"" it added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

People can be issued a fixed penalty notice ""for most types of breaches"" and fined Â£60 for the first offence. That fine is increased to Â£120 for a second offence and continues to double for repeated offences, up to a maximum of Â£1,920. If prosecuted, however, a court can impose an unlimited fine. Enforcing the restrictions puts huge pressure on police resources. Crime has returned to levels last seen before the March lockdown - which means the frontline is stretched once more. Chief constables in England and Wales have received an extra Â£30m to pay for overtime costs. But to limit demands on officers, a policing model they call ""The Four Es"" remains in place. Before fines are issued to rule-breakers, police will first take a number of steps: Engage with people to ask why they appear to be breaking the rules Explain the law, stressing the risks to public health and the NHS Encourage them to change their behaviour Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average: A modern browser with JavaScript and a stable internet connection are required to view this interactive.

"The ban has provoked a fierce debate on what goods are ""essential"" Rules banning shops selling non-essential items during Wales' firebreak lockdown will not be reversed, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. On Sunday afternoon, Mr Drakeford said the implementation of the rules may be tweaked, but the ""basic decision"" behind the ban was the right one. Apetition,externalon the issue has exceeded 60,000 signatures, making it the largest ever submitted to the Senedd. The Welsh Conservatives earlier said the rules were ""mixed-messaging"". Supermarkets have been told they can only sell ""essential"" itemsand must close parts of their stores which sell products such as clothes, shoes, toys and bedding during Wales' 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown. Policing 'challenging' because of Covid 'fatigue' Five more Covid deaths and 1,104 new cases Mark Drakeford has said he will review the lockdown restrictions on what supermarkets can sell, but the ban will not be reversed In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Drakeford said: ""The position we face in Wales is really and deeply serious and for these two weeks we are asking people to stay at home and not to mix with other people as much as they can. ""If the rules are not sensible rules, if there are anomalies that are emerging, we will put them right, but the basic underlying public health emergency has not gone away. ""The basic decision is the right one. If the implementation of it, the interpretation of it needs to be revisited to make sure the rules are sensible, then we will do that. ""Non-essential goods are not allowed to be sold over the next two weeks. That's why there are hundreds of shops the length and breadth of Wales are closed. The underlying issue is not about shopping, it is about saving lives."" Mr Drakeford said a review into how the rules have been implemented would be held on Monday. This video can not be played Marr: Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething explains Wales supermarket rules Following comments earlier on Sunday by Welsh Government ministers Lee Waters and Jeremy Miles, Mr Drakeford said there is some ""discretion"" in the rules for shops to sell ""non-essential"" items in certain circumstances. ""I was told over the weekend of a child arriving with a foster carer with nothing at all. In those circumstances there is discretion for that very unusual set of circumstances to be addressed. ""If we need to make that clearer, if we need to talk to supermarkets about how that can be addressed, that's what we'll be doing tomorrow."" Welsh Government guidance,externalstates if there is doubt as to whether an item is a necessity, shops will be ""expected to use their best endeavours to consider what is available"". The head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, Sara Jones, said: ""To hear that discretion can be applied, of course that's good because it's showing that ministers are listening and that they're willing to look at ways to move forward. ""However, it does open a whole host of other issues. For example, by actually allowing that discretion to happen it means that actually the consumer is going to spend more time in store having to seek advice having to seek guidance. ""That's going to have the opposite effect of what the policy was intended for in the first place, which was to minimise the amount of time people should spend in store."" Sara Jones called for the rules to be reversed How do shoppers feel? One woman, whose daughter was admitted to hospital on Saturday, said she was unable to buy new clothes for her despite her pyjamas being ""soaked in blood"". Chelsea Jones, from Llwynypia, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she was forced to make a 40-mile trip home to collect replacements. ""I was driving around crying in a panic trying to find somewhere that I am able to pick up some essentials for my child,"" she said. ""I have never felt so angry, frustrated or upset, ever. You just never know when a 'non essential item' will become 'essential' to you."" Another parent, Jodi Merry, who is also from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said the rules were an ""inconvenience"" and she was planning to buy clothes for her eight-year-old son after she gets paid next week. ""I know it's only two weeks but he doesn't have any winter pyjamas...Clothing, shoes and even bedding are definitely essentials."" The toy aisle at Tesco on Western Avenue in Cardiff has been blocked off - the sales ban also applies to clothing Shoppers in Cardiff had mixed opinions on the new rules. Jane Millersmith said: ""I think it's absolutely, totally ridiculous. The idea that somebody who's on benefits and is waiting for their money to come through, maybe until next Thursday or Wednesday, can't then buy a child a pair of school shoes is outrageous."" Meanwhile, Rebecca Edwards said: ""If I was desperate because I'd broken my kettle I'd think 'I'll go and buy a kettle quickly' I'm not going to browse the whole of the homeware department because I need a kettle, I'd just go and buy a kettle because that's what I'd come for."" However, Oliver Bowler said he thought the Welsh Government was taking a ""proportionate approach"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? Wales' firebreak lockdown is in place until 9 November. The Welsh Government added it had made a further Â£300m available to support businesses affected. Secretary of State for WalesSimon Hart urged,externalMr Drakeford to ""scrap the policy"" while Welsh Conservative leader Paul Davies called for the Senedd/Welsh Parliament to be recalled ""virtually"" to debate the matter. ""This is absolute madness by the Welsh Government, preventing people from buying the products which they want to buy,"" he said. How are the restrictions affecting you?

"Several thousand people are thought to have died since the Karabakh war reignited in late September Videos of a potential war crime have emerged as fighting rages around the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians. One video posted on a messaging app shows what appears to be two Armenians in military uniforms being captured by troops from Azerbaijan. A second video seemingly shows the same Armenians being shot with their hands behind their backs. Armenian authorities have identified the men as Benik Hakobyan, 73, and 25-year-old Yuri Adamyan. Azerbaijan has dismissed the videos as fake. Europe's top human rights watchdog, the Council of Europe, has said it has received the video and will look into all alleged human rights abuses and take action when appropriate. Fighting erupted on 27 September around the Caucasus enclave, which is recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan but under Armenian control. Clashes quickly escalated into a large-scale conflict, with indiscriminate shelling of towns and cities and alleged use of banned cluster munitions. A ceasefire was announced on 10 October and then again on 18 October, but attacks have continued. What are Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting over? Several thousand people are said to have died and shelling has killed civilians in both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Tens of thousands have fled their homes. Warning: You may find some of the images in this story disturbing Combatants on both sides have released images and videos showing prisoners of war (POWs) and the bodies of opposition soldiers. The BBC has studied several videos circulated by the two warring sides on social media, allegedly showing prisoners of war being harmed or killed. Only these two videos were verifiably what they purported to be. One clip widely circulating on Telegram channels, that claims to show an Azerbaijani POW being shot dead by Armenian soldiers, is actually a video from Russia that first appeared on social media sites in 2013. Others lack enough detail to be verified. The pair of videos that the BBC has verified were posted on an anonymous Russian-language pro-Azerbaijan channel on Telegram messenger last week. The first video appears to show Armenians Benik Hakobyan and Yuri Adamyan being taken prisoner. Screenshot from a video on social media showing two Armenians being captured in Hadrut In the video, someone speaking Russian with a heavy Azerbaijani accent orders the men to walk forwards, surrender any weapons and raise their hands. He speaks to the other soldiers in Azerbaijani, telling them not to hit the captives. The younger prisoner, Yuri Adamyan, removes a helmet and his jacket before putting his hands in the air and walking out of shot. Although the older man, Benik Hakobyan, is wearing a military-style camouflage jacket, it's unclear whether he is a soldier. He is pushed to the ground and appears to moan in pain. The first video was followed by a second that shows the apparent execution of the two men. The prisoners appear to have their hands bound behind them and are draped in the flags of Armenia and the unrecognised republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. They are sitting on a small wall and can be seen moving slightly. Then someone orders in Azerbaijani: ""Aim at their heads."" Multiple shots are heard and the prisoners slump to the ground. The BBC has confirmed that the man giving commands in both videos is a native Azerbaijani speaker with a regional accent. The prisoners from the first video also appear to be the men being executed in the second as they are wearing the same clothes. Azerbaijan's defence ministry quickly denied these were their troops and called the videos a provocation. The clips were deleted shortly afterwards. The following day, Azerbaijan's prosecutor general announced that an investigation had concluded the videos were fake. The BBC has studied the clips and confirmed that they were filmed in Hadrut, a town that has seen intense fighting. It is in southern Nagorno-Karabakh, near Fuzuli. It's likely the videos were recorded at some point between 9-15 October. Azerbaijan announced that Hadrut had been taken on 9 October, although it later emerged that, while they had taken some strategic heights around the town, fierce fighting was still going on for control of the town itself on 12 October. The first videos actually showing the Azerbaijan army in the town centre appeared on 15 October. The POW videos both appeared for the first time on 15 October. Bellingcat open-source investigators were the first to publish theiranalysis into the authenticity of the videos,external. The location of the first video is the side of the road in the northern part of Hadrut (39Â°31'25.9""N 47Â°01'40.8""E). In the picture above, there are four buildings that appear in the video that can be matched to structures in a satellite view of the region. The execution clip seems to be filmed at a park approximately a kilometre away in the south of the town. By cross-referencing a still from the video before the men were shot with a satellite view of the town and footage from a local TV report, it is possible to identify the exact location as the park next to Mkrtchyan Street (39Â°30'53.4""N 47Â°02'01.8""E). Bellingcat identified the same locations and time periods for both videos and confirmed that helmets and rifles seen on the soldiers matched those used at least in some instances by Azerbaijani servicemen. They wrote that their analysis ""would appear to indicate that these two men were indeed Armenian combatants who were captured between October 9 and October 15 by Azerbaijani soldiers, possibly special forces, and likely executed a short time later"". Online commentators from Azerbaijan have questioned the authenticity of the clip, by pointing out the apparent lack of blood as a result of the shooting, but military experts interviewed by the BBC say the video looks genuine. ""Hollywood gives a poor reflection of what gunshot wounds look like,"" said Rob Lee, a military expert from the Department of War Studies at King's College London. The BBC spoke to a former British military intelligence officer who agreed to talk on condition of anonymity due to security reasons. They said: ""These are real bullets, this is a real killing. This is genuine, and I don't see any reason to assume it's staged."" Brain matter could be seen coming out of a gunshot wound, the officer said. Armenia's human rights defender, Arman Tatoyan, has officially labelled Azerbaijan's execution of two prisoners of war an ""undeniable war crime"". ""In these videos, members of the Azerbaijani army humiliate prisoners of war and then brutally kill them with extreme cynicism,"" he wrote on Facebook. He said Armenia's representatives at the European Courts of Human Rights had already asked for copies of the videos. Mr Tatoyan said he would share the clips with the UN human rights commissioner, the Council of Europe and other international bodies. A spokesperson for the Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatovic, confirmed that the materials had been received and the commissioner was ""closely following the situation and she will look into all allegations of grave human rights violations and take actions when she deems appropriate"". A spokesperson from the International Committee of the Red Cross told the BBC that although the organisation followed up on all such allegations, it did not speak publicly about specific incidents. Nagorno-Karabakh human rights ombudsman Artak Beglaryan told the BBC that the men in the videos were two locals. He said Benik Hakobyan was not a soldier but a civilian from Hadrut and Yuri Adamyan was likely a serviceman from a neighbouring village. Since the appearance of the video from Hadrut, both sides have released statements identifying several prisoners of war. Azerbaijan showed two Armenian captives receiving medical attention and the Armenians produced images of an Azerbaijani prisoner undergoing treatment at a hospital in Karabakh. War crimes are actions violating international rules of war as defined by the body of laws, most importantly the Geneva Conventions The Conventions' signatories â all UN member states, Azerbaijan and Armenia included â must protect the prisoners of war, as well as sick and wounded, from harm Torturing, injuring or killing such a prisoner constitutes a war crime The Geneva Conventions also protect civilians Since the escalation of the conflict on 27 September, both Azerbaijani and Armenian forces have shelled cities and towns.

"This video can not be played Protests in Naples over possible lockdown Protesters in Naples opposed to stricter coronavirus measures clashed with police late into the night. Some threw smoke bombs and firecrackers in the centre of the southern Italian city; police responded with tear gas. The mainly young crowd defied a night-time curfew imposed late on Friday in the Campania region after cases rose. Regional President Vincenzo de Luca has called for a national lockdown to avoid a repeat of the casualties seen in the first wave earlier this year. Hundreds broke through a police cordon near the regional headquarters building late on Friday, Italy's Ansa news agency reports. Along with smoke bombs, bottles were thrown at the 100-strong line of police in riot gear. How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Demonstrators earlier gathered in front of a university building in response to calls on social media. One carried a banner with the words ""you close us, you pay us"". Smoke bombs and firecrackers were thrown Protesters chanted slogans calling for financial help Naples police commissioner Alessandro Giuliano condemned ""criminal behaviour"". ""No conditions of discomfort, however humanly understandable, can in any way justify violence,"" he said. Italy, badly hit during the first wave of the virus in March and April, has seen a spike in new daily infections - 19,143 were registered on Friday. Ninety-one deaths were recorded, though that is much lower than the peak of fatalities in the first wave. Regional leaders have the power to impose their own measures, but Campania's president said regional lockdowns would not be enough. ""We need to make one last effort to get things under control. We need to shut everything down for a month, for 40 days,"" he said in a statementposted on the regional government's website.,external The protesters defied a curfew imposed late on Friday Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he does not want to repeat the national lockdown imposed during the first wave, as Italy continues to grapple with the severe economic consequences. Campania is the second worst-hit region in Italy in terms of new cases, behind Lombardy, which was the epicentre when the pandemic first arrived in Italy. More than 37,000 people have died with coronavirus in Italy, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, and over 484,000 have been infected. *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.

"This video can not be played Labourâs deputy leader Angela Rayner is rebuked after making the comment Conservative MPs have faced ""widespread abuse"" after Labour's Angela Rayner used the word ""scum"" in a Parliamentary debate, the party's co-chairwoman says. Amanda Milling has written to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asking if he will take action against Labour MPs ""who perpetrate abuse"". Ms Rayner made the remark on Wednesday during a Commons speech by Tory MP Chris Clarkson, later apologising for ""language I used in a heated debate"". Labour has declined to comment. Rayner apologises for 'scum' remark in Commons Ms Milling, ina letter signed by more than 100 Tory backbenchers,,externalwrote that Ms Rayner's use of the word ""scum"" towards Mr Clarkson was ""unacceptable"". She said it had resulted in the phrase ""Tory scum"" trending on Twitter and had caused ""widespread abuse towards members of our parliamentary party"", including abusive phone calls and MPs' offices being targeted. ""We respectfully ask you to take action, reaffirming your commitment to working constructively, asking Labour MPs and party members to act appropriately at all times, taking action against those who perpetrate this unacceptable abuse online and offline, and publicly apologise for Angela Rayner's record of unparliamentary behaviour,"" she wrote to Sir Keir. Ms Rayner, the party's deputy leader who represents Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, opened Wednesday's debate, which was about financial support for regions facing tighter coronavirus restrictions. Later, Mr Clarkson - also a Greater Manchester MP - criticised the area's Labour mayor, Andy Burnham, and accused the opposition of ""opportunism"". At this point, Ms Rayner was overheard saying ""scum"" from her seat on Labour's frontbench and was rebuked by the Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing. Meanwhile, footballer Marcus Rashford, who has led a campaigncalling on the government to provide free school mealsover the holidays,tweeted,externalto condemn the ""unacceptable"" abuse some MPs had received for voting against the motion in Parliament.

The political consensus of early this year has been blown apart in recent days. Angela Rayner had to apologise earlier this week for saying ""scum"" while a Conservative MP criticised Labour in a debate over Covid. There is increasing political disagreement over the government's handling of the crisis. And the free meals issue has separately sparked a huge and heated debate, both in Parliament and on social media. The government is adamant it is offering support in other ways. Some Tory MPs have spoken publicly about why they think free meals is the wrong approach and accused Labour of trying to politicise the issue. Labour is going to continue to push this issue though - and believes it shows the government is out of touch.

"Six months after getting coronavirus, Rebecca Logan is still feeling the effects ""We all thought we would get Covid. but we never really thought it would be a bad thing. ""I was young, I was fit, I was healthy."" Rebecca Logan, a fitness instructor and part-time nurse, began to feel unwell in April. The 39-year-old mother of two felt dizzy and lost her sense of taste and smell. ""When I got the positive test, I thought: 'Okay, this is maybe how it's going to be for the next few days and then I'll pick up.' ""What happened to me was that, by day 14, whenever you usually expect to feel better, I actually was a lot worse."" Five weeks later, however, and Rebecca was still not feeling better. Now, more than six months later, she still suffers from breathlessness, ""brain fog"" and has to take daily naps. Rebecca believes she has so-called long Covid - a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had the virus. There is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients - two people with long Covid can have very different experiences. However, the most common feature is crippling fatigue. Others symptoms include: breathlessness, a cough that won't go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. Long Covid: 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' Long Covid: 'I donât have a life, I currently have an existence' Coronavirus patient unable to work six months on It is estimated that as many as 60,000 people in England could have post-Covid conditions and NHS England hascommitted Â£10m to fund specialist clinics. Nothing like this has been announced yet for Northern Ireland, but Stormont's Department of Health said it had set up a Strategic Clinical Advisory Cell to establish a clinical working group. It said it expected ""a regional multidisciplinary working group will be formed to provide continuing guidance"" on the future needs of patients. BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra revealed this week that none of Northern Ireland's health bodies are collating data on the number of people who are still suffering with symptoms associated with the virus. The Department of Health said ""an agreed clinical definition of long Covid is required before numbers can be officially recorded"". Rebecca tested positive for Covid-19 in early April This definition is being developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) which advises GPs on how to treat medical conditions. Dr Toby Hillman is a respiratory consultant at one of the UK's first post-Covid clinics, based at University College Hospital in London. He is also helping NICE to define the condition. ""We accept the evidence is not great at the moment, that it's starting to be generated in ever greater depth and quality but the definition is going to change,"" he said. ""The definition is likely to include clinical diagnoses of this disease because we're aware of the difficulties of accessing testing and the problems with confirmatory testing, so it's going to be a fairly broad church."" Rebecca said she needs support now: ""People need to recognise that long Covid is a condition and that people need help physically and mentally because you feel so alone. ""People look at you whenever you say you're still not feeling great and you're still not able to do things because they think: 'Sure Covid, you get it and you're better in 14 days, what's the problem?' ""It's a very lonely position to be in."" 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering?

"Gwent Police said it issued six fixed penalty tickets for breach Covid regulations on Friday night Wales' second national lockdown is more challenging to police than the first because people are ""fatigued"" with Covid, a police chief has warned. But Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime commissioner said it was important people took ""personal responsibility"". Walesentered a national 17-day lockdownat 18:00 BST on Friday. People can leave home for limited reasons, including to provide care, buy food and medication, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. A further16 deaths of people with coronavirus were reported in Wales on Saturday- the highest total since 28 May - while 1,324 more people tested positive. All but essential shops have closed and on Friday supermarkets began covering up non-essential goods, which the Welsh Retail Consortium labelled an""ill-conceived policy"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has said supermarkets should also stop selling items such as clothes as a matter of ""fairness"" to non-essential shops that have closed. However aSenedd petitionagainst the move has become the fourth-ever to be signed by more than 45,000 people, and will be considered for a debate in the Welsh Parliament. Jodi Merry, from Rhondda Cynon Taf, said the ban has come at an awkward time as she was planning to buy new clothes, including winter pyjamas, for her eight-year-old son after she gets paid next week. ""Everything is essential when it's something you desperately need,"" she said. Plastic has been seen over goods in supermarkets including clothes, microwaves and cat baskets Travel into or out of Wales to go on holiday or to visit a second home is illegal under the rules, and people are being told only to travel for ""essential reasons"". Dyfed-Powys Police and Crime commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said: ""The public... I guess there's fatigue that has set in in relation to the rules and regulations. ""Which is why it's really important we get the message out for people to take personal responsibility."" He said officers would be engaging and educating the public in the first instance and enforcement would only happen at the ""latter stage of that process"". Meanwhile, the Law Society of England and Wales, which represents solicitors, said it was keen to make people aware of the powers that enforcement officers have during the firebreak. It said police had the power to enter homes and other premises if they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the lockdown restrictions are being contravened or are about to be contravened. Its president David Greene said: ""These are extraordinary powers and it is important that the public are fully informed about them so that they don't fall foul of them inadvertently. ""It is vital that laws of this nature are both visible and understandable. ""We will be concerned to ensure they are being used in a proportionate fashion."" Responding to these concerns, Mr Llywelyn said: ""I think it's really important for the police to act in a proportionate way. ""We mustn't also forget that we're in an emergency situation with this being a global pandemic so these are short-term measures that are here to safeguard the communities across the whole of Wales."" Chief constables in England and Wales have received an extra Â£30m to pay for overtime costs Dyfed-Powys Police tweeted it was not patrolling the border with England, but officers were out across the road network and in communities. ""Truth be told, we're really hoping that we can all work together to do what we've been asked to do,"" it added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Enforcing the restrictions puts huge pressure on police resources. Crime has returned to levels last seen before the March lockdown - which means the frontline is stretched once more. Chief constables in England and Wales have received an extra Â£30m to pay for overtime costs. But to limit demands on officers, a policing model they call ""The Four Es"" remains in place.

"This video can not be played Protests in Naples over possible lockdown Protesters in Naples opposed to stricter coronavirus measures clashed with police late into the night. Some threw smoke bombs and firecrackers in the centre of the southern Italian city; police responded with tear gas. The mainly young crowd defied a night-time curfew imposed late on Friday in the Campania region after cases rose. Regional President Vincenzo de Luca has called for a national lockdown to avoid a repeat of the casualties seen in the first wave earlier this year. Hundreds broke through a police cordon near the regional headquarters building late on Friday, Italy's Ansa news agency reports. Along with smoke bombs, bottles were thrown at the 100-strong line of police in riot gear. How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Demonstrators earlier gathered in front of a university building in response to calls on social media. One carried a banner with the words ""you close us, you pay us"". Smoke bombs and firecrackers were thrown Protesters chanted slogans calling for financial help Naples police commissioner Alessandro Giuliano condemned ""criminal behaviour"". ""No conditions of discomfort, however humanly understandable, can in any way justify violence,"" he said. Italy, badly hit during the first wave of the virus in March and April, has seen a spike in new daily infections - 19,143 were registered on Friday. Ninety-one deaths were recorded, though that is much lower than the peak of fatalities in the first wave. Regional leaders have the power to impose their own measures, but Campania's president said regional lockdowns would not be enough. ""We need to make one last effort to get things under control. We need to shut everything down for a month, for 40 days,"" he said in a statementposted on the regional government's website.,external The protesters defied a curfew imposed late on Friday Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he does not want to repeat the national lockdown imposed during the first wave, as Italy continues to grapple with the severe economic consequences. Campania is the second worst-hit region in Italy in terms of new cases, behind Lombardy, which was the epicentre when the pandemic first arrived in Italy. More than 37,000 people have died with coronavirus in Italy, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, and over 484,000 have been infected. *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.

"Parents are being urged to hold celebrations at home The Scottish government has told children to stay at home this Halloween. In guidance issued a week ahead of 31 October, people have been told guising (going door-to-door) and parties are not encouraged. Instead, people have been asked to have safe Halloween celebrations at home. It comes as clinical director Jason Leitch suggested to the BBC that the central belt could be put into tier three restrictions. The Halloween move was announced on the Scottish government'sParent Club website,external. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said allowing children to go guising to neighbours this year would increase the risk of the spread of Covid-19. Covid: Scotland to enter new five-level alert system How will Scotland's five-level system work? ""Under the current restrictions it is not possible to meet up indoors or in large groups outdoors, so the safest thing to do this year is to stay at home,"" he said. ""I know guising is a big part of Halloween and children will be sad to miss out, but as door-to-door guising brings an additional and avoidable risk of spreading the virus, our clear advice for families is to avoid it. ""Children can still get dressed up and share jokes with their families, and our Parent Club guidance has lots of fun and creative ideas for families to enjoy a safe celebration at home."" Scots have also been told not to hold large gatherings in their gardens for Bonfire Night due to the cancellation of organised events. Mr Swinney said it was vital the public adhered to the rules on meeting up with other households to stop transmission of the virus. Trick-or-treating has been discouraged due to a high risk of spreading Covid infection ""We know that some people may consider using fireworks in their back gardens,"" he said. ""If you do plan on using fireworks this Bonfire Night, please do so responsibly and safely. ""Adapting alternative celebrations and sticking to the rules in place can go a huge way to ensuring everyone's safety."" The announcement of the guidance follows comments by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Thursday, who said it was ""not safe"" for guising to be allowed this year, due to Covid-19. At the coronavirus briefing, she said: ""It's not safe right now to do these things as normal, and it would not be fair of me or right of me to say otherwise. ""To parents, to children; think of ways you can celebrate in a way that is safe and doesn't have children or others coming into unnecessary contact with others."" On Friday, the first minister announced that Scotland would be entering a new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions from 2 November.. Prof Leitch toldBBC Breakfaston Saturday that preparations were being made to decide which level of restrictions each area of Scotland would be placed in. He said: ""There is a meeting later today with a small team of analysts, advisers, who will look at the early stages of what that allocation might look like. Then there will be conversations with local government, conversations with  central government, with the first minister and deputy first minister about where that goes. ""But roughly speaking, the central belt Glasgow, Edinburgh, Ayrshire and Arran, that strip across the middle, where 3.5m of Scots live, that would be tier three and roughly, north and south of that - tier two."" Talking aboutcomments he made about being prepared for a ""digital Christmas""earlier this week, Prof Leitch said he may have been too harsh. He said he was trying to be ""realistic"" but to also encourage people that ""what we do now matters for eight weeks from now"". Nicola Sturgeon said she may make Prof Leitch dress up as The Grinch following his comments He said: ""Realistic looks like some kind of family Christmas but it will depend how well we get the numbers down. ""I could have perhaps been gentler in my use of the phrase digital Christmas but I just mean you won't be flying to visit relatives probably, you may not have large multi-household gatherings in your home. You won't be having six families but you may well be allowed to have two or three families if that is allowed. ""Nobody can cancel Christmas, not even the national clinical director for Scotland. It's happening, it is just to make it as safe as we possibly can."" RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Restaurants, pubs and non-essential shops had to close from 18:00 BST Wales has entered a national 17-day lockdown in an effort to slow the rise of Covid cases and hospital admissions. Major restrictionsto people's lives came into force at 18:00 BST on Friday. People can leave home for limited reasons including to buy food and medication, provide care, exercise or to work if they cannot do so from home. All but essential businesses have closed with economists warning the measures may cost the Welsh economy more than Â£500m. What can I do in Wales lockdown? Supermarkets covering up non-essential items WATCH: How Covid cases spread in Wales over two months The Welsh Government said any delay would have caused greater harm. But opposition parties have called for clarity on what happens at the end of the period. The number of patients in hospital in Wales with coronavirus is now thehighest since June, according to NHS Wales figures published on Friday. There were 894 people in Welsh hospitals with the virus, up 26% week-on-week, while 43 of them are in critical care, a rise of 72%. This is about two-thirds of the number at the peak. Jeremy Lovesey and Sharon Hale decided to welcome in lockdown with a takeaway Jeremy Lovesey and Sharon Hale had just picked up a Chinese takeaway in Newbridge, Caerphilly county, when lockdown began. ""We're doing what we always do on a Friday night - just chill,"" he said. ""But as far as I'm concerned - forget it, no-one is going to take any notice of it. He said the last lockdown cost him Â£3,000 in wages and put a strain on their relationship. Ms Hale said: ""At the moment, I've had breast cancer, so I'm not working at the moment, so with this Covid they won't let me back. ""Why a fortnight? What's that going to achieve? I don't think in a fortnight it's going to achieve anything."" Julian Lassman said the lockdown would lose him Â£150 a week Julian Lassman was waiting to go into the kebab shop. He works in the aviation industry and said he would lose Â£150 a week. ""I have got a young family - my son is only two, my wife works for the NHS. Basically I have lost a big chunk of my wage. ""We've just got to ride the wave. The government have done the best they can but they shouldn't have had a full lockdown from March to September because they knew it would get worse. "" In Newbridge, businesses were shut apart from the local takeaways which were busy at around 19:00. Under the new rules people cannot mix with others they do not live with. People can no longer meet others indoors, or socialise outdoors, such as in parks or people's gardens. People who live alone are allowed to meet one other household. This has to be the same one every time and there are no rules specifying they have to be within any set distance of your home. People can visit shops for essential food and medicine There is no limit to how many times people can leave the house to exercise or how far they can run, cycle, walk or jog as local lockdown boundaries have now ended. But exercising with others, such as running and cycling clubs, will not be allowed, and exercise should start from home. Police checkpoints are being set up on the border atGloucestershire to stop people travelling into Monmouthshireunless they have a reasonable excuse. Travel into or out of Wales to go on holiday or to visit a second home is illegal under the rules, and people are being told only to travel for ""essential reasons"". People can be fined Â£60 for a first restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of Â£1,920 Grandparents and other relatives can still care for children, but only if no other methods of childcare are available. Indoor visits to care homes may be allowed but only in ""exceptional circumstances"", such as for end-of-life visits. Earlier on Friday children left school ahead of their half-term break. Primary and special schools will reopen as normal on 2 November after the half-term break - there is no extra time off. In secondary schools only pupils in Years 7 and 8 will go back to class during the lockdown. The national rules bring an end to the local restrictions imposed on 15 counties, as well as Bangor and Llanelli, in recent weeks. People can be fined Â£60 for a first coronavirus restrictions offence, up to a maximum fixed penalty notice of Â£1,920. Adrive-in movie theatrein Chester is no exception to these rules - after the toilets were found to be across the border with Wales. The streets of Lampeter high street looked empty when lockdown began on Friday Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it would be a ""difficult and challenging fortnight"" but ""without taking action now our NHS will soon be overwhelmed and thousands of lives lost"". Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies accused ministers of having ""no exit strategy"". ""The Welsh Government needs to give us hope and clarity of what it will actually achieve and what life will look like post national lockdown,"" he said.

"More than 1.4 million people in South Yorkshire are the latest to move to England's top level of restrictions. Tier three measures came into effect at midnight affecting areas including Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. Sheffield City Region's mayor said the measures were needed but called on the government to ""define precisely what the exit criteria is"" from tier three. Meanwhile, Wales entered the first full day of a national lockdown amid border patrols to stop non-essential travel. Gloucestershire Constabulary said it will patrol routes into the Forest of Dean area and pull over vehicles suspected of making unnecessary journeys out of Wales. Can I go out for a meal with my sister? And other questions What Covid tier is your area in? Tier 2 rules start in Stoke-on-Trent and Coventry Scotland to enter five-level Covid alert system Drivers without a valid excuse will be advised to turn around and, if they do not, will be reported to police in Wales who can issue fines, the force added. It comes as another 174 deaths and 23,012 new confirmed cases were recorded on Saturday. And a leading epidemiologist has warned sending some children home from schoolsmay be the only way to control infection rates. Prof Neil Ferguson, a former government scientific adviser, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the current restrictions on household mixing ""should have a significant effect"". But he said beyond that there was a ""limit to what we can do"" without sending some school year groups home. Prof Ferguson, whose advice led to the lockdown in March, also said it was ""too early to say"" what impact the restrictions were having, adding: ""I think we'll have to wait another week or two."" Asked what the impact would be of relaxing lockdown rules for one or two days on Christmas, Mr Ferguson, whoquit his role in May after an ""error of judgement"", said it was a ""balancing act"" and ""a political judgement"". ""It risks some transmission and there will be consequences of that,"" he said. ""But if it's only one or two days the impact is likely to be limited."" Some 7.3 million people are now living under England's tightest restrictions. As the Sheffield City region entered tier three - very high alert - mayor Dan Jarvis, urged people to ""do their bit"" and stick to the new rules. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was ""clear what it takes our end"" to get out of tier three, such as a drop in new cases - but the government ""do have to be clear and transparent about the exit strategy"". Church leaders' warning over northern Covid rules Elsewhere, Stoke-on-Trent, Slough and Coventrymoved into tier two- high alert level - at midnight. In Wales, a17-day ""firebreak"" has started, meaning most non-essential businesses are closed, with people only able to leave home for limited reasons. In line with new guidance, supermarkets removed non-essential items from sale - including clothing, kitchen electrical items and crockery - using barriers and plastic sheets to cover products. Shoppers in Wales will not be allowed to buy non-essential items, such as clothing and tableware, in stores In Scotland,a five-level system will be introducedfrom 2 November. The top level would be close to a full lockdown, but the aim is for schools to remain open at all levels. In Northern Ireland, schools have been closed for two weeks as part of an extended half-term break. This ispart of a four-week ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown, with some businesses being told to close temporarily. Under England's tier three rules, pubs and bars not serving substantial meals have to close, while household mixing is banned indoors and outdoors in hospitality settings and private gardens. Additional rules in South Yorkshire include the closure of betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos, and soft play centres. However, gyms will remain open. The new measures will be reviewed after 28 days, but Sheffield's director of public health, Greg Fell,said he feared four weeks ""will not be long enough"". LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THREE TIERS:How will the system work? PAY-PACKET SUPPORT:What will I be paid under the new scheme? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? In a letter to residents, Mr Jarvis, who is also the Labour MP for Barnsley Central, said there was light at the end of the tunnel and the restrictions would ""help us reach it sooner, and at a lower cost"". He warned South Yorkshire communities now have some of the highest numbers of cases in the north of England and infection rates are still going up. In Barnsley the infection rate in the seven days to 19 October was 486 cases per 100,000 people, in Sheffield 415, in Rotherham 407 and in Doncaster 393. The average area in England had 117. Mr Jarvis wrote: ""It's tempting to think that because new restrictions are not a silver bullet they are not worth the disruption. ""We don't have the luxury of easy choices.
