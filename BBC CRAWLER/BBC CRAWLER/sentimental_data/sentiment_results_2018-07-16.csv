"A former Conservative cabinet minister hascalled for a second Brexit referendum. Writing in the Times, Justine Greening, who used to be education secretary, argued that another vote would be ""the only way to end deadlock"". But how, in practice, could a second vote happen? The government has ruled out a new Brexit referendum and the Labour party says it's unlikely - although its Shadow Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, says it is sensible to keep ""all our options on the table"" - in the event of Parliament voting down a Brexit deal or in the case of a ""no deal"" scenario. Downing Street said, in response to Ms Greening, that a referendum will not happen""in any circumstances"". So unless there is a dramatic change in party policy, it's highly unlikely a referendum would be called in the first place. That's because a referendum requires an Act of Parliament, which needs to be voted through by the majority of MPs. And while there are vocal supporters on all sides, currently there are not enough MPs who support the idea of a second referendum. Even if MPs and peers agreed in principle to hold a second referendum, the legislative process can be drawn out. Parliament would need to pass detailed rules for the conduct of the poll and the regulation of campaigners. It tookseven months,externalbefore Parliament signed off the previous referendum legislation in 2015. Further time was also needed to pass secondary legislation on areas such as voting registration. In theory, Parliament could copy over some of the legislation from the 2015 Act in order to try to speed the process up. But according to David Jeffery, a politics lecturer at Liverpool University, this might not save a lot of time because issues would still need to be debated and scrutinised by MPs and Lords. Aside from the time to pass the legislation, there's also the length of the campaign to consider. Last time around there was a four-month period between the then Prime Minister David Cameron announcing the referendum in February 2016, and the vote taking place on 23 June. Justine Greening claims a new Brexit referendum would ""end deadlock"" Furthermore, theElectoral Commission has recommended,externalthat in future there should be at least a six-month gap between legislation being passed and a referendum being held. That's to allow enough time to register campaigns, put counting officers in place and give people information on how to vote. So combining the time to pass the legislation and allowing for a campaign, it might not be possible to hold a second referendum before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU in March 2019 (i.e. when the Article 50 process is due to expire). And holding a referendum after the Article 50 process could cause a number of practical problems. For one, what if the country voted to remain in the EU, but had already left by the time the vote was held? This could be avoided if the EU agreed to extend the Article 50 deadline - but this would need to be unanimously agreed by all EU member states. No 10 rejects Greening's referendum call Seven thoughts on a second EU referendum Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? What kind of Brexit do voters want? There's also the referendum question itself and the options on the ballot paper to consider. These need to be presented ""clearly, simply and neutrally"", according to the Electoral Commission. Justine Greening argues for three options: accept a negotiated Brexit deal, stay in the EU, or leave with no deal. David Jeffery says having more than a yes/no option could complicate the process: ""With three options you could have a situation where just 34% decide the winning option. ""And that leads to questions about the type of voting system you want - like choosing the options by preference order,"" he says. ""But then you need to ask 'do the public understand the system and how might it work in such a short period of time?'"" In the end it would be up to the Electoral Commission to assess that question.

"This video can not be played The ways Trump and Putin see eye to eye US President Donald Trump has defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 presidential election. After face-to-face talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Trump contradicted US intelligence agencies and said there had been no reason for Russia to meddle in the vote. Mr Putin reiterated that Russia had never interfered in US affairs. The two men held nearly two hours of closed-door talks in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit At a news conference after the summit, President Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to the allegations of meddling in the elections. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scale of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. In a strongly-worded statement, US House Speaker Paul Ryan said Mr Trump ""must appreciate that Russia is not our ally"". ""There is no moral equivalence between the United States and Russia, which remains hostile to our most basic values and ideals,"" he said, adding that there was ""no question"" Moscow had interfered in the 2016 election.

Some US politicians had called for the summit to be cancelled after12 Russian military intelligence agents were indicted last week, accused of hacking the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Russian woman charged with spying in the US Four intriguing lines in Mueller charges All you need to know about Trump Russia story Speaking on Monday, President Putin offered to allow US investigators to visit Russia to question the officers. He made it clear that, in return, Russia would want similar access to people in the US it suspects of criminal activity. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Before their encounter started, Mr Putin was already winning on points, by the mere fact that President Trump was meeting him in the first place. But while Mr Putin came over as the seasoned professional, eager to present his country as an equivalent to the US in terms of being a nuclear superpower; an energy provider; and a key actor in the Middle East, Mr Trump seemed more intent on castigating his opponents back home. A lot of the questions focused on Russia's intrusion into the US election campaign (the considered position of the key US intelligence agencies) and specifically the indictment by the Mueller probe of 12 Russian intelligence agents. Mr Trump would have none of it. He visibly seemed happier with Mr Putin's assurances than he did with the evidence of his own intelligence agencies. And he even welcomed Mr Putin's suggestion that Russia could join the investigation and interview the alleged perpetrators itself! Washington's Nato allies and many seasoned observers on Capitol Hill must have been watching in horror. Mr Putin described the Helsinki meeting as ""candid and useful"" while Mr Trump said there had been ""deeply productive dialogue"". Mr Trump said US-Russia relations had ""never been worse"" than before they met, but that had now changed. This video can not be played Trump: ""There was nobody to collude with"" Relations between Russia and the West were severely strained by Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014, which President Putin acknowledged in the news conference. ""President Trump's position on Crimea is well known. He talks about the illegality of the Crimean reintegration to Russia. We have another point of view... that a referendum was held in accordance with international law. For us, it's a closed question,"" he said. Both leaders also said they would work together to help resolve the Syrian crisis. The US and Russia back opposing sides in the eight-year-old civil war. On a lighter note, Mr Trump congratulated President Putin on the successful staging of the World Cup football tournament in Russia and Mr Putin responded by giving the US leader a tournament football. The US will co-host the 2026 World Cup with Canada and Mexico. President Trump said he would give the football to his 12-year-old son, Barron How Trump and Putin see eye to eye.

"The government has narrowly avoided a defeat on its Customs Bill after agreeing to Brexiteers' demands to change its wording. It twice survived by just three votes after a backlash from pro-EU Tories who accused Theresa May of ""caving in"" to the party's Eurosceptic MPs. Defence Minister Guto Bebb resigned so he could vote against the government. MPs will carry on debating Brexit on Tuesday when the Trade Bill comes to the Commons. It gives the government the power to build new trade relationships around the world after the UK leaves the EU, and MPs who support staying in the EU's customs union are seeking to change its wording. MP Guto Bebb quits as minister after Brexit vote MPs to vote on early summer recess Brexit: All you need to know Critics said the amendments to the Customs Bill laid down by Eurosceptics on Monday would undermine the UK's recently-announced negotiating position. But Downing Street, which agreed earlier to accept the four amendments, said they were ""consistent"" with the White Paper where it sets out how it wants to trade with the EU in years to come. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. The government, which does not have a Commons majority, has been under pressure from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate. This was underlined on Monday as it first accepted a series of demands from Brexiteers who are unhappy at the proposals in the White Paper, believing it keeps the UK too closely tied to the EU. But this angered MPs from the party's pro-EU wing who refused to back the new amendments, leading to heated exchanges in the House of Commons as the Customs Bill was debated. This video can not be played Anna Soubry criticised colleagues who have a ""gold-plated pension"" and support Brexit Tory MP and Remainer Heidi Allen said she wished the prime minister had ""faced down the amendments."" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What was agreed at Chequers wasn't perfect to us, wasn't perfect to Leavers either, but I think the prime minister had worked exceptionally hard to find a decent first pitch to put to the EU and move forward from that. ""We were all set [on the Remain side] to drop all our amendments and back it, then suddenly we had these rather extreme last minute manoeuvres, which seem to us to deviate the prime minister from her plan and we weren't prepared to do that."" Ms Allen said it was now up to Mrs May to ""pick the side of the economy"". Pro-EU MP Anna Soubry suggested backbench Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg was now ""running Britain"". Another Remainer, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, said the prime minister had, by accepting the amendments, put herself in ""a position of considerable weakness"". Mr Rees-Mogg said the amendments were ""broadly in line"" with government policy, which is why the government accepted them. By 305 votes to 302 - with 14 Tories rebelling - MPs backed an amendment that prevents the UK from collecting taxes on behalf of the EU, unless the rest of the EU does the same for the UK. Applying EU tariffs to products destined for the EU is part of Mrs May's plan to avoid friction at UK borders after Brexit. Another amendment, to ensure the UK is out of the EU's VAT regime, was backed by 303 to 300, with a Tory rebellion of 11. Three Labour MPs voted with the government. The government won several other votes more comfortably, and the entire bill was then approved by the House of Commons by 318 to 285. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg It looks a mess because it is a mess. It's getting harder and harder for the prime minister to get things through Parliament - and while calls for a second referendum are widely rejected, that sentiment could change if this kind of gridlock continues. The PM has spent the last two years trying to compromise. She has a divided party and no majority. There are no easy choices. But the divisions in the Tory party are daily reducing her room for manoeuvre. In a debate about principle, the problem for some is that compromise is a dirty word. Read Laura's blog The three Labour MPs who rebelled against their party whip by voting with the government were Frank Field, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer - all of whom are pro-Brexit. Former Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins who now sits as an independent also supported the government on one of the amendments. The Conservative rebels were the long-time pro-EU MP Ken Clarke, Heidi Allen, Guto Bebb, Richard Benyon, Jonathan Djanogly, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Hammond, Philip Lee, Nicky Morgan, Robert Neill, Mark Pawsey, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler said the one priority the EU has is making sure it gets a deal, rather than a ""cliff edge"" Brexit. She told Today: ""They are following all the ins and outs, and all the turbulence, in UK politics extremely carefully. ""[But] they are wondering if the prime minister - or anyone who could or might take over from her - would even have the political strength to get a deal agreed here in Brussels, then passed by parliament back home."" Adler said the ""normally outspoken EU leaders"" are keeping quiet as they don't want to ""put their oar in right now and risk blowing the whole thing up"". The new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is due in Brussels on Thursday to continue negotiations and the EU wants to engage, she added. ""All my EU sources say they want to engage constructively with the whitepaper and avoid giving the impression that it is dead on arrival. ""But importantly, as everyone knows, time for negotiation is running short. They want to complete the withdrawal agreement.""

"The Helsinki summit between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump is over, and after nearly two hours behind closed doors and another hour in front of the press, there's plenty of material to sort through. Leading into the meeting, Democrats were warning Mr Trump to be careful in dealing with his Russian counterpart - with some suggesting that it was unwise for the US president to even hold such an event, given Friday's indictments of 12 Russian military officers for conducting cyber-warfare against the US during the 2016 elections. Trump under fire after Putin meeting Russian praise for Putin after Trump summit Trump-Putin: Toolkit to help understand the story Many Republicans, on the other hand, were cautiously optimistic that the president would push back against Mr Putin on a range of issues. Congressman Steve Scalise, a Republican house leader,said,externalthat Mr Trump entered into the negotiations ""from a position of American strength to combat Russian aggression"". Things went â¦ a bit differently. Here are some key takeaways. Mr Trump, in his first question from an American reporter, was pressed to explain why earlier in the dayhe had tweeted out,externalthat US was to blame for the current tense state of US-Russia relations. In his answer, he stood by his earlier comments and said he held ""both countries responsible"". He said both sides had ""made some mistakes"" - but declined to specifically mention items like the Russian military involvement in Ukraine and its annexation of Crimea, the Novichok chemical attack in southern England and the indictment of Russians for meddling in the US election. This video can not be played The ways Trump and Putin see eye to eye Instead, he insisted there was ""no collusion at all"" between his campaign and Russia, conflating charges of election meddling - for which there have been indictments of Russian nationals - with evidence of collusion, which the Mueller probe has not yet alleged. When asked if he would directly condemn Russia and Mr Putin on election meddling, Mr Trump said his intelligence officials - including Director of Intelligence Dan Coats - have told him ""they think it's Russia"". Mr Putin, he continued, just told him it's not Russia. ""I don't see any reason why it would be,"" Mr Trump concluded, apparently leaning toward the Russian professions of innocence over the conclusions of his own government. This has put the US intelligence community in a familiar bind, given Mr Trump's past criticisms. It's a bind, however, for which Trump-appointed leaders, in office for more than a year, are now accountable. Mr Coats has issued a statement saying his intelligence community stands by its ""fact-based assessments"" of Russian meddling and their ""ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy"". Later on Monday, the president made an effort, via Twitter, to smooth over ruffled feathers. Mr Mueller has indicted more than two dozen Russians, but Mr Trump still isn't convinced that they're to blame - raising instead questions about the security of Democratic computer servers and FBI bias. The Trump Justice Department, and Mr Mueller's special counsel team, will grind on - Monday afternoon'sannouncement of a Russian woman indicted for being an undisclosed foreign operativeis evidence of that. But Mr Trump's campaign to discredit their work will also continue undeterred. Not surprisingly, Mr Trump's performance was greeted with a mix of condemnation and derision from the left. Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it a ""shameful performance"" that was ""thoughtless, dangerous and weak"". John Brennan, director of the CIA under Barack Obama, said Mr Trump was guilty of treason. Meanwhile, never-Trump conservatives were quick with ""I told you so-s"". Political consultant (and Jeb Bush advisor) Mike Murphycalled it,externala ""dark day"", after tweeting a string of invective. Former 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain said it was ""one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory"". ""The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate,"" the Arizona Republican senator, and chair of the Armed Services committee, wrote in a statement. ""But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake."" Perhaps most noteworthy is how Mr Trump is being seen among Republicans who are - or were becoming - more sympathetic to Mr Trump. Abby Huntsman, a conservative commentator and daughter of US ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman,tweeted,externalthat ""no negotiation is worth throwing your own people and country under the bus"". Newt Gingrich called Mr Trump's statements on intelligence agencies ""the most serious mistake of his presidency"". Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who swings between Trump critic and Trump confidante, was back in the former camp,calling the summit,externala ""missed opportunity"", a ""bad day for the US"" that will be sign of weakness to Russia. New York Post columnist Karol Markowicz, who several months ago had written about how pro- and anti-Trump conservatives had to dial back their rhetoric, was blunt. ""You can love Trump, you can be thrilled he vanquished Hillary, you can be right that Obama's foreign policy was clownish, but call it here: this was atrocious and no American president should ever behave this way."" The Drudge Report had a headline blaring that ""Putin dominates"" the summit. Even on the Fox News cable networks, which are normally Trump's biggest defender and echo chamber, commentators appeared uneasy. Neil Cavuto called the president's performance ""disgraceful"" and said it ""sets us back a lot"". ""There is a growing consensus across the land tonight ... that the president threw the United States under the bus,"" said Fox News White House correspondent John Roberts. Mary Kissel, a member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board, told Fox News audience that ""nothing was achieved"" from the summit. ""The president came off as wanting to have more meetings and going to Putin and asking for Putin's help, when we should be in the position of Putin coming to us and asking us to ease up on him,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, President Putin scored a great propaganda victory."" This could all blow over, of course. With domestic political battles on the horizon - a Supreme Court confirmation and mid-term election contests - the partisan battle lines could quickly re-form. For a moment, however, there was a hint of doubt and concern and the possibility that, at some point in the future, when political expediency is no longer paramount, Mr Trump could face more significant dissention within his ranks. This isn't how Mr Trump and his supporters see it. For them, the summit should be framed as the beginning of a larger effort to repair relations between the world's two largest nuclear powers. ""From the earliest days of our republic, American leaders have understood that diplomacy and engagement is preferable to conflict and hostility,"" he said. Mr Putin echoed those sentiments, calling the summit the ""first important step"". With no tangible results from the summit, the two leaders are framing this as the first of many meetings to come Given the American reaction from across the political spectrum, however, future meetings may be difficult to pull off. After a week abroad, Mr Trump on Monday delivered the coup de grace for what has been a highly disruptive week in US foreign affairs. European allies are uneasy. US-Russia relations are uncertain. And the US political world - and even the White House's own communications team - is unsettled. What comes next? That's unknown.

"Guto Bebb was elected MP for Aberconwy in May 2010 A Welsh Conservative MP has quit as a minister in anger at concessions being given to Brexiteers by Theresa May. Guto Bebb resigned as minister for defence procurement in order to vote against the government on amendments it accepted to its Brexit Customs Bill. MPs voted 305 to 302 on Monday to back a changeRemainers said would undermine Mrs May's negotiating position. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he was ""very sorry"" the Aberconwy MP felt he had to resign over the issue. Mr Bebb had staunchly defended the prime minister amid the turmoil which has followed the unveiling of her blueprint for post-Brexit relations with the EU. He brandedBoris Johnson's resignation as foreign secretary ""a selfish act""andattacked former Brexit Minister David Jonesfor criticising Mrs May's plan. Government scrapes through EU customs votes Airbus Brexit remarks criticised Brexit: All you need to know Mr Cairns told BBC Radio Wales he was ""going to miss"" Mr Bebb, who had served under him as a junior Wales Office minister. Speaking onGood Morning Wales, he said: ""Guto was an excellent minister and a close colleague and a good friend. ""I'm very sorry that he felt in order to vote last night that he needed to leave the government."" Alun Cairns and Guto Bebb had served together in the Wales Office Glyn Davies, Conservative MP for Montgomeryshire, said: ""I am very upset that Guto has felt the need to resign from the government. He is a good friend and was an outstanding minister. ""Guto is a man of deep principle. He is such a talented politician that I cannot believe he will not find another important role in the future."" Leave campaigner and Monmouth Conservative MP David Davies said he was ""sad to see him go"", adding: ""He's a friend and he was doing a really good job in the MoD [Ministry of Defence]. ""Guto is strong-minded though and in some ways I'm not surprised."" Mr Bebb was appointed minister for defence procurement in January 2018 after serving as parliamentary under secretary of state at the Wales Office and a government whip from March 2016. He was elected MP for Aberconwy in May 2010 and voted Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.

Clwyd West MP David Jones - a former Brexit minister and Welsh secretary who led the Vote Leave campaign in Wales - said the government was right to listen to its Brexiteer critics but believed ""a lot more listening"" needed to be done. Guto Bebb voted Remain in the Brexit referendum and it was no secret he had become increasingly frustrated by the actions of some of the Brexiteers in his party. He accused former Brexit Minister David Jones of sour grapes after he criticised the prime minister's plan for future trade with the EU. He also attacked senior cabinet ministers for ""inflammatory"" and ""unworthy"" comments after then-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said threats from business over Brexit were ""inappropriate"". But after a string of resignations by Brexiteers, Guto Bebb's decision to leave a job he obviously enjoyed has surprised many.

"When US President Joe Biden meets hisRussian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland on Wednesday, their names will enter into the pages of a long history of talks between leaders of the two powers. Here we look back at some of the summits that preceded this one. A meeting of US President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Geneva in 1985 led to a thawing of relations President John F Kennedy met Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in 1961. The talks were dominated by the crisis in Berlin and control over the divided city. For Kennedy, it was a bruising, unexpectedly hostile encounter at which he felt outmatched by his Soviet counterpart. ""Worst thing in my life,"" the president told a New York Times reporter after the talks. ""He savaged me."" The Berlin Wall went up in the months after the talks and the following year the two superpowers locked horns over the Cuban missile crisis. John F Kennedy was furious with himself after his meeting with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev In May 1972, President Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev met in Moscow for their first summit, which produced what appeared to be a good working relationship between the two leaders and a historic arms treaty setting limits to the rapidly expanding nuclear arsenals of both powers. Nixon invited Brezhnev to Washington the following year, and the pair signed nuclear arms control treaties at three successive summits. Richard Nixon met Leonid Brezhnev, who was the Soviet premier for 18 years In November 1974, Nixon's successor Gerald Ford met Brezhnev for the first time in the Russian city of Vladivostok. Relations between the pair were warm despite the extreme cold. They discussed American football and football which they had respectively played as younger men, and joked together. Ford had come wearing a wolfskin coat from Alaska. ""I'm a sheep in wolf's clothing,"" he joked to reporters. ""I told the first secretary. I'm going to get him one."" Brezhnev then tried on the coat and modelled it for photographers. Gerald Ford with Brezhnev, who often kept to the traditional socialist greeting of kisses Brezhnev tries on Ford's Alaskan wolfskin coat for the cameras The pair met again the following year in Helsinki - the first of several US-Russian summits that would take place in the Finnish capital - for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. Leaders from 35 nations signed the Helsinki accords - a declaration which called for respect for human rights and for the inviolability of European borders. It was among the most significant moments of the Cold War, but Ford faced criticism at home for what was seen by some as a concession to the Soviets and a legitimisation of Soviet oppression in Eastern Europe. Jan Lodal, a member of Ford's policy team at the summit,later wrote in the Atlantic,externalthat Brezhnev had secretly told Ford that the Soviets supported his re-election and would ""do everything we can to make that happen"". It would turn out to be a strange foreshadowing of the build up to another US presidential election, 41 years later. Brezhnev (r) had a ""Slavic love of physical contact"", including bear hugs, US memos for Ford (l) revealed Towards the end of the Cold War, in December 1987, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met in Washington DC, where the two nations once again engaged on the issue of controlling nuclear arms stockpiles and testing. They signed the INF Treaty - an accord banning intermediate-range nuclear missiles which led to the destruction of 2,692 missiles by 1991. General Secretary Gorbachev and President Reagan are widely credited for ending the Cold War era Then in 2017, shortly before the INF Treaty's 30-year anniversary, President Donald Trump accused Russian leader Vladimir Putin of violating the pact by testing and deploying a ground-launched intermediate-range cruise missile, calling it a ""big deal"". Moscow responded by accusing the US of violating the treaty. President George HW Bush met Mr Gorbachev seven times. By the time they met for their third summit, in Helsinki in September 1990, they had established a warm working relationship based on hours of discussions, often without advisers. Mr Bush was hoping to shore up support from Mr Gorbachev in dealing with aggression by the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who had weeks earlier invaded Kuwait. Mr Gorbachev arrived at the summit with a gift for Mr Bush - a framed cartoon depicting the two leaders as boxers, both standing in a victory stance, having knocked out a prone figure labelled ""Cold War"" in Russian. Mr Gorbachev presents Mr Bush with a cartoon to commemorate the end of the Cold War President Bill Clinton met Russian leader Boris Yeltsin in Helsinki in March 1997 for talks viewed as some of the most crucial between the US and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Relations had been strained by an eastward expansion of Nato to include former Soviet bloc nations. Yeltsin made it clear at the summit that he objected to Nato enlargement, but agreed to negotiate a pact with the alliance. The pair also agreed to a sharp reduction in their respective nuclear arsenals. Bill Clinton doubled over with laughter in a press conference when Boris Yeltsin called the US media ""a disaster"" US-Russia relations steadily worsened under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, a former Russian intelligence official who became president in 2000. George W Bush, who became US president a year later, attempted to bring Mr Putin on side but the pair's relationship slowly soured over the eight years Mr Bush was in office. ""I think Putin is not a democrat anymore,"" he told the visiting prime minister of Slovenia in 2006. ""He's a tsar. I think we've lost him."" President Barack Obama noted the ""extraordinary work"" Mr Putin had done for Russia When Barack Obama became US president in 2009, he tried a new strategy of going around Mr Putin. The Russian leader had stepped aside to comply with Russia's two-term presidential limit, installing Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Mr Obama did travel to Moscow to meet Mr Putin in 2009, and again at a Mexican G20 summit in 2012. On the second occasion, Mr Putin showed up late for the meeting, which focused on the prospects of peace settlement in Syria. But President Obama attempted to develop a relationship with Mr Medvedev. In 2009, Mr Obama dispatched his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to meet her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov with the goal of re-setting US-Russia relations. She even went armed with a toy button labelled ""reset"" in English and Russian, only for it to be revealed that the Russian word they'd used in fact meant ""overload"". Don't forget the reset button The reset was about as effective as the toy button Russia later pointedly refused US demands for them to extradite the whistleblower Edward Snowden. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to Moscow and distanced himself from Mr Putin. Then in 2014 Russia annexed Crimea, breaking for the first time the Helsinki Accord signed by Ford and Brezhnev in 1975 and heaping international opprobrium and sanctions on itself. President Obama criticised Mr Putin, but made it clear he had no intention of entering into any kind of conflict. ""This is not another cold war that we're entering into,"" he said. ""Now is not the time for bluster â¦ There are no easy answers, no military solution."" The two leaders met with only translators as witnesses When Mr Trump became president in 2016, the US once again sought a reset. A 16 July summit in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, was arranged with US-Russia relations under a heavy raincloud. US intelligence agencies unanimously concluded that Russia conducted a cyber operation to influence the outcome of the US presidential election in 2016. A special counsel was tasked with investigating the alleged Russian interference and if Mr Trump's campaign was complicit. A report released by the special counsel in April 2019 concluded that Mr Trump's campaign team did not collude with Russia to influence the election. In a news conference, President Trump defended Russia over the claims. He contradicted US intelligence agencies by suggesting Russia had no reason to meddle in the election. This video can not be played Trump: ""There was nobody to collude with"" Mr Trump also blamed poor relations with Russia on past US administrations rather than actions taken by President Putin's government. In the wake of the summit, Mr Trump faced a barrage of criticism from both sides of the US political divide for his defence of Russia. In the end, Mr Putin said the ball was in Mr Trump's court, and gifted the US president a World Cup football. President Trump said he would give the football to his 12-year-old son, Barron .

GTR said it was ""too early to say"" if the new timetable was causing problems. Earlier on Monday, it said: ""Our focus is on the evening peak and rest of the week as we introduce the new interim timetable."" GTR, which oversees Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern routes, changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May, which saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning. In ahalf-page newspaper advert, initially placed in the Metro newspaper and since replicated in local papers, it apologised and acknowledged it ""failed to launch new services as planned"" which has resulted in ""significant delays, cancellations and disruption"". A letter published in newspapers said the company apologised ""sincerely and unreservedly"" An interim timetable introduced on 4 June to improve performance saw about 6% of daily services removed, but reliability has continued to struggle. The operator said the changes would mean a 13% increase in services across the GTR network, 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London, creating space for 50,000 extra passengers at peak times. Its website said the timetable would continue to evolve over time. ""Once this interim timetable is bedded in, we will look to introduce more services to complete the intended May 2018 timetable,"" it said. A series of failures have been blamedfor causing the chaos, including Network Rail's late approval of the new timetables and delayed electrification projects Poor planning by train operatorshas also been blamed, and the decision by transport ministers to phase in the introduction of new GTR services The damaging impact of the new train timetable was demonstrated inpunctuality figures published by Network Rail on Monday GTR chief executiveCharles Horton resignedlast month Last week in the House of Commons, the government warned improvements to GTR services were ""simply not happening quickly enough"" and the train operator risks losing its franchise. Standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Cabinet Office minister and Aylesbury MP David Lidington said: ""We have launched a review of Govia Thameslink which will report in the next few weeks, and if those findings show that Govia is at fault we won't hesitate to take action whether that's fines, restricting access to future franchises or stripping them of the franchise. ""Passengers deserve far better than they're getting at the moment in terms of service and we will hold those operators to account.""

"Google says the new service will benefit job hunters and employers Google has secured several of the UK's largest recruitment services for a local version of its jobs-hunting tool. Reed, Guardian Jobs, Haymarket and Totaljobs.com are among those providing listings, in addition to global sites such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor. The facility automatically shows,externalthe ""freshest and most relevant"" openings based on a user's location when they type relevant terms into Google Search. But one expert said those involved might come to regret the tie-up. For now, the US tech giant is not charging employment sites to feature their listings nor using the service to place any extra adverts beyond those that normally appear within its results. Google lets users search for recent vacancies across a wide range of sites simultaneously In addition, applicants must still click through to the individual third-party jobs platforms to apply for a post. But one industry-watcher suggested this arrangement could change. ""Google is a behemoth of search, it controls the gateway to the internet - so I can understand why others feel they have to be part of its jobs service,"" commented Robert Jeffrey, editor of People Management magazine. ""But undoubtedly it will start charging for placement and other premium services. ""And for third-party sites that represents a risk."" The Google For Jobs service already exists in the US, Spain and parts of Africa, where the firm claims to have already connected millions of people to new job opportunities. In addition to the larger listing sites, Google has also partnered with thousands of smaller specialist platforms. The Google For Jobs service is triggered by relevant queries within its main search facility ""What job seekers get is the ability to find jobs from all over the internet,"" product manager Joy Xi explained. ""What the employers get is easier discoverability."" She added that there were also other advantages over individual sites. For example, Ms Xi said Google's ""search smarts"" meant applicants would not have to carry out multiple searches to find similar posts listed under different titles - for example: programmer, software engineer and developer. In addition, she said, the firm's Maps data had been referenced to let users see how long it would take to commute to each post. Even so, one major vacancies site is refusing to share its data - Indeed. The 14-year-old firm also acts as a listings aggregator and claims to be the world's most popular jobs hunt service with more than 200 million unique visitors a month. US-based Indeed is a subsidiary of Japan's Recruit Holdings ""At this time, Indeed has decided not to partner because we feel that's the best decision for jobseekers,"" its marketing chief Paul D'Arcy told the BBC. ""Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate this and other partnerships."" Indeed's recent efforts to maintain its lead include the acquisition of the CV-building service Resume.com, and launch of new tools for employers to help them tackle any hiring biases. However, its decision to avoid the new service means links to Indeed pages now appear further down Google's results pages. ""Indeed is the biggest in the market at the moment, and it may feel like it's got the most to lose by getting into bed with Google,"" said Mr Jeffrey. ""But it's a brave move.""

"Netflix's The Crown received 13 Emmy nominations this year Netflix shares plunged by more than 14% in after-hours trade on Monday, after the firm reported disappointing subscriber growth. Netflix said it added 5.2 million subscribers in the three months to the end of June, the same number it did during the period last year. The streaming service had forecast growth of 6.2 million. The decline in share price follows a successful run for the stock, which had roughly doubled so far this year. The firm's shares ended Monday's trading session at about $400, but tumbled by 14% after the market closed as investors digested the firm's quarterly results. Investors are worried about Netflix's growth potential in the face of increased competition from tech giants such as Apple, YouTube and Amazon, as well as traditional firms, which have started to invest more in online streaming. Disney, for example, plans to launch its own streaming service and stop licensing some of its material to Netflix. Why is Disney buying Fox? 6 Things we learned from the Emmy nominations Netflix acknowledged the challenges, but said its strategy is to ""keep improving"". ""We believe that consumer appetite for great content is broad and that there is room for multiple parties to have attractive offerings,"" it said. In a letter to investors, Netflix called it a ""strong but not stellar quarter"", ending with about 130 million subscribers globally. The firm added just 670,000 subscribers in the US - far short of the more than one million it added in the second quarter of 2017. It added 4.5 million subscribers internationally, fewer than the two most recent quarters but up 8% year-on-year. However, it said its finances were strong. The company reported $3.9bn in quarterly revenue, up 40% compared to the second quarter of 2017. Profits totalled $384.3m, almost six times the figure during the same period a year ago. Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco In its note to investors, Netflix pointed out a landmark achievement ahead of this year's Emmy's - it had, for the first time, earned more nominations than rival HBO. A huge stamp of approval for the firm's original content. But critical acclaim is worthless to Netflix unless it translates into booming business. Growth is the only metric that really matters to the firm's investors, and so this is a big miss - reflected in the stock price tanking on Monday. However, investors might be wise to not lose their heads - this disappointing earnings report comes off the back of two extremely strong quarters of comfortably beating expectations on adding subscribers. Netflix said its strategy will be to ""simply keep improving"" as more players start to step up their efforts to muscle in on its turf.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) will create as many jobs in the UK as it will displace over the next 20 years, a report has said. The analysis, by accountancy giant PwC, found AI would boost economic growth, creating new roles as others fell away. But it warned there would be ""winners and losers"" by industry sector, with many jobs likely to change. Opinion is split over AI's potential impact, with some warning it could leave many out of work in future. The pessimists argue AI is different to previous forms of technological change, because robots and algorithms will be able to do intellectual as well as routine physical tasks. Northern jobs 'most at risk from robots' Automation 'puts half of NI jobs at risk' However, John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Major new technologies, from steam engines to computers, displace some existing jobs but also generate large productivity gains. ""This reduces prices and increases real income and spending levels, which in turn creates demand for additional workers. ""Our analysis suggests the same will be true of AI, robots and related technologies, but the distribution of jobs across sectors will shift considerably in the process."" PwC said about seven million existing jobs could be displaced by AI from 2017-2037, but about 7.2 million could be created, giving the UK a small net jobs boost of around 200,000. Some sectors would benefit disproportionately, however, with jobs in health increasing by 22%, scientific and technical services by 16% and education by 6%. By contrast manufacturing jobs could fall by 25%, transport and storage by 22% and public administration by 18%, PwC said. ""As our analysis shows, there will be winners and losers,"" said Euan Cameron, PwC's AI lead in the UK. ""It's likely that the fourth industrial revolution will favour those with strong digital skills, as well as capabilities like creativity and teamwork which machines find it harder to replicate."" A growing body of research claims the impact of AI automation will be less damaging than previously thought. In April, the OECD criticisedan influential 2013 forecast by Oxford University,externalthat found about 47% of jobs in the US in 2010 and 35% in the UK were at ""high risk"" of being automated over the following 20 years. The OECD instead put the US figureat about 10% and the UK's at 12%- although it did suggest many more workers would see their tasks changing significantly.

"Should we or shouldn't we be allowed to modify human DNA in future children? An inquiry into the ethical issues surrounding genetically altering a human embryo has found there is ""no absolute reason not to pursue it"". But appropriate measures must be put in place before it becomes UK law, said the report - which calls for further research both medically and socially. Inquiry chair, Prof Karen Yeung, said: ""The implications for society are extensive, profound and long-term."" The use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans is currently prohibited by UK law, but ispermitted in some research. Scientists can do gene editing on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards, for example. Heritable genome editing could be used to wipe out genetic diseases in certain families by deleting or permanently changing any troublesome code in embryos, or the sperm and egg. But the field is attracting controversy over concerns it is opening the door to designer babies. Commenting on the Nuffield Council of Bioethics' review of genome editing, Dr David King, Director of Human Genetics Alert, said: ""This is an absolute disgrace. We have had international bans on eugenic genetic engineering for 30 years. But this group of scientists thinks it knows better, even though there is absolutely no medical benefit to this whatever. The Nuffield Council doesn't even bother to say no to outright designer babies.  The people of Britain decided 15 years ago that they don't want GM food. Do you suppose they want GM babies?"" This video can not be played Fergus Walsh reports on the science that could create designer human beings The independent inquiry by the Nuffield Council concludes that any invention should be guided by two key principles: the welfare of the future individual the welfare of society The Council stated that the use of heritable genome editing ""should not increase disadvantage, discrimination or division in society"". Sally Philips: A World Without Down's Syndrome First gene editing in human body attempt Director of the Nuffield Council Hugh Whittall said consideration needed to be given to groups whose conditions might be ""edited out"" of the population by the removal of a genetic variant. The Council have called for a broad and inclusive societal debate, with as many voices as possible heard. CRISPR, a biological system for altering DNA, was discovered in 2012. It can be used by scientists to make precise changes to DNA. CRISPR scans the genome looking for the right location and then uses the Cas9 protein as molecular scissors to snip through the DNA. Scientists have been using it in the labto target and cut out faulty DNA in human cells that cause illnesses. While effective, the process is less than perfect and can cut out too much DNA, experts have found. These unwanted or 'off-target' edits could, theoretically, alter other important genes - inadvertently triggering cancer, for example. In the near future, it might be possible to correct the DNA of embryos carrying the gene for Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis. But arguably, the most controversial aspect of gene editing concerns the potential to introduce changes to the germline - DNA alterations that would pass down the generations. The Council also recommended further research to be carried out ""to establish standards of clinical safety"". A recent study,externalby scientists at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, suggests the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can cause greater genetic damage in cells than previously thought, and advised gene therapy scientists to proceed ""with caution"". Speaking to reporters on Monday, members of the Nuffield Council working group were clear that the science still had ""some way to go"" and said it could be up to 20 years before heritable genome editing becomes a feasible option. ""It is important to stress that there is still great uncertainty over what genome editing may be able to achieve,"" said Prof Yeung, Professor of Law, Ethics and Informatics at the University of Birmingham. Even once legalised, the Council have recommended genome editing should only be licensed on a case-by-case basis and under strict regulation and monitoring. ""No change will happen overnight,"" said Mr Whittall ""This report is not a full stop. It plays into an ongoing - and international - discussion.""

"Harry Uzoka died outside his home in Shepherd's Bush A male model was knifed to death by another model who was ""not as successful"" as him in a row over a girl, a court has heard. Harry Uzoka, 25, died on the pavement outside his home in Shepherd's Bush, west London, after he was stabbed. The killing was the result of an argument between the victim and George Koh over Mr Uzoka's girlfriend, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Koh, 24, of York Way in Camden, denies murder. The Old Bailey was told Mr Uzoka called Mr Koh ""a fake"" on Instagram and arranged a fight after finding out Mr Koh claimed to have slept with Mr Uzoka's model girlfriend Ruby Campbell. Harry Uzoka arranged the fight after George Koh claimed he had slept with his girlfriend The jury was told a ""confrontation"" was arranged in Ollgar Road in Shepherd's Bush following a series of phone calls and messages on WhatsApp and Instagram. Mr Koh was joined by Merse Dikanda and Jonathan Okigbo, both 24, and Mr Uzoka recruited his flatmate Adrian Harper, the court was told. But while Mr Uzoka and his companion came armed with dumbbell bars, Mr Koh's group took at least three knives, including a machete, the court heard. ""It is not difficult to work out which side won. Uzoka and Harper were outnumbered and bars stand little chance against knives,"" prosecutor Richard Horwell QC told the hearing on Monday. Mr Koh's team set out to ""cause serious injury"", he said. Mr Uzoka and Mr Harper ran off when realised they were confronted with knives, but only Mr Harper got away, the court heard. The prosecutor told the court Mr Koh, who ""was also a model but not as successful as Uzoka"", had ""something of an obsession"" with Mr Uzoka, but that ""admiration for another model and his success had turned to contempt"". Jurors were told Mr Koh tried to delete his account and asked his mobile phone company to change his number. Three days after the stabbing, Mr Koh handed himself in to police and told officers that he had acted in self defence after being ""knocked to the ground"" by Mr Uzoka and ""had no intention"" to stab him in the chest. In a prepared statement, he told police: ""I feared that he would kill me or cause me serious injury. ""I was on the floor when he fell on to me. I maintain that my actions were reasonable given the circumstances."" The jury was told Mr Koh has pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing a knife. Mr Okigbo, from Camden in north London, denies murder. Mr Dikanda, of no fixed address, denies murder, possessing a machete on 11 January and possessing a knife on 25 January. The trial continues.

"The number of people moving to the UK from EU countries was the lowest it has been for nearly four years in 2017. But there was a rise in those coming from outside the EU, the Office for National Statistics said, with net migration the highest since 2011. Overall net migration, the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK for at least 12 months and those emigrating, was 282,000. The government wants to cut overall net migration to the tens of thousands. The ONS data,externalis for the first full calendar year since the Brexit vote. While the overall net migration was up by 33,000 on the previous year, statisticians said the figure was ""broadly stable"". UK 'will lose track of many EU migrants' This video can not be played BBC examines the statistics of migration over decades across the world The ONS figures showed there were 101,000 net migrants from the EU last year and 227,000 from outside the EU. There was also a record number of EU citizens emigrating from the UK, with an estimated 139,000 leaving in 2017. The only other year when the EU emigration figures came close to that level was in 2008 when 134,000 EU nationals left the UK. The migration report also showed: Net migration from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 - Poland, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia and Latvia - has fallen from 42,000 in the year before the referendum to 6,000 in 2017 Net migration from 14 longer-term member states such as Germany, Italy, Spain and France, has almost halved since the vote, falling from 84,000 in the 12 months to June 2016 to 46,000 last year An estimated 40,000 more Romanians and Bulgarians migrated to the UK than left last year - the joint lowest net migration figure for the two countries since the year to September 2014 The number of EU citizens coming to the UK ""looking for work"" decreased by a third (33%) from 55,000 in 2016 to 37,000 in the last year. Meanwhile, those coming to the UK for a definite job remained stable, the ONS said. ""What these statistics show is that more of the people who are coming to the UK are coming for the reasons we would want - to take up a definite job or to study,"" immigration minister Caroline Noakes said. While net migration is continuing to add to the UK population, the 2017 figure of 282,000 is down from record highs recorded in 2015 and early 2016. It is the highest for 18 months, however - and still well above the government target of less than 100,000. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Last year, 240,000 people from European Union countries came to live in Britain. The number of EU migrants has been falling since June 2016 - the month of the referendum - and is now at a similar level to mid-2014. At the same time, emigration of EU nationals from Britain has been steadily increasing and at 139,000 is the highest level on record. The EU emigration figures are a function of the number of EU nationals living in Britain; there are some 3.5 million in the country, so it's to be expected that departure levels are higher now than in the 1970s, '80s and '90s. Nevertheless, the fact they've risen so sharply would appear to be further evidence of the impact of the Brexit vote. As for migration from countries outside Europe, 311,000 people arrived in the UK last year - back to levels last seen in 2011. It suggests that even if the government takes greater control of EU migration after Brexit, the challenge of getting the right level of immigration from outside Europe remains. Emigration has shown a gradual increase since 2015 and is currently around 350,000, the ONS said. Immigration has stayed roughly stable at about 630,000, the report showed. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the new figures were ""very disappointing"", adding: ""It's time for the government to get serious about reducing immigration instead of caving into every demand of the immigration lobby."" Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the data suggests the UK is ""still an attractive country, but its allure for EU migrants has declined considerably over the past couple of years"". Shadow home secretary Diana Abbott said it was ""clear to almost everyone except Theresa May that the net migration target should go"". But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We remain committed to bringing net migration down to sustainable levels, and that is the tens of thousands.""

"Clooney made his name on TV series ER before turning to films George Clooney made more money last year than any actor across a 12-month period - thanks in part to the sale of the tequila company he co-founded. Forbes estimates the 57-year-old star made $239m (Â£180m) in pre-tax earnings in the year beginning 1 June 2017. That puts him second in itsannual list of the world's best-paid celebrities,external, a place behind boxer Floyd Mayweather. Kylie Jenner is placed third in the Celebrity 100 countdown, having made an estimated $166.5m (Â£125.5m) last year. Earlier this month Forbes said the social media star was on track to become ""the youngest-ever self-made billionaire"". U2, and British acts Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are also included in a top 10 alongside global football stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. The Celebrity 100 list ranks ""front of the camera"" stars around the globe using their estimated pre-tax earnings from 1 June 2017 to 1 June 2018. Of the 100 top-earning celebrities, just 15 were women - down one compared with last year's list. Times are pretty good for those who made it to this year's list: the world's 100 top-earning celebrities pulled in a combined $6.3bn (Â£4.8bn) over the past 12 months - up 22% from last year. Eleven superstars now cross the $100m (Â£75.6m) threshold - more than double the number from the last two years combined. Here's the top 10: Money Mayweather earned $285m in pre-tax annual earnings last year, and in doing so captured the top spot on Forbes' 20th annual ranking of the world's 100 highest-paid celebrities. The boxer's August 2017 fight versus Conor McGregor generated more than $550m (Â£415m) in revenue, with the fighter pocketing $275m of that. This is Mayweather's second number one spot on the Forbes list - the other was in 2015. Clooney's mammoth payday comes from the sale of his Casamigos tequila company to drinks giant Diageo in a deal worth $1bn (Â£753m). The star, who was recently injuredin a motorbike accident in Sardinia, founded the company in 2013 with friends Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman. Fashion guru Jenner is the youngest member of the Kardashian clan The youngest of the Kardashian sisters, Kylie Jenner has earned her place at number three after founding a cosmetics empire. A family reality show and 110 million followers on social media has also done its bit to help.  Forbes magazine saysKylie is now worth almost three times as much as her sister, Kim,at an estimated $900m (Â£680m) and is on her way to becoming the youngest self-made US billionaire. The 20-year old was a newcomer on the list last year, but has since had quite a significant jump up from 2017's 59th place. Judy Sheindlin speaking in 2017 Judy Sheindlin, AKA Judge Judy, comes fourth in the countdown with estimated earnings of $147m (Â£110m). Judge Judy's been on the air for 22 series and is watched by an average of more than 10 million viewers a day. She sold the rights to her extensive library for an estimated $100m (Â£75m) in 2017, which accounts for this year's high listing. Dwayne Johnson can currently be seen in action blockbuster Skyscraper Dwayne Johnson, the wrestler turned actor also known as 'The Rock', is ranked fifth with an estimated pre-tax tally of $124m (Â£93.4m). The 46-year-old's acting-related earnings - the vast majority of his $124m haul - are the largest ever recorded in the 20 years Forbes has tracked the Celebrity 100. Allow Twitter content?

Bono performing at New York's Madison Square Gardens last month U2's Joshua Tree world tour in 2017 - followed closely by a second current world tour - has seen the Irish band's earnings jump up considerably. 2.7 million fans turned out to mark the band's 30th anniversary of their seminal album - making it the most lucrative outing for any artist last year. Coldplay's Chris Martin has plenty of cause for celebration with the publication of the Forbes list Coldplay are the first British act on the list. Putting them there was their A Head Full Of Dreams Tour, which grossed more than half a billion dollars (Â£377m) in its two-year, five-continent run. That total means Coldplay trails only U2's 360 Tour and The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour on the list of all-time highest grossing tours. Lionel Messi's eighth position beat his country's last 16 world cup result In November 2017, Messi agreed a contract extension with his club Barcelona that will pay him an annual salary and bonus in excess of $80m (Â£60m), making him the highest-paid footballer. Add to that a lifelong deal with Adidas and other sponsorship contracts, including Gatorade, Pepsi, Ooredoo, Huawei and Hawkers, and things are looking pretty tidy for Leo. A theme park based on the Argentinian, the Messi Experience Park, is set to open in 2020 in the Chinese city of Nanjing. Sheeran is the world's highest-earning solo musician on the list. The 27-year old was the world's most streamed artist of 2017. His album Ã· was the biggest album of the year, racking up 3.1 billion streams around the world, while Shape of You became Spotify's biggest track of all time. He was one of the World Cup's top scorers, and this year also received his fifth Ballon d'Or. Having spent a lucrative nine years at Real Madrid, the football star made a Â£99.2m move to Italian side Juventus earlier this month. His lifetime contract with Nike is worth upward of $1bn (Â£754m). Kim launched the KKW Beauty range in 2017 Many of this year's best-paid celebrities have monetised their strong social media presence, and in doing so, have shot up the rankings of the top 100. Speaking to BBC News, Zack Greenburg, Forbes senior editor of media and entertainment said: ""Two of the biggest stories in entertainment this year are Kylie Jenner and The Rock, who have used their massive followings to make an ungodly amount of money. ""In Kylie's case, she's used it to make a business; and in Dwayne Johnson's, he takes his followers from film to film. It makes them an incredibly attractive prospect. ""They both have among the top 10 social media followings in the world, and it's no accident that they're in the top five on this list."" Similarly, Kim Kardashian West jumped from number 47 in last year's list to 30 this year - helped in no small part by the launch of her own cosmetics brand, KKW Beauty, in June 2017. ""Social media does play a massive part, but it's not the be-all and end-all,"" added Greenburg. ""George Clooney does almost no social media and he's number two on the list.""

"Vern Unsworth (R) helped bring top international cave rescuers to the mission, including Rob Harper (L) A British cave diver who helped rescue 12 Thai boys from deep within a cave has said he is considering suing tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. In now-deleted tweets, Mr Musk had called Vern Unsworth a ""pedo guy"" after the cave expert ridiculed a mini-submarine built by Mr Musk for the rescue effort as a ""PR stunt"". Mr Unsworth told reporters on Monday that he was considering legal action. ""It's not finished,"" he told Australian network Channel 7. Thailand-based Mr Unsworth's knowledge of the cave complex is said to have played a key role in the rescue effort. He travelled into the caves in the first days after the boys went missing and helped bring in top international cave rescue experts for the mission. Mr Unsworth had earlier said the mini-sub built by Mr Musk's team, and flown to Thailand before being rejected as inappropriate for the rescue mission by Thai officials, would have had ""absolutely no chance of working"". Elon Musk, who regularly takes on journalists and other critics on Twitter, on Sunday tweeted a response to Mr Unsworth, without using his name but calling him a ""British expat guy who lives in Thailand"". Long read: The full story of the extraordinary cave rescue Why was Elon Musk at the Thai cave rescue? Thai boys' tears for lost rescue diver He said he would make a video showing the mini-sub making it deep inside the cave ""no problemo"", adding: ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it"". Mr Musk did not back down when challenged. He later deleted the tweets - which were sent to his more than 22 million followers - and is yet to publicly respond to the outcry. ""Yes,"" Mr Unsworth said when asked if he would consider legal action. The BBC has contacted Mr Musk, via his company Tesla, for comment. Allow Twitter content?

All 12 boys and their young coach were rescued last week from the Tham Luang cave system after a complex and treacherous rescue operation involving hundreds of volunteers. They had become trapped in the cave by rising floodwaters on 23 June and were first found by rescuers on 2 July. The 13 rescued remain in hospital in the city of Chiang Rai but are expected to be discharged on Thursday. Last week, as the rescue effort was under way, Mr Musk hit out at the Thai official in charge of the mission's command centre, Narongsak Osotthanakorn, after he said the mini-sub was ""not practical with our mission"", though it was ""technologically sophisticated"". Mr Musk responded by saying Mr Osotthanakorn had been ""described inaccurately as 'rescue chief'"" and was ""not the subject matter expert"". Who are the Thai boys who were trapped in a cave?

"The US government has charged a 29-year-old Russian woman with conspiracy to act as a Russian government agent while infiltrating political groups. Maria Butina had developed close ties with the Republican party and had become an advocate for gun rights, according to US media reports. The charges are not related to the Mueller probe that is examining alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. She allegedly worked at the direction of a high-level Kremlin official. Ms Butina's attorney Robert Driscoll said in a statement released on Monday that his client was ""not an agent"" and instead just an international relations student ""who is seeking to use her degree to pursue a career in business"". He added the charges were ""overblown"" and there was ""no indication of Butina seeking to influence or undermine any specific policy or law or the United States"". Mr Driscoll said his client had ""been co-operating with various government entities for months"" over the allegations. Ms Butina, who lives in Washington, was arrested on Sunday and was held in jail pending a hearing set for Wednesday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement. The announcement of her arrest came hours after US President Donald Trump met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and defended the Kremlin against claims of interference in the 2016 presidential election. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit Russians charged with US election hack Mr Trump said there had been no reason for Russia to meddle in the vote. The arrest also came days after the justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections. Ms Butina had founded a Russian gun rights group before she came to study in America In a sworn statement unsealed on Monday, FBI Special Agent Kevin Helson said her assignment was to ""exploit personal connections with US persons having influence in American politics in an effort to advance the interests of the Russian Federation"". She did so without registering her activities with the US government, as required under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, prosecutors say. Ms Butina sought to foster ties with an ""organisation promoting gun rights"", the DOJ said, without naming any group or politicians. According to an affidavit, she was trying to ""establish a 'back channel' communication for representatives of the Government of Russia"". Thecriminal complaint,externalstates that she focused on developing personal connections with influential US politicians to ""advance the interest"" of Russia. Why is Trump meeting Putin a big deal? Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered As a part of that alleged mission, the complaint says Ms Butina was organising an event to further influence ""the views of US officials as those views relate to the Russian Federation"". Ms Butina reported back to an official in the Russian government about her progress using Twitter direct messages among other means, according to the complaint. In one message, the Russian official told Ms Butina: ""Your political star has risen in the sky. Now it is important to rise to the zenith and not burn out (fall) prematurely."" The affidavit also states that the unnamed official was sanctioned by the US Treasury. Ms Butina, originally from Siberia, came to the US on a student visa to study at American University. The complaint alleges that she was in fact secretly working for the Russian government. She founded a group called the Right to Bear Arms before she arrived in America, and US media have previously reported her ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA), the most powerful gun lobby in the US. She haspreviously denied having worked for the Russian government,external. The Washington Post,externalreported that she became an assistant to Russian banker and former senator Alexander Torshin. He was sanctioned by the US Treasury in April. Mr Torshin, who is a lifetime member of the NRA, and Ms Butina attended NRA events in the US beginning in 2014. She also attended a Trump campaign event and reportedly asked Mr Trump about his views on foreign relations with Russia. ""We get along with Putin,"" Mr Trump had answered, according to the Washington Post.

The charges are not related to the Mueller probe that is examining alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. She allegedly worked at the direction of a high-level Kremlin official. Ms Butina's attorney Robert Driscoll said in a statement released on Monday that his client was ""not an agent"" and instead just an international relations student ""who is seeking to use her degree to pursue a career in business"". He added the charges were ""overblown"" and there was ""no indication of Butina seeking to influence or undermine any specific policy or law or the United States"". Mr Driscoll said his client had ""been co-operating with various government entities for months"" over the allegations. Ms Butina, who lives in Washington, was arrested on Sunday and was held in jail pending a hearing set for Wednesday, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement. The announcement of her arrest came hours after US President Donald Trump met his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and defended the Kremlin against claims of interference in the 2016 presidential election. Even Trump allies shocked by Putin summit Russians charged with US election hack Mr Trump said there had been no reason for Russia to meddle in the vote. The arrest also came days after the justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections. Ms Butina had founded a Russian gun rights group before she came to study in America In a sworn statement unsealed on Monday, FBI Special Agent Kevin Helson said her assignment was to ""exploit personal connections with US persons having influence in American politics in an effort to advance the interests of the Russian Federation"". She did so without registering her activities with the US government, as required under the Foreign Agent Registration Act, prosecutors say. Ms Butina sought to foster ties with an ""organisation promoting gun rights"", the DOJ said, without naming any group or politicians. According to an affidavit, she was trying to ""establish a 'back channel' communication for representatives of the Government of Russia"". Thecriminal complaint,externalstates that she focused on developing personal connections with influential US politicians to ""advance the interest"" of Russia. Why is Trump meeting Putin a big deal? Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered As a part of that alleged mission, the complaint says Ms Butina was organising an event to further influence ""the views of US officials as those views relate to the Russian Federation"". Ms Butina reported back to an official in the Russian government about her progress using Twitter direct messages among other means, according to the complaint. In one message, the Russian official told Ms Butina: ""Your political star has risen in the sky. Now it is important to rise to the zenith and not burn out (fall) prematurely."" The affidavit also states that the unnamed official was sanctioned by the US Treasury. Ms Butina, originally from Siberia, came to the US on a student visa to study at American University. The complaint alleges that she was in fact secretly working for the Russian government. She founded a group called the Right to Bear Arms before she arrived in America, and US media have previously reported her ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA), the most powerful gun lobby in the US. She haspreviously denied having worked for the Russian government,external. The Washington Post,externalreported that she became an assistant to Russian banker and former senator Alexander Torshin. He was sanctioned by the US Treasury in April. Mr Torshin, who is a lifetime member of the NRA, and Ms Butina attended NRA events in the US beginning in 2014. She also attended a Trump campaign event and reportedly asked Mr Trump about his views on foreign relations with Russia. ""We get along with Putin,"" Mr Trump had answered, according to the Washington Post.

"Marcio Gomes escaped the fire with his wife, Andreia, and two daughters - but his unborn baby died A fire station manager advised a Grenfell Tower resident to go back and get his children, despite fearing he ""probably would not survive"". Jason Oliff said it was an ""impossible decision"" with ""no right or wrong answer"", the Grenfell inquiry heard. Resident Marcio Gomes called 999 as he tried to flee the tower with his heavily pregnant wife and daughters, but he became separated from them. The family later escaped with help from firefighters, but the unborn baby died. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Why was 'stay put' Grenfell advice so disastrous? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast: Station Manager Oliff Mr Oliff was in the control room and in charge of passing information from 999 calls to firefighters at the scene in west London. He was called over to help the 999 call handler as she spoke to Mr Gomes, who was having trouble breathing in the smoke-filled stairwell as he escaped the 21st floor. Mr Gomes told the 999 call operator that he had become separated from his wife, Andreia, and asked whether he should continue or go back for her. ""The operator was asking me 'what do I say to him?',"" Mr Oliff said, adding it was a ""highly stressful situation and I did not have the luxury of deliberating over the choices"". He said: ""Having seen the events unfolding at Grenfell Tower on the television and having knowledge of the conditions in the stairwell, I thought it unlikely that the male would be able to make it back, find his wife and still make it out of the building with all of his children."" Marcio and Andreia Gomes lost their unborn child, who they had already named Logan Mr Oliff said he believed the survival time inside the burning tower without fire safety equipment was ""very limited"". He told Mr Gomes, who had his two young daughters with him, to keep going. ""After a few more floors the male informed the operator that he had now lost contact with his children,"" he said. ""The operator could hear the male calling out for his children, he was now in extreme distress. ""The operator was also understandably distressed, she informed me that the male didn't know what to do and again asked me 'what do I tell him?'. ""This was an impossible decision to make. There was no right or wrong answer I could give and I did not give this advice easily. ""I told the operator 'tell him to go back and get his daughters'. ""I knew in saying this, that the male probably wouldn't survive, but my thinking was that if it was me, I wouldn't want to get out of that tower without my family and live with that for the rest of my life."" A few months later, Mr Oliff said he found out that the Gomes family had survived after being helped by firefighters, but that the unborn baby, named Logan, had died. This video can not be played The Gomes tell the story of how they managed to escape the fire Mr Oliff, who is a station manager at Chiswick and Feltham North West Area, was working from Stratford on the night of the fire rather than the usual control room in Merton, which was closed for repairs. ""In 27 years as a firefighter I never expected to see a fire like this in London,"" he said. ""It is difficult to know what the London Fire Brigade could have done to deal with this fire any better than we did."" Thepublic inquiry into the disasteron 14 June last year, which killed 72 people, is currently hearing evidence from London Fire Brigade staff.

"One of the pitch invaders high-fived France's MbappÃ© Four members of the Russian punk activist group Pussy Riot have been jailed for 15 days for disrupting the World Cup final by running onto the pitch. They were accused of violating the rules for spectators at sporting events and wearing police uniforms illegally. They were also banned from attending sports events for three years. Pussy Riot said it was a protest against human rights abuses in Russia. Stewards hauled the four off the pitch. The incident interrupted the second half of the Croatia v France match for about 25 seconds. France went on to win 4-2. Security was tight and it is not clear how the activists managed to get through Pussy Riot has staged high-profile protests against President Vladimir Putin before.Three members were jailed in 2012for an anti-Putin punk song performed in a Moscow cathedral. The group has tweeted that the four arrested on Sunday,externalspent the whole night at a police station in great discomfort. Three women and a man ran onto the pitch, though one was tackled on the sidelines. They wore police-style uniforms: white shirts, black trousers and epaulettes. One woman managed to do a high-five salute with French star Kylian MbappÃ© before being led off the pitch. But the male intruder was grabbed in anger by Croatia defender Dejan Lovren. After the incident Lovren told reporters: ""I just lost my head and I grabbed the guy and I wished I could throw him away from the stadium.""

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: The World Cup final that had everything It was the final which had everything - controversial decisions, a pitch invasion, the first World Cup final own goal, its first teenage goalscorer since Pele, and a comedy goalkeeping error. France beat Croatia 4-2to be crowned world champions for the second time and cap a truly remarkable event. Indeed the final was really the tournament in microcosm. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: France celebrate winning the World Cup World Cup finals have been low-scoring and tense of late - this game equalled the combined total of goals scored in the previous four. The last final to have more than two goals was in 1998 - the other time Les Bleus won the World Cup. It was also the joint highest goal tally in a final since 1958, when Brazil beat Sweden 5-2. Former England defender Rio Ferdinand said on BBC One: ""Sometimes these games can peter out to being boring chess matches but this was anything but. Croatia deserve credit for the way they attacked France."" Ex-England captain Alan Shearer said: ""As fortunate as they were to be leading at half-time, France totally changed in the second period. They found a way to get Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappe into the game and they tightened up at the back. ""Congratulations to them, they have been magnificent."" The tournament had 169 goals - two short of the record 171 set four years ago in Brazil and in France '98. France win is 'supreme coronation' - Deschamps Check out the player ratings from the World Cup final Kane wins Golden Boot, Modric is player of tournament This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Antoine Griezmann tucks away controversial VAR penalty This is the first World Cup to use video assistant referees (VAR). After being utilised regularly in the group stages, it went quiet for most of the knockout stage. But it was used in the final to award France a penalty. When Samuel Umtiti flicked a corner towards Ivan Perisic's hand, the referee did not award anything. But, after a lengthy discussion with the video assistant referee, he went to watch it on a screen - and awarded a penalty. While many were angry with VAR, it should be noted it was referee Nestor Pitana's decision to award the penalty, after viewing the incident several times. Antoine Griezmann scored. The BBC One punditsall thought it was the wrong decision,though former England winger Chris Waddle disagreed. Shearer said at half-time it was a ""ridiculous decision"". ""It will be such a shame if this game is decided on that decision,"" he said. ""That is not a deliberate handball and it shouldn't be a penalty. The referee didn't give it initially, but then he is certain he has made an error after going to the VAR? I don't agree with it."" Ferdinand said: ""Two bad decisions have turned the game on its head. It is too close for Ivan Perisic to react. He is not going to deliberately handle the ball. ""The referee took so long so he can't be certain. He can't! It becomes almost laughable. He can't be clear."" Former Germany striker Jurgen Klinsmann said: ""When you are not sure, you don't give it. It is the wrong decision."" Griezmann's goal was the 22nd penalty scored at this World Cup - a record. It was the 29th spot-kick taken - the highest since the stats were first recorded in 1966.

So it was only right that the final had one. Mario Mandzukic's header from Griezmann's free-kick - which made it 1-0 to France - made him the first player to score an own goal in a World Cup final. That doubled the record for own goals in a tournament. It also means there were twice as many own goals as top scorer Harry Kane managed in Russia. After that goal, Waddle - on BBC Radio 5 live - described Russia 2018 as the ""tournament of set-pieces"". He had a point - 73 of the 169 goals scored came from set-piece situations (43%) - the highest ratio since those stats started in 1966. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Kylian Mbappe goal stretches lead Kylian Mbappe was only the third teenager to play in a World Cup final - and became the second to score in one, following Pele's double against Sweden in 1958. Earlier in the tournament, Mbappe put in perhaps the most electrifying performance of the tournament with two goals against Argentina - which made him the first teenager to score twice in any World Cup game since the Brazil legend. It might be hard to argue it was a true breakthrough tournament for a player who has cost Paris St-Germain Â£159m - but the 19-year-old finished with four goals and was unsurprisingly named young player of the tournament. The BBC pundits feel he might be the man to end Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi's combined 10-year hold on the Ballon d'Or, the award for the world's best player. ""He is the guy who will be standing up on that Ballon d'Or podium in years to come. Easy,""said Ferdinand. ""To come to a World Cup with all eyes on you, and to do this at 19 years old... what a great strike. It's the intelligence and the decision-making. Kylian Mbappe makes the right decisions so often. There is already maturity beyond his years."" Klinsmann said: ""There is so much to come down the road. He is shaking up the market. With Ronaldo moving and Neymar being linked with other clubs, where is it finishing with this kid? ""What impresses me most is that he is already a part of the French team that is like a family. He looks so comfortable in this side, like he has been playing in it for 10 years.""

Samuel Umtiti passed the ball back to his captain, the Tottenham goalkeeper. Lloris casually tried to step around Mandzukic - only managing to kick the ball off the striker and into his own net. ""What on earth is Hugo Lloris doing? He is in a World Cup final and he's been punished for taking liberties,"" said BBC One co-commentator Martin Keown. It was probably the biggest mistake of the World Cup, although Germany keeper Manuel Neuer losing the ball 80 yards from goal as South Korea scored a second to knock them out in the group stages will live long in the memory. The goal did give Mandzukic a couple of claims to fame. He is only the second player to score a goal and an own goal in a World Cup game - and the first in a final. And he is just the fifth player to score in a World Cup and European Cup or Champions League finals - the first since Zinedine Zidane. Croatia defender Dejan Lovren scuffled with one of the pitch invaders There had been worries about Russia hosting the tournament, with concerns about the potential for racism, hooliganism, and gay fans being at risk of violence. But it appeared to go off smoothly. Until, that is, a pitch invasion in the final which Russian punk rock group Pussy Riot claimed responsibility for, saying they were protesting against various political issue in the country. Staff acted quickly to get them off the pitch - though several had confrontations with players on both sides.

""The operator was asking me 'what do I say to him?',"" Mr Oliff said, adding it was a ""highly stressful situation and I did not have the luxury of deliberating over the choices"". He said: ""Having seen the events unfolding at Grenfell Tower on the television and having knowledge of the conditions in the stairwell, I thought it unlikely that the male would be able to make it back, find his wife and still make it out of the building with all of his children."" Marcio and Andreia Gomes lost their unborn child, who they had already named Logan Mr Oliff said he believed the survival time inside the burning tower without fire safety equipment was ""very limited"". He told Mr Gomes, who had his two young daughters with him, to keep going. ""After a few more floors the male informed the operator that he had now lost contact with his children,"" he said. ""The operator could hear the male calling out for his children, he was now in extreme distress. ""The operator was also understandably distressed, she informed me that the male didn't know what to do and again asked me 'what do I tell him?'. ""This was an impossible decision to make. There was no right or wrong answer I could give and I did not give this advice easily. ""I told the operator 'tell him to go back and get his daughters'. ""I knew in saying this, that the male probably wouldn't survive, but my thinking was that if it was me, I wouldn't want to get out of that tower without my family and live with that for the rest of my life."" A few months later, Mr Oliff said he found out that the Gomes family had survived after being helped by firefighters, but that the unborn baby, named Logan, had died. This video can not be played The Gomes tell the story of how they managed to escape the fire Mr Oliff, who is a station manager at Chiswick and Feltham North West Area, was working from Stratford on the night of the fire rather than the usual control room in Merton, which was closed for repairs. ""In 27 years as a firefighter I never expected to see a fire like this in London,"" he said. ""It is difficult to know what the London Fire Brigade could have done to deal with this fire any better than we did.""

"Michael Gove has distanced himself from some of the arguments he made during the Brexit referendum, including claims over levels of Turkish immigration. The Leave campaign was criticised at the time for suggesting Turkey may join the EU by 2020 and up to 5.2m more migrants could come to the UK by 2030. In a new book, Mr Gove says it ""did not get everything absolutely right"". ""If it had been left entirely to me, the Leave campaign would have had a slightly different feel,"" he admits. The remarks feature in a new book about the campaign and political drama that followed it written by Tom Baldwin, a former Times journalist who was once a colleague of ex-journalist Mr Gove on the paper. Mr Baldwin subsequently worked for Ed Miliband as his communications director during the 2015 election, and now works for the People's Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on the final UK-EU deal. Row over UK veto on Turkey joining EU Claims about levels of Turkish immigration to the UK were among the most contentious of the referendum campaign. Vote Leave suggested the UK would not be in a position to stop Turkey joining the EU and warned of an influx of migrants putting more pressure on public services. The claims were repeated by key figures, including current cabinet ministers Mr Gove and Penny Mordaunt and ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson. In a speech during the campaign, Mr Gove said the continued free movement of people from the EU would have ""huge consequences"" for the health service, saying ""the idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable"". The claims about Turkey were strongly rejected at the time by Downing Street, which insisted that its accession was a long way off and that the UK would have a veto anyway. In an interview for the book, Ctrl Alt Delete, Mr Baldwin asked the environment secretary whether he was entirely comfortable in ""appealing to some very low sentiments"". Mr Gove is quoted as replying: ""I know what you mean, yes. If it had been left entirely to me, the Leave campaign would have had a slightly different feel. ""I would have to go back and look at everything I said and think whether that was the right response at the right time. There is a sense at the back of my mind that we did not get everything absolutely right. ""It's a difficult one."" Mr Gove is also pressed in the book about his much-quoted claim from the campaign that people had ""had enough of experts"" telling them what to think about Brexit. He says the remark was spontaneous rather than intended and designed not to denigrate expertise but to highlight past claims, such as over the 2008 financial crisis, which had been wrong. ""The irony, of course, is that I often cite experts to justify what I am doing,"" he adds.

"Ofcom has received over 2,500 complaints about a video shown to Dani Dyer on Love Island Media watchdog Ofcom will not investigate more than 2,600 complaints about the treatment of Love Island contestant Dani Dyer. The complaints related to a scene where Dyer was shown a misleading video of boyfriend Jack Fincham after his ex-girlfriend was brought into his villa. An Ofcom spokesperson said they ""understood"" Dyer's distress was upsetting for viewers. But it considered ""viewers are likely to expect emotionally charged scenes."" Dyer was seen crying in the beach hut after seeing the video of Fincham The spokesperson said that the viewers' concerns were ""carefully considered"" and that the audience was aware ""scenes... have been engineered to test contestants' relationships."" The clips in question were aired on 1 July. Dyer, who has been paired up with Fincham since the beginning of the series, burst into tears as she watched the video of Jack reacting as he saw his ex, Ellie Jones, arrive. Although he did not give an overtly positive response to Jones's arrival or make any mention of any romantic intentions towards her, Dani was visibly distressed. Alex Salmond Show tweets misled audience, says Ofcom Viewers were shown her full reaction. She said: ""It always happens to me, as soon as I'm happy with someone, something happens to me, it's like I'm not allowed to be happy.

"Amazon employed singer Ariana Grande to promote Prime Day Shoppers thinking of taking part in internet giant Amazon's Prime Day are being warned that not all the items on sale could be the bargains they seem. Consumer group Which? said that the goods are often cheaper at other times of the year. However Amazon said its website was transparent, and consumers could compare price changes over time. The 36 hour sale - aimed at subscribers to the Prime shopping service - offers discounts on a range of goods. The deals are time-limited, with shoppers being told that some items are only available while stocks last. The heavily-promoted offers start at midday UK time on Monday, and are co-ordinated across the globe. Amazon criticised for misleading adverts Amazon opens a supermarket with no check-outs However, Which? warned that some goods could be bought more cheaply outside the promotion period. ""Although these time-limited sales events can offer great discounts, not all offers will be as good as they seem,"" said Adam French, Which? consumer rights editor. ""It can be easy to get swept along by the hype and excitement on the day, so we recommend preparing in advance and researching what you want to buy, to make sure you can tell the difference between a good deal and a dud on Amazon Prime Day."" Jonny Grant, an IT consultant from London, found that the price of a computer monitor on Amazon Prime actually went up at midday on Tuesday, from Â£299 to Â£354. ""I've been caught out,"" he told the BBC.  ""I didn't buy it, because I wouldn't want to reward them for this kind of price hike."" But Greg Hine, from Edinburgh University, said he'd found Prime Day to be fairly reasonable. ""Every year I get my protein powder for Â£29.99 instead of Â£48. I have to say Prime Day works for me."" Several websites track the prices on Amazon. One, called Lovethesales.com, agreed that some so-called bargains were not all they were cracked up to be. It said a Sony Playstation was currently being advertised with 14% off, at a price of Â£299. However on 28 November last year the same console was Â£40 cheaper. Other consumer groups questioned whether targeted sales messages on people's mobile phones should be allowed to continue unabated. ""There's so much data. Retailers can work out so much about us,"" said James Daley, the founder of Fairer Finance. ""It turns into a bombardment of high-pressure sales messages that can lead people to make the wrong decisions.  It's time for us to have a debate on whether more boundaries need to be drawn."" In response, Amazon said customers could see for themselves whether they were getting a bargain. ""One of the great things about shopping online is that customers can quickly and easily compare prices,"" the company said. ""For many of our deals the new price and the previous Amazon price can be seen at the product detail page so customers can make an informed decision."" The launch of Amazon Prime Day is accompanied by a big marketing budget. Pop band Take That performed at an ""Unboxing Amazon Prime Day"" event, while Ariane Grande opened a promotional concert in New York. Several British newspapers and websites also provided readers with direct online links to the shopping site. Many of them stand to make a small amount of money on each sale.

"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

"Shares in Debenhams have fallen again in a rocky day for its shares. Reports some insurers reduced cover for its suppliers sent the department store chain's share price down 6.5%. The Sunday Times said,externalthe retailer was facing ""a cash crunch"" because some credit insurers had tightened their terms for Debenhams suppliers. Suppliers use credit insurance to cover them from the risk of not being paid but Debenhams said that its balance sheet and cash position were ""healthy"". The retailer, which is in the midst of a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales, said its relationship with credit insurers was ""constructive"" and all were continuing to provide cover to its suppliers. One major insurer, Euler Hermes, is understood to have reduced the amount of credit insurance it will provide. Meanwhile, some new suppliers are believed to have found it difficult to get credit insurance for Debenhams' orders. When insurance firms reduce their cover or withdraw it altogether, it means they are concerned about the ability of their customers to pay their debts. Debenhams acknowledged market conditions were ""challenging"", but said it had ""a clear strategy in place"" and was taking ""decisive actions to strengthen the business""â. Debenhams's shares closed down at 13.75p. The chain's statement comes a month after it issued itsthird profit warning this year, saying full-year profits would be lower than expected. Chief executive Sergio Bucher, who joined Debenhams in 2016, aims to put more emphasis on food and beauty and improve the firm's online platform. Debenhams is not the only retailer struggling. Last week, rival Marks and Spencer, which has already said it will close 100 shops, warned it could be forced toclose more storesas it battles to improve its fortunes. Meanwhile, administrators in charge of finding a buyer for the stricken Poundworld chain said on Fridaya further 80 stores would close, resulting in 1,024 job losses.

"Michael Gove has distanced himself from some of the arguments he made during the Brexit referendum, including claims over levels of Turkish immigration. The Leave campaign was criticised at the time for suggesting Turkey may join the EU by 2020 and up to 5.2m more migrants could come to the UK by 2030. In a new book, Mr Gove says it ""did not get everything absolutely right"". ""If it had been left entirely to me, the Leave campaign would have had a slightly different feel,"" he admits. The remarks feature in a new book about the campaign and political drama that followed it written by Tom Baldwin, a former Times journalist who was once a colleague of ex-journalist Mr Gove on the paper. Mr Baldwin subsequently worked for Ed Miliband as his communications director during the 2015 election, and now works for the People's Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on the final UK-EU deal. Row over UK veto on Turkey joining EU Claims about levels of Turkish immigration to the UK were among the most contentious of the referendum campaign. Vote Leave suggested the UK would not be in a position to stop Turkey joining the EU and warned of an influx of migrants putting more pressure on public services. The claims were repeated by key figures, including current cabinet ministers Mr Gove and Penny Mordaunt and ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson. In a speech during the campaign, Mr Gove said the continued free movement of people from the EU would have ""huge consequences"" for the health service, saying ""the idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable"". The claims about Turkey were strongly rejected at the time by Downing Street, which insisted that its accession was a long way off and that the UK would have a veto anyway. In an interview for the book, Ctrl Alt Delete, Mr Baldwin asked the environment secretary whether he was entirely comfortable in ""appealing to some very low sentiments"". Mr Gove is quoted as replying: ""I know what you mean, yes. If it had been left entirely to me, the Leave campaign would have had a slightly different feel. ""I would have to go back and look at everything I said and think whether that was the right response at the right time. There is a sense at the back of my mind that we did not get everything absolutely right. ""It's a difficult one."" Mr Gove is also pressed in the book about his much-quoted claim from the campaign that people had ""had enough of experts"" telling them what to think about Brexit. He says the remark was spontaneous rather than intended and designed not to denigrate expertise but to highlight past claims, such as over the 2008 financial crisis, which had been wrong. ""The irony, of course, is that I often cite experts to justify what I am doing,"" he adds.

"The relations between the US and Russia have been far from smile-inducing recently US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are holding a summit in the Finnish capital, Helsinki. Why is this so hotly anticipated? The US and Russia have long been adversaries but accusations that Moscow interfered in the US presidential election in 2016 have added an extra, bitter ingredient. Let's take a look. It goes back to the so-called Cold War (from 1945 to 1989) and the hostilities between the US and the then Soviet Union. They never fought each other directly but differences remained even after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the consolidation of the US as the world's sole superpower. Fast forward to now, and Mr Putin has made no secret of his determination to reassert Russian power after years of perceived humiliation, often putting his country on a collision course with the US. How do Russia tensions compare to Soviet era? Difficult at the best of times, bilateral relations have deteriorated significantly since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. That led the US and others to impose a series of economic sanctions on Russia. Their relationship has become one of the most scrutinised in global affairs, because of claims of Russian meddling in the 2016 US election, which has been denied by Moscow. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in Mr Trump's favour. An investigation into what Russia did and whether any of the Trump team helped them is the subject of an investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, dismissed by the president as a ""witch hunt"". Repeatedly he has called it a Democratic conspiracy driven by bitterness at losing the election. Read more about Crimea Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Since taking office in January 2017, President Trump has sought to improve ties, a stance at odds with traditional Republican party policy. Last month, he supported Russia's re-admission to the group of industrialised nations - now called G7 - after its suspension following the annexation of Crimea. Mr Trump has made several comments praising Mr Putin. ""Very much of a leader,"" he said in 2016, ""far more than our president has been a leader,"" in reference to Barack Obama. Last year, he called Mr Putin a ""tough cookie"". In March,he congratulated Mr Putin for his controversial election victory, despite warnings from his advisers not to do so. Putin and Trump in their own words Mr Putin has been more guarded in his views about Mr Trump, but has called him a ""very bright person, talented"" and a ""colourful"" man in the past. Official statements have lacked details but the talks are likely to include: Arms control:Both leaders have bragged about their nuclear capabilities and experts say this is one of the key points to watch. US and Russia have a deal called New Start, aimed at reducing and limiting the size of their nuclear arsenals, the two largest in the world. It is in effect until 2021 and any progress in extending it will be seen as a good sign. They are also likely to discuss a missiles treaty signed in 1987 amid mutual accusations of breaches US sanctions:Those were imposed on companies and individuals over Russia's annexation of Crimea, its support to separatists in eastern Ukraine, its role in the conflict in Syria and its alleged interference in the 2016 election. Congress needs to approve the easing of restrictions but observers say Mr Trump can indicate that the list of those sanctioned will not be expanded, a move that would be welcomed by Russia Ukraine:The US has given military aid to Ukraine and Mr Putin would be happy to see it scrapped. This, as well as a recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea, is unlikely to happen. But both leaders can agree to allow international peacekeepers to patrol eastern Ukraine, where a conflict has killed more than 10,000 people Syria:Israel, a key US ally, wants to see Iran and Iranian-backed forces away from south-west Syria, in the area next to its border. Mr Trump is likely to raise the issue but analysts say it is not clear whether Mr Putin can make any offer that includes limiting Iran's activities in the country, for example During a summit with Nato countries last week, Mr Trump signed a joint statement condemning ""Russian aggression"". The question many now ask is whether he will raise the concerns of the allies directly with the Russian president. It has been widely reported that the European partners have not been briefed about what Mr Trump is really trying to achieve in Helsinki. What is Nato? Can Nato survive Trump? There is a fear that after a tumultuous trip to Europe he will have some warm words for Mr Putin. Mr Trump bashed Nato allies over their defence spending, said Germany was ""controlled by Russia"" because of its gas imports and criticised UK Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan. It's hard to say. Mr Trump's unorthodox approach to such talks makes any prediction look more like a guessing game, but US advisers have downplayed any chance of major announcements. Adding an air of mystery is the fact that both will speak in private during their meeting, with only their interpreters expected to be present. Mr Putin and Mr Trump have met before on the sidelines of summits As a gesture of a restart in relations, they could agree to restore their countries' diplomatic presence after tit-for-tat expulsions in the last few years, most recently over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in England. A lot. US and Russia have been in different, or even opposing sides on many critical issues - Syria, Ukraine, Crimea, to name a few - that have a global impact. Add to that the Western sanctions in Russia that Mr Putin says are ""harmful for everyone"". But European countries, perhaps more than others, will be watching it very closely. They are in an uncomfortable situation as they fear the Russian threat, but are to some degree dependent on Russian energy supplies. Mr Trump singled out Germany over the controversial Nord Stream 2 project that will boost Russian gas deliveries to Central and Western Europe across the Baltic Sea. The route bypasses not only Ukraine but also the Baltic states and Poland - all of those countries oppose it. This all leaves little doubt that the world will be watching to see what happens on Monday. Trump Russia affair: Who's who?

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: The World Cup final that had everything It was the final which had everything - controversial decisions, a pitch invasion, the first World Cup final own goal, its first teenage goalscorer since Pele, and a comedy goalkeeping error. France beat Croatia 4-2to be crowned world champions for the second time and cap a truly remarkable event. Indeed the final was really the tournament in microcosm. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: France celebrate winning the World Cup World Cup finals have been low-scoring and tense of late - this game equalled the combined total of goals scored in the previous four. The last final to have more than two goals was in 1998 - the other time Les Bleus won the World Cup. It was also the joint highest goal tally in a final since 1958, when Brazil beat Sweden 5-2. Former England defender Rio Ferdinand said on BBC One: ""Sometimes these games can peter out to being boring chess matches but this was anything but. Croatia deserve credit for the way they attacked France."" Ex-England captain Alan Shearer said: ""As fortunate as they were to be leading at half-time, France totally changed in the second period. They found a way to get Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappe into the game and they tightened up at the back. ""Congratulations to them, they have been magnificent."" The tournament had 169 goals - two short of the record 171 set four years ago in Brazil and in France '98. France win is 'supreme coronation' - Deschamps Check out the player ratings from the World Cup final Kane wins Golden Boot, Modric is player of tournament This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Antoine Griezmann tucks away controversial VAR penalty This is the first World Cup to use video assistant referees (VAR). After being utilised regularly in the group stages, it went quiet for most of the knockout stage. But it was used in the final to award France a penalty. When Samuel Umtiti flicked a corner towards Ivan Perisic's hand, the referee did not award anything. But, after a lengthy discussion with the video assistant referee, he went to watch it on a screen - and awarded a penalty. While many were angry with VAR, it should be noted it was referee Nestor Pitana's decision to award the penalty, after viewing the incident several times. Antoine Griezmann scored. The BBC One punditsall thought it was the wrong decision,though former England winger Chris Waddle disagreed. Shearer said at half-time it was a ""ridiculous decision"". ""It will be such a shame if this game is decided on that decision,"" he said. ""That is not a deliberate handball and it shouldn't be a penalty. The referee didn't give it initially, but then he is certain he has made an error after going to the VAR? I don't agree with it."" Ferdinand said: ""Two bad decisions have turned the game on its head. It is too close for Ivan Perisic to react. He is not going to deliberately handle the ball. ""The referee took so long so he can't be certain. He can't! It becomes almost laughable. He can't be clear."" Former Germany striker Jurgen Klinsmann said: ""When you are not sure, you don't give it. It is the wrong decision."" Griezmann's goal was the 22nd penalty scored at this World Cup - a record. It was the 29th spot-kick taken - the highest since the stats were first recorded in 1966.

So it was only right that the final had one. Mario Mandzukic's header from Griezmann's free-kick - which made it 1-0 to France - made him the first player to score an own goal in a World Cup final. That doubled the record for own goals in a tournament. It also means there were twice as many own goals as top scorer Harry Kane managed in Russia. After that goal, Waddle - on BBC Radio 5 live - described Russia 2018 as the ""tournament of set-pieces"". He had a point - 73 of the 169 goals scored came from set-piece situations (43%) - the highest ratio since those stats started in 1966. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Kylian Mbappe goal stretches lead Kylian Mbappe was only the third teenager to play in a World Cup final - and became the second to score in one, following Pele's double against Sweden in 1958. Earlier in the tournament, Mbappe put in perhaps the most electrifying performance of the tournament with two goals against Argentina - which made him the first teenager to score twice in any World Cup game since the Brazil legend. It might be hard to argue it was a true breakthrough tournament for a player who has cost Paris St-Germain Â£159m - but the 19-year-old finished with four goals and was unsurprisingly named young player of the tournament. The BBC pundits feel he might be the man to end Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi's combined 10-year hold on the Ballon d'Or, the award for the world's best player. ""He is the guy who will be standing up on that Ballon d'Or podium in years to come. Easy,""said Ferdinand. ""To come to a World Cup with all eyes on you, and to do this at 19 years old... what a great strike. It's the intelligence and the decision-making. Kylian Mbappe makes the right decisions so often. There is already maturity beyond his years."" Klinsmann said: ""There is so much to come down the road. He is shaking up the market. With Ronaldo moving and Neymar being linked with other clubs, where is it finishing with this kid? ""What impresses me most is that he is already a part of the French team that is like a family. He looks so comfortable in this side, like he has been playing in it for 10 years."" Find out how you can follow the 2018-19 season on BBC Sport This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Howler from France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris gives Croatia lifeline In a season during which Loris Karius made possibly theworst goalkeeping mistake in a Champions League finalto gift Karim Benzema a goal, Hugo Lloris had a 'hold my beer' moment at the Luzhniki Stadium. Samuel Umtiti passed the ball back to his captain, the Tottenham goalkeeper. Lloris casually tried to step around Mandzukic - only managing to kick the ball off the striker and into his own net. ""What on earth is Hugo Lloris doing? He is in a World Cup final and he's been punished for taking liberties,"" said BBC One co-commentator Martin Keown. It was probably the biggest mistake of the World Cup, although Germany keeper Manuel Neuer losing the ball 80 yards from goal as South Korea scored a second to knock them out in the group stages will live long in the memory. The goal did give Mandzukic a couple of claims to fame. He is only the second player to score a goal and an own goal in a World Cup game - and the first in a final. And he is just the fifth player to score in a World Cup and European Cup or Champions League finals - the first since Zinedine Zidane. Croatia defender Dejan Lovren scuffled with one of the pitch invaders There had been worries about Russia hosting the tournament, with concerns about the potential for racism, hooliganism, and gay fans being at risk of violence. But it appeared to go off smoothly. Until, that is, a pitch invasion in the final which Russian punk rock group Pussy Riot claimed responsibility for, saying they were protesting against various political issue in the country. Staff acted quickly to get them off the pitch - though several had confrontations with players on both sides.

"One of the pitch invaders high-fived France's MbappÃ© Four members of the Russian punk activist group Pussy Riot have been jailed for 15 days for disrupting the World Cup final by running onto the pitch. They were accused of violating the rules for spectators at sporting events and wearing police uniforms illegally. They were also banned from attending sports events for three years. Pussy Riot said it was a protest against human rights abuses in Russia. Stewards hauled the four off the pitch. The incident interrupted the second half of the Croatia v France match for about 25 seconds. France went on to win 4-2.

"Shares in Debenhams have fallen again in a rocky day for its shares. Reports some insurers reduced cover for its suppliers sent the department store chain's share price down 6.5%. The Sunday Times said,externalthe retailer was facing ""a cash crunch"" because some credit insurers had tightened their terms for Debenhams suppliers. Suppliers use credit insurance to cover them from the risk of not being paid but Debenhams said that its balance sheet and cash position were ""healthy"". The retailer, which is in the midst of a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales, said its relationship with credit insurers was ""constructive"" and all were continuing to provide cover to its suppliers. One major insurer, Euler Hermes, is understood to have reduced the amount of credit insurance it will provide. Meanwhile, some new suppliers are believed to have found it difficult to get credit insurance for Debenhams' orders. When insurance firms reduce their cover or withdraw it altogether, it means they are concerned about the ability of their customers to pay their debts.

Jubilant crowds lined the capital's main artery, the Champs-ElysÃ©es, to greet the team's open-top bus. Jets saluted the players and the coach overhead, trailing smoke in French red, white and blue. The team was then honoured with an official reception by President Emmanuel Macron. France beat Croatia 4-2 in the final in Moscow on Sunday. It is France's second World Cup win, following their triumph in 1998. Mr Macron's office announced that the players and their coach would receive the country's highest accolade - the LÃ©gion d'Honneur.

"This video can not be played Theresa May denies Brexit deal is 'dead in the water' Theresa May has been accused of ""caving in"" to Conservative Brexiteers after agreeing to their changes to a key piece of legislation. Critics said accepting the amendments to the Customs Bill meant the prime minister's recently announced trade proposals were ""dead in the water"". But Mrs May said this was ""absolutely wrong"" and that the changes were ""consistent"" with her plan. The amendments relate to trading across UK-EU borders after Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but has yet to agree how its final relationship with the bloc will work. Live: MPs debate Brexit and customs After a meeting of the cabinet at Chequers, last week the government published a White Paper setting out its preferred trading relationship with the EU. The proposals, including a ""common rule book"" between the two sides, have angered many Tory MPs. And they were set to show their displeasure by trying to amend the Taxation (Cross Border Trade) Bill, known as the Customs Bill. Downing Street now says it will accept the four amendments - one of which could stop the UK from collecting tariffs for the EU, part of Theresa May's Chequers plan, unless the rest of the EU reciprocates. Another change could make the EU's ""backstop"" on customs impossible by ruling out a border in the Irish Sea. The other two amendments would ensure the UK was out of the EU's VAT regime and require new legislation if the government wanted to form a customs union with the EU. Allow Twitter content?

Theresa May's spokesman said the changes were ""consistent"" with the proposals put forward by the government so far. But Conservative MP Anna Soubry said the prime minister's Chequers plan had now been ""wrecked by caving in to the hard, no-deal Brexiteers"". Another Tory MP, Heidi Allen, said the amendments ""fundamentally undermine the Chequers proposal"". Greening calls for second referendum At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan In the Commons, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock said the prime minister had ""capitulated"" to  Conservative Brexiteers and that the proposals agreed at the Chequers summit were now ""dead in the water"". Mrs May denied this, adding: ""I would not have gone through all the work that I did to ensure that we reached that agreement only to see it changed in some way through these bills."" The government, which does not have a Commons majority, has been under pressure from MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate. This video can not be played Anna Soubry criticised colleagues who have a ""gold-plated pension"" and support Brexit As news broke that the Brexiteers' amendments had been accepted, there were angry exchanges between Conservative MPs as the Customs Bill was debated. Pro-EU Anna Soubry suggested backbench Eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg was now ""running Britain"". ""This government is in grave danger of not just losing the plot but losing a considerable amount of support from the people of this country unless we get Brexit right,"" she said. As Ms Soubry praised former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's support of free trade, she was told by former Tory minister Sir Edward Leigh that she ""ain't no Margaret Thatcher"". ""I don't pretend to be able to walk in Margaret Thatcher's boots,"" she responded. Later, Ms Soubry said: ""Nobody voted Leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them."" David Davis, whoresigned as Brexit secretaryin protest at the Chequers proposals, urged MPs to support the Customs Bill, describing it as ""vital legislation"". Mr Davis said the EU was a ""slow and not very effective negotiator of free trade agreements"", and that the UK had a negotiating hand ""over and above our economic weight"". The trouble with the tariffs amendment is that it seems to blow a hole in the government's policy of forming what it calls a Facilitated Customs Arrangement with the EU. The plan was that the UK would collect EU tariffs on goods imported into the UK and pass them onto Brussels if the goods were destined for the EU, but British firms could get a rebate if the goods stayed in the UK. It was messy, complicated and many thought it unworkable, but it was always assumed that the EU would not reciprocate - that they would not collect tariffs for the UK at their ports in return. Insisting that they have to do so will be difficult if not impossible to get around. Earlier Mr Davis said he still backed Theresa May, telling reporters as he left his London home that ""my name's not Geoffrey Howe"" - a reference to the late Conservative politician whose barbed criticisms of Margaret Thatcher during his resignation speech in 1990 paved the way for her subsequent downfall.

"This video can not be played Justine Greening: ""This deal keeps no-one happy"" Downing Street has rejected Justine Greening's call for a fresh referendum on the UK's exit from the EU, saying it will not happen ""in any circumstances"". The former education secretary argued the final Brexit decision should be given back to the people and out of the hands of ""deadlocked politicians"". She called for three options to be on the ballot paper: the prime minister's Chequers deal, staying in the EU or a clean break from Europe with no deal. The UK is due to leave in March 2019. Amid continuing Tory divisions over Mrs May's strategy, the government has accepted changes to legislation for customs arrangements after the UK leaves to avoid a Commons rebellion by Brexit-backing MPs. No 10 said the amendments to the Customs Bill, including one that would preclude the UK from collecting tariffs on goods bound for EU countries, were ""consistent"" with the blueprint agreed by the cabinet. Asked during a Commons statement on last week's Nato summit whether she was ""rolling over"", Mrs May said she would continue to ""listen to the concerns"" of colleagues regarding Brexit-related legislation. Reality Check: How would the UK hold a second referendum? Live: MPs debate Brexit and customs Ms Greening, who resigned after the cabinet reshuffle in January, said the referendum should offer a first and second preference vote so that a consensus can be reached. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Greening said the government's proposals were a ""genuine clever attempt at a compromise that could work"" but ""suits no-one"". The MP for Putney said: ""The reality is Parliament is now stalemated. Whatever the proposal on the table, there will be MPs who vote it down. But Britain needs to find a route forward."" Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' - May Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan Seven thoughts on a second EU referendum Ms Greening, who supported Remain in the EU referendum, is the highest profile ex-Cabinet minister to call for a second referendum. She said there were other senior Conservatives who agreed with her stance, adding that people who supported Leave in the referendum would also feel the government's approach is ""not what they voted for"". In her article in the Times, she lambasted the PM's Brexit blueprint, saying: ""We'll be dragging Remain voters out of the EU for a deal that means still complying with many EU rules, but now with no say on shaping them. ""It's not what they want, and on top of that when they hear that Leave voters are unhappy, they ask, 'What's the point?' ""For Leavers, this deal simply does not deliver the proper break from the European Union that they wanted."" By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Combine a hung parliament with Brexit, and when you scan your eye around the House of Commons, you sometimes wonder if they can collectively agree on anything. The one thing there is certainly not much public support for right now among MPs is another referendum. Whatever the view of an individual MP on Brexit, most see making the case for another schlep to the polling station a hard argument to flog. And so while those doing so are a pretty small tribe, and it is a million miles from a majority view, there is pride among them that they can add another name to their gang. But it is worth remembering that Justine Greening is a pro-European in a marginal seat - Putney in London - that voted heavily to Remain. Ms Greening, who grew up in Rotherham, where 68% people voted to leave the EU, said the parliamentary stalemate ""risks a no-confidence vote and, worse, a Corbyn government, which would be disastrous for the economy"". She hadpreviously suggested a future generation of MPs will seek to ""improve or undo"" Brexitif it does not work for young people. Fellow Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin, who backed Leave in the referendum, said he agreed with Ms Greening that the PM's plan was ""dead"" but described her call for a second vote as ""a little ill-thought-out"". ""If we wanted to extend the uncertainty for another long period this is one way of doing it,"" he told Today. Mrs May has ruled out a second vote, as has Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, although a number of senior Labour figures are backing the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a final vote on any exit deal. Pro-EU Conservative MP Dominic Grieve told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme the possibility of holding a second referendum should not be excluded but Mrs May was ""entitled to try to develop"" her Chequers plan. This video can not be played Theresa May reveals the advice President Trump gave her over Brexit ""My primary political duty at the moment is to try and help get this country through a Brexit process that is endangering its stability and its wellbeing,"" he said. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said another referendum was ""heading much closer"" but could be avoided if the Tories changed leader, adding there was ""uproar out there"" about the prime minister's proposals. Suella Braverman, who used to lead a Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs and is now a minister in the Brexit department, said there were ""obviously strong views"" within her party and described the Chequers plan as a ""starting point"" for negotiations with the EU. But the disagreements in the party have also led to another resignation from the government. Scott Mann has quit his job as a parliamentary private secretary at the Treasury, saying Mrs May's plan was ""in direct conflict"" with the views of his Leave-voting constituents in north Cornwall and he did not want to deliver a ""watered-down Brexit"" to them.

"The two leaders met with only translators as witnesses US President Donald Trump says his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was ""a good start"". After two hours of closed-door talks the two leaders went into a working lunch with their senior advisers. Speaking earlier, Mr Putin said it was time to discuss ""difficult multi-national issues"". Relations between Russia and the West were severely strained by Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Russia is also accused of meddling in the 2016 US election, a claim it strongly denies. Speaking before Monday's much-anticipated summit, Mr Trump said he hoped for an ""extraordinary relationship"" and blamed US-Russia tensions on previous administrations. Some US politicians had called for the summit to be cancelled after12 Russian military intelligence agents were chargedon Friday with hacking the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Live updates: Trump-Putin summit Why is Trump meeting Putin a big deal?

The tweets are likely to alarm White House advisers already nervous about the risks of ceding too much ground to the Russian leader during the talks. The two leaders were joined only by their interpreters during their two hours of face-to-face talks. Their summit comes after a tumultuous European tour that saw Mr Trump sharply criticise longstanding allies of the US over trade and military spending. This video can not be played Trump: I have low expectations for Putin meeting Russia has been criticised in the US because of its military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria as well as its destabilising actions in Ukraine. Relations have also been damaged by accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 US election, and Trump campaign collusion in the effort. The allegations are being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Trump has consistently denounced the inquiry as a ""witch hunt"".The 12 Russians indicted on Friday,externalwere targeted as part of Mr Mueller's investigation. Four intriguing lines in Mueller charges Protesters in Finland have been urging Mr Trump to focus on human rights ahead of his visit. Top Democrats including party chairman Tom Perez urged Mr Trump to cancel the talks, saying Mr Putin was ""not a friend of the United States"". On the Republican side, Senator John McCain said the summit ""should not move forward"" unless the president ""is prepared to hold Putin accountable"". Russia denied the hacking allegations, and said it looked forward to the talks as a vehicle for improving relations. US National Security Adviser John Bolton has said that both sides have agreed the meeting will have no set agenda. But he said he found it ""hard to believe"" Mr Putin would not expect the alleged election hacking to be brought up. ""That's what one of the purposes of this meeting is, so the president can see eye to eye with President Putin and ask him about it,"" he told ABC News. The two leaders will meet at the presidential palace in Helsinki Mr Trump has also been urged to raisethe poisoning of two people in the UKwho came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok on 30 June. Investigators believe the incident is linked to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in March. Mr Trump elaborated on what would be discussed at the summit during a joint news conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May last week. ""We'll be talking about Syria,"" he said. ""We'll be talking about other parts of the Middle East. I will be talking about nuclear proliferation."" This is not the first time US and Russian leaders have met in Helsinki. Finland remained politically and militarily neutral after World War Two, as the US and Soviet Union went headlong into the Cold War, making it an attractive meeting spot for the two superpowers. The city was a backdrop to the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which are credited for improving relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Helsinki remained a destination in the post-Soviet era, and the Trump-Putin summit is the fourth such meeting in the city. His tour has included a Nato summit in Belgium and a visit to the UK. Neither passed without controversy. Following the Nato summit, Mr Trump said the allies had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets butother leaders cast doubt on this claim. The UK visit also had its ups and downs after Mr Trump told a newspaper the US would probably not give the UK a trade deal under the terms of Mrs May's Brexit plans - and then later appeared to backtrack on this position. He also said Europe was ""losing its character"" because of immigration from Africa and the Middle East. On Sunday, just before he departed for Helsinki, Mr Trump described the European Union as a foe on trade. He told CBS News that European countries were taking advantage of the US and not paying their Nato bills. Why is Trump meeting Putin a big deal?

"The number of people moving to the UK from EU countries was the lowest it has been for nearly four years in 2017. But there was a rise in those coming from outside the EU, the Office for National Statistics said, with net migration the highest since 2011. Overall net migration, the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK for at least 12 months and those emigrating, was 282,000. The government wants to cut overall net migration to the tens of thousands. The ONS data,externalis for the first full calendar year since the Brexit vote. While the overall net migration was up by 33,000 on the previous year, statisticians said the figure was ""broadly stable"". UK 'will lose track of many EU migrants' This video can not be played BBC examines the statistics of migration over decades across the world The ONS figures showed there were 101,000 net migrants from the EU last year and 227,000 from outside the EU. There was also a record number of EU citizens emigrating from the UK, with an estimated 139,000 leaving in 2017. The only other year when the EU emigration figures came close to that level was in 2008 when 134,000 EU nationals left the UK. The migration report also showed: Net migration from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 - Poland, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia and Latvia - has fallen from 42,000 in the year before the referendum to 6,000 in 2017 Net migration from 14 longer-term member states such as Germany, Italy, Spain and France, has almost halved since the vote, falling from 84,000 in the 12 months to June 2016 to 46,000 last year An estimated 40,000 more Romanians and Bulgarians migrated to the UK than left last year - the joint lowest net migration figure for the two countries since the year to September 2014 The number of EU citizens coming to the UK ""looking for work"" decreased by a third (33%) from 55,000 in 2016 to 37,000 in the last year. Meanwhile, those coming to the UK for a definite job remained stable, the ONS said. ""What these statistics show is that more of the people who are coming to the UK are coming for the reasons we would want - to take up a definite job or to study,"" immigration minister Caroline Noakes said. While net migration is continuing to add to the UK population, the 2017 figure of 282,000 is down from record highs recorded in 2015 and early 2016. It is the highest for 18 months, however - and still well above the government target of less than 100,000. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Last year, 240,000 people from European Union countries came to live in Britain. The number of EU migrants has been falling since June 2016 - the month of the referendum - and is now at a similar level to mid-2014. At the same time, emigration of EU nationals from Britain has been steadily increasing and at 139,000 is the highest level on record. The EU emigration figures are a function of the number of EU nationals living in Britain; there are some 3.5 million in the country, so it's to be expected that departure levels are higher now than in the 1970s, '80s and '90s. Nevertheless, the fact they've risen so sharply would appear to be further evidence of the impact of the Brexit vote. As for migration from countries outside Europe, 311,000 people arrived in the UK last year - back to levels last seen in 2011. It suggests that even if the government takes greater control of EU migration after Brexit, the challenge of getting the right level of immigration from outside Europe remains. Emigration has shown a gradual increase since 2015 and is currently around 350,000, the ONS said. Immigration has stayed roughly stable at about 630,000, the report showed. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the new figures were ""very disappointing"", adding: ""It's time for the government to get serious about reducing immigration instead of caving into every demand of the immigration lobby."" Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the data suggests the UK is ""still an attractive country, but its allure for EU migrants has declined considerably over the past couple of years"". Shadow home secretary Diana Abbott said it was ""clear to almost everyone except Theresa May that the net migration target should go"". But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We remain committed to bringing net migration down to sustainable levels, and that is the tens of thousands.""

"Clooney made his name on TV series ER before turning to films George Clooney made more money last year than any actor across a 12-month period - thanks in part to the sale of the tequila company he co-founded. Forbes estimates the 57-year-old star made $239m (Â£180m) in pre-tax earnings in the year beginning 1 June 2017. That puts him second in itsannual list of the world's best-paid celebrities,external, a place behind boxer Floyd Mayweather. Kylie Jenner is placed third in the Celebrity 100 countdown, having made an estimated $166.5m (Â£125.5m) last year. Earlier this month Forbes said the social media star was on track to become ""the youngest-ever self-made billionaire"". U2, and British acts Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are also included in a top 10 alongside global football stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. The Celebrity 100 list ranks ""front of the camera"" stars around the globe using their estimated pre-tax earnings from 1 June 2017 to 1 June 2018. Of the 100 top-earning celebrities, just 15 were women - down one compared with last year's list. Times are pretty good for those who made it to this year's list: the world's 100 top-earning celebrities pulled in a combined $6.3bn (Â£4.8bn) over the past 12 months - up 22% from last year. Eleven superstars now cross the $100m (Â£75.6m) threshold - more than double the number from the last two years combined. Here's the top 10: Money Mayweather earned $285m in pre-tax annual earnings last year, and in doing so captured the top spot on Forbes' 20th annual ranking of the world's 100 highest-paid celebrities. The boxer's August 2017 fight versus Conor McGregor generated more than $550m (Â£415m) in revenue, with the fighter pocketing $275m of that. This is Mayweather's second number one spot on the Forbes list - the other was in 2015. Clooney's mammoth payday comes from the sale of his Casamigos tequila company to drinks giant Diageo in a deal worth $1bn (Â£753m). The star, who was recently injuredin a motorbike accident in Sardinia, founded the company in 2013 with friends Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman. Fashion guru Jenner is the youngest member of the Kardashian clan The youngest of the Kardashian sisters, Kylie Jenner has earned her place at number three after founding a cosmetics empire. A family reality show and 110 million followers on social media has also done its bit to help.  Forbes magazine saysKylie is now worth almost three times as much as her sister, Kim,at an estimated $900m (Â£680m) and is on her way to becoming the youngest self-made US billionaire. The 20-year old was a newcomer on the list last year, but has since had quite a significant jump up from 2017's 59th place. Judy Sheindlin speaking in 2017 Judy Sheindlin, AKA Judge Judy, comes fourth in the countdown with estimated earnings of $147m (Â£110m).

Bono performing at New York's Madison Square Gardens last month U2's Joshua Tree world tour in 2017 - followed closely by a second current world tour - has seen the Irish band's earnings jump up considerably. 2.7 million fans turned out to mark the band's 30th anniversary of their seminal album - making it the most lucrative outing for any artist last year. Coldplay's Chris Martin has plenty of cause for celebration with the publication of the Forbes list Coldplay are the first British act on the list. Putting them there was their A Head Full Of Dreams Tour, which grossed more than half a billion dollars (Â£377m) in its two-year, five-continent run. That total means Coldplay trails only U2's 360 Tour and The Rolling Stones' A Bigger Bang Tour on the list of all-time highest grossing tours. Lionel Messi's eighth position beat his country's last 16 world cup result In November 2017, Messi agreed a contract extension with his club Barcelona that will pay him an annual salary and bonus in excess of $80m (Â£60m), making him the highest-paid footballer. Add to that a lifelong deal with Adidas and other sponsorship contracts, including Gatorade, Pepsi, Ooredoo, Huawei and Hawkers, and things are looking pretty tidy for Leo. A theme park based on the Argentinian, the Messi Experience Park, is set to open in 2020 in the Chinese city of Nanjing. Sheeran is the world's highest-earning solo musician on the list. The 27-year old was the world's most streamed artist of 2017. His album Ã· was the biggest album of the year, racking up 3.1 billion streams around the world, while Shape of You became Spotify's biggest track of all time. He was one of the World Cup's top scorers, and this year also received his fifth Ballon d'Or. Having spent a lucrative nine years at Real Madrid, the football star made a Â£99.2m move to Italian side Juventus earlier this month. His lifetime contract with Nike is worth upward of $1bn (Â£754m). Kim launched the KKW Beauty range in 2017 Many of this year's best-paid celebrities have monetised their strong social media presence, and in doing so, have shot up the rankings of the top 100. Speaking to BBC News, Zack Greenburg, Forbes senior editor of media and entertainment said: ""Two of the biggest stories in entertainment this year are Kylie Jenner and The Rock, who have used their massive followings to make an ungodly amount of money. ""In Kylie's case, she's used it to make a business; and in Dwayne Johnson's, he takes his followers from film to film. It makes them an incredibly attractive prospect. ""They both have among the top 10 social media followings in the world, and it's no accident that they're in the top five on this list."" Similarly, Kim Kardashian West jumped from number 47 in last year's list to 30 this year - helped in no small part by the launch of her own cosmetics brand, KKW Beauty, in June 2017. ""Social media does play a massive part, but it's not the be-all and end-all,"" added Greenburg. ""George Clooney does almost no social media and he's number two on the list.""

"Harry Uzoka died outside his home in Shepherd's Bush A male model was knifed to death by another model who was ""not as successful"" as him in a row over a girl, a court has heard. Harry Uzoka, 25, died on the pavement outside his home in Shepherd's Bush, west London, after he was stabbed. The killing was the result of an argument between the victim and George Koh over Mr Uzoka's girlfriend, the Old Bailey heard. Mr Koh, 24, of York Way in Camden, denies murder. The Old Bailey was told Mr Uzoka called Mr Koh ""a fake"" on Instagram and arranged a fight after finding out Mr Koh claimed to have slept with Mr Uzoka's model girlfriend Ruby Campbell. Harry Uzoka arranged the fight after George Koh claimed he had slept with his girlfriend The jury was told a ""confrontation"" was arranged in Ollgar Road in Shepherd's Bush following a series of phone calls and messages on WhatsApp and Instagram. Mr Koh was joined by Merse Dikanda and Jonathan Okigbo, both 24, and Mr Uzoka recruited his flatmate Adrian Harper, the court was told. But while Mr Uzoka and his companion came armed with dumbbell bars, Mr Koh's group took at least three knives, including a machete, the court heard. ""It is not difficult to work out which side won. Uzoka and Harper were outnumbered and bars stand little chance against knives,"" prosecutor Richard Horwell QC told the hearing on Monday. Mr Koh's team set out to ""cause serious injury"", he said. Mr Uzoka and Mr Harper ran off when realised they were confronted with knives, but only Mr Harper got away, the court heard. The prosecutor told the court Mr Koh, who ""was also a model but not as successful as Uzoka"", had ""something of an obsession"" with Mr Uzoka, but that ""admiration for another model and his success had turned to contempt"". Jurors were told Mr Koh tried to delete his account and asked his mobile phone company to change his number. Three days after the stabbing, Mr Koh handed himself in to police and told officers that he had acted in self defence after being ""knocked to the ground"" by Mr Uzoka and ""had no intention"" to stab him in the chest. In a prepared statement, he told police: ""I feared that he would kill me or cause me serious injury. ""I was on the floor when he fell on to me. I maintain that my actions were reasonable given the circumstances."" The jury was told Mr Koh has pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing a knife. Mr Okigbo, from Camden in north London, denies murder. Mr Dikanda, of no fixed address, denies murder, possessing a machete on 11 January and possessing a knife on 25 January. The trial continues.

"The number of drivers breaking down after hitting potholes reached a three-year high between April and June, according to the RAC. The RAC reported a 15% rise from last year's second quarter in breakdowns caused by poor quality roads. The motoring body said roads had not recovered from February and March's severe weather and councils were ""not winning the battle"" against potholes. The government said it was spending Â£6bn to improve England's roads. The RAC was called to 4,091 pothole-related breakdowns between April and June in 2018, compared with 3,565 in the same period last year - and the most since 2015 (4,436). Incidents included broken suspension springs, damaged shock absorbers and distorted wheels. RAC chief engineer David Bizley said the figures meant the safety of road users was ""being put at risk"". Council left with Â£40m road repair bill Thousands claim pothole compensation Pothole road crash cyclist dies The Local Government Association said a pothole was being fixed by councils ""every 21 seconds"". But it said only ""long-term, consistent and fairer government investment"" would allow local authorities to embark on the widespread improvement of our roads that was ""desperately needed"". Most potholes develop on local roads which councils are responsible for, rather than motorways and trunk roads. In March, the governmentsaid it was giving an extra Â£100m to councils in England for road repairsfollowing the prolonged spell of freezing weather. In response to the RAC's latest figures, the Department for Transport said: ""We have listened to the concerns of road users and are already providing councils in England with over Â£6bn to help improve the condition of our local highways.

"Applicants have to carry baskets of sand uphill for more than three miles in under 48 minutes The Gurkhas will recruit women for the first time from 2020, and the selection process will be the same as for men. Women hoping to join will have to pass gruelling physical tests - including racing 3.1 miles (5km) uphill carrying 55lb (25kg) of sand in a wicker basket. Gurkhas, who are Nepalese, have been part of the Army for more than 200 years. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said it was ""right"" women were given the chance to serve in ""this elite group"". The change in direction comes three years after Nepal - traditionally a male-dominated society - elected its first female president, Bidhya Devi Bhandari. To be considered for the selection process, applicants must weigh more than 50kg (7.9 stone), be taller than 158cm (5ft 1in) and ""be able to complete eight underarm heaves"", the Army website says. The recruitment process takes place in Pokhara, central Nepal. Successful applicants are then flown to Catterick, North Yorkshire, for a 10-week training programme. Gurkha soldiers take part in Great North 10k What are the top jobs women have never had? Lt Gen Nick Pope CBE, deputy chief of the general staff and  colonel commandant for the Brigade of Gurkhas, said the decision reflected ""the openness and diversity of the British army"". He added the policy was ""consistent with the government's broader decision to open all ground close combat roles to women"". In 1815, after suffering heavy casualties in the invasion of Nepal, the British East India Company signed a peace deal that allowed it to recruit from the ranks of the former enemy. Following the partition of India in 1947, an agreement between Nepal, India and Britain meant four Gurkha regiments from the Indian army were transferred to the British army, eventually becoming the Brigade of Gurkhas. At its peak, during World War Two, 112,000 men were in the Gurkhas. More than 230,000 fought across both world wars, but their numbers have fallen dramatically since. Currently, there are about 3,000 Gurkhas - most are in the infantry but some are engineers, logisticians or signals specialists. The regiment, whose motto is ""Better to die than be a coward,"" still carry into battle their traditional weapon - an 18-inch (46cm) long curved knife known as a kukri.

"Marcio Gomes escaped the fire with his wife, Andreia, and two daughters - but his unborn baby died A fire station manager advised a Grenfell Tower resident to go back and get his children, despite fearing he ""probably would not survive"". Jason Oliff said it was an ""impossible decision"" with ""no right or wrong answer"", the Grenfell inquiry heard. Resident Marcio Gomes called 999 as he tried to flee the tower with his heavily pregnant wife and daughters, but he became separated from them. The family later escaped with help from firefighters, but the unborn baby died. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Why was 'stay put' Grenfell advice so disastrous? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast: Station Manager Oliff Mr Oliff was in the control room and in charge of passing information from 999 calls to firefighters at the scene in west London. He was called over to help the 999 call handler as she spoke to Mr Gomes, who was having trouble breathing in the smoke-filled stairwell as he escaped the 21st floor. Mr Gomes told the 999 call operator that he had become separated from his wife, Andreia, and asked whether he should continue or go back for her. ""The operator was asking me 'what do I say to him?',"" Mr Oliff said, adding it was a ""highly stressful situation and I did not have the luxury of deliberating over the choices"". He said: ""Having seen the events unfolding at Grenfell Tower on the television and having knowledge of the conditions in the stairwell, I thought it unlikely that the male would be able to make it back, find his wife and still make it out of the building with all of his children."" Marcio and Andreia Gomes lost their unborn child, who they had already named Logan Mr Oliff said he believed the survival time inside the burning tower without fire safety equipment was ""very limited"". He told Mr Gomes, who had his two young daughters with him, to keep going. ""After a few more floors the male informed the operator that he had now lost contact with his children,"" he said. ""The operator could hear the male calling out for his children, he was now in extreme distress. ""The operator was also understandably distressed, she informed me that the male didn't know what to do and again asked me 'what do I tell him?'. ""This was an impossible decision to make. There was no right or wrong answer I could give and I did not give this advice easily. ""I told the operator 'tell him to go back and get his daughters'. ""I knew in saying this, that the male probably wouldn't survive, but my thinking was that if it was me, I wouldn't want to get out of that tower without my family and live with that for the rest of my life."" A few months later, Mr Oliff said he found out that the Gomes family had survived after being helped by firefighters, but that the unborn baby, named Logan, had died. This video can not be played The Gomes tell the story of how they managed to escape the fire Mr Oliff, who is a station manager at Chiswick and Feltham North West Area, was working from Stratford on the night of the fire rather than the usual control room in Merton, which was closed for repairs. ""In 27 years as a firefighter I never expected to see a fire like this in London,"" he said. ""It is difficult to know what the London Fire Brigade could have done to deal with this fire any better than we did.""

"This video can not be played Blair Wilson posted a selfie on Facebook minutes after he was targeted in a homophobic attack A man who shared a defiant selfie following a homophobic attack, said he ""nearly fainted"" after Nicola Sturgeon praised him during her Pride speech. Blair Wilson posted a photograph of him smiling, with a black eye and blood running down his face, after the assault in Neilston, East Renfrewshire. He was attacked after confronting people who shouted abuse at him as he walked home. The first minister said Blair showed values that should define the country. The 21-year-old told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandradio programme: ""I had about 5,000 mails on Facebook from everyone I know saying 'oh my goodness,  I'm at pride and Nicola Sturgeon is speaking about you'. ""I nearly fainted. I could not believe it. ""My mum and dad and family had went on holiday a few days before. Obviously my mum had seen the video of Nicola Sturgeon on Facebook and she phoned me crying saying how proud she was of me. She couldn't believe the first minister was speaking about me."" This video can not be played The first minister said Blair showed values that should define the country Blair spoke to BBC The Social about the attack. He said he was walking home from his mum's house when he heard the abuse shouted at him. Defiant selfie of hate crime victim Nicola Sturgeon praises hate crime victim Blair Wilson - BBC News ""I was going to walk away but I had a moment where I was like 'I shouldn't be letting this happen in the place where I've lived for 21 years of my life',"" he said. ""So I walked over to the people who shouted and I just asked 'Why?'. I wasn't physical or anything, I was just curious as to why they felt the need to shout that at someone who was minding their own business."" He began to walk away but then the assailant followed him and kicked him in the chest and punched him in the nose. The first minister,who led thousands of people at Glasgow's Pride event, praised the 21-year-old's bravery. She said: ""Instead of cowering away, he spoke up and let me tell you this, the principles and values demonstrated by that young man of dignity, courage and compassion are the values that should define our country. ""So Blair, we all stand with you."" Nicola Sturgeon was speaking as she led Glasgow's Pride march Blair told BBC Scotland he now hopes that the support from the first minister and the reaction to his selfie will help to change people's views. He said: ""Since seeing my selfie, as trivial as it sounds, it can trigger an emotional connection with someone and I think that's when people really start to care about an issue. ""Nicola Sturgeon speaking about it at Pride as well really struck close to people who maybe wouldn't have necessarily thought about that being as big a deal right now."" He added: ""Seeing the comments and support from everyone is the best painkiller. ""I really hope people will look at the selfie and think, I know a wee boy like that, or I know a wee girl who is gay as well, or I know a little trans youth who is getting abuse from people in the street and I've not necessarily done anything to stop it.""

"Amazon employed singer Ariana Grande to promote Prime Day Shoppers thinking of taking part in internet giant Amazon's Prime Day are being warned that not all the items on sale could be the bargains they seem. Consumer group Which? said that the goods are often cheaper at other times of the year. However Amazon said its website was transparent, and consumers could compare price changes over time. The 36 hour sale - aimed at subscribers to the Prime shopping service - offers discounts on a range of goods. The deals are time-limited, with shoppers being told that some items are only available while stocks last. The heavily-promoted offers start at midday UK time on Monday, and are co-ordinated across the globe. Amazon criticised for misleading adverts Amazon opens a supermarket with no check-outs However, Which? warned that some goods could be bought more cheaply outside the promotion period. ""Although these time-limited sales events can offer great discounts, not all offers will be as good as they seem,"" said Adam French, Which? consumer rights editor. ""It can be easy to get swept along by the hype and excitement on the day, so we recommend preparing in advance and researching what you want to buy, to make sure you can tell the difference between a good deal and a dud on Amazon Prime Day."" Jonny Grant, an IT consultant from London, found that the price of a computer monitor on Amazon Prime actually went up at midday on Tuesday, from Â£299 to Â£354. ""I've been caught out,"" he told the BBC.  ""I didn't buy it, because I wouldn't want to reward them for this kind of price hike."" But Greg Hine, from Edinburgh University, said he'd found Prime Day to be fairly reasonable. ""Every year I get my protein powder for Â£29.99 instead of Â£48. I have to say Prime Day works for me."" Several websites track the prices on Amazon. One, called Lovethesales.com, agreed that some so-called bargains were not all they were cracked up to be. It said a Sony Playstation was currently being advertised with 14% off, at a price of Â£299. However on 28 November last year the same console was Â£40 cheaper. Other consumer groups questioned whether targeted sales messages on people's mobile phones should be allowed to continue unabated. ""There's so much data. Retailers can work out so much about us,"" said James Daley, the founder of Fairer Finance. ""It turns into a bombardment of high-pressure sales messages that can lead people to make the wrong decisions.  It's time for us to have a debate on whether more boundaries need to be drawn."" In response, Amazon said customers could see for themselves whether they were getting a bargain. ""One of the great things about shopping online is that customers can quickly and easily compare prices,"" the company said. ""For many of our deals the new price and the previous Amazon price can be seen at the product detail page so customers can make an informed decision."" The launch of Amazon Prime Day is accompanied by a big marketing budget. Pop band Take That performed at an ""Unboxing Amazon Prime Day"" event, while Ariane Grande opened a promotional concert in New York. Several British newspapers and websites also provided readers with direct online links to the shopping site. Many of them stand to make a small amount of money on each sale.

"The crocodiles ranged from full grown to young animals A mob of villagers has killed nearly 300 crocodiles at a sanctuary for the animals in the Indonesian province of West Papua. The slaughter was in retaliation for a local man thought to have been killed by one animal from the site. Officials and police said they were not able to stop the attack and may now press charges. The killing of a protected species is a crime that carries a fine or imprisonment in Indonesia. The local villager was killed on Friday morning while gathering vegetables on the crocodile farm's breeding sanctuary. Iceland accused of killing rare whale The model bitten by a shark while posing Can we save the Lord of the Rings toad? ""An employee heard someone screaming for help, quickly went there and saw a crocodile attacking someone,"" the head of Indonesia's Natural Resources Conservation Agency in West Papua said. After the funeral on Saturday, several hundred angry locals went to the sanctuary, armed with knives, shovels, hammers and clubs. Local media cite officials saying the mob first attacked the office of the crocodile farm and then went on to slaughter all 292 reptiles at the sanctuary. The farm was operating on a licence to breed protected saltwater and New Guinea crocodiles both for preservation and to harvest some of the animals.

"The speed limit through roadworks on motorways is normally 50mph (80km/h) Drivers could be allowed to travel faster through motorway roadworks on quiet days such as Sundays. Speed limits could be increased from 50mph (80km/h) to 60mph (97km/h) when there is less activity by road workers, Highways England announced. Highways England will test the plan which is aimed at reducing drivers' frustration at roadworks. The RAC welcomed a trial but said continued use of average speed cameras was also ""essential"". The safety of road workers is ""paramount"" said RAC spokesman Simon Williams. But ""the use of average speed cameras have been very successful in controlling speed"". ""Increasing the limit will do away with some of the frustration for drivers."" Highways England said various speed limits could also be used within one set of roadworks, meaning higher speeds are allowed when vehicles are further away from road workers. The agency said there were nearly 300 incidents a week of drivers entering coned-off areas or subjecting road workers to physical or verbal abuse on motorways or major A roads. Steph Savill, a motoring campaigner on behalf of women drivers, welcomed the announcement, saying she found roadwork restrictions ""frustrating and stressful"" and were difficult to justify ""when there are no workers on duty or other safety concerns"". She said: ""From personal experience, it's nearly impossible to keep to 50mph on a motorway in these circumstances so a small increase to 60mph will likely reduce driver stress and gets our vote."" Should the proposals be brought in, they would come into effect in late 2018 or early 2019, Highways England chief executive Jim O'Sullivan said. He added: ""People understand roadworks are necessary but are also frustrated by them. ""At the same time we have to ensure as they drive through them that they, and our road workers, are safe. ""So we are always thinking of new ways to improve journeys at the same time as keeping everyone as safe as we can. ""That is why over the next 12 months we will test changes to the design and operation of roadworks."" A studyby Highways England released in October 2017found 60% of drivers who drove at 60mph through a roadworks zone had a decreased average heart rate indicating a reduction in frustration. Motorways in Scotland and Wales are controlled by the countries' respective governments through devolved powers. Transport Scotland and the Welsh Government both said they currently had no plans to copy the Highways England plan.

"This video can not be played A man is rescued 60ft down a cliff in Dorset perched on a narrow ledge A paraglider pilot has been rescued after crashing into a cliff on Dorset's Jurassic Coast. The man was found on a narrow ledge about 260ft (80m) from the bottom of a cliff at Thorncombe Beacon on Sunday, shortly before 18:00 BST.

"The two leaders met with only translators as witnesses US President Donald Trump says his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was ""a good start"". After two hours of closed-door talks the two leaders went into a working lunch with their senior advisers. Speaking earlier, Mr Putin said it was time to discuss ""difficult multi-national issues"". Relations between Russia and the West were severely strained by Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Russia is also accused of meddling in the 2016 US election, a claim it strongly denies. Speaking before Monday's much-anticipated summit, Mr Trump said he hoped for an ""extraordinary relationship"" and blamed US-Russia tensions on previous administrations. Some US politicians had called for the summit to be cancelled after12 Russian military intelligence agents were chargedon Friday with hacking the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Live updates: Trump-Putin summit Why is Trump meeting Putin a big deal? Who's who in Trump-Russia drama?,external But writing on Twitter, Mr Trump put the blame for the deterioration in relations with Russia on ""years of US foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt"". In response,Russia's foreign affairs ministry tweeted: ""We agree."",external Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The tweets are likely to alarm White House advisers already nervous about the risks of ceding too much ground to the Russian leader during the talks. The two leaders were joined only by their interpreters during their two hours of face-to-face talks. Their summit comes after a tumultuous European tour that saw Mr Trump sharply criticise longstanding allies of the US over trade and military spending. This video can not be played Trump: I have low expectations for Putin meeting Russia has been criticised in the US because of its military support for President Bashar al-Assad in Syria as well as its destabilising actions in Ukraine. Relations have also been damaged by accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 US election, and Trump campaign collusion in the effort. The allegations are being investigated by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Trump has consistently denounced the inquiry as a ""witch hunt"".The 12 Russians indicted on Friday,externalwere targeted as part of Mr Mueller's investigation. Four intriguing lines in Mueller charges Protesters in Finland have been urging Mr Trump to focus on human rights ahead of his visit. Top Democrats including party chairman Tom Perez urged Mr Trump to cancel the talks, saying Mr Putin was ""not a friend of the United States"". On the Republican side, Senator John McCain said the summit ""should not move forward"" unless the president ""is prepared to hold Putin accountable"". Russia denied the hacking allegations, and said it looked forward to the talks as a vehicle for improving relations. US National Security Adviser John Bolton has said that both sides have agreed the meeting will have no set agenda. But he said he found it ""hard to believe"" Mr Putin would not expect the alleged election hacking to be brought up. ""That's what one of the purposes of this meeting is, so the president can see eye to eye with President Putin and ask him about it,"" he told ABC News. The two leaders will meet at the presidential palace in Helsinki Mr Trump has also been urged to raisethe poisoning of two people in the UKwho came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok on 30 June. Investigators believe the incident is linked to the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in March. Mr Trump elaborated on what would be discussed at the summit during a joint news conference with UK Prime Minister Theresa May last week. ""We'll be talking about Syria,"" he said. ""We'll be talking about other parts of the Middle East. I will be talking about nuclear proliferation."" This is not the first time US and Russian leaders have met in Helsinki. Finland remained politically and militarily neutral after World War Two, as the US and Soviet Union went headlong into the Cold War, making it an attractive meeting spot for the two superpowers. The city was a backdrop to the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which are credited for improving relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Helsinki remained a destination in the post-Soviet era, and the Trump-Putin summit is the fourth such meeting in the city. His tour has included a Nato summit in Belgium and a visit to the UK. Neither passed without controversy. Following the Nato summit, Mr Trump said the allies had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets butother leaders cast doubt on this claim. The UK visit also had its ups and downs after Mr Trump told a newspaper the US would probably not give the UK a trade deal under the terms of Mrs May's Brexit plans - and then later appeared to backtrack on this position. He also said Europe was ""losing its character"" because of immigration from Africa and the Middle East. On Sunday, just before he departed for Helsinki, Mr Trump described the European Union as a foe on trade. He told CBS News that European countries were taking advantage of the US and not paying their Nato bills. Why is Trump meeting Putin a big deal?

"PM Theresa May has set out her plans for Brexit - but EU bigwigs are in no hurry to comment for now Even the president of the United States now sees fit to weigh in on the Brexit path Theresa May is taking. Donald Trump has said, amongst other things, that if the prime minister is successful in her plan -formalised on Thursday in a White Paper,external- then that would make a future trade deal with the US far less likely. So how come key player Brussels remains so uncannily quiet about the paper? Brussels badgered the UK for months and months and months about coming up with a detailed proposal on how it envisions the future EU-UK relationship after Brexit. Now they have it, surely they have an opinion about it? As far as official responses go, the most we got from Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, was that he and his colleagues now need time to analyse the White Paper in detail. On the one hand: fair enough. It is a very dense document. But I feel the EU is hiding behind the paper's 98 pages of Brexit tech-talk. In private, EU diplomats make no secret at all of their rejection of large chunks of the White Paper. Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' - May Trump: Brexit plan could kill US trade deal Brussels has said since the beginning of Brexit negotiations that the UK can't pick and choose the ""best parts"" of EU membership and walk away from the rest when it leaves. Yet that's exactly how the White Paper is interpreted in EU circles. There is no way Michel Barnier will accept it as is. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, must calculate the best time to criticise the White Paper For Theresa May to get that ""deep and special"" access to the EU in trade terms, Brussels will certainly expect more concessions. But EU leaders are biding their time. Trying to calculate not if, but when, and how to get their criticisms across. They're very aware of the febrile political atmosphere in the UK and think if they make a quick comment or criticism of the White Paper, they'd be adding fuel to the fire. So if the EU is so keen for a soft Brexit - (of course we know, deep down, it would prefer no Brexit at all) - what concessions is Brussels prepared to make now to help shore up the prime minister's position in the political maelstrom at home? Worryingly few, is the answer if you're a fan of Theresa May or her White Paper. Brussels fears UK turmoil may lead to no-deal Brexit EU wonders if Theresa May has run out of 'Brexit fudge' Brexit: Why Brussels seems relaxed about the end game The EU still believes it holds pretty much all the cards in Brexit negotiations. I don't expect real whiffs of EU concessions before the last minute of the 11th hour this autumn. Can Theresa May hang on till then? And if she can, is she politically strong enough to strike a deal with Brussels and then sell it back home? Frankly, no one knows - and in the meantime, Brussels is stepping up contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. Not because the EU or Downing Street wants that - they really do not - but because the time allotted under EU law for a withdrawal agreement to be agreed and signed off by both parties is fast running out. In the meantime, EU diplomats try to sound upbeat: the White Paper is a great springboard from which to re-start face-to-face Brexit negotiations, they say. Those talks begin again behind closed doors on Monday. Trump and May meet amid Brexit storm May pitches trade deal at Trump dinner What happens now that a deal's been done?

"The number of people moving to the UK from EU countries was the lowest it has been for nearly four years in 2017. But there was a rise in those coming from outside the EU, the Office for National Statistics said, with net migration the highest since 2011. Overall net migration, the difference between the number of people coming to live in the UK for at least 12 months and those emigrating, was 282,000. The government wants to cut overall net migration to the tens of thousands. The ONS data,externalis for the first full calendar year since the Brexit vote. While the overall net migration was up by 33,000 on the previous year, statisticians said the figure was ""broadly stable"". UK 'will lose track of many EU migrants' This video can not be played BBC examines the statistics of migration over decades across the world The ONS figures showed there were 101,000 net migrants from the EU last year and 227,000 from outside the EU. There was also a record number of EU citizens emigrating from the UK, with an estimated 139,000 leaving in 2017. The only other year when the EU emigration figures came close to that level was in 2008 when 134,000 EU nationals left the UK. The migration report also showed: Net migration from eight eastern European countries that joined the EU in 2004 - Poland, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia and Latvia - has fallen from 42,000 in the year before the referendum to 6,000 in 2017 Net migration from 14 longer-term member states such as Germany, Italy, Spain and France, has almost halved since the vote, falling from 84,000 in the 12 months to June 2016 to 46,000 last year An estimated 40,000 more Romanians and Bulgarians migrated to the UK than left last year - the joint lowest net migration figure for the two countries since the year to September 2014 The number of EU citizens coming to the UK ""looking for work"" decreased by a third (33%) from 55,000 in 2016 to 37,000 in the last year. Meanwhile, those coming to the UK for a definite job remained stable, the ONS said. ""What these statistics show is that more of the people who are coming to the UK are coming for the reasons we would want - to take up a definite job or to study,"" immigration minister Caroline Noakes said. While net migration is continuing to add to the UK population, the 2017 figure of 282,000 is down from record highs recorded in 2015 and early 2016. It is the highest for 18 months, however - and still well above the government target of less than 100,000. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Last year, 240,000 people from European Union countries came to live in Britain. The number of EU migrants has been falling since June 2016 - the month of the referendum - and is now at a similar level to mid-2014. At the same time, emigration of EU nationals from Britain has been steadily increasing and at 139,000 is the highest level on record. The EU emigration figures are a function of the number of EU nationals living in Britain; there are some 3.5 million in the country, so it's to be expected that departure levels are higher now than in the 1970s, '80s and '90s. Nevertheless, the fact they've risen so sharply would appear to be further evidence of the impact of the Brexit vote. As for migration from countries outside Europe, 311,000 people arrived in the UK last year - back to levels last seen in 2011. It suggests that even if the government takes greater control of EU migration after Brexit, the challenge of getting the right level of immigration from outside Europe remains. Emigration has shown a gradual increase since 2015 and is currently around 350,000, the ONS said. Immigration has stayed roughly stable at about 630,000, the report showed. Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch UK, said the new figures were ""very disappointing"", adding: ""It's time for the government to get serious about reducing immigration instead of caving into every demand of the immigration lobby."" Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said the data suggests the UK is ""still an attractive country, but its allure for EU migrants has declined considerably over the past couple of years"". Shadow home secretary Diana Abbott said it was ""clear to almost everyone except Theresa May that the net migration target should go"". But the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We remain committed to bringing net migration down to sustainable levels, and that is the tens of thousands.""

"Volunteers show the outline of the Tankerton wreck An ""incredible"" Tudor shipwreck, found on Kent mudflats by a local history and archaeology group, will be protected. Timescapes discovered the wreck at Tankerton Beach, Whitstable, while hunting for World War Two pillboxes. The timbers, dating from the 16th century, protruded out of the sand. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has scheduled the wreck, and another in Camber Sands, for protection on the advice of Historic England. This week archaeologists will excavate the Tankerton wreck, hoping to uncover evidence of its cargo and personal items belonging to the crew. Excavating the wreck at Tankerton Experts from Wessex Archaeology, with the help of Timescape volunteers, surveyed the exposed remains, which measured more than 12m long and 5m wide (40ft by 16ft). Samples of the age of the wood revealed one oak plank comes from woodland in southern Britain and was felled in 1531. Wounded veterans explore 1906 shipwreck Shipwreck's latest artefacts revealed U-boat and merchant shipwrecks protected According to Historic England, the hull's construction suggests it is a late 16th or early 17th century single-masted merchant ship of around 100 to 200 tonnes. A second wreck discovered in 2016 at Camber Sands, East Sussex, is also being investigated. The Camber Sands wreck was discovered in 2016 Historic England said it is believed to be ""a substantial oak-built sailing vessel measuring 47.2m long"", and likely to date from the late 18th or early 19th century. Some of the timbers are of North American origin, and it is thought it could be the Avon which was lost in August 1852 with a cargo of timber. Duncan Wilson, head of Historic England, said: ""These two very different ships are equally fascinating and will shed light on our maritime past. ""Many of the ships that Historic England protects are accessible only to divers but when the sands shift and the tide is right, visitors to these beaches in Kent and Sussex can catch a glimpse of these incredible wrecks.""

"Tens of thousands of EU migrants could lose their right to be in the UK after Brexit - and the authorities will not know who they are, a new report warns. EU citizens must register using an online system to secure ""settled status"" when the UK leaves next March. The government has said it expects about 3.5m applications. But the Migration Observatory said ministers had no precise figures for how many EU citizens were living in the UK and how many plan to stay. The think tank, which is based at Oxford University, haspreviously warned,externalthat thousands of EU citizens could inadvertently become illegal residents in the UK after Brexit despite meeting the required criteria to stay. UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? Brexit: All you need to know Its latest report said: ""A whole host of factors, from lack of awareness to fear of rejection to simple disorganisation mean that some eligible EU citizens will not apply."" Last month, Home Secretary Sajid Javid launched what he a called a ""simple"" smartphone-based system, to enable EU citizens to carry on living in the UK legally when Britain leaves the EU. Applicants will be asked to provide their biographical information, declare whether they have any criminal records, and upload a facial photograph - and pay Â£65 for adults and Â£35 for children. EU citizens and family members who have been in the UK for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for settled status, meaning they are free to go on living and working in the UK indefinitely. Those who have arrived by 31 December 2020, but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status. Migration Observatory director Madeleine Sumption, said: ""It's reasonable to expect that even with a perfectly designed application and a great communications campaign, some EU citizens will fall through the gaps and fail to secure settled status. ""Government and civil society will want to know who and how many so that they can address the problem."" The think tank calls on the Home Office to establish a clear plan for measuring whether EU nationals living in the country have received ""settled status"". A Home Office spokesman said securing citizens' rights was a priority on which it had delivered. ""The draft Withdrawal Agreement published in March guarantees the rights of EU citizens and their family members living in the UK, and of UK nationals living in the EU,"" they said. ""But we recognise that we need to reach out to and support a wide range of people including vulnerable groups whose needs will vary, such as the elderly, those who cannot access or aren't confident with technology and non-English speakers.""

"Theresa May held talks with the US president during his UK visit The prime minister has warned Conservative MPs that they could be putting Brexit at risk. Some long-standing Leave campaigners are unhappy with herBrexit White Paper,externalwhich proposes a common rulebook with the EU for traded goods. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Theresa May urged the country to ""keep their eye on the prize"". Her message comes ahead of crucial Commons votes on trade and customs policy next week. Some members of her party's European Research Group (ERG) want to amend that legislation to scupper Mrs May's plans. The White Paper, which sparked the resignations of ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis, is aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg called it a ""bad deal for Britain"". US President Donald Trumptold the Sun newspaper,externalthe proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country. Hours later, however, he said a US-UK trade deal would ""absolutely be possible"". Trump: US-UK trade deal 'absolutely possible' Reality Check: What does Brexit White Paper reveal? Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan Mrs May said she has not seen any workable alternative to the White Paper - so voting against her legislation could lead to a ""disorderly and damaging Brexit"". The prime minister said the legacy of Brexit ""cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland"". She added that Brexit must not destroy the ""integrated supply chains and just-in-time processes on which jobs and livelihoods depend"". But Mrs May did offer some reassurance to those who worry she will make further concessions to Brussels. ""Our Brexit deal is not some long wish-list from which negotiators get to pick and choose,"" she wrote. ""It is a complete plan with a set of outcomes that are non-negotiable."" She added her Brexit plan would ""end"" both the free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK. This video can not be played Why Tory MPs are fighting over the government's Brexit white paper Long-standing Leave campaigners are not the only group likely to revolt, however. There are also fears that some former Remainers in her party will vote with Labour to compel her to negotiate a fully-fledged customs union with the EU. ""This would be the ultimate betrayal of the Brexit vote,"" she says. On Thursday, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he would analyse the details with the European Parliament and member states and was ""looking forward"" to negotiations with the UK next week. The UK is hoping the EU will back the White Paper proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. 18 October 2018:The key EU summit.

"This video can not be played Theresa May reveals the advice President Trump gave her over Brexit Donald Trump told Theresa May she should sue the EU rather than negotiate over Brexit, she has told the BBC. The US president said on Friday at a joint news conference he had given Mrs May a suggestion - but she had found it too ""brutal"". Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr what he had said, she replied: ""He told me I should sue the EU - not go into negotiations."" It came as another government member resigned over her Brexit plans. Robert Courts said he quit as a parliamentary private secretary - an unpaid ministerial aide - at the Foreign Office to ""express discontent"" with Mrs May's policy before key Brexit votes on Monday. ""I had to think who I wanted to see in the mirror for the rest of my life,"" he said in tweet. He could not tell his constituents he supported Mrs May's proposals ""in their current form,"" he added. Mr Courts replaced David Cameron as the Conservative MP for Witney, Oxfordshire in 2016. PM warns party not to put Brexit at risk Trump: US-UK trade deal 'absolutely possible' Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan Defending her Brexit blueprint on the Andrew Marr show, the prime minister said it would allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations, end free movement of people, and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. AWhite Paper,externalpublished on Thursday fleshed out details of her plan, which advocates close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services. Before the paper was published, Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigned, along with several junior government figures, saying it would not deliver the Brexit people voted for in the 2016 referendum. This video can not be played Prime Minister Theresa May and US President Donald Trump hold a joint press conference at Chequers Mrs May laughed off the president's legal action suggestion, but added: ""Interestingly, what the president also said at that press conference was 'don't walk away'. ""Don't walk away from those negotiations because then you'll be stuck. So I want us to be able to sit down to negotiate the best deal for Britain."" Donald Trump declined to spell out what his advice to Mrs May had been, in an interview with US TV network CBS, but added: ""Maybe she'll take it, it's something she could do if she wanted to. ""But it was strong advice. And I think it probably would have worked."" Ahead of his meeting with Mrs May, Mr Trumptold the Sun newspaper,externalher Brexit proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country. But hours later he said a US-UK trade deal would ""absolutely be possible"". This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg tells the BBC the prime minister's Brexit plan goes against promises she made Leading Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has called the White Paper a ""bad deal for Britain"". He told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""The government unfortunately believes that Brexit is not a good thing in itself, it seems to think it has to be tempered by non-Brexit."" He said Mrs May, who campaigned to keep Britain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had failed to grasp the ""enormously positive"" opportunities offered. He described her as a ""Remainer who has remained a Remainer"". He also said she would have to change her policy in order to get it through Parliament, without having to rely on Labour votes. Mrs May urged Brexiteers in her own party to ""keep their eye on the prize"" of Brexit - and said her plan was the only workable way to deliver it. Analysis by BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman Frankly, it is difficult to see any grounds for the UK suing the EU. Like any other member state, the UK can sue the EU in relation to any specific measure it has taken which breaches EU law. Such action would be heard at the European Court of Justice, the ultimate arbiter of EU law. An example would be if the UK was denied agricultural subsidies, or structural funds to which it was entitled under EU law. The Conservative government of David Cameron successfully sued when the European Central Bank said it would only license financial institutions within the Eurozone as clearing houses for transactions in euros. The UK and the EU have not reached a Brexit agreement yet, so there can be no action for breach of that agreement. Parties to a negotiation are under what are known as ""procedural duties"" - for instance, to act in good faith. But it is very difficult to bring an action, within a negotiation, on that basis. Some would say that even attempting to do so would seriously harm the negotiation. Mrs May's message comes ahead of crucial Commons votes on trade and customs policy in the coming week, with Tory Brexiteers tabling a series of amendments to the legislation. Mr Rees-Mogg said he was not expecting either the Customs Bill or the Trade Bill to be voted down at this stage. There are also likely to be amendments tabled by Remain supporting MPs. Reality Check: What does the Brexit White Paper reveal? Commons Brexit battles previewed Mrs May told Andrew Marr: ""Some people are saying they want to vote in the Trade Bill to keep us in the customs union. I say that's not acceptable, that's not what the British people voted for. ""Others are saying that perhaps we cannot have the bill at all. That would be damaging to our 'no deal' preparations. ""So let's just keep our eyes on the prize here. The prize is delivering leaving the European Union in a way that's in our national interest."" This video can not be played Theresa May faced questions on Brexit, leadership and President Trump Mrs May insists her plans would allow the UK to strike its own trade deals, despite agreeing a ""common rulebook"" with the EU on cross-border trade. She said such rules were needed to protect jobs in firms with supply chains that crossed borders and deal with the Irish border issue. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said Mrs May's ""so-called plan"" did not ""stand up to scrutiny"". ""No-one - not the public, Parliament or the Conservative party - is happy with Theresa May's offer. This has descended into a shambles,"" he said. Labour MP Ian Murray, a member of the People's Vote campaign, said the British people needed a vote on the final deal. Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson said it was not the party's policy to back another referendum - but said it should not be ruled out.

"Passengers have described the service as ""diabolical"" A troubled rail operator has said it is ""too early to say"" if its third new timetable in two months is causing disruption. Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern passengers have faced disruption since a new timetable began on 20 May. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) said the latest timetable would provide a ""more robust and reliable service"". On Monday it said: ""Our focus is on the evening peak and rest of the week as we introduce the new interim timetable."" Monday is the first working day of the new timetable, which GTR said ""provides passengers with a more robust and reliable service, gives priority to peak hour trains and seeks to reduce gaps in the service"". There has been a mixed reaction from commuters. One St Albans Commuter said: ""I just got on the 8:12. It's running on time and the train is full, but no worse than before the timetable change really."" Another said: ""So far it's looking ok this morning. My fear is the return when trains aren't in the right place for the new timetable."" In Harpenden, Hertfordshire, Charlotte Halkett tweeted that ""there still appear to be huge crowds & delays to trains"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

GTR, which oversees Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern routes, changed the time of every train on its timetable on 20 May, which saw some services withdrawn and further cancellations without any warning. In ahalf-page newspaper advert, initially placed in the Metro newspaper and since then replicated in local papers, it apologised and acknowledged it ""failed to launch new services as planned"" which has resulted in ""significant delays, cancellations and disruption"". A letter published in newspapers said the company apologised ""sincerely and unreservedly"" An interim timetable introduced on 4 June to improve performance saw about 6% of daily services removed, but reliability has continued to struggle. The operator said the changes would mean a 13% increase in services across the GTR network - 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London, creating space for 50,000 extra passengers at peak times. Its website said the timetable would continue to evolve over time. ""Once this interim timetable is bedded in, we will look to introduce more services to complete the intended May 2018 timetable,"" it said. A series of failures have been blamedfor causing the chaos, including Network Rail's late approval of the new timetables and delayed electrification projects Poor planning by train operatorshas also been blamed, and the decision by transport ministers to phase in the introduction of new GTR services The damaging impact of the new train timetable was demonstrated inpunctuality figures published by Network Rail on Monday GTR chief executiveCharles Horton resignedlast month Last week in the House of Commons, the government warned improvements to GTR services were ""simply not happening quickly enough"" and the train operator risks losing its franchise. Standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Cabinet Office minister and Aylesbury MP David Lidington said: ""We have launched a review of Govia Thameslink which will report in the next few weeks, and if those findings show that Govia is at fault we won't hesitate to take action whether that's fines, restricting access to future franchises or stripping them of the franchise. ""Passengers deserve far better than they're getting at the moment in terms of service and we will hold those operators to account.""

"Volunteers show the outline of the Tankerton wreck An ""incredible"" Tudor shipwreck, found on Kent mudflats by a local history and archaeology group, will be protected. Timescapes discovered the wreck at Tankerton Beach, Whitstable, while hunting for World War Two pillboxes. The timbers, dating from the 16th century, protruded out of the sand. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has scheduled the wreck, and another in Camber Sands, for protection on the advice of Historic England. This week archaeologists will excavate the Tankerton wreck, hoping to uncover evidence of its cargo and personal items belonging to the crew. Excavating the wreck at Tankerton Experts from Wessex Archaeology, with the help of Timescape volunteers, surveyed the exposed remains, which measured more than 12m long and 5m wide (40ft by 16ft). Samples of the age of the wood revealed one oak plank comes from woodland in southern Britain and was felled in 1531. Wounded veterans explore 1906 shipwreck Shipwreck's latest artefacts revealed U-boat and merchant shipwrecks protected According to Historic England, the hull's construction suggests it is a late 16th or early 17th century single-masted merchant ship of around 100 to 200 tonnes. A second wreck discovered in 2016 at Camber Sands, East Sussex, is also being investigated. The Camber Sands wreck was discovered in 2016 Historic England said it is believed to be ""a substantial oak-built sailing vessel measuring 47.2m long"", and likely to date from the late 18th or early 19th century. Some of the timbers are of North American origin, and it is thought it could be the Avon which was lost in August 1852 with a cargo of timber. Duncan Wilson, head of Historic England, said: ""These two very different ships are equally fascinating and will shed light on our maritime past. ""Many of the ships that Historic England protects are accessible only to divers but when the sands shift and the tide is right, visitors to these beaches in Kent and Sussex can catch a glimpse of these incredible wrecks.""

Finland remained politically and militarily neutral after World War Two, as the US and Soviet Union went headlong into the Cold War, making it an attractive meeting spot for the two superpowers. The city was a backdrop to the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which are credited for improving relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Helsinki remained a destination in the post-Soviet era, and the Trump-Putin summit is the fourth such meeting in the city. His tour has included a Nato summit in Belgium and a visit to the UK. Neither passed without controversy. Following the Nato summit, Mr Trump said the allies had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets butother leaders cast doubt on this claim. The UK visit also had its ups and downs after Mr Trump told a newspaper the US would probably not give the UK a trade deal under the terms of Mrs May's Brexit plans - and then later appeared to backtrack on this position. He also said Europe was ""losing its character"" because of immigration from Africa and the Middle East. On Sunday, just before he departed for Helsinki, Mr Trump described the European Union as a foe on trade.

""We'll be talking about other parts of the Middle East. I will be talking about nuclear proliferation."" This is not the first time US and Russian leaders have met in Helsinki. Finland remained politically and militarily neutral after World War Two, as the US and Soviet Union went headlong into the Cold War, making it an attractive meeting spot for the two superpowers. The city was a backdrop to the signing of the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which are credited for improving relations between the Soviet Union and Western countries. Helsinki remained a destination in the post-Soviet era, and the Trump-Putin summit is the fourth such meeting in the city. His tour has included a Nato summit in Belgium and a visit to the UK. Neither passed without controversy. Following the Nato summit, Mr Trump said the allies had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets butother leaders cast doubt on this claim. The UK visit also had its ups and downs after Mr Trump told a newspaper the US would probably not give the UK a trade deal under the terms of Mrs May's Brexit plans - and then later appeared to backtrack on this position. He also said Europe was ""losing its character"" because of immigration from Africa and the Middle East. On Sunday, just before he departed for Helsinki, Mr Trump described the European Union as a foe on trade. He told CBS News that European countries were taking advantage of the US and not paying their Nato bills. Why is Trump meeting Putin a big deal?

""It can take a long time to properly stamp out a grass fire and while we expect to have crews at the scene for some time, we will reduce the levels of crews and equipment which will also help get roads moving again.""
