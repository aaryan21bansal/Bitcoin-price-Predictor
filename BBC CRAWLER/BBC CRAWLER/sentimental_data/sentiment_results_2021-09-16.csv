"Tests similar to this one, showed the dangers of cladding as early as 2004, it has emerged Leaked test results suggest the government and construction industry had early evidence of the dangers posed by cladding, 13 years before the Grenfell Tower fire. Panels, commonly used on buildings in the UK, failed fire tests carried out in 2004. The results, marked ""Commercial in confidence"", were circulated within an industry advisory group. They were recently passed to the BBC and, until now, never made public. Hundreds of thousands of flat owners are now threatened with large bills because of construction materials which pose a risk in fires. The 2004 results were among the first from a British test of full-scale building systems, developed in the late 1990s when there were growing concerns in Parliament about the risks of cladding. The tests were part of research commissioned by the then Labour government to determine what standards building systems should have to meet. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell cladding not 'uniquely dangerous' Five cladding systems were tested, including one with aluminium panels, although the primary aim was not to assess the risk of particular designs The aluminium and plastic cladding at Grenfell has been blamed for spreading the fire. Two were constructed from high pressure laminate (HPL) boards, formed from wood, or paper fibre, widely used on modern apartment blocks in the UK. In the tests, all five cladding systems were judged to have failed against ""proposed performance criteria"". Most of the tests were carried out without using ""fire breaks"" - extra components which should be fitted to block the spread of flames. However, fire breaks were used in one high pressure laminate panel system, but it still failed. Zoe Bartley bought a three-room flat in Chelmsford four years ago, and with her partner Ash, now has a baby. They are desperate to move to a bigger home, but the cladding crisis means they cannot sell the flat. This video can not be played Zoe Bartley bought a flat in Chelmsford four years ago but can't sell it due to safety concerns It has HPL panels, as well as wooden balconies and missing fire breaks, Zoe finds it ""disgusting"" that the test results were not circulated more widely. The couple are anticipating a bill of tens of thousands of pounds to remove the dangerous materials, which could bankrupt them. ""There's no finish line, and it's all-consuming at times,"" Zoe says. ""We are very angry that we've been put in this situation. ""We've done everything right. Everything by the book: 'Buy a property and set yourself up for the future.' ""I might end up bankrupt by the time I'm in my 30s."" Her building is lower than 18 metres, so does not qualify for government funding. The UK Cladding Action Group called the test results ""staggering new evidence which shows the government and its advisers knew these materials were dangerous, but simply stood back and allowed them to be installed on hundreds of thousands of buildings. ""The British state knew from this moment on that it was gambling with a disaster in a high-rise, but it chose not to act."" Jonathan Evans, director of Ash and Lacy, a major UK supplier of cladding systems, said he had never seen the results, and described them as ""really vital bits of information"" which would have helped assess fire risks after Grenfell. He said that when poor test data is not made public, it creates a bias towards tests with successful outcomes. ""We all proceed along the route of thinking these systems are safer than they are, until there's a disaster."" Not making poor test data public creates a bias towards tests with successful outcomes, argues Jonathan Evans He said a lack of public information about cladding systems in the 2000s may have resulted in governments not abandoning a controversial British standard for building materials, known as Class 0. The Grenfell Tower inquiry has heard evidence that this standard was much easier to meet than a stricter European classification, and that keeping it as an option in England and Wales allowed combustible materials to be installed on thousands of buildings. If Class 0 had been abandoned and a ban on combustible materials introduced, Grenfell might not have happened, Dr Evans said. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) described the 2004 tests as ""experimental... for a different purpose"" than the rounds of testing ordered in the wake of the Grenfell disaster. They were carried out to ""to check the criteria for testing"" rather than to assess the ""intrinsic safety of building materials"", officials said. The findings fed into a review of technical standards used by building designers to assess the safety of cladding. An MHCLG spokesman said: ""We are taking action to improve building safety where successive governments have failed, through our Building Safety Bill, which marks the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years, with more rights and protections for residents and a Â£5bn investment to remove unsafe cladding. ""The new Building Safety Regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for buildings over 18m and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings, ensuring products are removed from the market if they do not meet regulation."" The Building Research Establishment, which carried out the tests and circulated them to the industry advisory group, refused to comment. Next month the Grenfell Tower public inquiry will begin examining evidence of what governments knew about the risks of cladding fires before the 2017 disaster, and what they did about it.

"This video can not be played 'We don't have a lorry driver shortage problem' John Lewis is chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. Retailers have been grappling with a host of supply chain problems from driver shortages to shipping delays. John Lewis chair Sharon White said the business was throwing everything at the issues to make sure Christmas would not be disrupted. The retailer recorded a pre-tax loss of Â£29m for the six months to 31 July. That compares with a Â£635m loss for the same period last year. Sales for the group rose by 6%, aided by strong demand for homeware, fashion, nursery furnishing and Waitrose online grocery sales. John Lewis has 34 department stores and 331 Waitrose supermarket stores alongside its online operation. John Lewis to create thousands of Christmas jobs John Lewis and Waitrose plan to cut 1,000 jobs ""We're acting hard and we're acting fast to make sure we can still deliver a fantastic sparkly Christmas to our customers,"" Ms  White told the BBC. She added that the department store chain had introduced a host of measures to help manage labour shortages: ""We've raised wages for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers and we're really beginning to see the results of that."" There is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000, a Road Haulage Association survey of its members estimates. This has led to a chronic lack of materials for the construction sector, such as cement and timber, as well as problems for the manufacturing sector. Christmas is when many retailers make most of their profits, including John Lewis. And it's throwing everything at it to make sure its stock arrives on time. The pandemic has wreaked havoc for the flow of goods around the world. There's still a shortage of containers and it's also tough getting a space on the vast ships that carry them from China. Freight costs have also rocketed. And if your stock does turn up as planned, you've got to make sure you have drivers to get the goods to distribution centres and on to stores. Add in the uncertainty over Covid and no wonder retailers are even more nervous than usual about the all important festive season. Ms White said the John Lewis Christmas campaign in stores would be delayed by two weeks. John Lewis said it was focusing on expanding its products and offerings for the holiday season, including 10 new Christmas emporiums in John Lewis and expanding areas related to the department store within Waitrose supermarkets. However, Ms White sought to temper expectations: ""We're not through Covid and there's more uncertainty than we would like."" John Lewis has announced plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers for the winter She said there were still containers stuck in various parts of the world. ""We're acting at every single part in the supply chain to ensure that Christmas is saved this year,"" she said. ""Our customers hopefully won't see anything,"" she added. ""We're on track. But so far, we don't see any significant problems."" On Wednesday, the retailer announced plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers for the winter. The partnership is hiring people for its supermarkets, department stores and warehouses, including delivery drivers for its online grocery division. It is also looking to fill 550 permanent, full-time, driver and warehouse jobs. New joiners will be offered free food and drink to ""help ensure we can attract the help we need"", it said.

"China has demonstrated increasing power and influence in the Asia Pacific raising concerns amongst global players A new security partnership in the Asia-Pacific will see the UK and US provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines. American officials have said the move was not aimed at countering Beijing. However experts say the Aukus agreement signals a paradigm shift in strategy and policy across the region. The timing of the new deal is particularly significant. It comes just a month after the US exit from Afghanistan, when doubts have been raised in multiple quarters about US commitment in the region. Britain too is eager to be more involved in the Asia-Pacific especially after its exit from the European Union and Australia is increasingly concerned about China's influence. ""It is a 'big deal' because this really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific,"" Guy Boekenstein, senior director of defence and national security at Australia's Northern Territory government, told the BBC. ""It also publicly demonstrates our combined stance on this and commitment to a stable and secure Indo-Pacific region - one that for the past 70 years has led to the prosperity of all in the region, including China's economic growth."" The agreement involves the sharing of information and technology in a number of areas including intelligence and quantum technology as well as the acquisition of cruise missiles. But the nuclear submarines are key.  They are to be built in Adelaide in South Australia and will involve the US and the UK providing consultation on technology for their production. ""A nuclear submarine has enormous defence capabilities and therefore ramifications for the region. Only six countries in the world have nuclear submarines. They are a really powerful deterrent capability without giving them nuclear weapons,"" Michael Shoebridge, director of defence, strategy and national security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said. UK, US and Australia launch pact to counter China UK to shift foreign policy focus after review China warns UK as carrier strike group approaches Nuclear submarines are much more stealthy than conventional ones - they operate quietly, are able to move easily and are harder to detect. At least eight submarines will be supported, although it's not clear when they will be deployed. The process will take longer due to a lack of nuclear infrastructure in Australia. They will not be nuclear armed, only powered with nuclear reactors. ""Let me be clear: Australia is not seeking to acquire nuclear weapons or establish a civil nuclear capability,"" Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. President Biden added that there would be an initial 18-month consultation period with teams from the three countries to decide how it would work and to ensure compliance with non-proliferation commitments. However, the move does show that the US and UK are willing to take the big step of exporting nuclear technology to a non-nuclear powered nation, according to Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia Programme at the Stimson Center. And that is what makes the partnership so unique. This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China ""This technology is extremely sensitive. This is frankly an exception to our policy in many respects, I do not anticipate that this will be undertaken in other circumstances going forward. We view this as a one-off,"" a US official told Reuters, adding that Washington had shared nuclear propulsion technology only once before - with Britain in 1958. In recent years, China has demonstrated increasing power and influence in the region. ""We hear words about co-operation and then we see the threats against Taiwan and events in Hong Kong and the rapid militarisation of the South China Sea. So really when it comes to strategic issues, deterrents seem to be the only thing that makes sense against China,"" Mr Shoebridge said. The US has been investing heavily in other partnerships in the region too with Japan, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as India and Vietnam. This deal could benefit all of them, according to Mr Shoebridge, in the face of concerns about China's growing power. ""The region will appreciate that. This is part of a geopolitical shift which is driven by one big thing. And that is the direction that Xi Jinping is taking. This announcement fits with the growing participation of the world's biggest democracies to deter China from using its power"" Mr Shoebridge added. The response has reportedly been positive, even if it has been a quiet recognition. President Biden will host the first in-person meeting of leaders of the ""Quad"" group of countries next week Bonnie Glaser, director of the Asia programme at policy think tank the German Marshall Fund said: ""My understanding from people in the administration - having talked to allies and partners who have an interest in peace and security in the Indo-Pacific - is that there was nothing negative. There is support in the region for deterrence and for having US presence and military presence in the region."" One relationship that will undoubtedly change as a result of the agreement is the one between China and Australia. The two nations have been strong trade partners in the past with a large number of Chinese students choosing to study in Australia. However, political relations deteriorated after Australia backed a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. The pact shows Australia is aligning itself with the US and UK but also signals a vote of confidence in Australia which is looking to play a more active role in Asian security. ""Just because Australia has nuclear submarines doesn't mean it is more powerful than China. It does change the balance of power in the region. If China does face a security situation in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, it will affect the military preparedness or response that China will have to prepare for. It does change the power equilibrium in the region,"" Ms Sun told the BBC. Chinese students 'fear speaking out' in Australia Australia escalates wine dispute with China 'We should unite against China' - Kevin Rudd In response to the deal, China's embassy in Washington said the governments involved ""should shake off their Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice"". However, the reaction on the mainland might be even stronger. ""What's Chinese for apoplectic? One can expect a fiery-hot reaction from Beijingâ¦ This gives Australia and the US another tool in the toolbox to deter China,"" William Choong, senior fellow in regional strategic and political studies at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, said.

"This video can not be played Watch: Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China China has criticised a historic security pact between the US, UK and Australia, describing it as ""extremely irresponsible"" and ""narrow-minded"". The deal will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time. It is being widely viewed as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea. The region has been a flashpoint for years and tensions there remain high. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the alliance risked ""severely damaging regional peace... and intensifying the arms race"". He criticised what he called ""the obsolete Cold War... mentality"" and warned the three countries were ""hurting their own interests"". Chinese state media carried similar editorials denouncing the pact, and one in the Global Times newspaper said Australia had now ""turned itself into an adversary of China"". ANALYSIS: Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED: Tensions in the South China Sea The US is sharing its submarine technology for the first time in 60 years, having previously only shared it with the UK. It means Australia will be able to build nuclear-powered submarines that are faster and harder to detect than conventionally powered fleets. They can stay submerged for months and shoot missiles longer distances - although Australia says it has no intention of putting nuclear weapons on them. The new partnership, under the name Aukus, was announced in a joint virtual press conference between US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning. And while China was not mentioned directly, the three leaders referred repeatedly to regional security concerns which they said had ""grown significantly"". ""This is an historic opportunity for the three nations, with like-minded allies and partners, to protect shared values and promote security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,"" a joint statement read. The Aukus alliance is probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two, analysts say. It means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. While they are the big-ticket item in the deal, cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies will also be shared. Australia will also acquire long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, and allow more US troops to be stationed in the country's north. ""This really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter [China's] aggressive moves,"" said Guy Boekenstein from the Asia Society Australia. Boris Johnson later said the pact would ""preserve security and stability around the world"" and generate ""hundreds of high-skilled jobs"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that China was ""embarking on one of the biggest military spends in history... Our partners in those regions want to be able to stand their own ground."" This video can not be played Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea? In recent years, Beijing has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea. It has been increasingly assertive over what it says are centuries-old rights to the contested region, and has been rapidly building up its military presence to back up those claims. The US has bolstered its military presence too, and has been investing heavily in other partnerships in the region such as with Japan and South Korea. Having the submarines stationed in Australia is critical to US influence in the region, analysts say. The Western powers have also been wary of China's infrastructure investment on Pacific islands, although it remains below US and Australian spending there. China is Australia's biggest trading partner, and in the past, the two have maintained good relations. But in recent years that has broken down. Australia has accused Beijing of interfering in its domestic politics, blocked Chinese investment, and banned Chinese telecom giant Huawei from building Australian tech infrastructure. The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' Canberra also echoed a call by the US last year for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. Beijing's response was to deliver a series of trade punishments - sanctioning over a dozen Australian goods.It has slapped Australian wine with taxes of up to 200%. Australia hopes the new alliance will also help cushion the economic blowback. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday: ""Beijing has seen over the past months that Australia will not back down and the threats of economic retaliation and pressure simply will not work."" But France has also reacted angrily to the new pact, because it means Australia will now abandon a $50bn (â¬31bn; Â£27bn) deal with it to build 12 submarines. ""It's really a stab in the back,"" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. ""We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed."" The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell said he understood why France was disappointed by the deal, adding that the EU was not consulted about the new alliance. ""This forces us once again... to reflect on the need to make the issue of European strategic autonomy a priority. This shows that we must survive on our own,"" he said on Thursday. Secretary Blinken said the US cooperated ""incredibly closely"" with France and would continue to do so, adding that ""we place fundamental value on that relationship, on that partnership"".

"A previously unseen Vincent van Gogh drawing of an exhausted old man has been discovered, a museum dedicated to the artist has confirmed. Study for Worn Out was drawn early in the artist's career in 1882, the Van Gogh Museum said on Thursday. The sketch has been been sitting in a Dutch family's private collection for more than a century. But on Thursday, it went on display at the Amsterdam museum for the first time. The public will be able to see it until 2 January, before it is returned to the private collection. The small pencil drawing, signed ""Vincent"", depicts an elderly labourer dressed in a waistcoat, trousers and boots, sitting on a wooden chair with his head in his hands. ""This one has never been seen before anywhere. It's the first time that this drawing is out in the open,"" said Teio Meedendorp, senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum. He told the BBC it was ""absolutely impossible"" to say how much it was worth. Van Gogh appeared to have used  the drawing as the basis for a slightly different version of the drawing shortly afterwards, which he preferred, and which is currently in the museum's collection under the title Worn Out. The artist made Study for Worn Out when he was living in the Hague and still learning to draw at around the age of 29. Experts say it offers an exceptional insight into Van Gogh's working process at the time. The museum's director, Emilie Gordenker, said the team were ""delighted with this discovery"". ""We are very happy to have made a contribution to our specialist field,"" she added. ""It's quite rare for a new work to be attributed to Van Gogh. We're proud to be able to share this early drawing and its story with our visitors."" The owner of the work, who wants to remain anonymous, asked the museum to determine whether the drawing could be attributed to Van Gogh. 'Unseen' Van Gogh painting fetches Â£11m at auction Van Gogh: How London inspired a genius Van Gogh suffered 'episodes of delirium' In a statement, Meedendorp said: ""In stylistic terms, it fits perfectly with the many figure studies we know from Van Gogh's time in The Hague and the connection with Worn Out is obvious. ""The artist began by drawing a grid on the paper, which tells us that he worked with a perspective frame to help him capture a figure quickly with the correct proportions. He then worked the sheet up in his characteristically expressive drawing style: not refined, but with energetic scratches and strokes and laying down contours, in search of a pithy image with special attention to effects of light and shade. ""In terms of the materials, you also find everything you'd expect in a Van Gogh drawing from this period: a thick carpenter's pencil as medium, coarse watercolour paper as support, and fixing with a solution of water and milk. ""There are traces of damage in the corners on the back of the drawing, which we can link to the way Van Gogh customarily attached sheets of paper to his drawing board using wads of starch.'"" A Street Scene In Montmartre fetched Â£11.2m at auction in March The announcement comes six months after a Van Gogh painting of a Paris streetwent on display for the first timeafter spending more than 100 years behind closed doors. A Street Scene In Montmartre has been owned by a French family for most of the time since it was painted in 1887. The paintingwent on to fetch 13.09 million euros (Â£11.2m)at auction in March.

"Sir Keir Starmer is ""bereft of vision"" and needs to let voters know what he stands for, Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey has told the BBC. Mr McCluskey - who is standing down after 11 years at the head of Britain's biggest union - said he ""desperately hopes"" Sir Keir will be the next PM. But he said he was not optimistic about the Labour leader's chances at the next election as things stand. He advised Sir Keir to learn from Jeremy Corbyn - and Tony Blair. Although a frequent critic of Mr Blair, the Unite leader said: ""Everybody knew what he stood for before he was elected, he offered an alternative, he offered a vision."" Unite union elects first female leader Starmer should be inspired by Biden - TUC leader And he said Mr Corbyn had the same qualities, which ""people bought into"". ""At the moment we are bereft of a vision - and that is a real, real problem that Keir has to address,"" he added. ""I will be accused of not being helpful to Keir, but in actual fact I want to do the opposite by saying to him everybody says 'well, nobody knows what Labour stands for, nobody knows what Keir stands for'. ""And in those situations, the reality is that you don't enthuse people."" He argued that the only way to win back so-called Red Wall seats lost to the Conservatives was to ""unite"" the party and end attacks on the left. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn with Unite chief Len McCluskey at Labour conference Mr McCluskey fell out with Sir Keir when the Labour leader suspended his close ally Jeremy Corbyn from the Parliamentary party. He has accused the party leadership of going back on a deal to reinstate Mr Corbyn - an allegation which Sir Keir's office denies. He argued that bringing Mr Corbyn back into the Labour fold would help mend what he described as a ""broken party"" but admitted he was now ""pessimistic"" about that happening. He was speaking to the BBC at the launch of his autobiography, Always Red. The launch party, in a room above a Westminster pub, was packed with leading figures from the Labour left, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and ex-communications chief Seumas Milne. Mr Corbyn gave a speech praising Mr McCluskey's leadership of Unite - and for his ""support and friendship during some very difficult times"", particularly during the failed ""coup"" against him in 2016. In his speech, Mr McCluskey said Labour had come within ""touching distance"" of power at the 2017 general election, as the country ""embraced an unashamedly radical prospectus put forward by Jeremy Corbyn"". Speaking afterwards, he said Labour's failure to ""respect"" the result of the Brexit referendum at the 2019 general election was the biggest mistake the party had made in recent years. Sharon Graham is due take over from Mr McCluskey as Unite general secretary after winning a leadership contest in August. She has said her focus will continue to be on workplace rights rather than internal Labour party politics or ""settling old scores"" at Westminster.

"This video can not be played A look at a few of the ministers who have been promoted and demoted in Boris Johnson's cabinet reshuffle Boris Johnson is putting the finishing touches to his reshuffle after making significant changes to his top team. On Wednesday, the PM fired both Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, before replacing Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with Liz Truss. He has now moved on to confirming which junior ministers are in or out of jobs. But one ousted minister, John Whittingdale, told BBC's Newscast that the new team could lack experience. In some of the latest manoeuvres, Conor Burns, who resigned as a trade minister in 2020 after a report foundhe used ""veiled threats"" to aid his father in a financial dispute, returned to the front bench as a Northern Ireland minister. Others moved to more high-profile ministerial roles on Thursday included Alex Chalk, who was appointed Solicitor General, and Skills Minister Gillian Keegan, who now joins the Department for Health and Social Care. But Justin Tomlinson lost his job as minister for disabled people in the same department, while Matt Warman was sacked as minister of digital infrastructure. Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Liz Truss: fast track to foreign secretary BBC specialists on Boris Johnson's reshuffle Former Brexit and Northern Ireland Minister, Robin Walker, has gone to the Department for Education, where he will work with the new Secretary of State, Nadhim Zahawi. And Helen Whately, who was the minister for social care, has been moved to the Treasury, but Jesse Norman joined the list of sackings. Earlier on Thursday, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general at the Cabinet Office to become a minister at the trade department. Mr Whittingdale - who lost his job as data minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport - said his post had been one he ""loved"" and was ""sad to give up"". He also revealed some of the PM's appointments ""came out of the blue"". The former minister told Newscast: ""I understand that every prime minister has to make room to allow people to be brought forward. I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. ""Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do."" There were big winners from the reshuffle too, included Nadine Dorries, who was promoted from being a junior health minister into her first cabinet-level jobas culture secretary. The Mid Bedfordshire MP is probably best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Ms Truss, who is the Tory party's first female foreign secretary - and only the second woman to hold the role, following Labour's Margaret Beckett - said she was delighted by the appointment and would use the role to ""promote a positive, outward vision of global Britain"". Other changes made on Wednesday included: Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick being fired and replaced by Michael Gove Treasury minister Steve Barclay replacing Mr Gove as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden trading his role of culture secretary to be minister without portfolio at the Cabinet Office and Conservative Party co-chair Anne-Marie Trevelyan being promoted to replace Ms Truss as international trade secretary And Mr Raab being moved from the Foreign Office to become justice secretary, though he will also have the formal title of deputy prime minister Former Justice Secretary Mr Buckland's sacking was greeted with some surprise, with a number of Labour MPs tweeting praise for him and senior Conservative Sir Bob Neill - who chairs the Commons Justice Committee - saying he ""deserved better"". In aletter to the prime minister,externalafter his dismissal, Mr Buckland called for more investment in the justice system, adding that ""years of underfunding"" had made it harder for it to recover from the effects of the pandemic. Nadine Dorries appeared unsure of her promotion when she arrived at Downing Street on Wednesday New Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Mr Gove will also get the added responsibility of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda - which it claimed would spread wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum. The Daily Telegraph reported,externalthat Mr Dowden, following his appointment as the Tory party's new co-chairman, had told staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters to start preparing for a general election which could be in 20 months' time. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done. Whether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case. Nearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister. Read more from Laura Mr Johnson continued making changes late into the night on Wednesday as he got the reshuffle of more junior ministers under way, ahead of the further changes on Thursday. Long-serving Nick Gibb was sacked from his role at the Department for Education, while Caroline Dinenage lost her job as a culture minister, and Luke Hall was fired as a local government minister. Amanda Milling, who was removed as Conservative Party co-chairwoman, has become a Foreign Office minister. Julia Lopez has been moved from the Cabinet Office to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, while Greg Hands left the Department of International Trade for a new brief as business minister.

"Sir Clive Sinclair demonstrates his ill-fated electric C5 vehicle in 1985 Inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, who popularised the home computer and invented the pocket calculator, has died at his London home aged 81. His daughter Belinda Sinclair said he passed away on Thursday morning after having cancer for more than a decade. Sir Clive's products included the ZX series of computers and his ill-fated C5 electric vehicle. He was still working on his inventions last week ""because that was what he loved doing"", said Ms Sinclair. ""He was inventive and imaginative and for him it was exciting and an adventure, it was his passion,"" she added. Obituary: A tireless inventor Sinclair C5 'was ahead of its time' His ZX Spectrum computers brought affordable personal computing to the masses - selling in their millions across the world. However, in a BBC interview in 2013, Sir Clive revealed he did not, at that time, use computers himself. ""I don't like distraction,"" he explained. ""If I had a computer, I'd start thinking I could change this and that, and I don't want to. My wife very kindly looks after that for me."" This video can not be played Sir Clive Sinclair on personal computing Unlike the ZX Spectrum, his attempt to launch an electric vehicle was not successful. The C5 launched in 1985 and buyers were disappointed with its limited range, slow speed and inability to climb hills. It caused Sir Clive severe financial problems. His daughter said: ""I think sometimes he was a bit too early [with his inventions]. ""He was very good at imagining things that people might like or might need, even though they didn't know they wanted them."" He was a devoted father and grandfather who will be missed by her children Samuel, Henry and Florence, Ms Sinclair said.

"This video can not be played 'Why did my mother have to lie waiting on an ambulance?' An 86-year-old woman had to wait eight hours for an ambulance after falling and breaking her hip at home. Lillian Briggs, who has Parkinson's, skin cancer and has had two heart attacks, was left lying on her kitchen floor in agony after blacking out. Her son, Robert Ewing, and his sister rang for an ambulance a number of times only to be told their mother was in the system but was not a priority. Mr Ewing told BBC Scotland: ""I thought she was going to die in front of us."" The Scottish Ambulance Service apologised for the delay and confirmed it was investigating the circumstances. Chief executive Pauline Howie told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""These waits are appalling and they are not something we aspire to as an ambulance service."" Military to be called in to help ambulance crews 'There are so many calls and not enough ambulances' Ambulance boss 'sorry' over patient waiting times Health secretary faces criticism over ambulance plea After receiving a call from his sister following his mother's fall in Edinburgh on Monday, the 60-year-old found his mother semi-conscious in a confused state. His sister kept calling for an ambulance but after seven hours he called them himself and was told they knew about his mother, she was on the system and could he stop calling. ""I said hopefully you'll be here before my mother dies because my mum's in a bad way now,"" he said. ""I just held my mum's hand. She had a couple of bruises and a bashed face so I wiped her face and reassured her, put a cover over her to try to keep her warm as best I could - I couldn't move her because she was in a lot of pain - really bad pain. ""We aren't medically trained, we just did our best. My sister was getting more and more agitated and upset. My mum was getting worse, she was turning blue, her jaw was going, her breathing was getting shallower - she was in a bad state. ""I actually thought she was going to die in the house in front of us. Even now I can feel myself getting upset about it."" Lillian Briggs is currently in a stable condition in hospital Mr Ewing added: ""I'd heard stories about them having trouble emptying the ambulances at the Royal Infirmary but I thought after seven, eight hours, 'goodness, it can't take that long - surely she must be a priority by now'."" Mrs Briggs is now in hospital in a stable condition following surgery but is on oxygen after developing a chest infection. Her case was raised during First Minister's Questions earlier on Thursday. ""Nicola Sturgeon says it's going to be fully investigated but what does that mean?,"" Mr Ewing said. ""Is she going to get in touch with us and tell us why my poor mother had to lie there for eight hours? ""I just want a reason as to why she had to lie there for that amount of time in a critical condition because, as far as I'm concerned, a broken hip is a critical condition and she was in an awful lot of pain. Lillian Briggs lay on her kitchen floor for eight hours waiting for an ambulance ""I just don't want others to go through what we had to suffer and what my mum is still suffering."" The Scottish government has nowasked the MoD for military assistancefor the country's ambulance service. Nicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Opposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait. Mr Ewing said getting military help could have happened sooner once the government knew Covid cases were rising and hospitals were getting busier again. ""Why didn't Nicola Sturgeon put in place a plan of action two or three weeks ago?,"" he said. ""I don't think she would like her mother lying there in agony."" He said the first minister's apology to all those who had to wait for an ambulance was ""just words"". Scottish Ambulance Service chief executive Pauline Howie was asked on Good Morning Scotland if the two cases highlighted in the media were ""anomalies"". She said: ""The vast majority of patients, for immediately life-threatening patients, will receive a response under 10 minutes and for other emergency patients, under 40 minutes."" The chief executive confirmed the service would apologise directly to the families and share the findings of its reviews into the circumstances. Ms Howie also described the current pressures on the NHS as ""unprecedented"" and added staff face an ""extremely challenging"" winter.

"Sir Keir Starmer is ""bereft of vision"" and needs to let voters know what he stands for, Unite General Secretary Len McCluskey has told the BBC. Mr McCluskey - who is standing down after 11 years at the head of Britain's biggest union - said he ""desperately hopes"" Sir Keir will be the next PM. But he said he was not optimistic about the Labour leader's chances at the next election as things stand. He advised Sir Keir to learn from Jeremy Corbyn - and Tony Blair. Although a frequent critic of Mr Blair, the Unite leader said: ""Everybody knew what he stood for before he was elected, he offered an alternative, he offered a vision."" Unite union elects first female leader Starmer should be inspired by Biden - TUC leader And he said Mr Corbyn had the same qualities, which ""people bought into"". ""At the moment we are bereft of a vision - and that is a real, real problem that Keir has to address,"" he added. ""I will be accused of not being helpful to Keir, but in actual fact I want to do the opposite by saying to him everybody says 'well, nobody knows what Labour stands for, nobody knows what Keir stands for'. ""And in those situations, the reality is that you don't enthuse people."" He argued that the only way to win back so-called Red Wall seats lost to the Conservatives was to ""unite"" the party and end attacks on the left. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn with Unite chief Len McCluskey at Labour conference Mr McCluskey fell out with Sir Keir when the Labour leader suspended his close ally Jeremy Corbyn from the Parliamentary party. He has accused the party leadership of going back on a deal to reinstate Mr Corbyn - an allegation which Sir Keir's office denies. He argued that bringing Mr Corbyn back into the Labour fold would help mend what he described as a ""broken party"" but admitted he was now ""pessimistic"" about that happening. He was speaking to the BBC at the launch of his autobiography, Always Red. The launch party, in a room above a Westminster pub, was packed with leading figures from the Labour left, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and ex-communications chief Seumas Milne. Mr Corbyn gave a speech praising Mr McCluskey's leadership of Unite - and for his ""support and friendship during some very difficult times"", particularly during the failed ""coup"" against him in 2016. In his speech, Mr McCluskey said Labour had come within ""touching distance"" of power at the 2017 general election, as the country ""embraced an unashamedly radical prospectus put forward by Jeremy Corbyn"". Speaking afterwards, he said Labour's failure to ""respect"" the result of the Brexit referendum at the 2019 general election was the biggest mistake the party had made in recent years. Sharon Graham is due take over from Mr McCluskey as Unite general secretary after winning a leadership contest in August. She has said her focus will continue to be on workplace rights rather than internal Labour party politics or ""settling old scores"" at Westminster. In a speech to the TUC last week,Sir Keir urged the trade union movementto work with Labour to win the next election. He is hoping to set a new direction for the party - and his leadership - at its annual conference in Brighton at the end of the month, where he will deliver a keynote speech to delegates in person for the first time.

"Tests similar to this one, showed the dangers of cladding as early as 2004, it has emerged Leaked test results suggest the government and construction industry had early evidence of the dangers posed by cladding, 13 years before the Grenfell Tower fire. Panels, commonly used on buildings in the UK, failed fire tests carried out in 2004. The results, marked ""Commercial in confidence"", were circulated within an industry advisory group. They were recently passed to the BBC and, until now, never made public. Hundreds of thousands of flat owners are now threatened with large bills because of construction materials which pose a risk in fires. The 2004 results were among the first from a British test of full-scale building systems, developed in the late 1990s when there were growing concerns in Parliament about the risks of cladding. The tests were part of research commissioned by the then Labour government to determine what standards building systems should have to meet. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell cladding not 'uniquely dangerous' Five cladding systems were tested, including one with aluminium panels, although the primary aim was not to assess the risk of particular designs The aluminium and plastic cladding at Grenfell has been blamed for spreading the fire. Two were constructed from high pressure laminate (HPL) boards, formed from wood, or paper fibre, widely used on modern apartment blocks in the UK. In the tests, all five cladding systems were judged to have failed against ""proposed performance criteria"". Most of the tests were carried out without using ""fire breaks"" - extra components which should be fitted to block the spread of flames. However, fire breaks were used in one high pressure laminate panel system, but it still failed. Zoe Bartley bought a three-room flat in Chelmsford four years ago, and with her partner Ash, now has a baby. They are desperate to move to a bigger home, but the cladding crisis means they cannot sell the flat. This video can not be played Zoe Bartley bought a flat in Chelmsford four years ago but can't sell it due to safety concerns It has HPL panels, as well as wooden balconies and missing fire breaks, Zoe finds it ""disgusting"" that the test results were not circulated more widely. The couple are anticipating a bill of tens of thousands of pounds to remove the dangerous materials, which could bankrupt them. ""There's no finish line, and it's all-consuming at times,"" Zoe says. ""We are very angry that we've been put in this situation. ""We've done everything right. Everything by the book: 'Buy a property and set yourself up for the future.' ""I might end up bankrupt by the time I'm in my 30s."" Her building is lower than 18 metres, so does not qualify for government funding. The UK Cladding Action Group called the test results ""staggering new evidence which shows the government and its advisers knew these materials were dangerous, but simply stood back and allowed them to be installed on hundreds of thousands of buildings. ""The British state knew from this moment on that it was gambling with a disaster in a high-rise, but it chose not to act."" Jonathan Evans, director of Ash and Lacy, a major UK supplier of cladding systems, said he had never seen the results, and described them as ""really vital bits of information"" which would have helped assess fire risks after Grenfell. He said that when poor test data is not made public, it creates a bias towards tests with successful outcomes. ""We all proceed along the route of thinking these systems are safer than they are, until there's a disaster."" Not making poor test data public creates a bias towards tests with successful outcomes, argues Jonathan Evans He said a lack of public information about cladding systems in the 2000s may have resulted in governments not abandoning a controversial British standard for building materials, known as Class 0. The Grenfell Tower inquiry has heard evidence that this standard was much easier to meet than a stricter European classification, and that keeping it as an option in England and Wales allowed combustible materials to be installed on thousands of buildings. If Class 0 had been abandoned and a ban on combustible materials introduced, Grenfell might not have happened, Dr Evans said. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) described the 2004 tests as ""experimental... for a different purpose"" than the rounds of testing ordered in the wake of the Grenfell disaster. They were carried out to ""to check the criteria for testing"" rather than to assess the ""intrinsic safety of building materials"", officials said. The findings fed into a review of technical standards used by building designers to assess the safety of cladding. An MHCLG spokesman said: ""We are taking action to improve building safety where successive governments have failed, through our Building Safety Bill, which marks the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years, with more rights and protections for residents and a Â£5bn investment to remove unsafe cladding. ""The new Building Safety Regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for buildings over 18m and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings, ensuring products are removed from the market if they do not meet regulation."" The Building Research Establishment, which carried out the tests and circulated them to the industry advisory group, refused to comment. Next month the Grenfell Tower public inquiry will begin examining evidence of what governments knew about the risks of cladding fires before the 2017 disaster, and what they did about it.

"This video can not be played Watch: Police stopped Gabby Petito two weeks ago US authorities are searching for a Florida woman who went missing during a road trip with her fiancÃ©. Gabrielle ""Gabby"" Petito, 22, has not spoken to her family since late August, when she was visiting Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park with her boyfriend. Police say the boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, 23, who has returned home, is now a person of interest in the case. The couple had been documenting their cross-country campervan trip on social media. Mr Laundrie returned to their Florida home on 1 September, police say. Ms Petito's parents reported her missing 10 days later. But police say although Mr Laundrie is refusing to speak to them about her disappearance, he has not been charged with any crime. ""We are pleading with anyone, including Brian, to share information with us on her whereabouts in the past few weeks,"" said North Port police chief Todd Garrison. ""The lack of information from Brian is hindering this investigation. The answers will eventually come out."" But Mr Laundrie's lawyer, Steve Bertolino, defended his silence. ""In my experience, intimate partners are often the first person law enforcement focuses their attention on in cases like this and the warning that 'any statement made will be used against you' is true, regardless of whether my client had anything to do with Ms Petito's disappearance. ""As such, on the advice of counsel Mr Laundrie is not speaking on this matter,"" Mr Bertolino said. Ms Petito's family have called on Mr Laundrie to give answers, including when he last saw her and ""why he left Gabby all alone and drove her van to Florida"". ""These are critical questions that require immediate answers,"" they said in a statement. Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Ms Petito's father urged the public to provide information that could help in the case. Allow Twitter content?

"A previously unseen Vincent van Gogh drawing of an exhausted old man has been discovered, a museum dedicated to the artist has confirmed. Study for Worn Out was drawn early in the artist's career in 1882, the Van Gogh Museum said on Thursday. The sketch has been been sitting in a Dutch family's private collection for more than a century. But on Thursday, it went on display at the Amsterdam museum for the first time. The public will be able to see it until 2 January, before it is returned to the private collection. The small pencil drawing, signed ""Vincent"", depicts an elderly labourer dressed in a waistcoat, trousers and boots, sitting on a wooden chair with his head in his hands. ""This one has never been seen before anywhere. It's the first time that this drawing is out in the open,"" said Teio Meedendorp, senior researcher at the Van Gogh Museum. He told the BBC it was ""absolutely impossible"" to say how much it was worth. Van Gogh appeared to have used  the drawing as the basis for a slightly different version of the drawing shortly afterwards, which he preferred, and which is currently in the museum's collection under the title Worn Out. The artist made Study for Worn Out when he was living in the Hague and still learning to draw at around the age of 29. Experts say it offers an exceptional insight into Van Gogh's working process at the time. The museum's director, Emilie Gordenker, said the team were ""delighted with this discovery"". ""We are very happy to have made a contribution to our specialist field,"" she added. ""It's quite rare for a new work to be attributed to Van Gogh. We're proud to be able to share this early drawing and its story with our visitors."" The owner of the work, who wants to remain anonymous, asked the museum to determine whether the drawing could be attributed to Van Gogh. 'Unseen' Van Gogh painting fetches Â£11m at auction Van Gogh: How London inspired a genius Van Gogh suffered 'episodes of delirium' In a statement, Meedendorp said: ""In stylistic terms, it fits perfectly with the many figure studies we know from Van Gogh's time in The Hague and the connection with Worn Out is obvious. ""The artist began by drawing a grid on the paper, which tells us that he worked with a perspective frame to help him capture a figure quickly with the correct proportions. He then worked the sheet up in his characteristically expressive drawing style: not refined, but with energetic scratches and strokes and laying down contours, in search of a pithy image with special attention to effects of light and shade. ""In terms of the materials, you also find everything you'd expect in a Van Gogh drawing from this period: a thick carpenter's pencil as medium, coarse watercolour paper as support, and fixing with a solution of water and milk. ""There are traces of damage in the corners on the back of the drawing, which we can link to the way Van Gogh customarily attached sheets of paper to his drawing board using wads of starch.'"" A Street Scene In Montmartre fetched Â£11.2m at auction in March The announcement comes six months after a Van Gogh painting of a Paris streetwent on display for the first timeafter spending more than 100 years behind closed doors. A Street Scene In Montmartre has been owned by a French family for most of the time since it was painted in 1887. The paintingwent on to fetch 13.09 million euros (Â£11.2m)at auction in March.

"This video can not be played Watch: Police stopped Gabby Petito two weeks ago US authorities are searching for a Florida woman who went missing during a road trip with her fiancÃ©. Gabrielle ""Gabby"" Petito, 22, has not spoken to her family since late August, when she was visiting Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park with her boyfriend. Police say the boyfriend, Brian Laundrie, 23, who has returned home, is now a person of interest in the case. The couple had been documenting their cross-country campervan trip on social media. Mr Laundrie returned to their Florida home on 1 September, police say. Ms Petito's parents reported her missing 10 days later. But police say although Mr Laundrie is refusing to speak to them about her disappearance, he has not been charged with any crime.

"This video can not be played 'Why did my mother have to lie waiting on an ambulance?' An 86-year-old woman had to wait eight hours for an ambulance after falling and breaking her hip at home. Lillian Briggs, who has Parkinson's, skin cancer and has had two heart attacks, was left lying on her kitchen floor in agony after blacking out. Her son, Robert Ewing, and his sister rang for an ambulance a number of times only to be told their mother was in the system but was not a priority. Mr Ewing told BBC Scotland: ""I thought she was going to die in front of us."" The Scottish Ambulance Service apologised for the delay and confirmed it was investigating the circumstances. Chief executive Pauline Howie told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""These waits are appalling and they are not something we aspire to as an ambulance service."" Military to be called in to help ambulance crews 'There are so many calls and not enough ambulances' Ambulance boss 'sorry' over patient waiting times Health secretary faces criticism over ambulance plea After receiving a call from his sister following his mother's fall in Edinburgh on Monday, the 60-year-old found his mother semi-conscious in a confused state. His sister kept calling for an ambulance but after seven hours he called them himself and was told they knew about his mother, she was on the system and could he stop calling. ""I said hopefully you'll be here before my mother dies because my mum's in a bad way now,"" he said. ""I just held my mum's hand. She had a couple of bruises and a bashed face so I wiped her face and reassured her, put a cover over her to try to keep her warm as best I could - I couldn't move her because she was in a lot of pain - really bad pain. ""We aren't medically trained, we just did our best. My sister was getting more and more agitated and upset. My mum was getting worse, she was turning blue, her jaw was going, her breathing was getting shallower - she was in a bad state. ""I actually thought she was going to die in the house in front of us. Even now I can feel myself getting upset about it."" Lillian Briggs is currently in a stable condition in hospital Mr Ewing added: ""I'd heard stories about them having trouble emptying the ambulances at the Royal Infirmary but I thought after seven, eight hours, 'goodness, it can't take that long - surely she must be a priority by now'."" Mrs Briggs is now in hospital in a stable condition following surgery but is on oxygen after developing a chest infection. Her case was raised during First Minister's Questions earlier on Thursday. ""Nicola Sturgeon says it's going to be fully investigated but what does that mean?,"" Mr Ewing said. ""Is she going to get in touch with us and tell us why my poor mother had to lie there for eight hours? ""I just want a reason as to why she had to lie there for that amount of time in a critical condition because, as far as I'm concerned, a broken hip is a critical condition and she was in an awful lot of pain. Lillian Briggs lay on her kitchen floor for eight hours waiting for an ambulance ""I just don't want others to go through what we had to suffer and what my mum is still suffering."" The Scottish government has nowasked the MoD for military assistancefor the country's ambulance service. Nicola Sturgeon said health services were dealing with the most challenging combination of circumstances in their history due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Opposition politicians have highlighted a series of serious ambulance delays, including one where a man died after a 40-hour wait. Mr Ewing said getting military help could have happened sooner once the government knew Covid cases were rising and hospitals were getting busier again. ""Why didn't Nicola Sturgeon put in place a plan of action two or three weeks ago?,"" he said. ""I don't think she would like her mother lying there in agony."" He said the first minister's apology to all those who had to wait for an ambulance was ""just words"". Scottish Ambulance Service chief executive Pauline Howie was asked on Good Morning Scotland if the two cases highlighted in the media were ""anomalies"". She said: ""The vast majority of patients, for immediately life-threatening patients, will receive a response under 10 minutes and for other emergency patients, under 40 minutes."" The chief executive confirmed the service would apologise directly to the families and share the findings of its reviews into the circumstances. Ms Howie also described the current pressures on the NHS as ""unprecedented"" and added staff face an ""extremely challenging"" winter.

"Boris Johnson is continuing a major reshuffle of his government ministers Junior and mid-ranking ministers are waiting to hear if they have new jobs Yesterday, Liz Truss became the new foreign secretary, replacing Dominic Raab Raab is confirmed in three roles - justice secretary, Lord Chancellor and deputy prime minister Former vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi is the new education secretary Nadine Dorries is secretary of state for culture, media and sport Today, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general to be minister at the trade department John Whittingdale leaves his job as minister at the culture department Jennifer Scott and Sinead Wilson Boris Johnson replaces ministers who quit and forced him to announce his departure as prime minister. Michael Gove is known as a reformer and is now in charge of controversial planning changes. We're going to wrap up our rolling live coverage here of Boris Johnson's reshuffle. But don't fret! We will bring you coverage of any significant developments as and when they occur this evening on ourwebsiteandTwitter feed,external. Your writers today were Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, Arryn Moy and Sinead Wilson. And your editors were Georgina Pattinson and Jennifer Scott. We've just had these confirmations from Downing Street about who is leaving the government:   Labour's Emily Thornberry will now face Anne-Marie Trevelyan across the dispatch box Shadow International Trade Secretary, Emily Thornberry, hastaken to Twitter,externalto set out the challenges for her new counterpart, Anne-Marie Trevelyan -  or what she calls ""a beginner's guide to the mess she's inherited"". She says Trevelyan's predecessor, Liz Truss - who is now foreign secretary - ""leaves behind a legacy of major problems"" at the department. The UK doesn't have ""a single completed deal we didn't have inside the EU"" she says. And she goes on to list the areas where she says Truss ""caved in"" or failed to respond - before saying she hopes the new minister is ""getting her feet under the table"" and sorting out the issues. The Institute for Government,externalhas been looking at the new cabinet and which seats the MPs represent, and it makes for interesting reading. It notes that Boris Johnson's top team now has slightly more ministers from the North and slightly fewer from the Midlands. Five posts are now held by MPs with northern seats, with Anne-Marie Trevelyan (Berwick-upon-Tweed), Simon Clarke (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) and Nigel Adams (Selby and Ainsty) swelling the ranks from two to five. But the Midlands loses two representatives, with both Gavin Williamson (South Staffordshire) and Robert Jenrick (Newark) both sacked. We are eagerly waiting some more ministerial moves this afternoon. But just in case you haven't followed every change so far (we are sure you have),take a look at our run downof who is in and who is out of Boris Johnson's new cabinet.

Nadine Dorries made her debut at the dispatch box Liz Truss took her coffee to go After a day of being moved in to or out of the cabinet, or to a new role, those in the headlines yesterday have been snapped out and about. New Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries was welcomed
by the Speaker as the Commons started with her taking questions on her culture, media and sport department. The newly-appointed Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, was seen outside her new office ahead of chairing a meeting of Commonwealth foreign ministers. Being a little quieter was Justice Secretary
and deputy PM Domini Raab, who had little to say as he went into the Ministry of
Justice. And sacked Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick had
a quick chat as he left home for the synagogue. Dominic Raab faces his demotion head on Robert Jenrick's first day back on the backbenches Liz Truss is known throughout Westminster for her use of social media to promote her work in government. In a piece for the Times,externalin 2018, she claimed it had ""brought lots of younger people into politics"", as well as allowing her to showcase her ""passion for burgers and beaches"". True to form - and much like her other new colleagues - she is now tweeting on her first day in her new job as foreign secretary, updating her followers with news of a meeting with her counterparts in the Commonwealth.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid is one minister who held on to his job in the reshuffle - having only been in post since June. And he has been busy in Blackpool today, making his first speech in the role. Javid says dealing with record waiting lists in the NHS will be a top priority. But he says he can't just be the ""minister for Covid"" because of all the other ""hidden costs"" of the pandemic that need dealing with. Coronavirus has also shone a light on the health disparities that exist
across the country, he says, and high on his agenda will be tackling those and overhauling  mental health provision and social care.

Peter SaullBBC Political Reporter While it's gone a bit quiet on Downing Street, the cafes of Parliament are full of chatter about the reshuffle. The Conservative MPs I've spoken to are almost universally positive about the changes Boris Johnson has made to his top team. There's an acceptance that a refresh was needed and there is little surprise, for example, that Gavin Williamson lost his job as education secretary. Nadhim Zahawi is considered a highly capable replacement, with several Tories praising his handling of the vaccine rollout. Some admit to being surprised at the appointment of Nadine Dorries as culture secretary, with one MP wryly observing: ""We're going to have fun"". However, others point out that her previous experience as minister for suicide prevention will come in handy as she gets to grips with the issue of online safety. By this time on a Thursday afternoon, MPs are usually starting to drift back to their constituencies, but a few Conservatives are hanging around a bit longer in case they get summoned to Downing Street. ""We're all waiting for a call,"" one admitted. After a flurry of announcements late last night and early this morning, Boris Johnson's reshuffle appears to have entered something of an intermission. This may be connected to the fact the prime minister has been hosting the crown prince of Abu Dhabi in Downing Street this afternoon, as well as speaking in the House of Common this morning. Ahead of announcements we expect to resume later, here's a recap of what's happened so far today:  Yesterday's reshuffle means more ministers now attend cabinet Among the 30 ministers who will now attend cabinet, there are eight women - up from six previously. It means the proportion of women has gone from from 22% to 27%, as only 27 ministers took part in cabinet meetings before the reshuffle. There are now seven cabinet attendees from an ethnic minority, an increase of one but similar as a share of the total (up slightly from 22% to 23%). And the number who are privately educated has gone up slightly from 17 beforehand to 18 now. Appointing Michael Gove as the governmentâs âlevelling-upâ chief in the cabinet reshuffle will help people to understand the phrase, the chairman of the Northern Research Group of Tory backbenchers has said. Jake Berry said the challenge was to âbring some definitionâ to the term that âmeans all things to all peopleâ. âAnd we also need to be able to point out to people how we are getting on and doing it.â The Rossendale and Darwen MP said the next election could be in 2023 and he reckoned Mr Gove would ârelentlessly focus on shovels in the ground, demonstrating howlevelling upis changing peopleâs lives"". One task for Mr Gove is the big issue of planning reform. Some Tory MPs in southern England fear the plans could lead to mass house building. But Mr Berry was more receptive, adding: âFrankly, in many parts of the north of England people are quite keen to see more houses built. I understand thatâs not the same across the country, and itâs not the same all parts of the north of course. âThe planning system needs reform, in my view it is a clog on economic activity, particularly the time it takes, so I do hope he will take the opportunity to look at that."" And as Boris Johnson continues to appoint junior ministers, Mr Berry called on him to recruit more northern MPs into ministerial roles.

"This video can not be played 'We don't have a lorry driver shortage problem' John Lewis is chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. Retailers have been grappling with a host of supply chain problems from driver shortages to shipping delays. John Lewis chair Sharon White said the business was throwing everything at the issues to make sure Christmas would not be disrupted. The retailer recorded a pre-tax loss of Â£29m for the six months to 31 July. That compares with a Â£635m loss for the same period last year. Sales for the group rose by 6%, aided by strong demand for homeware, fashion, nursery furnishing and Waitrose online grocery sales. John Lewis has 34 department stores and 331 Waitrose supermarket stores alongside its online operation. John Lewis to create thousands of Christmas jobs John Lewis and Waitrose plan to cut 1,000 jobs ""We're acting hard and we're acting fast to make sure we can still deliver a fantastic sparkly Christmas to our customers,"" Ms  White told the BBC. She added that the department store chain had introduced a host of measures to help manage labour shortages: ""We've raised wages for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers and we're really beginning to see the results of that."" There is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000, a Road Haulage Association survey of its members estimates. This has led to a chronic lack of materials for the construction sector, such as cement and timber, as well as problems for the manufacturing sector. Christmas is when many retailers make most of their profits, including John Lewis. And it's throwing everything at it to make sure its stock arrives on time. The pandemic has wreaked havoc for the flow of goods around the world. There's still a shortage of containers and it's also tough getting a space on the vast ships that carry them from China. Freight costs have also rocketed. And if your stock does turn up as planned, you've got to make sure you have drivers to get the goods to distribution centres and on to stores. Add in the uncertainty over Covid and no wonder retailers are even more nervous than usual about the all important festive season. Ms White said the John Lewis Christmas campaign in stores would be delayed by two weeks. John Lewis said it was focusing on expanding its products and offerings for the holiday season, including 10 new Christmas emporiums in John Lewis and expanding areas related to the department store within Waitrose supermarkets. However, Ms White sought to temper expectations: ""We're not through Covid and there's more uncertainty than we would like."" John Lewis has announced plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers for the winter She said there were still containers stuck in various parts of the world. ""We're acting at every single part in the supply chain to ensure that Christmas is saved this year,"" she said. ""Our customers hopefully won't see anything,"" she added. ""We're on track. But so far, we don't see any significant problems."" On Wednesday, the retailer announced plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers for the winter.

This video can not be played Covid: Doctor combating jab myths labelled Dr Death A doctor who has been debunking myths about the Covid vaccine on TikTok says online trolls have dubbed her Dr Death and suggested she should have her medical licence removed. Dr Bnar Talabani, 32, is the only Welsh doctor on Team Halo, a UN-backed group of doctors and scientists using social media to dispel vaccine misinformation. She was born in northern Iraq and came to the UK as a refugee, aged 10. The co-founder of Muslim Doctors Cymru, Dr Talabani believes trainee medics should be given social media lessons as part of their studies. Singapore's health ministry has reported 910 new cases, its highest number since May 2020. More than 80% of the city-state's population has been vaccinated, but a recent rise in cases has forced the government to halt the further easing of lockdown restrictions. If you're just catching up with the day's developments - here are some of the today's top coronavirus news stories in the UK.  The European Union has said that it will provide â¬30bn ($35.3bn; Â£25.6bn) over the next six years towards a new agency dealing with health preparedness and rapid response. The Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, or HERA, was officially launched on Thursday, and aims to tackle international crises like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. âWe need to be better prepared for future health crises,â said EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton. ""HERA will establish new, adaptable production capacities and secure supply chains to help Europe react fast when needed."" The EU has been criticised for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. While health policy and outreach is still handled largely by individual members, vaccine rollout was slowed by initial shortages and longer waiting times for regulatory approvals. HERA is expected to be fully operational by early next year. As we reported earlier, reports suggest Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will announce revised rules for international travel tomorrow, for travellers in England. But while testing costs are expected to come down for fully vaccinated travellers, those who are not fully vaccinated may be asked to take two tests when arriving from a low-risk - or green - destination, and expected to quarantine at home - according to PA Media. It is anticipated that people arriving from red list countries will continue to be required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 per solo adult traveller. However, the red list is expected to be reduced with Pakistan and South Africa among the countries which may come off the high-risk list. The travel sector has been desperate for the testing and quarantine rules for international travel to be relaxed. Earlier this week, Heathrow Airport said it had gone from being Europe's busiest airport in 2019 to number 10 on the list, behind rival airports in cities such as Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt. The Visual and Data Journalism Team One ""ping"" - an alert asking someone to self-isolate - was issued by the NHS Covid app for every reported case in England in the week ending 8 September. Data shows 201,081 cases were reported in this period, with 199,296 contact tracing alerts  - or pings - sent out by the app. The number of pings issued for every reported case has been on a steady decline for the past two months, although it is still above levels seen in mid-May. A total of 211,947 pings were sent out across England and Wales last week, a 2% increase from the previous week. There have been another 158 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days, according to latest government figures. In addition a further 26,911 cases of coronavirus were recorded in the UK over the past 24 hours. Data shows 836 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus, bringing the total number being treated for Covid in UK hospitals to 8,339 - 1,081 of them in intensive care New rules for international travel are expected to be announced on Friday for England, the PA Media news agency has said. The green and amber lists will be merged to form one category of low-risk countries, while the number of destinations on the red list will be reduced, reports PA Media. There is also speculation that fully vaccinated people arriving in the UK will no longer need to take a pre-departure lateral flow test prior to their flight, or a post-arrival PCR test. The changes, which could save individual travellers up to Â£100 each, would come into force ahead of the half-term break at the end of October.

officials say that more than 200 cases of Covid-19 have now been confirmed in
the southeastern province of Fujian. Since the
weekend, there has been outbreak of the virus in three cities: Xiamen, Putian
and Quanzhou. More than half of
these are in Putian, a city with a population of 2.9 million people. There have
been clusters of cases at kindergartens and primary schools. Local officials
today told a press conference that more than 40% of patients are under the age

âall teachers, students and staff in schools in Fujian provinceâ. Official media
are today showing footage of nursery students as young as seven-months-old
receiving Covid-19 tests. China instantly
locks down communities when cases of Covid-19 are identified, and carries out
multiple rounds of testing to identify anyone who is asymptomatic. Earlier this
week, state media called this latest outbreak âsevere and complicatedâ. Many
schools have suspended classes and people are being encouraged not to travel
unless necessary. Non-essential businesses have closed in hotspot areas. However, the
authorities are hoping that Chinaâs swift approach means that this outbreak can
be brought under control by the start of Golden Week (1 October), the second most important travel and tourism period after Chinese New Year.

"This video can not be played 'We don't have a lorry driver shortage problem' John Lewis is chartering a fleet of extra ships, along with a number of other businesses, to make sure it has Christmas stock on time. Retailers have been grappling with a host of supply chain problems from driver shortages to shipping delays. John Lewis chair Sharon White said the business was throwing everything at the issues to make sure Christmas would not be disrupted. The retailer recorded a pre-tax loss of Â£29m for the six months to 31 July. That compares with a Â£635m loss for the same period last year. Sales for the group rose by 6%, aided by strong demand for homeware, fashion, nursery furnishing and Waitrose online grocery sales. John Lewis has 34 department stores and 331 Waitrose supermarket stores alongside its online operation. John Lewis to create thousands of Christmas jobs John Lewis and Waitrose plan to cut 1,000 jobs ""We're acting hard and we're acting fast to make sure we can still deliver a fantastic sparkly Christmas to our customers,"" Ms  White told the BBC. She added that the department store chain had introduced a host of measures to help manage labour shortages: ""We've raised wages for heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers and we're really beginning to see the results of that."" There is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000, a Road Haulage Association survey of its members estimates. This has led to a chronic lack of materials for the construction sector, such as cement and timber, as well as problems for the manufacturing sector. Christmas is when many retailers make most of their profits, including John Lewis. And it's throwing everything at it to make sure its stock arrives on time. The pandemic has wreaked havoc for the flow of goods around the world. There's still a shortage of containers and it's also tough getting a space on the vast ships that carry them from China. Freight costs have also rocketed. And if your stock does turn up as planned, you've got to make sure you have drivers to get the goods to distribution centres and on to stores. Add in the uncertainty over Covid and no wonder retailers are even more nervous than usual about the all important festive season. Ms White said the John Lewis Christmas campaign in stores would be delayed by two weeks. John Lewis said it was focusing on expanding its products and offerings for the holiday season, including 10 new Christmas emporiums in John Lewis and expanding areas related to the department store within Waitrose supermarkets. However, Ms White sought to temper expectations: ""We're not through Covid and there's more uncertainty than we would like."" John Lewis has announced plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers for the winter She said there were still containers stuck in various parts of the world. ""We're acting at every single part in the supply chain to ensure that Christmas is saved this year,"" she said. ""Our customers hopefully won't see anything,"" she added. ""We're on track. But so far, we don't see any significant problems."" On Wednesday, the retailer announced plans to recruit more than 7,000 temporary workers for the winter. The partnership is hiring people for its supermarkets, department stores and warehouses, including delivery drivers for its online grocery division. It is also looking to fill 550 permanent, full-time, driver and warehouse jobs. New joiners will be offered free food and drink to ""help ensure we can attract the help we need"", it said.

"Tests similar to this one, showed the dangers of cladding as early as 2004, it has emerged Leaked test results suggest the government and construction industry had early evidence of the dangers posed by cladding, 13 years before the Grenfell Tower fire. Panels, commonly used on buildings in the UK, failed fire tests carried out in 2004. The results, marked ""Commercial in confidence"", were circulated within an industry advisory group. They were recently passed to the BBC and, until now, never made public. Hundreds of thousands of flat owners are now threatened with large bills because of construction materials which pose a risk in fires. The 2004 results were among the first from a British test of full-scale building systems, developed in the late 1990s when there were growing concerns in Parliament about the risks of cladding. The tests were part of research commissioned by the then Labour government to determine what standards building systems should have to meet. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell cladding not 'uniquely dangerous' Five cladding systems were tested, including one with aluminium panels, although the primary aim was not to assess the risk of particular designs The aluminium and plastic cladding at Grenfell has been blamed for spreading the fire. Two were constructed from high pressure laminate (HPL) boards, formed from wood, or paper fibre, widely used on modern apartment blocks in the UK. In the tests, all five cladding systems were judged to have failed against ""proposed performance criteria"". Most of the tests were carried out without using ""fire breaks"" - extra components which should be fitted to block the spread of flames. However, fire breaks were used in one high pressure laminate panel system, but it still failed. Zoe Bartley bought a three-room flat in Chelmsford four years ago, and with her partner Ash, now has a baby. They are desperate to move to a bigger home, but the cladding crisis means they cannot sell the flat. This video can not be played Zoe Bartley bought a flat in Chelmsford four years ago but can't sell it due to safety concerns It has HPL panels, as well as wooden balconies and missing fire breaks, Zoe finds it ""disgusting"" that the test results were not circulated more widely. The couple are anticipating a bill of tens of thousands of pounds to remove the dangerous materials, which could bankrupt them. ""There's no finish line, and it's all-consuming at times,"" Zoe says. ""We are very angry that we've been put in this situation. ""We've done everything right. Everything by the book: 'Buy a property and set yourself up for the future.' ""I might end up bankrupt by the time I'm in my 30s."" Her building is lower than 18 metres, so does not qualify for government funding. The UK Cladding Action Group called the test results ""staggering new evidence which shows the government and its advisers knew these materials were dangerous, but simply stood back and allowed them to be installed on hundreds of thousands of buildings. ""The British state knew from this moment on that it was gambling with a disaster in a high-rise, but it chose not to act."" Jonathan Evans, director of Ash and Lacy, a major UK supplier of cladding systems, said he had never seen the results, and described them as ""really vital bits of information"" which would have helped assess fire risks after Grenfell. He said that when poor test data is not made public, it creates a bias towards tests with successful outcomes. ""We all proceed along the route of thinking these systems are safer than they are, until there's a disaster."" Not making poor test data public creates a bias towards tests with successful outcomes, argues Jonathan Evans He said a lack of public information about cladding systems in the 2000s may have resulted in governments not abandoning a controversial British standard for building materials, known as Class 0. The Grenfell Tower inquiry has heard evidence that this standard was much easier to meet than a stricter European classification, and that keeping it as an option in England and Wales allowed combustible materials to be installed on thousands of buildings. If Class 0 had been abandoned and a ban on combustible materials introduced, Grenfell might not have happened, Dr Evans said. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) described the 2004 tests as ""experimental... for a different purpose"" than the rounds of testing ordered in the wake of the Grenfell disaster. They were carried out to ""to check the criteria for testing"" rather than to assess the ""intrinsic safety of building materials"", officials said. The findings fed into a review of technical standards used by building designers to assess the safety of cladding. An MHCLG spokesman said: ""We are taking action to improve building safety where successive governments have failed, through our Building Safety Bill, which marks the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years, with more rights and protections for residents and a Â£5bn investment to remove unsafe cladding. ""The new Building Safety Regulator will enforce a more stringent regulatory regime for buildings over 18m and oversee the safety and performance of all buildings, ensuring products are removed from the market if they do not meet regulation."" The Building Research Establishment, which carried out the tests and circulated them to the industry advisory group, refused to comment. Next month the Grenfell Tower public inquiry will begin examining evidence of what governments knew about the risks of cladding fires before the 2017 disaster, and what they did about it.

"Marks & Spencer has said it is closing 11 of its French stores because of problems supplying them with fresh and chilled foods since Brexit. The UK retail giant said all 11 franchise stores it operated with partner SFH in France would shut by the end of this year. M&S said supply chain problems since Brexit had made it ""near impossible"" to maintain standards of food supply. Nine M&S stores run at French travel hubs will continue to operate. ""M&S has a long history of serving customers in France and this is not a decision we or our partner SFH have taken lightly,"" said Paul Friston, M&S managing director of international. ""However, as things stand today, the supply chain complexities in place following the UK's exit from the European Union now make it near impossible for us to serve fresh and chilled products to customers to the high standards they expect, resulting in an ongoing impact to the performance of our business. ""With no workable alternative for the High Street stores, we have agreed with SFH to close all 11 franchised stores."" Its French online operation, which sells mainly clothing and home products, will not be affected by the closures. One of the main problems Marks & Spencer was facing in France was post-Brexit bureaucracy, a spokesman said. Its partner, SFH, mainly operated shops on Paris High Streets, selling fresh food products such as sandwiches, he said. Due to hold-ups caused by red tape at the UK/French border, it was impractical to get the products to the shops. The retailer's other French partner, Lagardere Travel Retail, runs M&S stores in French airports, railway and Metro stations. Those stores are unaffected by this decision, in part because of their location. Marks & Spencer opened its first French stores in 1975, with branches in Paris and Lyon. After leaving France and the rest of mainland Europe in 2001 to focus on its UK business, it then reopened in Paris in 2011. M&S said its discussions with Lagardere on a sustainable future business model continued to make good progress. ""Today's announcement is the latest change to the structure of our European businesses following the UK's exit from the European Union,"" the retailer said. ""In April earlier this year, we announced the reconfiguration of our food business in Czech Republic, removing the sale of all fresh and chilled products from stores, and instead doubling our ranges of frozen and ambient products. ""This removed the ongoing supply chain risks to our business and the knock-on impact on limiting availability for customers in our stores."" The export of fresh processed food from the UK to the EU is a classic example of precisely the sort of trade, built up under the single market, that was bound to be challenged by the new post-Brexit arrangements. Specialist exporters say hundreds of pages of documents including health certificates are now required. Although catastrophic port delays were avoided in the immediate aftermath of Brexit earlier this year, the trade data and surveys of small businesses reveal a hit to exports to the EU. Giants such as M&S were able to muddle through, but no longer. Some exporters have also complained that imports coming the other way from the EU will be waved through now until July at least. There had been some hope that imposing UK import controls would provide an incentive for France, the Netherlands and Germany to ease controls on their side. That discussion is not now happening. Nor is there any move towards a veterinary agreement, of the sort the EU already enjoys with Switzerland or New Zealand, that might have eased some of the new export red tape burden. Instead, there is a private acceptance that after this Brexit deal, fewer sandwiches will be exported to France, and that is the price for the regulatory and trade freedom to export more elsewhere. Steve Dresser, managing director of Grocery Insight, said that while all retailers' sales had been affected by Covid, Marks & Spencer in France was ""another casualty of Brexit"". ""Once you add inefficiency in to any supply chain, be it trade barriers or bureaucracy, plus the need for extra manpower, there is cost that needs to be absorbed somewhere along the line. ""It's likely for the minimal returns, the numbers simply no longer made sense to M&S,"" Mr Dresser said. ""It's clear that a huge amount of management resource has been taken up getting stock in the right place for European stores,"" he added. This include the Republic of Ireland, where Marks & Spencer has had stock shortages, ""due to the way that product is accounted for coming via Northern Ireland"". Products entering either Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland from Britain are subject to EU border processes. Retailers have been dealing with stock shortages and stock being held up at borders post-Brexit, as well as a chronic shortage of drivers, which hauliers have said is in part due to Brexit. Businesses are faced with costs, either through having to pay for warehouses in EU countries and having cash tied up in stock, through wastage if products with a short shelf life are held up at borders, or through gaps on shelves due to supply chain problems. ""The outlook remains bleak on this front, with the deal signed by UK government tying this country to checks and delays at the borders,"" Mr Dresser said, adding that this was ""baffling"" as ""we have voted to take back control"".

"Artwork: Lunar Pathfinder will operate for at least eight years The contract has been signed that will see the first UK satellite go to the Moon in 2024. Lunar Pathfinder is a relay platform for telecommunications. It will feed the telemetry and data from other spacecraft at the Moon back to Earth. This will make those other missions simpler and cheaper to operate. The contract was signed in London between the European Space Agency and Pathfinder's manufacturer, Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL). It is a service agreement. Esa is not funding Pathfinder's build; it's merely purchasing a proportion of its relay capacity. This will be used by the agency's future missions, and also ventures run by its American counterpart, Nasa. The quid pro quo is that Pathfinder will hitch a ride on a US rocket. Europe plans sat-nav and telecoms network for Moon UK signs up to Nasa's Moon exploration principles This video can not be played Josef Aschbacher: ""We need to move faster in Europe"" There is an armada of missions - public and private - going to the Moon this decade, including ones that will take astronauts back to the lunar surface for the first time since Apollo. Pathfinder will be in a position to service all these ventures, selling its bandwidth to anyone who needs it. With Esa as its ""anchor customer"", SSTL will have confidence it can get a decent return on its self-investment. This is a key moment then for all parties, not least Esa which is now following a procurement model routinely practised by Nasa. The space agency sets the requirements, offers perhaps seed money to industry to develop the product solution, and then agrees to purchase the service. Nasa doesn't buy SpaceX hardware, only the service provided by the company California's SpaceX is the classic example of this model in action, producing novel rockets and crew-carrying capsules for use by Nasa at a fraction of the cost of more traditional contracting. Josef Aschbacher, the new director general of Esa, is determined to push Europe down this same route, and Lunar Pathfinder is his poster child. He's come into the job with the ambition - he calls it his Agenda 2025 - to shake up the way space is done across the continent of Europe. If Europe doesn't become more fleet-of-foot in the space domain, it will fall behind geopolitically, he believes. ""Europe has to realise that first of all, space is extremely important for the development of a country or a region,"" he told me. ""I would claim that if you're not a space power, you cannot be a superpower. We see this best demonstrated in China, which is really using space as a tool to become a major superpower. ""The US, of course, is doing it since a long time. So Europe has to wake up."" The service agreement was signed at London's Royal Society on Wednesday evening Under Dr Aschbacher's leadership, there will be more projects where Esa acts as the first buyer, or anchor customer. The agency will do more consulting to enable venture capital to have the confidence to back innovative ideas in Europe. There'll also be prizes and grants to stimulate this innovation. And the whole contracting process inside Esa will be re-assessed to speed things up. ""Time is crucial for the new space world,"" Dr Aschbacher said. ""Our procedures are too slow - time to contact, reviews, the various interactions with these fast-moving companies. This is about internal procedure where I need to work on Esa to be much faster."" Lunar Pathfinder will operate in a wide elliptical orbit at the Moon for at least eight years. It will talk to other lunar missions - be they other satellites in orbit or rovers down on the surface - using S-band and UHF frequencies. Communications will be relayed back to Earth ground stations in X-band. Additionally, there'll be a demonstration of technology that could one day lead to a sat-nav service at the Moon. ""Pathfinder will be hosting a weak signal detection receiver from Esa. Effectively, the idea is to test how signals from GPS or Galileo at Earth can be detected from lunar orbit and then used for navigation of lunar assets,"" explained Nelly Offord, the exploration business manager at SSTL. Elodie Viau, the director of telecoms at Esa, said she expected Britain to play a leading role in the agency's new direction under Dr Aschbacher. ""What is great about the UK is its commercial mindset; it is very business-minded,"" she noted.

"Most people do not believe workers will return to the office full-time after the coronavirus pandemic, an exclusive survey for the BBC suggests. A total of 70% of 1,684 people polled predicted that workers would ""never return to offices at the same rate"". The majority of workers said that they would prefer to work from home either full-time or at least some of the time. But managers raised concerns that creativity in the workplace would be affected. Half of 530 senior leaders also surveyed by polling organisation YouGov for the BBC said that workers staying at home would adversely affect both creativity and collaboration - against just 38% of the general public. Bosses at big firms such as investment bank Goldman Sachs andtech giant Applehave rejected calls for more flexibility, with the former evencalling working from home an ""aberration"". Managers and members of the public surveyed for the BBC agreed, however, that neither productivity nor the economy would be harmed by continuing work-from-home policies. BT's chief executive Philip Jansen, for example, told the BBC that it is planning to let most of its office workers work on-site three or four days of the week in future - although thousands of its engineers won't be offered the same flexibility. ""We are a people business so collaboration, dynamism, teamwork, creativity... is really important to us,"" he said. According to the research, more than three-quarters of people believe their boss will allow them to continue working from home some of the time. According to the latest official figures,external, the proportion of workers who did at least some work from home in 2020 increased to 37%, up from 27% the previous year.

While Maisie is grateful for the six-month contract, she's keen to be in the office as much as possible so she can make a good impression. ""I've never had a job where I'm speaking to people online or emailing,"" she says, referring to her past experience in retail. She adds: ""I'm more productive when I am in the office because it's more of a professional environment and you get to see people."" Having started the role remotely, she only got to meet her colleagues for the first time in-person recently. ""We recently had team drinks and I finally got to meet everyone. It was really nice, I got to see everyone in person and get an idea of who they are, rather than just what their email is."" She says she will still take the opportunity to work from home some days, though, perhaps towards the end of the week. More than 60% of those surveyed thought young people would struggle to progress without face-to-face contact or in-person mentoring. As experts have pointed out, under-25s in particular were hit hard by job losses or reduced hours at the onset of the pandemic. Five ways we think office work will change Should I be working at home or going to the office? The bespoke research for the BBC suggests that some inequalities may be exacerbated by the pandemic, while others might have improved. Half of the workers surveyed thought that women's careers might be boosted by home-working, with childcare duties being less of a hindrance. One enthusiastic home-worker is Antony Howard, who works in procurement for a large defence company in Manchester. He's found big benefits to logging on remotely for the last 16 months, from avoiding expensive coffee shops to cutting down on travel time. ""My health and carbon footprint have never been better. I'm no longer commuting 92 miles a day and I'm more productive,"" he says. While he's also been saving money by shopping more locally, he does worry about those newer to the company. ""We've had 17-year-old apprentices starting in September who have never been on-site,"" he says. ""For me as a 57-year-old, hybrid working is a great scenario, but for the younger ones starting out, they need that workplace experience, that structure."" Even so, he hopes that the pandemic will ""recalibrate"" the workplace. Rather than being a novelty, he says, ""I think this is the new now."" Recruiters are finding it tricky to navigate the expectations of candidates demanding hybrid and remote working, and companies who want people back in the office for at least some of the time. Kam Vara says people are turning down jobs which don't offer remote working Kam Vara, a consultant at Katie Bard recruitment, says it has been a very challenging few months. ""It used to be that people would fit their lives around their work. Covid is teaching people that it doesn't work that way any more"", she says. ""People are turning down opportunities because they don't offer remote working, and they would rather sit tight and wait for the right job to become available"". She adds: ""It feels quite messy right now. What an employer is looking for is some sort of order. To get people into the office and have some structure. But what employees are looking for is something very different. It's going to be like this for a while until the jigsaw fits together."" In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson recommended a ""gradual return to work"" over the summer as coronavirus restrictions eased. Across the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep clocking on remotely where possible. And working remotely full-time for office staff could well become the norm again. This video can not be played Q&A: How do you bring people back to workplace? On Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPsthat advising people in England should work from home again would be part of the government's contingency plans if there was considerable pressure on the NHS this winter. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, added that the policy could make ""a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday: ""The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people."" The BBC commissioned polling organisation YouGov to survey 1,684 working adults and 530 senior leaders in business about their predictions and opinions on working from home. YouGov also re-ran a previous survey of 4,041 British adults, first conducted in March 2021, about their current working from home situation. Have your working arrangements changed?

"The woman sued surgeon Sam Eljamel (pictured) and NHS Tayside A woman left with ""life-changing injuries"" after botched surgery will receive Â£2.8m in damages. Carolyn Almond-Roots was a patient of Sam Eljamel, a former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside, in 2013. A BBC Scotland investigation in 2018 revealed that dozens of people claimed to have been harmed by Mr Eljamel. Some of his former patients are suing NHS Tayside, claiming Mr Eljamel has harmed them. Several have already secured compensation. Surgeon who harmed Scots is now working in Libya The top surgeon who harmed patients for years Jonathan Howat, of Thompsons Solicitors who handled Ms Almond-Roots' case, said her treatment was ""appalling"". ""The disgraceful conduct of Eljamel has left my client with very serious and life-changing injuries that affect every aspect of her daily life,"" he said. ""The level of compensation Ms Almond-Roots has received highlights the seriousness of what has been inflicted upon her."" He said the damages took into account ""the fact that my client will need to pay for additional care for the rest of her life"". ""The injuries caused by this rogue surgeon are appalling and we are glad that his negligent practices have been brought to light,"" Mr Howat added. Sam Eljamel was the head of the neurosurgery department in Ninewells Hospital in Dundee Mr Eljamel was head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside, and also worked at Fernbrae private hospital in Dundee as well as being an adviser to the Scottish government. He began treating Ms Almond-Roots in 2013 after she experienced a pain in her thighs that was radiating upwards. She saw Mr Eljamel at both Ninewells NHS hospital in Dundee and the private Fernbrae hospital. Thompsons Solicitors said Ms Almond-Roots reached a settlement of Â£2,810,118 at the Court of Session. It has not yet been determined what share of the damages will be paid by the private hospital and NHS Tayside, as Ms Almond-Roots was treated by Mr Eljamel at both. He was suspended from his post at NHS Tayside following internal and external reviews in 2013. He was placed under interim conditions by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) in 2014 and then removed himself from the General Medical Council (GMC) register, which means he can no longer practice in the UK. BBC Scotland's Disclosure found in 2018that Mr Eljamel had harmed patients for years at NHS Tayside. He was allowed to continue operating even after an external investigation found he was injuring patients. Last year, the BBC found he wasworking as a surgeon in Libya. NHS Tayside said it could not comment because it was an ongoing case.

Even so, he hopes that the pandemic will ""recalibrate"" the workplace. Rather than being a novelty, he says, ""I think this is the new now."" Recruiters are finding it tricky to navigate the expectations of candidates demanding hybrid and remote working, and companies who want people back in the office for at least some of the time. Kam Vara says people are turning down jobs which don't offer remote working Kam Vara, a consultant at Katie Bard recruitment, says it has been a very challenging few months. ""It used to be that people would fit their lives around their work. Covid is teaching people that it doesn't work that way any more"", she says. ""People are turning down opportunities because they don't offer remote working, and they would rather sit tight and wait for the right job to become available"". She adds: ""It feels quite messy right now. What an employer is looking for is some sort of order. To get people into the office and have some structure. But what employees are looking for is something very different. It's going to be like this for a while until the jigsaw fits together."" In England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson recommended a ""gradual return to work"" over the summer as coronavirus restrictions eased. Across the rest of the UK, people are still being advised to keep clocking on remotely where possible. And working remotely full-time for office staff could well become the norm again. This video can not be played Q&A: How do you bring people back to workplace? On Tuesday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPsthat advising people in England should work from home again would be part of the government's contingency plans if there was considerable pressure on the NHS this winter. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, added that the policy could make ""a significant difference to transmission if we get into trouble"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday: ""The most important and effective way of reducing spread of the virus is not to be in contact with other people."" The BBC commissioned polling organisation YouGov to survey 1,684 working adults and 530 senior leaders in business about their predictions and opinions on working from home. YouGov also re-ran a previous survey of 4,041 British adults, first conducted in March 2021, about their current working from home situation. Have your working arrangements changed?

"This video can not be played The US, UK and Australian leaders welcomed what President Biden described as a ""historic step"" The UK, US and Australia have announced a historic security pact in the Asia-Pacific, in what's seen as an effort to counter China. It will let Australia build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time, using technology provided by the US. The Aukus pact, which will also cover AI and other technologies, is one of the countries' biggest defence partnerships in decades, analysts say. China has condemned the agreement as ""extremely irresponsible"". Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it ""seriously undermines regional peace and stability and intensifies the arms race"". China's embassy in Washington accused the countries of a ""Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice"". The pact also created a row with France, which has now lost a deal with Australia to build 12 submarines. ""It's really a stab in the back,"" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. The new partnership was announced in a joint virtual press conference between US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday. And while China was not mentioned directly, the three leaders referred repeatedly to regional security concerns which they said had ""grown significantly"". This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China Speaking to the BBC, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said China was ""embarking on one of the biggest military spends in history"". ""It is growing its navy [and] air force at a huge rate. Obviously it is engaged in some disputed areas,"" he said. ""Our partners in those regions want to be able to stand their own ground."" In recent years, Beijing has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea. ANALYSIS: Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED: Tensions in the South China Sea On Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pact would ""preserve security and stability around the world"" and generate ""hundreds of high-skilled jobs"". He also said the relationship with France was ""rock solid"". The Aukus alliance is probably the most significant security arrangement between the three nations since World War Two, analysts say. The pact will focus on military capability, separating it from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance which also includes New Zealand and Canada. While Australia's submarines is the big-ticket item, Aukus will also involve the sharing of cyber capabilities and other undersea technologies. ""This is an historic opportunity for the three nations, with like-minded allies and partners, to protect shared values and promote security and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region,"" the joint statement read. ""This really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter [China's] aggressive moves in the Indo-Pacific,"" said Guy Boekenstein from the Asia Society Australia. France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said trust with Australia ""had been betrayed"" Western nations have been wary of China's infrastructure investment on Pacific islands, and have also criticised China's trade sanctions against countries like Australia. Australia had in the past maintained good relations with China, its biggest trading partner. But the relationship has broken down in recent years amid political tensions. But there is tension now too with France, after Australia tore up the A$50bn (â¬31bn; Â£27bn) deal to build 12 submarines. ""We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed,"" Mr Le Drian said. These submarines are much faster and harder to detect than conventionally powered fleets. They can stay submerged for months, shoot missiles longer distances and also carry more. Having them stationed in Australia is critical to US influence in the region, analysts say. The US is sharing its submarine technology for the first time in 50 years. It had previously only shared technology with the UK. Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines, after the US, UK, France, China, India and Russia. Australia has reaffirmed it has no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons. Meanwhile New Zealand said it would ban Australia's submarines from its waters, in line with an existing policy on the presence of nuclear-powered submarines. New Zealand, although a Five Eyes member, has been more cautiousin aligning with either the US or China in the Pacific. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her nation had not been approached to join the pact. Is the Five Eyes alliance in trouble?

"This video can not be played Watch: Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China China has criticised a historic security pact between the US, UK and Australia, describing it as ""extremely irresponsible"" and ""narrow-minded"". The deal will see the US and UK give Australia the technology to build nuclear-powered submarines for the first time. It is being widely viewed as an effort to counter China's influence in the contested South China Sea. The region has been a flashpoint for years and tensions there remain high. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the alliance risked ""severely damaging regional peace... and intensifying the arms race"". He criticised what he called ""the obsolete Cold War... mentality"" and warned the three countries were ""hurting their own interests"". Chinese state media carried similar editorials denouncing the pact, and one in the Global Times newspaper said Australia had now ""turned itself into an adversary of China"". ANALYSIS: Why this pact signals a major shift EXPLAINED: Tensions in the South China Sea The US is sharing its submarine technology for the first time in 60 years, having previously only shared it with the UK. It means Australia will be able to build nuclear-powered submarines that are faster and harder to detect than conventionally powered fleets. They can stay submerged for months and shoot missiles longer distances - although Australia says it has no intention of putting nuclear weapons on them. The new partnership, under the name Aukus, was announced in a joint virtual press conference between US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning.

It means Australia will become just the seventh nation in the world to operate nuclear-powered submarines. While they are the big-ticket item in the deal, cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence and other undersea technologies will also be shared. Australia will also acquire long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, and allow more US troops to be stationed in the country's north. ""This really shows that all three nations are drawing a line in the sand to start and counter [China's] aggressive moves,"" said Guy Boekenstein from the Asia Society Australia. Boris Johnson later said the pact would ""preserve security and stability around the world"" and generate ""hundreds of high-skilled jobs"". UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the BBC that China was ""embarking on one of the biggest military spends in history... Our partners in those regions want to be able to stand their own ground."" This video can not be played Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea? In recent years, Beijing has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea. It has been increasingly assertive over what it says are centuries-old rights to the contested region, and has been rapidly building up its military presence to back up those claims. The US has bolstered its military presence too, and has been investing heavily in other partnerships in the region such as with Japan and South Korea. Having the submarines stationed in Australia is critical to US influence in the region, analysts say. The Western powers have also been wary of China's infrastructure investment on Pacific islands, although it remains below US and Australian spending there. China is Australia's biggest trading partner, and in the past, the two have maintained good relations. But in recent years that has broken down. Australia has accused Beijing of interfering in its domestic politics, blocked Chinese investment, and banned Chinese telecom giant Huawei from building Australian tech infrastructure. The year when Australia and China hit 'lowest ebb' Canberra also echoed a call by the US last year for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. Beijing's response was to deliver a series of trade punishments - sanctioning over a dozen Australian goods.It has slapped Australian wine with taxes of up to 200%. Australia hopes the new alliance will also help cushion the economic blowback. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday: ""Beijing has seen over the past months that Australia will not back down and the threats of economic retaliation and pressure simply will not work."" But France has also reacted angrily to the new pact, because it means Australia will now abandon a $50bn (â¬31bn; Â£27bn) deal with it to build 12 submarines. ""It's really a stab in the back,"" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. ""We had established a relationship of trust with Australia, this trust has been betrayed."" The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell said he understood why France was disappointed by the deal, adding that the EU was not consulted about the new alliance. ""This forces us once again... to reflect on the need to make the issue of European strategic autonomy a priority. This shows that we must survive on our own,"" he said on Thursday. Secretary Blinken said the US cooperated ""incredibly closely"" with France and would continue to do so, adding that ""we place fundamental value on that relationship, on that partnership"".

"The UK government should cut rising energy bills by getting rid of levies that subsidise renewable energy, the boss of E.On UK has said. Speaking to the Financial Times,external,Michael Lewis said green subsidies should be funded through tax instead. Regulators have warned that consumer energy bills will be hit by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally. Wholesale energy prices rose on Thursday after a key electricity cable between Britain and France shut down. Mr Lewis said: ""This is going to be a very challenging winter for customers and for suppliers and there is a real short-term imperative to do what we can to help consumers."" Green levies account for around a quarter of energy bills, he said. Mr Lewis recommended removing green levies and paying for subsidies through general taxation, ""so these costs are funded more progressively and we level the playing field on the cost of cleaner heating."" ""Then we can also start to apply something like a carbon tax on gas on a 'polluter pays' principle,"" he added. A government spokesperson said: ""Our energy price cap will protect millions of customers this winter from sudden increases in global gas prices. ""Millions of low-income households will also benefit from a Â£140 discount on their bills, with added support offered to pensioners and the most vulnerable over the colder months."" The fire at the National Grid site broke out just after midnight on Wednesday A jump in prices after a UK electricity interconnector was taken offline after a fire has been fuelling concerns about inflation and the potential impact on businesses just as the country's economy starts to recover from the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic. National Grid said the fire and planned maintenance at a site near Ashford in Kent meant the cable will be totally offline until 25 September. Half of its capacity, or one gigawatt (GW) of power, is expected to remain unavailable until late March 2022. On Wednesday, British electricity prices for the following day jumped by 19% to Â£475 per megawatt hour (MWh). Theenergy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, ""will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK"". The price cap, which limits the price firms can charge customers who have not recently changed their energy tariff,will increase in Octoberin order to cover rising wholesale costs. The fire at the Interconnexion France-Angleterre (IFA) site broke out in the early hours of Wednesday. The site was evacuated and there were no reports of casualties. After the fire an electricity interconnector running under the English Channel was ""not operating"", the National Grid said in a statement. Electricity interconnectors,externalare high-voltage cables that connect the electricity systems of neighbouring countries, and allow them to share excess power. A spokesperson for National Grid's electricity system operator, which balances power supplies in the UK, said it expects to ""continue supplying electricity safely and securely"" despite the incident. The link can carry up to 2GW of power, and had been importing electricity from France in recent days, after UK prices hit a record high of Â£540 per MWh on the wholesale energy market. Analysts are now closely watching National Grid's efforts to get the facility fully back online as winter approaches and with it higher energy demand. Glenn Rickson, head of European power analysis at S&P Global Platts Analytics, told Reuters: ""The outage is going to lift the potential for price volatility as long as it's offline... and of course demand will get higher as we move further into winter."" UK Steel director general Gareth Stace pointed out that the ""extortionate"" electricity prices had already forced some steelmakers to suspend operations. ""Even with the global steel market as buoyant as it is, these eye-watering prices are making it impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day and night,"" he said. Other analysts have suggested that as a result, the UK may have to rely more heavily on gas-fired power stations in the coming months. Wholesale gas prices are already elevated for several reasons, such as low winds meaning less renewable energy is generated, outages at some nuclear stations and lower flows into the UK of the gas from Norway. On Wednesday, fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings said it was suspending operations at both its Billingham and Ince manufacturing complexes due to high gas costs. National Grid said its investigation into the fire at the IFA site was continuing and it would ""update the market with any changes as necessary"". Britain is a net importer of electricity and near neighbour France is its biggest supplier of power through the interconnectors that run under the English Channel. The IFA2 interconnector, a second link between Britain and France, is currently operating at its full capacity and not affected by the problem. The 1GW connection is a Â£700m shared investment with French power firm RTE and the UK's fourth power exchange with continental Europe.

"The Co-op has announced a partnership with Amazon Prime, enabling customers across the UK to do their whole grocery shop online with same-day delivery. The supermarket chain is also extending its robot deliveries, so it can push online sales up from Â£70m to Â£200m. The partnership launched in Glasgow and surrounding areas on Thursday and will be rolled out to other parts of the country before the end of the year. But the GMB union has accused the Co-op of compromising its ethics. Robots to deliver groceries in second town Delivery robot takes plunge into canal Amazon Prime customers will be able to do their shopping on the Amazon UK website. Same-day delivery with two-hour scheduled slots is offered for free on all orders over Â£40. The minimum value for an order is Â£15 and a Â£3.99 delivery charge applies to all orders below Â£40. Two towns in England - Milton Keynes and Northampton - are already receiving Co-op grocery deliveries from autonomous robot vehicles made by Starship Technologies, a firm set up by the founders of Skype. The supermarket chain plans to increase the number of robots operating and delivering Co-op groceries from 200 to 500 by the end of this year, extending them from Milton Keynes and Northampton to Cambridgeshire and then into northern England. Co-op group chief executive Steve Murrells said: ""The pandemic has accelerated changes in consumer shopping trends and we're driving forward with exciting plans to provide rapid kerb-to-kitchen grocery delivery services. ""We are delighted to be working with Amazon. Its reach and leading technology and innovative approach means greater convenience for people in their communities."" But GMB national officer Andy Prendergast criticised the move: ""It's really disappointing to see a company with a proud ethical heritage like Co-op teaming up with Amazon: a tax-evading multinational with a horrifying health and safety record. ""Workers in Amazon warehouses are treated like robots. They are knocked unconscious, suffer broken bones and are taken away in ambulances in their desperate pursuit of unrealistic targets."" The union added that it had concerns about the amount of tax Amazon pays in the UK, as well as the fact that bosses had failed to recognise a union to protect Amazon workers' rights. Amazon said it offered ""excellent pay, benefits and opportunities for career growth, all while working in a safe, modern work environment"". The online retailer also said it had invested Â£32bn in the UK since 2010, paying Â£1.5bn in tax last year. Andy Brian, partner at retail specialist law firm Gordons, says the Co-op-Amazon partnership is ""really where the future lies"". ""Who can successfully - and profitably - get products ordered on mobile devices to customers in the shortest possible time, so they don't even have to bother with shops at all,"" he said. ""Demand for this type of fast, no-hassle service will only increase in line with the ability for consumers to order products easily, with one-click, directly from social media or through QR codes.""

She says Trevelyan's predecessor, Liz Truss - who is now foreign secretary - ""leaves behind a legacy of major problems"" at the department. The UK doesn't have ""a single completed deal we didn't have inside the EU"" she says. And she goes on to list the areas where she says Truss ""caved in"" or failed to respond - before saying she hopes the new minister is ""getting her feet under the table"" and sorting out the issues. The Institute for Government,externalhas been looking at the new cabinet and which seats the MPs represent, and it makes for interesting reading. It notes that Boris Johnson's top team now has slightly more ministers from the North and slightly fewer from the Midlands. Five posts are now held by MPs with northern seats, with Anne-Marie Trevelyan (Berwick-upon-Tweed), Simon Clarke (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) and Nigel Adams (Selby and Ainsty) swelling the ranks from two to five. But the Midlands loses two representatives, with both Gavin Williamson (South Staffordshire) and Robert Jenrick (Newark) both sacked.

Peter SaullBBC Political Reporter While it's gone a bit quiet on Downing Street, the cafes of Parliament are full of chatter about the reshuffle. The Conservative MPs I've spoken to are almost universally positive about the changes Boris Johnson has made to his top team. There's an acceptance that a refresh was needed and there is little surprise, for example, that Gavin Williamson lost his job as education secretary. Nadhim Zahawi is considered a highly capable replacement, with several Tories praising his handling of the vaccine rollout. Some admit to being surprised at the appointment of Nadine Dorries as culture secretary, with one MP wryly observing: ""We're going to have fun"". However, others point out that her previous experience as minister for suicide prevention will come in handy as she gets to grips with the issue of online safety. By this time on a Thursday afternoon, MPs are usually starting to drift back to their constituencies, but a few Conservatives are hanging around a bit longer in case they get summoned to Downing Street. ""We're all waiting for a call,"" one admitted. After a flurry of announcements late last night and early this morning, Boris Johnson's reshuffle appears to have entered something of an intermission. This may be connected to the fact the prime minister has been hosting the crown prince of Abu Dhabi in Downing Street this afternoon, as well as speaking in the House of Common this morning. Ahead of announcements we expect to resume later, here's a recap of what's happened so far today:  Yesterday's reshuffle means more ministers now attend cabinet Among the 30 ministers who will now attend cabinet, there are eight women - up from six previously. It means the proportion of women has gone from from 22% to 27%, as only 27 ministers took part in cabinet meetings before the reshuffle. There are now seven cabinet attendees from an ethnic minority, an increase of one but similar as a share of the total (up slightly from 22% to 23%). And the number who are privately educated has gone up slightly from 17 beforehand to 18 now. Appointing Michael Gove as the governmentâs âlevelling-upâ chief in the cabinet reshuffle will help people to understand the phrase, the chairman of the Northern Research Group of Tory backbenchers has said. Jake Berry said the challenge was to âbring some definitionâ to the term that âmeans all things to all peopleâ. âAnd we also need to be able to point out to people how we are getting on and doing it.â The Rossendale and Darwen MP said the next election could be in 2023 and he reckoned Mr Gove would ârelentlessly focus on shovels in the ground, demonstrating howlevelling upis changing peopleâs lives"". One task for Mr Gove is the big issue of planning reform. Some Tory MPs in southern England fear the plans could lead to mass house building. But Mr Berry was more receptive, adding: âFrankly, in many parts of the north of England people are quite keen to see more houses built. I understand thatâs not the same across the country, and itâs not the same all parts of the north of course. âThe planning system needs reform, in my view it is a clog on economic activity, particularly the time it takes, so I do hope he will take the opportunity to look at that."" And as Boris Johnson continues to appoint junior ministers, Mr Berry called on him to recruit more northern MPs into ministerial roles.

"Boris Johnson is continuing a major reshuffle of his government ministers Junior and mid-ranking ministers are waiting to hear if they have new jobs Yesterday, Liz Truss became the new foreign secretary, replacing Dominic Raab Raab is confirmed in three roles - justice secretary, Lord Chancellor and deputy prime minister Former vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi is the new education secretary Nadine Dorries is secretary of state for culture, media and sport Today, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general to be minister at the trade department John Whittingdale leaves his job as minister at the culture department Jennifer Scott and Sinead Wilson Boris Johnson replaces ministers who quit and forced him to announce his departure as prime minister. Michael Gove is known as a reformer and is now in charge of controversial planning changes. We're going to wrap up our rolling live coverage here of Boris Johnson's reshuffle. But don't fret! We will bring you coverage of any significant developments as and when they occur this evening on ourwebsiteandTwitter feed,external. Your writers today were Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, Arryn Moy and Sinead Wilson. And your editors were Georgina Pattinson and Jennifer Scott. We've just had these confirmations from Downing Street about who is leaving the government:   Labour's Emily Thornberry will now face Anne-Marie Trevelyan across the dispatch box Shadow International Trade Secretary, Emily Thornberry, hastaken to Twitter,externalto set out the challenges for her new counterpart, Anne-Marie Trevelyan -  or what she calls ""a beginner's guide to the mess she's inherited"". She says Trevelyan's predecessor, Liz Truss - who is now foreign secretary - ""leaves behind a legacy of major problems"" at the department. The UK doesn't have ""a single completed deal we didn't have inside the EU"" she says. And she goes on to list the areas where she says Truss ""caved in"" or failed to respond - before saying she hopes the new minister is ""getting her feet under the table"" and sorting out the issues. The Institute for Government,externalhas been looking at the new cabinet and which seats the MPs represent, and it makes for interesting reading. It notes that Boris Johnson's top team now has slightly more ministers from the North and slightly fewer from the Midlands. Five posts are now held by MPs with northern seats, with Anne-Marie Trevelyan (Berwick-upon-Tweed), Simon Clarke (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) and Nigel Adams (Selby and Ainsty) swelling the ranks from two to five. But the Midlands loses two representatives, with both Gavin Williamson (South Staffordshire) and Robert Jenrick (Newark) both sacked. We are eagerly waiting some more ministerial moves this afternoon. But just in case you haven't followed every change so far (we are sure you have),take a look at our run downof who is in and who is out of Boris Johnson's new cabinet. Question Time is returning to BBC One tonight with a studio audience! And with reshuffles, Covid plans and submarine alliances, you can be sure the panel will have lots to talk about.

Nadine Dorries made her debut at the dispatch box Liz Truss took her coffee to go After a day of being moved in to or out of the cabinet, or to a new role, those in the headlines yesterday have been snapped out and about. New Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries was welcomed
by the Speaker as the Commons started with her taking questions on her culture, media and sport department. The newly-appointed Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, was seen outside her new office ahead of chairing a meeting of Commonwealth foreign ministers. Being a little quieter was Justice Secretary
and deputy PM Domini Raab, who had little to say as he went into the Ministry of
Justice. And sacked Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick had
a quick chat as he left home for the synagogue. Dominic Raab faces his demotion head on Robert Jenrick's first day back on the backbenches Liz Truss is known throughout Westminster for her use of social media to promote her work in government. In a piece for the Times,externalin 2018, she claimed it had ""brought lots of younger people into politics"", as well as allowing her to showcase her ""passion for burgers and beaches"". True to form - and much like her other new colleagues - she is now tweeting on her first day in her new job as foreign secretary, updating her followers with news of a meeting with her counterparts in the Commonwealth.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid is one minister who held on to his job in the reshuffle - having only been in post since June. And he has been busy in Blackpool today, making his first speech in the role. Javid says dealing with record waiting lists in the NHS will be a top priority. But he says he can't just be the ""minister for Covid"" because of all the other ""hidden costs"" of the pandemic that need dealing with. Coronavirus has also shone a light on the health disparities that exist
across the country, he says, and high on his agenda will be tackling those and overhauling  mental health provision and social care. Here is another minister taking to social media to mark his first day in the new job. Nadhim Zahawi replaced Gavin Williamson as education secretary in Wednesday's shake-up.

"The UK government should cut rising energy bills by getting rid of levies that subsidise renewable energy, the boss of E.On UK has said. Speaking to the Financial Times,external,Michael Lewis said green subsidies should be funded through tax instead. Regulators have warned that consumer energy bills will be hit by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally. Wholesale energy prices rose on Thursday after a key electricity cable between Britain and France shut down. Mr Lewis said: ""This is going to be a very challenging winter for customers and for suppliers and there is a real short-term imperative to do what we can to help consumers."" Green levies account for around a quarter of energy bills, he said. Mr Lewis recommended removing green levies and paying for subsidies through general taxation, ""so these costs are funded more progressively and we level the playing field on the cost of cleaner heating."" ""Then we can also start to apply something like a carbon tax on gas on a 'polluter pays' principle,"" he added. A government spokesperson said: ""Our energy price cap will protect millions of customers this winter from sudden increases in global gas prices. ""Millions of low-income households will also benefit from a Â£140 discount on their bills, with added support offered to pensioners and the most vulnerable over the colder months."" The fire at the National Grid site broke out just after midnight on Wednesday A jump in prices after a UK electricity interconnector was taken offline after a fire has been fuelling concerns about inflation and the potential impact on businesses just as the country's economy starts to recover from the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic. National Grid said the fire and planned maintenance at a site near Ashford in Kent meant the cable will be totally offline until 25 September. Half of its capacity, or one gigawatt (GW) of power, is expected to remain unavailable until late March 2022. On Wednesday, British electricity prices for the following day jumped by 19% to Â£475 per megawatt hour (MWh). Theenergy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, ""will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK"". The price cap, which limits the price firms can charge customers who have not recently changed their energy tariff,will increase in Octoberin order to cover rising wholesale costs. The fire at the Interconnexion France-Angleterre (IFA) site broke out in the early hours of Wednesday. The site was evacuated and there were no reports of casualties. After the fire an electricity interconnector running under the English Channel was ""not operating"", the National Grid said in a statement. Electricity interconnectors,externalare high-voltage cables that connect the electricity systems of neighbouring countries, and allow them to share excess power. A spokesperson for National Grid's electricity system operator, which balances power supplies in the UK, said it expects to ""continue supplying electricity safely and securely"" despite the incident. The link can carry up to 2GW of power, and had been importing electricity from France in recent days, after UK prices hit a record high of Â£540 per MWh on the wholesale energy market. Analysts are now closely watching National Grid's efforts to get the facility fully back online as winter approaches and with it higher energy demand. Glenn Rickson, head of European power analysis at S&P Global Platts Analytics, told Reuters: ""The outage is going to lift the potential for price volatility as long as it's offline... and of course demand will get higher as we move further into winter."" UK Steel director general Gareth Stace pointed out that the ""extortionate"" electricity prices had already forced some steelmakers to suspend operations. ""Even with the global steel market as buoyant as it is, these eye-watering prices are making it impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day and night,"" he said. Other analysts have suggested that as a result, the UK may have to rely more heavily on gas-fired power stations in the coming months. Wholesale gas prices are already elevated for several reasons, such as low winds meaning less renewable energy is generated, outages at some nuclear stations and lower flows into the UK of the gas from Norway. On Wednesday, fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings said it was suspending operations at both its Billingham and Ince manufacturing complexes due to high gas costs. National Grid said its investigation into the fire at the IFA site was continuing and it would ""update the market with any changes as necessary"". Britain is a net importer of electricity and near neighbour France is its biggest supplier of power through the interconnectors that run under the English Channel. The IFA2 interconnector, a second link between Britain and France, is currently operating at its full capacity and not affected by the problem. The 1GW connection is a Â£700m shared investment with French power firm RTE and the UK's fourth power exchange with continental Europe.

"This video can not be played Watch: Four 'amateur astronauts' launched into orbit by SpaceX Four amateur astronauts have blasted off from Florida on their private mission to orbit. TheInspiration4,externalcrew, comprising one billionaire and three ""ordinary citizens"", rode out of the Kennedy Space Center in a Dragon capsule provided by the SpaceX rocket company. The quartet will spend the next three days circling the Earth. It's another milestone in the space tourism market, which is experiencing a resurgence after a decade's hiatus. Earlier this summer, billionaire businessmenSir Richard BransonandJeff Bezoswent above Earth's atmosphere in their own space vehicles. And following this latest mission, there'll be three privateer visits to the International Space Station (ISS) - one in October, carrying a Russian movie director and an actress, and two either side of the New Year. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? Cancer survivor joins historic space mission Billionaire Branson rockets to the edge of space Mr Isaacman (nearest) shouted ""Punch it, SpaceX!"" moments before launch The Inspiration4 crew of Jared Issacman, Hayley Arceneaux, Sian Proctor and Chris Sembroski have had six months of intensive training with SpaceX. However, onboard computer systems will be in control of their Dragon capsule, overseen by SpaceX teams on the ground. The Dragon is not going anywhere near the ISS. It's on a ""free flight"" to a target altitude of 575km (360 miles). That's about 150km above the orbiting laboratory, and roughly the height from where the Hubble Space Telescope views the cosmos. (L-R) Sembroski, Proctor, Isaacman and Arceneaux trained for six months Even if they don't have a destination as such, the foursome will have plenty to keep them occupied. They've taken up scientific experiments to be conducted inside their Dragon capsule, and SpaceX has modified their temporary home to include a big window, which the crew is sure to be using during downtime to wonder at the Earth below. The Inspiration4 venture was purchased from SpaceX by Mr Isaacman, 38, who made his fortune developing systems to process credit card payments. But rather than go on an ""outing with fishing buddies"", he decided, as he saw it, to inject real purpose into the flight. So, he gifted the three adjacent seats to people with inspirational stories. Fans of Haley Arceneaux turned out to watch the flight go up This is perhaps best illustrated in 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. She overcame bone cancer as a child and as an adult has gone back to work for the medical facility that cured her - theSt Jude Children's Research Hospital,externalin Memphis, Tennessee. Mr Isaacman wants to raise $200m for St Jude's work. Haley Arceneaux was treated for cancer at St Jude as a 10 year-old Dr Sian Proctor, 51, is a geoscientist and science communicator. She actually came close to being a Nasa astronaut in 2009 but missed out in the final round of selection. Dr Proctor won her seat through her role as an artist and by demonstrating her entrepreneurial skills. She plans to paint while looking out the Dragon's domed window. Chris Sembroski, 42, is a US Air Force veteran and works as an engineer with aerospace company Lockheed Martin. He'd made a donation to St Jude that also entered him into a lottery draw for the fourth position in the crew. Mr Sembroski didn't win the lottery - but a friend did, and asked him to take the place. The Dragon capsule and its Falcon rocket head out over the Atlantic Ocean SpaceX and Inspiration4 have described Wednesday's launch as the first ""all-civilian mission to orbit"". That depends very much on your definition of ""civilian"". The first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, was technically a civilian, having resigned his Navy commission in 1960, nine years before Apollo 11. The big window during development at SpaceX Artwork: The glass dome should provide stunning views But there's no doubting the Dragon flight commanded by Mr Isaacman has significance. Space activity - even human spaceflight - is becoming ever more commercial, and the idea that people can go to orbit outside of the purview of the major national space agencies will increasingly look normal. The 2000s saw several super-wealthy individuals spend a fortnight on the ISS. That particular era of space tourism ended in 2009 when spare seats on Russian rockets were bought up for the exclusive use of Nasa astronauts. But this second era looks as though it will be more resilient, simply because there are many more private space companies chasing the business, and this should bring down prices for a wider pool of customers. Elon Musk's vision is for humans to be living on Mars Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is intent on making humans ""a multi-planet species"". And Mr Isaacman regards Inspiration4 as a signpost of where things are going. He was very keen that his Dragon go higher than astronauts usually go. And not since the final shuttle servicing mission of Hubble in 2009 have people been to an altitude above 570km. ""We've been going to the space station (420km) for some time, and there's just unbelievable science and research and great contributions that are coming out of there. But if we're going to go to the Moon again, and we're going to go to Mars and beyond, we've got to get a little outside of our comfort zone and take that next step in that direction,"" he said before launch. ""So that was really the rationale (for our choice of altitude)."" Some commentators have voiced concern about the collective impact on the Earth's climate of spaceflights like this one. SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket uses highly refined kerosene fuel which produces the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (COâ), along with nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to warming. Emissions from rocket launches remain tiny compared with the aviation industry, though they are projected to grow.

"Stephen Leonard was known as Stephen Chafer when he murdered a three-year-old girl in 1979 The father of a three-year-old killed in 1979 said he was ""gutted"" he could not see the full official reviews after her murderer tried to kill again. Stephen Chafer, also known as Stephen Leonard, killed Lorraine Holt and, after being released from jail twice,nearly decapitated a woman in 2018. Lorraine's dad Jim Holt said he did not ""want the same mistakes made again"". The Ministry of Justice said ""details"" would be shared with him, but not whole reports. Chafer was 17 years old when he carried Lorraine, whom he was related to through marriage, to the grounds of a vicarage in Derby. He sexually assaulted her before stabbing her 39 times on 20 January 1979. He pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed, before being released in 2002. Stephen Chafer admitted the murder of Lorraine Holt in 1979 More than 10 years later, Chafer - now known as Stephen Leonard - was jailed for 26 months for arson, having removed the fire alarms at his Peterborough flat and set it alight. In June 2018, just under a year after being released on licence, he stabbed Faye Mills, a 60-year-old woman with dementia whom he had known for about 15 years, in a ""frenzied"" attack over an argument about a garden rake in Peterborough. Prosecutor Charles Falk had told the trial he ""almost decapitated her"" and the extent of her injuries made it ""almost inexplicable"" she lived. He was convicted of attempted murder andjailed for life, with a minimum term of 17 years. Following the attack on Ms Mills both a serious case review (SCR) and a serious further offence (SFO) review were completed. In July 2019, the BBC asked the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) for the SCR through the Freedom of Information Act, but this was refused on the grounds of personal information. After the BBC took the request to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the MOJ further cited ""information provided in confidence"" as a reason for refusal. The ICO agreed with the MOJ and the review has not been released. Jim Holt has asked to see the reviews However, Mr Holt claimed he was told he would receive a copy of the reviews, but that he was now being refused them. ""All I wanted was the reports, for them to admit that they made a mistake,"" he said. ""This isn't about Lorraine anymore. This is about all child killers that you are releasing, because if you're making mistakes on Stephen Chafer, Stephen Leonard, whatever you want to call him, you're making mistakes elsewhere because people just don't learn."" He said he believed the authorities were ""scared to death I'm going to sue"". But he added: ""I don't want the money - no amount of money can bring my daughter back. ""I just don't want the same mistakes made again with other criminals."" Mr Holt had been offered a meeting and said: ""I'm prepared to meet them but I'm gutted that they say one thing and then do another - that's not fair."" The Ministry of Justice has since said that, in general, SFO reviews were provided to victims of later offences to share with them the actions being taken to address any failings in the supervision of offenders. It said the confidential information in them was not routinely available to victims of the initial offences. A spokesman said: ""The details of this review have already been shared with the victims of this crime and we are also meeting with Mr Holt to do the same. ""We are committed to ensuring victims get the information they need to understand what happened, which is why we disclose SFO reviews to victims of the offence where they request to receive them.""

"Boris Johnson is continuing a major reshuffle of his government ministers Junior and mid-ranking ministers are waiting to hear if they have new jobs Yesterday, Liz Truss became the new foreign secretary, replacing Dominic Raab Raab is confirmed in three roles - justice secretary, Lord Chancellor and deputy prime minister Former vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi is the new education secretary Nadine Dorries is secretary of state for culture, media and sport Today, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general to be minister at the trade department John Whittingdale leaves his job as minister at the culture department Jennifer Scott and Sinead Wilson Boris Johnson replaces ministers who quit and forced him to announce his departure as prime minister. Michael Gove is known as a reformer and is now in charge of controversial planning changes. We're going to wrap up our rolling live coverage here of Boris Johnson's reshuffle. But don't fret! We will bring you coverage of any significant developments as and when they occur this evening on ourwebsiteandTwitter feed,external. Your writers today were Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, Arryn Moy and Sinead Wilson. And your editors were Georgina Pattinson and Jennifer Scott. We've just had these confirmations from Downing Street about who is leaving the government:   Labour's Emily Thornberry will now face Anne-Marie Trevelyan across the dispatch box Shadow International Trade Secretary, Emily Thornberry, hastaken to Twitter,externalto set out the challenges for her new counterpart, Anne-Marie Trevelyan -  or what she calls ""a beginner's guide to the mess she's inherited"". She says Trevelyan's predecessor, Liz Truss - who is now foreign secretary - ""leaves behind a legacy of major problems"" at the department. The UK doesn't have ""a single completed deal we didn't have inside the EU"" she says. And she goes on to list the areas where she says Truss ""caved in"" or failed to respond - before saying she hopes the new minister is ""getting her feet under the table"" and sorting out the issues. The Institute for Government,externalhas been looking at the new cabinet and which seats the MPs represent, and it makes for interesting reading. It notes that Boris Johnson's top team now has slightly more ministers from the North and slightly fewer from the Midlands. Five posts are now held by MPs with northern seats, with Anne-Marie Trevelyan (Berwick-upon-Tweed), Simon Clarke (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) and Nigel Adams (Selby and Ainsty) swelling the ranks from two to five. But the Midlands loses two representatives, with both Gavin Williamson (South Staffordshire) and Robert Jenrick (Newark) both sacked. We are eagerly waiting some more ministerial moves this afternoon. But just in case you haven't followed every change so far (we are sure you have),take a look at our run downof who is in and who is out of Boris Johnson's new cabinet. Question Time is returning to BBC One tonight with a studio audience! And with reshuffles, Covid plans and submarine alliances, you can be sure the panel will have lots to talk about.

Nadine Dorries made her debut at the dispatch box Liz Truss took her coffee to go After a day of being moved in to or out of the cabinet, or to a new role, those in the headlines yesterday have been snapped out and about. New Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries was welcomed
by the Speaker as the Commons started with her taking questions on her culture, media and sport department. The newly-appointed Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, was seen outside her new office ahead of chairing a meeting of Commonwealth foreign ministers. Being a little quieter was Justice Secretary
and deputy PM Domini Raab, who had little to say as he went into the Ministry of
Justice. And sacked Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick had
a quick chat as he left home for the synagogue. Dominic Raab faces his demotion head on Robert Jenrick's first day back on the backbenches Liz Truss is known throughout Westminster for her use of social media to promote her work in government. In a piece for the Times,externalin 2018, she claimed it had ""brought lots of younger people into politics"", as well as allowing her to showcase her ""passion for burgers and beaches"". True to form - and much like her other new colleagues - she is now tweeting on her first day in her new job as foreign secretary, updating her followers with news of a meeting with her counterparts in the Commonwealth.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid is one minister who held on to his job in the reshuffle - having only been in post since June. And he has been busy in Blackpool today, making his first speech in the role. Javid says dealing with record waiting lists in the NHS will be a top priority. But he says he can't just be the ""minister for Covid"" because of all the other ""hidden costs"" of the pandemic that need dealing with. Coronavirus has also shone a light on the health disparities that exist
across the country, he says, and high on his agenda will be tackling those and overhauling  mental health provision and social care. Here is another minister taking to social media to mark his first day in the new job. Nadhim Zahawi replaced Gavin Williamson as education secretary in Wednesday's shake-up.

Peter SaullBBC Political Reporter While it's gone a bit quiet on Downing Street, the cafes of Parliament are full of chatter about the reshuffle. The Conservative MPs I've spoken to are almost universally positive about the changes Boris Johnson has made to his top team. There's an acceptance that a refresh was needed and there is little surprise, for example, that Gavin Williamson lost his job as education secretary. Nadhim Zahawi is considered a highly capable replacement, with several Tories praising his handling of the vaccine rollout. Some admit to being surprised at the appointment of Nadine Dorries as culture secretary, with one MP wryly observing: ""We're going to have fun"". However, others point out that her previous experience as minister for suicide prevention will come in handy as she gets to grips with the issue of online safety. By this time on a Thursday afternoon, MPs are usually starting to drift back to their constituencies, but a few Conservatives are hanging around a bit longer in case they get summoned to Downing Street. ""We're all waiting for a call,"" one admitted. After a flurry of announcements late last night and early this morning, Boris Johnson's reshuffle appears to have entered something of an intermission. This may be connected to the fact the prime minister has been hosting the crown prince of Abu Dhabi in Downing Street this afternoon, as well as speaking in the House of Common this morning. Ahead of announcements we expect to resume later, here's a recap of what's happened so far today:  Yesterday's reshuffle means more ministers now attend cabinet Among the 30 ministers who will now attend cabinet, there are eight women - up from six previously. It means the proportion of women has gone from from 22% to 27%, as only 27 ministers took part in cabinet meetings before the reshuffle. There are now seven cabinet attendees from an ethnic minority, an increase of one but similar as a share of the total (up slightly from 22% to 23%). And the number who are privately educated has gone up slightly from 17 beforehand to 18 now. Appointing Michael Gove as the governmentâs âlevelling-upâ chief in the cabinet reshuffle will help people to understand the phrase, the chairman of the Northern Research Group of Tory backbenchers has said. Jake Berry said the challenge was to âbring some definitionâ to the term that âmeans all things to all peopleâ. âAnd we also need to be able to point out to people how we are getting on and doing it.â The Rossendale and Darwen MP said the next election could be in 2023 and he reckoned Mr Gove would ârelentlessly focus on shovels in the ground, demonstrating howlevelling upis changing peopleâs lives"". One task for Mr Gove is the big issue of planning reform. Some Tory MPs in southern England fear the plans could lead to mass house building. But Mr Berry was more receptive, adding: âFrankly, in many parts of the north of England people are quite keen to see more houses built. I understand thatâs not the same across the country, and itâs not the same all parts of the north of course. âThe planning system needs reform, in my view it is a clog on economic activity, particularly the time it takes, so I do hope he will take the opportunity to look at that."" And as Boris Johnson continues to appoint junior ministers, Mr Berry called on him to recruit more northern MPs into ministerial roles.

"This video can not be played A look at a few of the ministers who have been promoted and demoted in Boris Johnson's cabinet reshuffle Boris Johnson is putting the finishing touches to his reshuffle after making significant changes to his top team. On Wednesday, the PM fired both Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, before replacing Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with Liz Truss. He has now moved on to confirming which junior ministers are in or out of jobs. But one ousted minister, John Whittingdale, told BBC's Newscast that the new team could lack experience. In some of the latest manoeuvres, Conor Burns, who resigned as a trade minister in 2020 after a report foundhe used ""veiled threats"" to aid his father in a financial dispute, returned to the front bench as a Northern Ireland minister. Others moved to more high-profile ministerial roles on Thursday included Alex Chalk, who was appointed Solicitor General, and Skills Minister Gillian Keegan, who now joins the Department for Health and Social Care. But Justin Tomlinson lost his job as minister for disabled people in the same department, while Matt Warman was sacked as minister of digital infrastructure. Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? Liz Truss: fast track to foreign secretary BBC specialists on Boris Johnson's reshuffle Former Brexit and Northern Ireland Minister, Robin Walker, has gone to the Department for Education, where he will work with the new Secretary of State, Nadhim Zahawi. And Helen Whately, who was the minister for social care, has been moved to the Treasury, but Jesse Norman joined the list of sackings. Earlier on Thursday, Penny Mordaunt left her post as paymaster general at the Cabinet Office to become a minister at the trade department. Mr Whittingdale - who lost his job as data minister at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport - said his post had been one he ""loved"" and was ""sad to give up"". He also revealed some of the PM's appointments ""came out of the blue"". The former minister told Newscast: ""I understand that every prime minister has to make room to allow people to be brought forward. I quite recognise the prime minister is keen to have a front-facing cabinet that reflects modern Britain. ""Equally it's no bad thing to have a bit of experience around that table and people who have got a good grasp of the detail of the jobs they are being asked to do."" There were big winners from the reshuffle too, included Nadine Dorries, who was promoted from being a junior health minister into her first cabinet-level jobas culture secretary. The Mid Bedfordshire MP is probably best known outside Westminster for her 2012 appearance on ITV's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Ms Truss, who is the Tory party's first female foreign secretary - and only the second woman to hold the role, following Labour's Margaret Beckett - said she was delighted by the appointment and would use the role to ""promote a positive, outward vision of global Britain"". Other changes made on Wednesday included: Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick being fired and replaced by Michael Gove Treasury minister Steve Barclay replacing Mr Gove as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden trading his role of culture secretary to be minister without portfolio at the Cabinet Office and Conservative Party co-chair Anne-Marie Trevelyan being promoted to replace Ms Truss as international trade secretary And Mr Raab being moved from the Foreign Office to become justice secretary, though he will also have the formal title of deputy prime minister Former Justice Secretary Mr Buckland's sacking was greeted with some surprise, with a number of Labour MPs tweeting praise for him and senior Conservative Sir Bob Neill - who chairs the Commons Justice Committee - saying he ""deserved better"". In aletter to the prime minister,externalafter his dismissal, Mr Buckland called for more investment in the justice system, adding that ""years of underfunding"" had made it harder for it to recover from the effects of the pandemic. Nadine Dorries appeared unsure of her promotion when she arrived at Downing Street on Wednesday New Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Mr Gove will also get the added responsibility of the government's ""levelling up"" agenda - which it claimed would spread wealth and opportunity around the country - while continuing to handle demands for another Scottish independence referendum. The Daily Telegraph reported,externalthat Mr Dowden, following his appointment as the Tory party's new co-chairman, had told staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters to start preparing for a general election which could be in 20 months' time. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done. Whether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case. Nearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister.

"This video can not be played ""Legal action could end up closing us down."" Care home owners have said they are struggling to find insurance against Covid-19 claims, which could lead to closures. They want the Welsh government to provide an indemnity similar to the one which protects the NHS. And they have also called the UK government's backing of insurance indemnity for live events a ""slap in the face"" for the care sector. The Welsh government said it is a UK-wide issue. It added it was working with other governments to find a solution. Diary reveals lockdown isolation at care home Care home owner trying to keep 'head above water' Public liability insurance is a legal requirement for care home registration but owners have reported the cost has doubled or trebled in some cases. But the insurance does not protect from claims relating to Covid-19, leaving homes vulnerable to potentially high pay-outs - unlike within the NHS, where the government provides this indemnity, or protection. The risk, along with other challenges the sector has faced during the pandemic, could lead to more homes closing. Mary Wimbury, chief executive of Care Forum Wales, said those in the sector were ""very let down"" because they feel the care they have provided for vulnerable people was treated as less important than the music and live events industry. Last month, the UK government announced a Â£750m scheme which protects music festivals and live events if they have to cancel because of Covid-19. Ms Wimbury called on the Welsh government to introduce an indemnity scheme similar to that and the one which protects the NHS from claims. ""If a care home was to be sued, they might not be covered at all and potentially would have to close,"" she said. Bethan Mascarenhas feels older people have been ""forgotten"" ""The care sector has kept caring for really vulnerable people and it's had to do that under really difficult conditions and it does feel like a slap in the face that the UK government has given an indemnity to the music industry but not to the care sector."" Owners also said it makes them more risk averse when it comes to visitors. Bethan Mascarenhas, manager of The Old Vicarage in Llangollen, Denbighshire, said while they had not had any cases of Covid, it was still one of the biggest risks and legal action could lead to the home closing. ""This isn't us over-worrying - these are things that could potentially happen,"" she said. She said there was an injustice, adding older people were often ""forgotten and pushed to the bottom of the priority list"". ""Everybody else is able to get back to partying and having a great time but we're asking for insurance cover so they can see their loved ones and be connected again. There's a huge disparity,"" she said. Justin Otto-Jones, who helps run Parkside House in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, called the situation ""plainly unsatisfactory"". She added: ""It's frustrating as we have been raising this for more than a year with Welsh government. ""It is a major worry and adds to the perfect storm that care homes have been facing which includes staffing issues and fatigue."" Bill Bosson says contact with loved ones keeps him going Resident at the Old Vicarage Audrey Dunbebin said: ""To be able to feel in contact with your friends and family is very nice, it makes you feel very at home. ""It is very important, it connects you with your old life."" Fellow resident Bill Bosson added: ""It's important to keep the connection all the time because if you don't I think you'd go into a recluse in as much as I'd fall out of everything, whereas they [friends and family] keep me going."" The Welsh government said more than Â£185m had been given to the adult social care sector with more coming until the end of the financial year. A spokesman added: ""Our policy on care home visiting has evolved throughout the pandemic, informed by public health advice."" The Association of British Insurers recognised the market for care homes was challenging and said insurers were working with care homes on managing risks to increase the chances of getting cover. A spokesman said: ""Premise managers and local authorities should speak to their insurance adviser or broker to explore their options.""

"The first people in England and Wales receive their coronavirus booster jab - a central part of winter Covid preparation across the UK Maternity support worker Catherine Cargill, who works in Croydon, speaks of her joy at getting a third jab Millions of people, including health and care workers, the clinically vulnerable, and the over-50s, are eligible Scotland and Northern Ireland request military help amid surging ambulance and health service demand UK Covid deaths rise by 158 - with 26,911 new cases reported on Thursday Vaccines in England stopped 230,800 hospital admissions among the over-45s, new figures suggest France sees 3,000 health workers suspended for going without a jab Dozens of aides to Russian President Vladimir Putin test positive Edited by George Bowden That's all from us for today. Join us again tomorrow morning. Your writers today were Joshua Cheetham, Victoria Lindrea, Jen Meierhans and Sophie Williams. The editors were George Bowden and Robert Greenall. We're drawing our live coronavirus coverage to a close soon, but before we go, here are some of Thursday's biggest global Covid developments: Earlier you may have read our story about Virgin Australia's mandatory vaccine requirement for workers. They're not the only ones asking their staff to get the jab. In August, United Airlines - America's largest carrier - became the first in the US to mandate vaccines for employees. Today it revealed that 95% of management have been fully vaccinated ahead of its 27 September deadline, according to Reuters news agency. About 90% of employees have also uploaded proof of their shots. United has taken a tough stance on the issue. As an incentive, anyone uploading the vaccination card before 20 September will be eligible for an additional day of pay. Meanwhile those with religious exemptions from the jab will be placed on temporary, unpaid leave from 2 October. Following Monday's announcement about vaccinating schoolchildren, the BBC's James Gallagher takes an in-depth look at which children are now being offered the vaccine - and why the government has come to its decision, after months of discussion among the experts. Prof Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England, said it was a ""difficult decision"", but that ongoing disruption to school, caused by Covid, uld cause mental health problems and have long term effects on life chances. Evidence suggests a single dose cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant (if you come into contact with it) by about 55%. It also reduces the chances of you getting very sick or spreading it to someone else. So who will be vaccinated, how will it happen and will the choice be up to parents or children?Read on to find out more. This video can not be played Covid: Doctor combating jab myths labelled Dr Death A doctor who has been debunking myths about the Covid vaccine on TikTok says online trolls have dubbed her Dr Death and suggested she should have her medical licence removed. Dr Bnar Talabani, 32, is the only Welsh doctor on Team Halo, a UN-backed group of doctors and scientists using social media to dispel vaccine misinformation. She was born in northern Iraq and came to the UK as a refugee, aged 10. The co-founder of Muslim Doctors Cymru, Dr Talabani believes trainee medics should be given social media lessons as part of their studies. Singapore's health ministry has reported 910 new cases, its highest number since May 2020. More than 80% of the city-state's population has been vaccinated, but a recent rise in cases has forced the government to halt the further easing of lockdown restrictions. If you're just catching up with the day's developments - here are some of the today's top coronavirus news stories in the UK.  The European Union has said that it will provide â¬30bn ($35.3bn; Â£25.6bn) over the next six years towards a new agency dealing with health preparedness and rapid response. The Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority, or HERA, was officially launched on Thursday, and aims to tackle international crises like the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. âWe need to be better prepared for future health crises,â said EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton. ""HERA will establish new, adaptable production capacities and secure supply chains to help Europe react fast when needed."" The EU has been criticised for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. While health policy and outreach is still handled largely by individual members, vaccine rollout was slowed by initial shortages and longer waiting times for regulatory approvals. HERA is expected to be fully operational by early next year. As we reported earlier, reports suggest Transport Secretary Grant Shapps will announce revised rules for international travel tomorrow, for travellers in England. But while testing costs are expected to come down for fully vaccinated travellers, those who are not fully vaccinated may be asked to take two tests when arriving from a low-risk - or green - destination, and expected to quarantine at home - according to PA Media. It is anticipated that people arriving from red list countries will continue to be required to spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 per solo adult traveller. However, the red list is expected to be reduced with Pakistan and South Africa among the countries which may come off the high-risk list. The travel sector has been desperate for the testing and quarantine rules for international travel to be relaxed. Earlier this week, Heathrow Airport said it had gone from being Europe's busiest airport in 2019 to number 10 on the list, behind rival airports in cities such as Amsterdam, Paris and Frankfurt. The Visual and Data Journalism Team One ""ping"" - an alert asking someone to self-isolate - was issued by the NHS Covid app for every reported case in England in the week ending 8 September. Data shows 201,081 cases were reported in this period, with 199,296 contact tracing alerts  - or pings - sent out by the app. The number of pings issued for every reported case has been on a steady decline for the past two months, although it is still above levels seen in mid-May. A total of 211,947 pings were sent out across England and Wales last week, a 2% increase from the previous week. There have been another 158 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days, according to latest government figures. In addition a further 26,911 cases of coronavirus were recorded in the UK over the past 24 hours. Data shows 836 people were admitted to hospital with coronavirus, bringing the total number being treated for Covid in UK hospitals to 8,339 - 1,081 of them in intensive care New rules for international travel are expected to be announced on Friday for England, the PA Media news agency has said. The green and amber lists will be merged to form one category of low-risk countries, while the number of destinations on the red list will be reduced, reports PA Media. There is also speculation that fully vaccinated people arriving in the UK will no longer need to take a pre-departure lateral flow test prior to their flight, or a post-arrival PCR test. The changes, which could save individual travellers up to Â£100 each, would come into force ahead of the half-term break at the end of October.

officials say that more than 200 cases of Covid-19 have now been confirmed in
the southeastern province of Fujian. Since the
weekend, there has been outbreak of the virus in three cities: Xiamen, Putian
and Quanzhou. More than half of
these are in Putian, a city with a population of 2.9 million people. There have
been clusters of cases at kindergartens and primary schools. Local officials
today told a press conference that more than 40% of patients are under the age

Join us again tomorrow morning. Your writers today were Joshua Cheetham, Victoria Lindrea, Jen Meierhans and Sophie Williams. The editors were George Bowden and Robert Greenall. We're drawing our live coronavirus coverage to a close soon, but before we go, here are some of Thursday's biggest global Covid developments: Earlier you may have read our story about Virgin Australia's mandatory vaccine requirement for workers. They're not the only ones asking their staff to get the jab. In August, United Airlines - America's largest carrier - became the first in the US to mandate vaccines for employees. Today it revealed that 95% of management have been fully vaccinated ahead of its 27 September deadline, according to Reuters news agency. About 90% of employees have also uploaded proof of their shots. United has taken a tough stance on the issue. As an incentive, anyone uploading the vaccination card before 20 September will be eligible for an additional day of pay. Meanwhile those with religious exemptions from the jab will be placed on temporary, unpaid leave from 2 October. Following Monday's announcement about vaccinating schoolchildren, the BBC's James Gallagher takes an in-depth look at which children are now being offered the vaccine - and why the government has come to its decision, after months of discussion among the experts. Prof Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England, said it was a ""difficult decision"", but that ongoing disruption to school, caused by Covid, uld cause mental health problems and have long term effects on life chances. Evidence suggests a single dose cuts the risk of catching the Delta variant (if you come into contact with it) by about 55%. It also reduces the chances of you getting very sick or spreading it to someone else. So who will be vaccinated, how will it happen and will the choice be up to parents or children?Read on to find out more.

"The UK government should cut rising energy bills by getting rid of levies that subsidise renewable energy, the boss of E.On UK has said. Speaking to the Financial Times,external,Michael Lewis said green subsidies should be funded through tax instead. Regulators have warned that consumer energy bills will be hit by soaring prices of fossil fuels globally. Wholesale energy prices rose on Thursday after a key electricity cable between Britain and France shut down. Mr Lewis said: ""This is going to be a very challenging winter for customers and for suppliers and there is a real short-term imperative to do what we can to help consumers."" Green levies account for around a quarter of energy bills, he said. Mr Lewis recommended removing green levies and paying for subsidies through general taxation, ""so these costs are funded more progressively and we level the playing field on the cost of cleaner heating."" ""Then we can also start to apply something like a carbon tax on gas on a 'polluter pays' principle,"" he added. A government spokesperson said: ""Our energy price cap will protect millions of customers this winter from sudden increases in global gas prices. ""Millions of low-income households will also benefit from a Â£140 discount on their bills, with added support offered to pensioners and the most vulnerable over the colder months."" The fire at the National Grid site broke out just after midnight on Wednesday A jump in prices after a UK electricity interconnector was taken offline after a fire has been fuelling concerns about inflation and the potential impact on businesses just as the country's economy starts to recover from the worst effects of the coronavirus pandemic. National Grid said the fire and planned maintenance at a site near Ashford in Kent meant the cable will be totally offline until 25 September. Half of its capacity, or one gigawatt (GW) of power, is expected to remain unavailable until late March 2022. On Wednesday, British electricity prices for the following day jumped by 19% to Â£475 per megawatt hour (MWh). Theenergy regulator told the BBC that increasing prices, for gas in particular, ""will feed into all customer energy bills in the UK"". The price cap, which limits the price firms can charge customers who have not recently changed their energy tariff,will increase in Octoberin order to cover rising wholesale costs. The fire at the Interconnexion France-Angleterre (IFA) site broke out in the early hours of Wednesday. The site was evacuated and there were no reports of casualties. After the fire an electricity interconnector running under the English Channel was ""not operating"", the National Grid said in a statement. Electricity interconnectors,externalare high-voltage cables that connect the electricity systems of neighbouring countries, and allow them to share excess power. A spokesperson for National Grid's electricity system operator, which balances power supplies in the UK, said it expects to ""continue supplying electricity safely and securely"" despite the incident. The link can carry up to 2GW of power, and had been importing electricity from France in recent days, after UK prices hit a record high of Â£540 per MWh on the wholesale energy market. Analysts are now closely watching National Grid's efforts to get the facility fully back online as winter approaches and with it higher energy demand. Glenn Rickson, head of European power analysis at S&P Global Platts Analytics, told Reuters: ""The outage is going to lift the potential for price volatility as long as it's offline... and of course demand will get higher as we move further into winter."" UK Steel director general Gareth Stace pointed out that the ""extortionate"" electricity prices had already forced some steelmakers to suspend operations. ""Even with the global steel market as buoyant as it is, these eye-watering prices are making it impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day and night,"" he said. Other analysts have suggested that as a result, the UK may have to rely more heavily on gas-fired power stations in the coming months. Wholesale gas prices are already elevated for several reasons, such as low winds meaning less renewable energy is generated, outages at some nuclear stations and lower flows into the UK of the gas from Norway. On Wednesday, fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings said it was suspending operations at both its Billingham and Ince manufacturing complexes due to high gas costs. National Grid said its investigation into the fire at the IFA site was continuing and it would ""update the market with any changes as necessary"". Britain is a net importer of electricity and near neighbour France is its biggest supplier of power through the interconnectors that run under the English Channel. The IFA2 interconnector, a second link between Britain and France, is currently operating at its full capacity and not affected by the problem. The 1GW connection is a Â£700m shared investment with French power firm RTE and the UK's fourth power exchange with continental Europe.

"This video can not be played Watch: Four 'amateur astronauts' launched into orbit by SpaceX Four amateur astronauts have blasted off from Florida on their private mission to orbit. TheInspiration4,externalcrew, comprising one billionaire and three ""ordinary citizens"", rode out of the Kennedy Space Center in a Dragon capsule provided by the SpaceX rocket company. The quartet will spend the next three days circling the Earth. It's another milestone in the space tourism market, which is experiencing a resurgence after a decade's hiatus. Earlier this summer, billionaire businessmenSir Richard BransonandJeff Bezoswent above Earth's atmosphere in their own space vehicles. And following this latest mission, there'll be three privateer visits to the International Space Station (ISS) - one in October, carrying a Russian movie director and an actress, and two either side of the New Year. What is the SpaceX Crew Dragon? Cancer survivor joins historic space mission Billionaire Branson rockets to the edge of space Mr Isaacman (nearest) shouted ""Punch it, SpaceX!"" moments before launch The Inspiration4 crew of Jared Issacman, Hayley Arceneaux, Sian Proctor and Chris Sembroski have had six months of intensive training with SpaceX. However, onboard computer systems will be in control of their Dragon capsule, overseen by SpaceX teams on the ground. The Dragon is not going anywhere near the ISS. It's on a ""free flight"" to a target altitude of 575km (360 miles). That's about 150km above the orbiting laboratory, and roughly the height from where the Hubble Space Telescope views the cosmos. (L-R) Sembroski, Proctor, Isaacman and Arceneaux trained for six months Even if they don't have a destination as such, the foursome will have plenty to keep them occupied. They've taken up scientific experiments to be conducted inside their Dragon capsule, and SpaceX has modified their temporary home to include a big window, which the crew is sure to be using during downtime to wonder at the Earth below. The Inspiration4 venture was purchased from SpaceX by Mr Isaacman, 38, who made his fortune developing systems to process credit card payments. But rather than go on an ""outing with fishing buddies"", he decided, as he saw it, to inject real purpose into the flight. So, he gifted the three adjacent seats to people with inspirational stories. Fans of Haley Arceneaux turned out to watch the flight go up This is perhaps best illustrated in 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. She overcame bone cancer as a child and as an adult has gone back to work for the medical facility that cured her - theSt Jude Children's Research Hospital,externalin Memphis, Tennessee. Mr Isaacman wants to raise $200m for St Jude's work. Haley Arceneaux was treated for cancer at St Jude as a 10 year-old Dr Sian Proctor, 51, is a geoscientist and science communicator. She actually came close to being a Nasa astronaut in 2009 but missed out in the final round of selection. Dr Proctor won her seat through her role as an artist and by demonstrating her entrepreneurial skills. She plans to paint while looking out the Dragon's domed window. Chris Sembroski, 42, is a US Air Force veteran and works as an engineer with aerospace company Lockheed Martin. He'd made a donation to St Jude that also entered him into a lottery draw for the fourth position in the crew. Mr Sembroski didn't win the lottery - but a friend did, and asked him to take the place. The Dragon capsule and its Falcon rocket head out over the Atlantic Ocean SpaceX and Inspiration4 have described Wednesday's launch as the first ""all-civilian mission to orbit"". That depends very much on your definition of ""civilian"". The first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong, was technically a civilian, having resigned his Navy commission in 1960, nine years before Apollo 11. The big window during development at SpaceX Artwork: The glass dome should provide stunning views But there's no doubting the Dragon flight commanded by Mr Isaacman has significance. Space activity - even human spaceflight - is becoming ever more commercial, and the idea that people can go to orbit outside of the purview of the major national space agencies will increasingly look normal. The 2000s saw several super-wealthy individuals spend a fortnight on the ISS. That particular era of space tourism ended in 2009 when spare seats on Russian rockets were bought up for the exclusive use of Nasa astronauts. But this second era looks as though it will be more resilient, simply because there are many more private space companies chasing the business, and this should bring down prices for a wider pool of customers. Elon Musk's vision is for humans to be living on Mars Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is intent on making humans ""a multi-planet species"". And Mr Isaacman regards Inspiration4 as a signpost of where things are going. He was very keen that his Dragon go higher than astronauts usually go. And not since the final shuttle servicing mission of Hubble in 2009 have people been to an altitude above 570km. ""We've been going to the space station (420km) for some time, and there's just unbelievable science and research and great contributions that are coming out of there. But if we're going to go to the Moon again, and we're going to go to Mars and beyond, we've got to get a little outside of our comfort zone and take that next step in that direction,"" he said before launch. ""So that was really the rationale (for our choice of altitude)."" Some commentators have voiced concern about the collective impact on the Earth's climate of spaceflights like this one. SpaceX's Falcon-9 rocket uses highly refined kerosene fuel which produces the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (COâ), along with nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to warming. Emissions from rocket launches remain tiny compared with the aviation industry, though they are projected to grow.

"Father-of-two Brian Phelan died after being stabbed on a rural road near Newry in 2018 A 30-year-old man has been found guilty of the murder of Brian Phelan on the outskirts of Newry in July 2018. Mr Phelan was stabbed three times in the neck and twice in the body during an attack on a remote Carrivekeeney Road, near to the village of Camlough. He had gone there with Daniel Martin James Carroll, of Edward Street in Portadown, but originally from Newry. Carroll was found guilty of Mr Phelan's murder at Newry Crown Court on Wednesday. During a two-week trial, the court heard that on the day of his death Mr Phelan had met Carroll in Bessbrook before travelling to the road with the intention of buying quad bikes. The road, which runs up the side of Camlough mountain, effectively comes to a dead end for vehicles, however a path does lead across the mountain. It was the defence's case that three men with paramilitary links had appeared from a nearby field, attacked Mr Phelan, threatened him and then made off in the direction of the mountain. Although he said he knew them, Carroll would not name the men stating that his life and that of his family was at risk. The defence said that the mountain path could have been accessed by small vehicles such as quadbikes. However, the prosecution said this version of events, which Carroll put forward 15 months after Brian Phelan's death, was complete nonsense. It said the defendant had attacked the victim and then fled the scene, changing his T-shirt before being arrested nearly two hours later at a family member's home in Newry. Although no definite motive was identified, the jury had been told of Carroll's previous record, which included unprovoked violence. Giving evidence, a police officer had also suggested there could have been a financial disagreement between the two men. A jury of six men and five women took less than 90 minutes to reach a unanimous guilty verdict. Social distancing meant that only a small number of Brian Phelan's friends and family were permitted inside the courtroom. There were emotional scenes from those in the public gallery with a loud cheer from the adjoining foyer. Before being sent down, the judge told Carroll that he would be sentenced to life imprisonment. A tariff hearing to determine the minimum amount of time he will spend in prison before being considered for parole will be set in November.

"This video can not be played Queen's University says its rooms are oversubscribed. Queen's University Belfast (QUB) has said it is ""unlikely"" to offer a room to any student living less than 40 miles from the university. They have told students living within that radius to make ""alternative travel and accommodation arrangements"". But students living more than 40 miles away have also been told they may not get a room until mid-October. It was laid out in an email sent to some students who had applied for rooms in halls of residence. QUB had previously offered studentsa Â£1,500 deal to withdraw from its accommodation. It said due to ""unprecedented"" demand, accommodation in its halls was oversubscribed. About 3,500 students each year live in halls of residence run by the university. Queen's previously offered students Â£1,500 to pull out of their accommodation offer On Wednesday night, some students who had applied for QUB's rooms for the 2021/22 academic year received a further update by email. The university apologised ""for the upset caused by the uncertainty of the past few weeks"" and said it was doing all it could ""to find solutions"". Queen's said the financial package to withdraw from accommodation had been accepted by ""several hundred students"" and they were still working to secure additional rooms, including at Ulster University's Jordanstown campus. ""In prior years, the 3,400 rooms provided by the university has been enough to meet all our requirements,"" QUB said. ""This year, despite securing an additional 770 rooms, we are still unable to meet demand which hopefully gives you some idea of the size of the challenge we have faced. ""We continue to work tirelessly to secure other options but it may be mid to late October before some of these become available. ""We will be allocating all available accommodation by distance lived from Queen's. ""Presently, it is unlikely we will be able to offer a room to anyone who lives within a 40 mile radius of the university."" This video can not be played QUB offers students Â£1,500 deal not to take up halls of residence However, students living more than 40 miles from QUB were not guaranteed a room for the start of term. ""We strongly advise students who have not yet received an accommodation offer and who live outside the 40-mile radius, to make travel arrangements for the first three to four weeks of term as it is unlikely you will be able to move into your accommodation before mid-October,"" the university email said. Students offered Â£1,500 not to take Queen's rooms Anger over Queen's withdrawal of halls offer One QUB student from Londonderry who contacted BBC News NI said the move would mean they would have to take a bus to Belfast and back every day until then. The university said it would start to make room offers by email from Monday 20 September. However, if students did not accept within 24 hours their room would be offered to another student. QUB also said, however, they were ""working with a range of local hotels"" to enable students to book rooms ""for one or two nights per week"" if necessary.

"The Five Eyes group has successfully shared intelligence between Western powers for decades The Five Eyes alliance is an intelligence-sharing arrangement between five English-speaking democracies: the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It evolved during the Cold War as a mechanism for monitoring the Soviet Union and sharing classified intelligence. It is often described as the world's most successful intelligence alliance. But recently it has suffered an embarrassing setback. Four of the members have jointly condemnedChina's treatment of its Uyghur population in Xinjiang province. They have also expressed concern over China's de facto military takeover of the South China Sea, its suppression of democracy in Hong Kong andits threatening moves towards Taiwan, which China has vowed to ""take back"" by 2049. One country, though, has opted out of confronting China: New Zealand. Surprisingly, perhaps, for a nation that prides itself on respect for human rights, New Zealand's Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta declined to join in this Western condemnation of Beijing, saying ""it felt uncomfortable"" with expanding the alliance's role by putting pressure on China in this way. Although New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern admitted on Monday that its differences with China are becoming ""harder to reconcile"", the country still prefers to pursue its own bilateral relations with Beijing. Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta declined to join in Western condemnation of Beijing China's state media has made much of this, talking of a wedge been driven between the two neighbours and allies, Australia and New Zealand. China is New Zealand's largest export market; New Zealand depends on China for close to 30% of its exports, mostly dairy products. So does Australia, but the two Antipodean neighbours clearly view China's policies in a very different light. Australia's federal government in Canberra has vetoed a major Chinese investment in the state of Victoria which was to be part of Beijing's ""Belt and Road"" initiative, its growing acquisition of economic assets around the world. Meanwhile, China has imposed a series of damaging trade sanctions on Australia over the past year. As the trade war between the two countries worsens, Australia's wine exports to China have reportedly dropped by 96% from the first quarter of 2020 compared to the first quarter of this year, from A$325m (Â£181m) to just A$12m (Â£6.6m). New Zealand, on the other hand, has been rewarded by Beijing with ever-closer trade relations. New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern has taken a different China stance to Australia's Scott Morrison So what exactly has all this got to do with intelligence-sharing? Very little, is the answer. It was assumed last year by officials in the Five Eyes alliance that since all five nations broadly shared the same world view, then that view would also apply to China. In May 2020 the alliance agreed to expand its role away from just security and intelligence to a more public stance on respect for human rights and democracy. In November the alliance criticised the Chinese government for stifling democracy in Hong Kong whenBeijing introduced new laws that disqualified elected legislatorsin the former British colony. A Chinese government spokesman reacted angrily, mocking the Five Eyes alliance by declaring that ""those who dared to harm China's sovereignty would find their own eyes poked out"". 'Five Eyes could be blinded' over HK, warns China Could Huawei threaten the Five Eyes? How coronavirus will change national security Now, six months later, New Zealand's departure from the party line on China has meant that the Five Eyes' newly expanded role appears to have ground to a halt, prompting some to question whether the alliance is in trouble. But that would be an exaggeration. This was about politics, not intelligence. New Zealand is not leaving the alliance, it is only drawing a distinction between the two. In retrospect it was an overstretch of what Five Eyes was meant for: sharing secrets. There will almost certainly be some in New Zealand's intelligence community who feel embarrassment at this playing out so publicly. By farthe majority of intelligence shared within the alliance comes from Washington. The next biggest contributor is the UK, with input from GCHQ, MI6 and MI5. Considerably smaller contributions are made by Canada and Australia. When it comes to New Zealand, an intelligence review conducted in 2017 found that for every 99 pieces of intelligence NZ received through the alliance, it contributed just one. So New Zealand would clearly have much to lose if it left. In conclusion, then, is the alliance going to transcend into a unified diplomatic or political pressure group? Unlikely at this stage. Is its existence as an alliance for intelligence-sharing between allies in trouble? No. Who are the Uyghurs?

"Britain is about to embark on a world tour - in the shape of the Royal Navy's aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by a fleet of warships. The Royal Navy says it will be the most powerful UK naval deployment in a generation. The government sees the fleet, named the Carrier Strike Group, as a potent symbol of ""Global Britain"" - and as proof of Boris Johnson's promise to restore the Royal Navy as Europe's foremost naval power and end what he called an ""era of retreat"". The prime minister spent this morning on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in Portsmouth naval base, ahead of its maiden operational deployment. But is this world tour more than a symbol of national virility or a flag-waving exercise? And what's the point of sailing halfway across the world? Over the next 28 weeks the Carrier Strike Group will cover 26,000 miles - further than the distance around the world at the equator. F-35B Lightning aircraft returning to HMS Queen Elizabeth during a training exercise HMS Queen Elizabeth will first sail into the Mediterranean. From there, she is planning to launch her F-35 jets to conduct airstrikes over Iraq against the group known as Islamic State. It would be the carrier's first combat operation - even though the RAF has been doing the same mission for the past seven years from its land base on Cyprus. Perhaps more controversial is the decision to then go east. The strike group will sail through the Suez Canal, out to the Indian Ocean and on to the Philippine Sea. HMS Queen Elizabeth is scheduled to make a number of port stops along way - including Oman, Singapore, South Korea and Japan. Like the US, Britain is responding to the rise of China. But unlike America, Britain has less influence and fewer resources to match. For UK foreign policy it means a more modest ""tilt"" to Asia rather than the US ""pivot"". HMS Queen Elizabeth will be accompanied by two Royal Navy Frigates, two Destroyers, two supply ships and -  beneath the surface - an Astute Class Submarine. An American Navy Destroyer and a Dutch Frigate will be part of the strike group. There'll also be more American jets on board the carrier: 10 US Marine Corps F-35s compared to the Britain's eight. The government insists the addition of allies is a sign of strength rather than weakness. But it is also an indication that Britain's Armed Forces are now smaller and can do less on their own. This video can not be played Watch: What's it like on board HMS Queen Elizabeth? The strike group will sail through the South China Sea where China has been expanding its claim to territorial waters. But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace insists Britain is not looking for a ""confrontation"". Instead, he says the carrier group will exercise its right to freedom of navigation. So do not expect a repeat of what happened in 2018 when another Royal Navy Warship, HMS Albion, deliberately sailed close to the disputed Paracel Islands,prompting an angry response from Beijing. The prime minister visited HMS Queen Elizabeth in Portsmouth earlier These sensitivities highlight ambiguities in Britain's policy towards China. The British government says it still wants a constructive relationship - not least on trade. Two former defence chiefs have questioned the decision to send the strike group east. Lord Nicholas Houghton recently told MPs that ""it was not necessarily the best way of seeking an accommodation"" with Beijing, while Lord David Richards said Britain should be focusing its attention closer to home ""on Nato and the Euro-Atlantic area"". But the deployment has as much to do with boosting trade and strengthening diplomatic ties in the region. At sea it'll be conducting military exercises with allies, including Japan, Australia and the US. During her port visits, HMS Queen Elizabeth will become a giant floating trade and diplomatic mission. In the words of the head of the Royal Navy, Admiral Tony Radakin: ""Navies follow trade and trade follows navies."" He says this deployment shows the Navy is ""flying the flag for Britain and carrying forward the prime minister's vision"" of a ""Global Britain"". Some argue there might have been better ways of sending a strong message to China. Dr Peter Roberts, director of military sciences at RUSI, a defence and security think tank, says that instead of what he calls ""a predictable, long and slow deployment"", the Royal Navy could have dispatched two of its hunter-killer submarines. If they set off north, under the Arctic ice, and then popped up in the Pacific, he suggests, that would have had a greater impact on challenging both Russian and Chinese behaviour. The former national security adviser, Lord Peter Ricketts, believes it still makes sense to send the carrier east as a ""symbol of working closely with allies"". This is not least to get a return on the significant investment in the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers. But, he adds, ""this is a piece of diplomatic theatre, not a military strategy"".

"The event started in London on Tuesday A controversial arms fair is being attended by the Welsh government again this year. It follows a review into whether the administrationshould continue goingto the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) event. A ""small number of officials"" are attending the London event, the Welsh government said. Plaid Cymru criticised the Welsh Labour government for spending public money on ""this contemptible event"". But the Welsh Conservatives said it was right for officials to go. Aerospace Wales, a trade association, is receiving financial support from the Welsh government to attend the event, which started in London on Tuesday. DSEI is held every two years and is supported by the UK government's Ministry of Defence. The Conservative UK government has invited62 countries,externalto DSEI, including countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Colombia, which were on the government's2019 human rights watch list,external. Welsh Government role at arms fair to be reviewed Banksy donates funds from drone artwork Firms ejected from London arms fair The Welsh government has had a presence at the show over the last 10 years, including a stand in 2019. Ministers attended in 2015 and 2017. Rather than have its own stand at this year's four day event, the government has paid for Aerospace Forum Wales to ""lead Wales' presence"". The forum describes itself as the ""trade association for all companies operating in the aerospace, defence and space sectors in Wales"" and will have its own stand. The Welsh government said a ""small number"" of officials have also been sent to support companies ""with a presence in Wales such as Airbus, Thales, General Dynamics, Jacobs and Qinetiq"". The spokesman added: ""These companies are a major part of Wales aerospace, cyber security and defence sectors which has a collective value of at least Â£4bn and employs more than 18,000 people in Wales. ""Welsh government officials will also be engaging with companies looking to invest in Wales and will be meeting a number of SMEs regarding investment, innovation and job creation opportunities."" The event is a showcase for the UK's arms industry John Walley, chief executive of Aerospace Wales, said: ""We believe it's important for the UK and Wales from a national security point of view, I don't think it's for us to abrogate responsibility for defending the country."" A UK government spokeswoman said: ""Defence and security exports support 250,000 jobs across the UK and contribute over Â£1.8 billion to the economy. ""We always undertake strict checks before inviting foreign governments to export summits, including DSEI 2021."" Six companies were supported to join the Welsh government at the 2019 event. Speaking at the time, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would review his government's presence at future events, but said officials were present ""to support important Welsh companies that operate, not directly in the arms area, but in other issues, such as cyber security"". The Welsh government has since confirmed that Radnor Range, a weapons and explosives testing range, was one of the companies on its stand. In a Freedom of Information response to theDeclassified UK website,external, the Welsh government said it spent Â£85,350 on the DSEI 2019 event itself and Â£9,851.28 on expenses for 12 officials. A Welsh Conservative spokesman said: ""This vitally important sector is worth more than Â£19 billion to the UK economy and Wales gets to reap the benefits from the jobs that the sector provides."" ""It's right the Welsh government are in attendance to support Welsh businesses at the event, and we hope that any future cooperation agreements with Plaid Cymru does not mean leaving Welsh business in the sector high and dry."" Plaid Cymru's spokesperson on international affairs, Heledd Fychan, said: ""Plaid Cymru condemns any action that supports the development and sale of weapons of mass destruction.

"The woman sued surgeon Sam Eljamel (pictured) and NHS Tayside A woman left with ""life-changing injuries"" after botched surgery will receive Â£2.8m in damages. Carolyn Almond-Roots was a patient of Sam Eljamel, a former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside, in 2013. A BBC Scotland investigation in 2018 revealed that dozens of people claimed to have been harmed by Mr Eljamel. Some of his former patients are suing NHS Tayside, claiming Mr Eljamel has harmed them. Several have already secured compensation. Surgeon who harmed Scots is now working in Libya The top surgeon who harmed patients for years Jonathan Howat, of Thompsons Solicitors who handled Ms Almond-Roots' case, said her treatment was ""appalling"". ""The disgraceful conduct of Eljamel has left my client with very serious and life-changing injuries that affect every aspect of her daily life,"" he said. ""The level of compensation Ms Almond-Roots has received highlights the seriousness of what has been inflicted upon her."" He said the damages took into account ""the fact that my client will need to pay for additional care for the rest of her life"". ""The injuries caused by this rogue surgeon are appalling and we are glad that his negligent practices have been brought to light,"" Mr Howat added. Sam Eljamel was the head of the neurosurgery department in Ninewells Hospital in Dundee Mr Eljamel was head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside, and also worked at Fernbrae private hospital in Dundee as well as being an adviser to the Scottish government. He began treating Ms Almond-Roots in 2013 after she experienced a pain in her thighs that was radiating upwards. She saw Mr Eljamel at both Ninewells NHS hospital in Dundee and the private Fernbrae hospital. Thompsons Solicitors said Ms Almond-Roots reached a settlement of Â£2,810,118 at the Court of Session. It has not yet been determined what share of the damages will be paid by the private hospital and NHS Tayside, as Ms Almond-Roots was treated by Mr Eljamel at both. He was suspended from his post at NHS Tayside following internal and external reviews in 2013. He was placed under interim conditions by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) in 2014 and then removed himself from the General Medical Council (GMC) register, which means he can no longer practice in the UK. BBC Scotland's Disclosure found in 2018that Mr Eljamel had harmed patients for years at NHS Tayside. He was allowed to continue operating even after an external investigation found he was injuring patients. Last year, the BBC found he wasworking as a surgeon in Libya. NHS Tayside said it could not comment because it was an ongoing case.

"This video can not be played ""Legal action could end up closing us down."" Care home owners have said they are struggling to find insurance against Covid-19 claims, which could lead to closures. They want the Welsh government to provide an indemnity similar to the one which protects the NHS. And they have also called the UK government's backing of insurance indemnity for live events a ""slap in the face"" for the care sector. The Welsh government said it is a UK-wide issue. It added it was working with other governments to find a solution. Diary reveals lockdown isolation at care home Care home owner trying to keep 'head above water' Public liability insurance is a legal requirement for care home registration but owners have reported the cost has doubled or trebled in some cases. But the insurance does not protect from claims relating to Covid-19, leaving homes vulnerable to potentially high pay-outs - unlike within the NHS, where the government provides this indemnity, or protection. The risk, along with other challenges the sector has faced during the pandemic, could lead to more homes closing. Mary Wimbury, chief executive of Care Forum Wales, said those in the sector were ""very let down"" because they feel the care they have provided for vulnerable people was treated as less important than the music and live events industry. Last month, the UK government announced a Â£750m scheme which protects music festivals and live events if they have to cancel because of Covid-19. Ms Wimbury called on the Welsh government to introduce an indemnity scheme similar to that and the one which protects the NHS from claims. ""If a care home was to be sued, they might not be covered at all and potentially would have to close,"" she said. Bethan Mascarenhas feels older people have been ""forgotten"" ""The care sector has kept caring for really vulnerable people and it's had to do that under really difficult conditions and it does feel like a slap in the face that the UK government has given an indemnity to the music industry but not to the care sector."" Owners also said it makes them more risk averse when it comes to visitors. Bethan Mascarenhas, manager of The Old Vicarage in Llangollen, Denbighshire, said while they had not had any cases of Covid, it was still one of the biggest risks and legal action could lead to the home closing. ""This isn't us over-worrying - these are things that could potentially happen,"" she said. She said there was an injustice, adding older people were often ""forgotten and pushed to the bottom of the priority list"". ""Everybody else is able to get back to partying and having a great time but we're asking for insurance cover so they can see their loved ones and be connected again. There's a huge disparity,"" she said. Justin Otto-Jones, who helps run Parkside House in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, called the situation ""plainly unsatisfactory"". She added: ""It's frustrating as we have been raising this for more than a year with Welsh government. ""It is a major worry and adds to the perfect storm that care homes have been facing which includes staffing issues and fatigue."" Bill Bosson says contact with loved ones keeps him going Resident at the Old Vicarage Audrey Dunbebin said: ""To be able to feel in contact with your friends and family is very nice, it makes you feel very at home. ""It is very important, it connects you with your old life."" Fellow resident Bill Bosson added: ""It's important to keep the connection all the time because if you don't I think you'd go into a recluse in as much as I'd fall out of everything, whereas they [friends and family] keep me going."" The Welsh government said more than Â£185m had been given to the adult social care sector with more coming until the end of the financial year. A spokesman added: ""Our policy on care home visiting has evolved throughout the pandemic, informed by public health advice."" The Association of British Insurers recognised the market for care homes was challenging and said insurers were working with care homes on managing risks to increase the chances of getting cover. A spokesman said: ""Premise managers and local authorities should speak to their insurance adviser or broker to explore their options.""

"Microsoft has announced users can now delete all passwords from their accounts and instead login using an authenticator app or other solution. The technology giant made passwordless accounts available for business users of its products in March. And that system is now being made available to all Microsoft or Windows users. It said ""nearly 100% of our employees"" were already using the new, more secure system for their corporate accounts. If passwordless login is enabled, users re-logging in to a Microsoft account will be asked to give their fingerprint, or other secure unlock, on their mobile phone. Why passwords don't work, and what will replace them Pets' names 'used as passwords by millions' Gadget-makers face ban on easy-to-guess passwords And this is far more secure than using passwords, which can be guessed or stolen, according to Microsoft. ""Only you can provide fingerprint authentication or provide the right response on your mobile at the right time,"" it said. Windows users will still be able to use quick-login features such as a Pin code, though. Some rare exceptions will still need passwords, such as Office 2010, Xbox 360 consoles, and Windows 8.1 or earlier machines. And if access to the authenticator app is lost - for example, if the phone it is installed on is lost or stolen or a user forgets when upgrading - backup options can be used, including: Windows Hello facial recognition, which requires a compatible laptop or special camera a physical security key, which must be used on the device logging in Short Message Service (SMS) or email codes But SMS and email are two of the most common channels for cyber-criminals targeting specific individuals And Microsoft says security-conscious users who have two-factor authentication set up will need to have access to two different recovery methods. Microsoft's messaging tells customers no passwords are more secure Prof Alan Woodward, part of a research team investigating passwordless authentication, at the University of Surrey, called it ""quite a bold step from Microsoft"". ""This isn't just logging into PCs, it's logging into online services as well"" - including important ones such as cloud storage, he said. Microsoft laid out its reasons for the new system,externalin a series of blog posts. Security vice-president Vasu Jakkal wrote: ""Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives. ""We are expected to create complex and unique passwords, remember them, and change them frequently - but nobody likes doing that."" The separate authenticator app - not pictured in this stock photo - is claimed to be more secure than a password Instead, people tended to create insecure passwords that technically cleared the bar for using symbols, numbers or case sensitivity - but in order to remember them, used a repeated formula or the same password on multiple websites. And that led to hackers guessing them or revealing them in a data breach and reusing them. ""Hackers don't break in, they log in,"" the blog post read. The new passwordless feature greets users with a box saying: ""A passwordless account reduces the risk of phishing and password attacks."" And once the feature is set up, a confirmation tells users: ""You have increased the security of your account and improved your sign-in experience by removing your password"". Microsoft's claims about poor password use were largely true, Prof Woodward said. ""The message has been pummelled home about what good password hygiene looks like - but it's easier said than done,"" he said. Passwords were a decades-old concept ""and maybe the time is now right to start looking for something different"". But there were no currently agreed standards. ""There are a number of different ways this could be done - and it would be good if everybody moved on, really, and tried to find a way of doing this,"" Prof Woodward said.

"A PM is rarely as powerful as on a reshuffle day ""This is a mad way to run the country,"" confessed a member of the government. Whether prime ministers wield sharp knives or attack with blunt spoons, reshuffle days like this are indeed a strange mixture of bravado and farce. Bravado when, earlier, one cabinet minister told me, ""I think I'm OK,"" as, ashen-faced, looking nauseous and clammy, they were en route to see the prime minister before promptly being sacked. And farce when, as legend has it, on several occasions, would-be ministers end up jobless, because the post-it notes with their name on fell off the board. Forgotten, their career plunged to the floor too. The way the most senior government politicians are recruited and removed is bizarre and brutal. For weeks ministers have nervously inquired of journalists: ""Is it on?"" And inhabitants of the Westminster village who claim real knowledge of the plan are rarely those who truly know. But, whatever the curious British traditions of how it's done, it is what is done that makes the difference. Prime ministers rarely wield as much power as on the day of the big hirings and firings. Johnson rings changes with major cabinet reshuffle Who is in Boris Johnson's new cabinet? And Boris Johnson has used this occasion to make big changes to the cabinet. The most significant switch came in one of the chunkiest jobs of all. Removing the foreign secretary is a big deal. Dominic Raab's always happy to let it be known that he holds a black belt in karate. And his conversation with the prime minister this reshuffle day took longer than expected, suggesting he fought his move pretty hard. Sources suggest he managed to wangle the ill-defined title of deputy prime minister out of Mr Johnson. Being justice secretary, running prisons, courts, and the legal system, is of course a huge job. Downing Street insists it's not a demotion, and that it doesn't want this move to be seen as punishment after what looked, to many people, like a debacle in Afghanistan. But even with the DPM bauble, Mr Raab, the now former foreign secretary, is a less senior figure in the government. There are some other slightly puzzling aspects. Steve Barclay was, until the reshuffle, chief secretary to the Treasury, wielding the calculator on what is a hugely important Spending Review, when cash for departments for the next few years is fixed. That review is coming in just a few weeks' time, so you might wonder at the wisdom of moving Mr Barclay right now. He's being replaced by Simon Clarke, a previous inhabitant of a Treasury role, a strong supporter of Mr Johnson and North East MP. He's also, at 6ft 7ins, around a foot taller than his new boss in Number 11 - cue the inevitable jokes about Number 10 wanting to make the chancellor feel small. Anne-Marie Trevelyan is back on the top team In a similar vein Anne-Marie Trevelyan, also a strong Johnson backer, returns to cabinet as trade secretary. Irrespective of the merit of her move to that department, Ms Trevelyan had been part of the government's team preparing for COP26, a major international event that starts in about 50 days. If it's a true priority, unpicking a part of the team right now may raise a few eyebrows. There are many more jobs to be allocated, more intrigue to come when middle-ranking and junior ministers get their P45s or offers. But the shape of the cabinet itself is clear. What's harder to divine is any one strong political ideology, or any radical guiding idea. Certainly, politicians popular with the Tory party like Truss seem to have prospered. Loyalty to the prime minister himself seems to have been rewarded. But it's not a Brexit cabinet, or a small-state cabinet, or to use Tory verbiage, a ""one-nation"" cabinet for those more in the middle. It's a Johnson cabinet, with no particular bent towards any one faction or tribe. For some of his backers, that is one of Mr Johnson's attributes - he's not wedded to principle, but staying on top. For other Tories, that's rather the problem - with no one strong ideology other than a desire to win, it begs the question of what it's all really for. For Downing Street, though, this is a day for the doers. After the early traumas of Brexit, then the emergency and horror of the pandemic, the moves represent, they hope, a refreshed team that can get things done. Whether it's building houses without upsetting the Tory shires, sorting out school exams, pushing through tougher prison sentences, with new faces it's a government that Downing Street hopes will be more able to push reform forward, and make its case. Nearly two years after the election, it's perhaps the start of Mr Johnson's third act as prime minister. And while the shuffling of his cabinet pack has passed, so far largely without incident, there is no doubt about the scale of the challenge, individual and collective, that they face.

"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

"Boris Johnson has appointed several new ministers to his cabinet, to replace those whose resignations this week ultimately prompted him to announce he would step down as prime minister. A fuller reshuffle is likely once Mr Johnson's successor is in place, but in the interim period Nadhim Zahawi has been promoted to chancellor, after Rishi Sunak quit, and Stephen Barclay has replaced Sajid Javid as health secretary. James Cleverly and Greg Clark also return to the cabinet, replacing Mr Zahawi as education secretary and the sacked Michael Gove as levelling up, housing and communities secretary respectively. Who else is in the current cabinet? Here is a guide to the people in Mr Johnson's cabinet, with the latest new faces, as well as those who have changed roles. Boris Johnson became prime minister in December 2019 and immediately faced the UK's looming exit from the EU and the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The health crisis has been described as perhaps the biggest challenge the country has faced since World War Two. Mr Johnsonâs election win secured him the largest Tory majority in Parliament since 1987. He succeeded Theresa May as prime minister. His only previous cabinet post was foreign secretary, which he quit over differences with Mrs May over Brexit. Since being at 10 Downing Street, he married his fiancee Carrie Symonds and the couple have had two children. Nadhim Zahawi has been appointed chancellor following the resignation of Rishi Sunak. A former child refugee who fled Iraq with his parents in the 1970s, Mr Zahawi co-founded the market research firm YouGov and is now believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons. A strong media performer, the minister has been relied upon regularly to defend the prime minister on broadcast media rounds. Mr Zahawi was promoted to the cabinet in September 2021 after overseeing the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine programme and served as education secretary for eight months. He was elected as Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon in May 2010 and has also served as a business minister. Priti Patel was appointed home secretary in Boris Johnsonâs first cabinet and has kept her position since then. A prominent Brexiteer, Ms Patel had previously argued that Mr Johnson was the only person who could save Brexit and the Tories. She had previously served as Theresa May's international development secretary, until she was forced to quit following a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians. She was first elected to the seat of Witham, Essex, in 2010, after working for several years in PR for the Conservative Party, as well as lobbying for tobacco and alcohol industries. Liz Truss replaced Dominic Raab as foreign secretary in September 2021. Her first role in Boris Johnson's cabinet was as international trade secretary. She was previously in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as the first female lord chancellor between 2016 and 2017. She served as environment secretary in David Cameron's government from 2014-16. Ms Truss was elected to Parliament in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. In a widely-publicised speech in June 2018, she attacked cabinet colleagues for demanding more money, saying it would only lead to higher taxation. Kit Malthouse replaces Stephen Barclay as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was previously a minister jointly at the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice and attended cabinet. He came to the fore in the Brexit debate, when his name was put to a so-called compromise plan to replace Theresa May's proposed Northern Ireland backstop with ""alternative arrangements"". He was a deputy mayor of London from 2008, serving under Boris Johnson, and became MP for North West Hampshire in 2015. A chartered accountant who has run a number of small businesses, he lays claim to signing trade deals around the world in more than two decades of frontline politics. Ben Wallace has been defence secretary since July 2019. Mr Wallace trained at Sandhurst before joining the Scots Guards as a platoon commander. During his eight-year spell in the Army, he served in Northern Ireland, Germany, Cyprus and Central America. He was a member of the Scottish Parliament, before winning his seat of Lancaster and Wyre in 2005. The MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed replaced Liz Truss as international trade secretary in September 2021. She returned after losing her place in the cabinet when the Department for International Development was scrapped. Ms Trevelyan was promoted to a role as Armed Forces minister shortly after the Conservativesâ 2019 election victory. An outspoken Brexiteer, she resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in November 2018 in protest at the Brexit withdrawal deal negotiated by former PM Theresa May. The former chartered accountant has also served on the Public Accounts Committee, responsible for scrutinising government spending. Stephen Barclay has become health secretary after Sajid Javid quit the role. He had been Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and minister for the Cabinet Office since September 2021. In February, Boris Johnson also appointed him as the new chief of staff at No 10. He had previously served as chief secretary to the Treasury and Brexit secretary. The former insurance company solicitor was elected MP for North East Cambridgeshire in 2010. James Cleverly has taken over as education secretary after Nadhim Zahawi was made chancellor and his replacement, Michelle Donelan, quit hours later. The former soldier, who rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Royal Artillery, is one of the partyâs most effective media performers. Theresa May made him party chairman and Boris Johnson initially promoted him to the cabinet as minister without portfolio before demoting him in his February 2020 reshuffle. Despite supporting Mrs Mayâs Withdrawal Agreement, he is popular with Brexiteers and served in the London Assembly while Mr Johnson was mayor. The father-of-two has been MP for Braintree in Essex since 2015. Jacob Rees-Mogg takes on a newly created role in cabinet having previously been an attending member as the Leader of the House of Commons. He is one of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers and a key member of party's European Research Group (ERG). He was a constant critic of former Prime Minister Theresa May over Brexit. Before being elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010, Mr Rees-Mogg worked in finance, originally based in Hong Kong and later moving back to London. He set up his own investment management company in 2007. Mr Rees-Mogg, a Catholic, is married with six children. He is against abortion and gay marriage, but it was his position on Brexit, as well as his old-fashioned dress and courteous manner, which have brought him mainstream attention. Nadine Dorries remains culture secretary, having replaced Oliver Dowden in the role in September 2021. She was previously a minister for health and social care. Ms Dorries was elected as the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire in May 2005. In November 2012, she was temporarily suspended from the Conservative party after taking part in reality TV programme I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. Before she entered politics Ms Dorries trained as a nurse, then went on to set up her own business and later became a director at BUPA. Kwasi Kwarteng remains as business secretary. The MP for Spelthorne in Surrey, seen as a rising star on the right of the party for many years, had been energy minister since July 2019. He was previously a junior Brexit minister. Before becoming an MP in 2010, he worked as an analyst in financial services. Greg Clark was named as levelling up, housing and communities secretary after Michael Gove was sacked by Boris Johnson. He is responsible for ""levelling up"" - the programme to help communities who feel they have been left behind. Mr Clark was local government and communities secretary â covering much of the same brief as his latest role â for a year under David Cameron, and had been a minister in several other departments during the coalition. He also served in Theresa Mayâs cabinet as business secretary and, more recently, chaired the Commons Science and Technology Select Committee. A former business consultant and BBC executive, Mr Clark has been MP for Royal Tunbridge Wells since 2005. Therese Coffey remains as work and pensions secretary. The former environment minister was initially appointed to the role after Amber Rudd resigned over the government's approach to Brexit. Ms Coffey has previously served in a number of roles including Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. She backed Remain in the 2016 referendum and voted in favour of Theresa May's Brexit deal. However, she later spoke about the need to honour the referendum result and supported Boris Johnson's Tory leadership bid. Dominic Raab replaced Robert Buckland as justice secretary in September 2021. Mr Raab faced criticism and calls for his resignation over his handling of the Afghanistan crisis. He was appointed foreign secretary and first secretary of state in Boris Johnson's first cabinet. A staunch Brexiteer, Mr Raab served as a justice minister in 2015, but was sacked by Theresa May when she became prime minister the following year. He made a return as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after the resignation of David Davis, but quit only months later in opposition to Mrs Mayâs Brexit deal. Mr Raab started his career as an international lawyer, before joining the Foreign Office as a diplomat. Grant Shapps remains transport secretary. The former international development minister was appointed to transport in July 2019. He was once seen as a high-flyer in the Tory party until he resigned following allegations he ignored warnings about bullying when he was party co-chairman. He was born in Watford and educated at a local grammar school, before going on to Manchester Polytechnic to study business and finance. He later set up his own successful printing business. Mr Shapps was elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire in 2005. George Eustice has been environment secretary since February 2020. Mr Eustice previously held ministerial posts under David Cameron and Theresa May, but resigned in 2019 in protest the latter's promise to allow MPs a vote on delaying Brexit if her deal failed to pass the House of Commons. He has represented the Cornish constituency of Camborne and Redruth since 2010. Shailesh Vara was appointed Northern Ireland secretary following Brandon Lewisâs resignation. He was a minister at the Northern Ireland Office from July 2018 to November 2018. He has been a minister in the justice and work & pensions departments, and also spent time as a government whip. Mr Vara, who is married with two children, was elected Conservative MP for North West Cambridgeshire in 2005. Businessman Alister Jack was elected MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017 and has supported what he calls ""a successful Brexit for Scotland"". He founded tent-hire and self-storage companies and is also a dairy farmer. His constituency includes the busiest ferry-port serving Northern Ireland. He was appointed assistant government whip in February 2019. Robert Buckland returns to the cabinet, becoming Welsh secretary following Simon Hartâs resignation. The former solicitor general moved to be prisons minister in the justice department and served as justice secretary from July 2019 to September 2021. He supported Boris Johnson for the leadership describing him as a ""moderate, open-minded, one-nation Conservative"". He was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority, and has subsequently held the seat with an increased share of the vote. He was born in Llanelli and practised as a lawyer specialising in criminal law and planning before becoming an MP. Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016, her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University, where she studied social and political sciences. She went on to become deputy director of the Conservative research department. She was previously deputy director of the centre-right Policy Exchange think-tank. She was also director of the New Schools Network, the organisation set up by Rachel Wolf, which runs the free schools programme. Andrew Stephenson has become minister without portfolio, attending cabinet, and remains a transport minister. He has previously spent time as a minister in the Foreign & Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development. He has also been a government whip. Mr Stephenson was first elected as Conservative MP for Pendle in May 2010. Simon Clarke is chief secretary to the treasury, and also attends cabinet. The MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland was previously a minister in the housing, communities and local government department. Mr Clarke, a qualified solicitor, worked as a policy specialist on health and education before being elected in 2017. Mark Spencer moves from the role of government enforcer as the chief whip to the Leader of the House. Mr Spencer had served in the whips' office since 2016 and was also parliamentary secretary to the Treasury. From farming family, Mr Spencer did not attend Oxbridge, unlike many of his colleagues. He attended Shuttleworth Agricultural College before joining the family farming business. He started his political career as a local councillor and won the Sherwood seat from Labour in the 2010 general election. The MP for Daventry moves from the Foreign Office to become the new chief whip, in charge of disciplining Conservative MPs. He was first elected in 2010 but before becoming a politician, ran his family's wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New Covent Garden Market. The former MEP is a qualified football referee and referees on the Northamptonshire Combination League. Michael Ellis QC has been appointed minister for the Cabinet Office. He will remain paymaster general, which he was appointed last year. Mr Ellis worked as a barrister for 17 years before being elected MP for Northampton North in 2010. His legal experience has also seen him given the role of attorney general and he became a member of the Privy Council in 2019. Johnny Mercer has been named minister for veterans' affairs in the Cabinet Office and will also attend cabinet. He served as a defence minister and Cabinet Office minister - without attending cabinet - between 2019 and 2021, having been elected MP for Plymouth Moor View in 2015. Before becoming an MP he had served in the Army for 12 years and completed three tours in Afghanistan. He is on both the Commons defence and health select committees and chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group for Mental Health.

"Fighters at Hairatan At Afghanistan's border with Uzbekistan a cargo train rolls over a bridge and into the newly created ""Islamic Emirate"". The Taliban's white and black flag flutters next to the Uzbek one. Some traders have welcomed the group's return to power. The driver of a truck being loaded with wheat tells me in the past he was regularly forced to pay bribes to corrupt police officials whenever passing their checkpoints. ""Now, it's not like that,"" he says. ""I could drive all the way to Kabul and not pay a penny."" It's been exactly one month since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan. Now cash is in short supply, and the country is facing a mounting economic crisis. One source in the business community tells us trade levels have dropped significantly, as Afghan importers aren't able to pay for new goods. The Taliban's head of customs at Hairatan port, Maulvi Saeed, tells us the group is cutting duty rates to promote trade, and wants to encourage wealthy traders to return to the country. ""It will create jobs for the people, and the businessmen will be rewarded in the afterlife,"" he says. Around an hour's drive away is Mazar-i-Sharif, the country's fourth largest city. On the surface life appears to be continuing as normal, though many are suffering financially. I head to the intricately tiled Blue Mosque, the cultural heart of the city. I was last here in August, shortly before the Taliban takeover. Back then, the grounds were teeming with young men and women posing for selfies. The Blue Mosque in Mazar-i-Sharif Now the Taliban have allocated separate visiting times according to gender: women can come in the mornings, men the rest of the day. When we visit, there are plenty of women strolling around, but there seem to be significantly fewer than before. ""Things are alright, but maybe people still need more time to get used to the new government,"" one woman suggests timidly. I'm meeting Haji Hekmat, an influential local Taliban leader. ""You might have brought security,"" I put to him, ""but your critics say you're killing the culture here."" ""No,"" he replies emphatically, ""Western influences have been here for the past 20 yearsâ¦ Control of Afghanistan has passed from one foreign hand to another for 40 years, we have lost our own traditions and values. We are bringing our culture back to life."" According to his understanding of Islam, the mixing of men and women is prohibited. Haji Hekmat: ""Western influences have been here for the past 20 yearsâ¦ We are bringing our culture back to life"" Haji Hekmat seems genuinely convinced the Taliban enjoy the support of the people. Out of his earshot, however, one female visitor whispered to a colleague, ""These are not good people."" Whilst the Taliban's interpretation of Islam might clash less with the values of those in more rural, socially conservative villages - in bigger Afghan cities, many remain deeply suspicious of the group. Haji Hekmat puts this down to years of ""propaganda"" but a history of suicide bombings and targeted assassinations in urban areas is clearly also responsible. As we leave the Blue Mosque, we spot a large and excited crowd by the main road, and elbow our way to the centre. Four dead bodies with bullet wounds are laid out on display. One has a small handwritten note on top of it describing the men as kidnappers, warning other criminals their punishment will be the same. Despite the smell of the bodies under the hot sun, the crowd snap photos and try to push past each other for a better look. Violent crime has long been a major problem in Afghanistan's big cities, and even their critics credit the Taliban with improving security. One onlooker tells us, ""If they are kidnappers it's a good thing. It will be a lesson for others."" PROFILES:Who's who in the Taliban leadership INVESTIGATION:Taliban kill civilians in resistance stronghold VOICES:Uncertain times ahead for Afghan women But lots of others in the city don't feel safe. Law student Farzana, tells us, ""Every time I step out of my house and I see the Taliban, I shiver with fear."" Private universities like hers are open, but those run by the government remain shut for now. Under the new Taliban rule, male and female students who are studying in the same classroom must be separated by a curtain. For Farzana, that's not the priority though. She's concerned that the Taliban may not let women work - something the group has denied. For the moment, though, women in Afghanistan are being told to stay at home for their own safety, unless they are teachers or medics. Male and female university students are separated by a curtain ""Right now I feel hopeless,"" Farzana says, ""but I'm doing my best to stay optimistic for the future."" The last time the Taliban were in power, they introduced far more restrictive measures than they have so far on this occasion, banning women from leaving home without a male companion for example. Much of the fear in Afghan cities today is that similar laws could eventually be introduced again. Whilst the Taliban are in firm control of the country, they're yet to win the hearts and minds of many residents. Haji Hekmat acknowledges, ""Taking over the country militarily was hard, implementing the rule of law and protecting it is even harder."" Additional reporting by Malik Mudasir and Shams Ahmadzai.

"Microsoft has announced users can now delete all passwords from their accounts and instead login using an authenticator app or other solution. The technology giant made passwordless accounts available for business users of its products in March. And that system is now being made available to all Microsoft or Windows users. It said ""nearly 100% of our employees"" were already using the new, more secure system for their corporate accounts. If passwordless login is enabled, users re-logging in to a Microsoft account will be asked to give their fingerprint, or other secure unlock, on their mobile phone. Why passwords don't work, and what will replace them Pets' names 'used as passwords by millions' Gadget-makers face ban on easy-to-guess passwords And this is far more secure than using passwords, which can be guessed or stolen, according to Microsoft. ""Only you can provide fingerprint authentication or provide the right response on your mobile at the right time,"" it said. Windows users will still be able to use quick-login features such as a Pin code, though. Some rare exceptions will still need passwords, such as Office 2010, Xbox 360 consoles, and Windows 8.1 or earlier machines. And if access to the authenticator app is lost - for example, if the phone it is installed on is lost or stolen or a user forgets when upgrading - backup options can be used, including: Windows Hello facial recognition, which requires a compatible laptop or special camera a physical security key, which must be used on the device logging in Short Message Service (SMS) or email codes But SMS and email are two of the most common channels for cyber-criminals targeting specific individuals And Microsoft says security-conscious users who have two-factor authentication set up will need to have access to two different recovery methods. Microsoft's messaging tells customers no passwords are more secure Prof Alan Woodward, part of a research team investigating passwordless authentication, at the University of Surrey, called it ""quite a bold step from Microsoft"". ""This isn't just logging into PCs, it's logging into online services as well"" - including important ones such as cloud storage, he said. Microsoft laid out its reasons for the new system,externalin a series of blog posts. Security vice-president Vasu Jakkal wrote: ""Passwords are incredibly inconvenient to create, remember, and manage across all the accounts in our lives. ""We are expected to create complex and unique passwords, remember them, and change them frequently - but nobody likes doing that."" The separate authenticator app - not pictured in this stock photo - is claimed to be more secure than a password Instead, people tended to create insecure passwords that technically cleared the bar for using symbols, numbers or case sensitivity - but in order to remember them, used a repeated formula or the same password on multiple websites. And that led to hackers guessing them or revealing them in a data breach and reusing them. ""Hackers don't break in, they log in,"" the blog post read. The new passwordless feature greets users with a box saying: ""A passwordless account reduces the risk of phishing and password attacks."" And once the feature is set up, a confirmation tells users: ""You have increased the security of your account and improved your sign-in experience by removing your password"". Microsoft's claims about poor password use were largely true, Prof Woodward said. ""The message has been pummelled home about what good password hygiene looks like - but it's easier said than done,"" he said. Passwords were a decades-old concept ""and maybe the time is now right to start looking for something different"". But there were no currently agreed standards. ""There are a number of different ways this could be done - and it would be good if everybody moved on, really, and tried to find a way of doing this,"" Prof Woodward said.
