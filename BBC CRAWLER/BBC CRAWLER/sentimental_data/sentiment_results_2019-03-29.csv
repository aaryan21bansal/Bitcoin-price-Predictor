"The National Living Wage (NLW) will lead to a pay increase for more than 128,000 employees in NI by next year, new research has suggested. The NLW was introduced in 2016 and is effectively a new minimum wage for workers aged 25 and over. It was set at Â£7.20 per hour with the aim of rising to about Â£8.60 by 2020. The research,from the Ulster University Economic Policy Centre,external, suggested the higher wage could also lead to a small number of job losses. It also concluded that the overall economic effect of the NLW will be slightly negative, due to the costs it imposes on businesses. The study found that employees in the hospitality industry will be the major beneficiaries - more than half the workforce in that sector will get a pay rise. Other sectors where a large proportion of workers will benefit are retailing and administration. Employers will have to adjust to the NLW in a variety of ways such as reducing profits, increasing prices, improving productivity or cutting jobs. The study suggests that, given the relatively high proportion of lower paid jobs and lower profit margin businesses in Northern Ireland, some job losses are likely. However, it estimates these to be at a very low level, less than 700 or 0.09% of the Northern Ireland labour force. Aside from examining the data, the Ulster University researchers also spoke to Northern Ireland business representatives. The research was conducted by the Ulster University's Economic Policy Centre The feedback from that consultation suggests the impact of the NLW has been less severe than first anticipated, although that has varied between sectors. Skill shortages have been a bigger issue for businesses, with market forces rather than legislative requirements increasingly requiring businesses to increase pay. In terms of the overall economic impact the central estimate is that the NLW will provide economic benefits of Â£80m through additional earnings and improved productivity. However the costs of job losses and other adjustments by businesses are estimated at Â£153m, giving an overall economic cost of Â£73m or about 0.18% of total economic output. The study acknowledges that the NLW is intended to support wider societal benefits, such as making work more attractive and helping to reduce inequality. Jordan Buchanan, one of the authors, said:  ""It isn't just about the economic benefits. ""All workers should be paid a fair wage. So far, the evidence suggests that the National Living Wage has been successful in raising pay for many in society without causing unemployment.

"The gang were arrested following a year-long police investigation Eight members of a family-run drugs gang who supplied up to Â£2.5m worth of cocaine have been jailed. They distributed about 42kg of cocaine in Newport between July 2016 and June 2018, the city's crown court heard. The judge said each of them played a role ""trading in a vile drug"". Half of the gang, led by brothers Jerome and Blaine Nunes, were jailed on Friday. Eight others, including the pair's mother Angela Collingbourne, 51, will be sentenced at a later date. They were arrested following a year-long police investigation which involved surveillance and secret recordings. Judge Daniel Williams described it as ""painstaking, impressive and thorough"". 'No quick solutions' to drugs problems Can theatre help tackle county lines? Initially, the gang operated out of a garage called NP19 tyres which prosecution barrister Andrew Jones described as a ""front to launder money from drug dealing"". Video recording showed thousands of pounds passing through the premises while only a handful of cars were being repaired. Central to the organisation was a mobile phone called ""the Jez line"" which was the main point of contact for customers. Half of the drugs gang were sentenced at Newport Crown Court on Friday with the remainder to be done at a later date On average, 267 contacts were made with the phone line each day, with more than 4,000 different numbers contacted over a two-year period. The Nunes brothers were convicted of conspiracy to supply a class A drug between 31 July 2016 and 15 June 2018 following a trial. Six other defendants pleaded guilty to the same charge. The judge said it was one of the most ""depressing features"" of the case that Jerome Nunes was able to direct the operation from his prison cell using hidden mobile phones. He was already serving a seven year, eight month sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to supply. He will now serve an additional 12 years. Blaine Nunes was sentenced to 14 years, to run consecutively with a sentence of four years and eight months he is already serving forcausing death by dangerous driving. The other members of the gang to be jailed on Friday were: Preston Killoran, 25, eight years, eight months Thomas Allison, 26, 10 years Kieran Vodden, 23, seven years, four months Ashley Lloyd, 23, six years Joel Clark, 23, six years each Daniel Richardson, 34, five years The convictions come after 120 officers from Gwent Police and Tarian, the regional organised crime unit for south Wales, conducted a series of raids in Maindee and Alway in Newport. Det Ch Insp Julian Bull said: ""It is good to know that these criminals are now behind bars and unable to continue profiting from the misery their trade brings to our neighbourhoods.""

"If we know one thing about the prime minister it is that she does not give up, even when that seems the obvious, or rational choice. Parliament has rejected her deal three times now - a reality that would have finished off many previous administrations and leaders. Whether that is foolhardy and stubborn, or admirably resilient, it is highly likely that at least for another couple of weeks, Theresa May will look through every nook and cranny in Parliament to see if there is a way for her deal to pass through - somehow. But that's a decision taken in the bunker, and the walls are closing in. There is little reason tonight to think that, in the end, the burning core of Euroscepticism in the Tory Party will ever accept her deal. There are few signs that any more than a handful of Labour MPs are really going to take the plunge and ultimately walk through the same lobbies as Theresa May, and Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith. The prime minister concluded today that our political process is reaching its limits. But maybe soon it will be her leadership, her deal, that has passed its limits.

"This video can not be played The Masterchef 2019 winner on her show highlights. Retired banker Irini Tzortzoglou has won this year's MasterChef - and quickly said she has no plans to start a new career running a restaurant. The 61-year-old triumphed in the BBC One show's first all-female final. For the final three-course challenge, she cooked red mullet with a squid risotto, griddled rosemary lamb chops and a fig and hazelnut baklava. Irini, who took inspiration from her Greek childhood, grew up in Crete and now lives in Cartmel, Cumbria. She was one of 56 amateur chefs who competed for the coveted MasterChef trophy in the show's 15th series. Over the course of several gruelling rounds of cooking challenges, they were whittled down to the final three. Irini was particularly pleased to have been in the show's first all-female final and said she wished she could have shared her trophy with her fellow finalists Jilly McCord and Delia Maria Asser. Irini beat off competition from Delia Maria Asser (far left) and Jilly McCord She said: ""It happened so quickly that I felt all the final that the three of us were like one. ""We were all doing our own thing, but actually we were in unison - so my instinctive reaction was: 'Can I share it? Can I share it with my friends?'"" Irini continued: ""We are just lucky we are three women who love and respect each other and have grown to be very fond and appreciative of each other's talents."" Irini Tzortzoglou said she wouldn't follow past winners in opening a restaurant Irini said being filmed throughout the series did not bother her because she remained ""totally focused"". In an interview on BBC Breakfast, she said: ""The cameras didn't disturb me because you really need to ignore them if you want to cook. ""And the guys are fantastic, Gregg [Wallace] comes and relaxes you - he used to joke with me about Greek history, challenge me, laugh with me - and then John [Torode] is like a younger brother who cares for you, he wants you to do as well as you want to. ""They didn't bother me at all. In fact, I loved being around them."" Past winners of the show, such as 2005 champion Thomasina Miers and 2011's Shelina Permalloo, have gone on to own their own restaurants. But despite impressing some of the biggest names in the food industry throughout the competition, Irini's future plans do not involve opening her own professional kitchen. ""I don't think that at my time of life I want to run a restaurant,"" she said. ""I want to spend more time with my mum and I would love to go round Greece and do some research - maybe make a programme, if I'm lucky.""

"Heidi Allen said the group hoped to attract candidates from ""every walk of life"" The Independent Group (TIG) of MPs has applied to become a political party to take part in European elections in May if they go ahead. The group intends to call itself Change UK, and has named Heidi Allen as its interim leader. The government has warned that unless the EU withdrawal agreement is approved later, the UK risks having to take part in May's European Parliament polls. TIG said it would field a substantial number of candidates if this happened. But the group's choice of name has caused controversy, with the petitions website change.org understood to be considering legal action. The company, which says it has 15 million users in the UK, is understood to have contacted the elections watchdog amid concerns the Independent Group is trying to harness some of its profile and support by deliberately choosing a similar name. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? The Independent Group, currently made up of eight former Labour and three ex-Tory MPs, has said it had applied to register as a political party in time for it to take part in those polls under the name ""Change UK - The Independent Group"". If MPs reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal for the third time later, the UK will have until 12 April to come up with an alternative way forward for Brexit. In this scenario, it is thought EU leaders will insist on a longer delay to the UK's departure - which could involve the UK having to put up candidates for European elections between 23 and 26 May. If the elections watchdog approves its application and the polls go ahead, it said it would field a substantial number of candidates from backgrounds outside of politics to try and ""shake up the two-party system"". Ms Allen, a former Conservative MP, told the BBC that the European elections would be a ""weathervane moment for the country"" and a ""proxy for another referendum"". ""It is real opportunity,"" she said. ""The country is crying out for someone to lead and say we can just stay."" She claimed there was enormous support for a new political movement but she did not underestimate the challenges involved. ""This is David and Goliath stuff. We are literally just starting out and building a party together."" She said there had no squabbling over her appointment as interim leader and it felt a ""nice fit"" for her to take the role alongside Chuka Umunna, who is acting as the group's principal spokesman. The group will elect a permanent leader at its first party conference in September. The 11 MPs in the group, who include Mike Gapes, Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston, will continue in their current roles in Parliament. Mrs May has said the public would find taking part in European elections unacceptable and has appealed to MPs to support the agreement to ensure the UK is able to leave the EU on 22 May in an orderly fashion.

"This video can not be played Police used water cannon during the protest in Algiers Hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in Algeria to demand the resignation of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Estimates say crowds in the capital, Algiers, reached a million. It is the sixth successive Friday of mass anti-government protests in the country. Earlier this week an army general,Lt Gen Ahmed Gaed Salah, called for the position of president to made vacant. But opposition parties in Algeria said it would not guarantee free elections. Algerian police fired tear gas at crowds as they attempted to reach the presidency, the BBC's Mohamed Arezki Himeur, in Algiers, said. How does reclusive President Bouteflika run Algeria? Beating the president not enough for protesters The renewed calls for regime change come just days after Lt Gen Gaed Salah demanded that Mr Bouteflika be declared unfit to rule. Demonstrations against Mr Bouteflika began last month after the president, who has seldom been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, announced that he would stand for another term. In response, the president agreed to not stand for a fifth term in upcoming elections, which have been delayed. However the move did not go down well with protesters, who said his decision not to run was a cynical move to prolong his 20-year rule. Some estimates say as many as a million people marched in the capital, Algiers They are now calling for the departure of the president and also an entire generation of Algerian political leaders, including those who would be in line to succeed him. At the protest in Algiers, one member of the crowd, named as Ali, told Reuters news agency: ""We only have one word to say today, all the gang must go immediately, game over."" Lt Gen Gaed Salah - who is also deputy defence minister and seen as loyal to Mr Bouteflika - this week called for the use of Article 102, which allows the Constitutional Council to declare the position of president vacant if the leader is unfit to rule. The ruling party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), backed the general's call. Under the constitution, the head of the Senate, Abdelkhader Bansallah, would become the acting head of state until an election could be held. Despite the significant intervention, the call from the army chief of staff does not appear to be enough for protesters and opposition parties, who have continued to protest on the streets. By Ahmed Rouaba, BBC Africa Opposition parties and protesters in Algeria were not impressed by the suggestion of Lt Gen Gaid Salah to trigger Article 102 of the constitution. The majority of protesters are youth who are not involved in party politics and who say they are not interested in the departure of Mr Bouteflika only to see the power transferred to his former allies - bringing to power different faces of the same regime. It is difficult to predict what is going to happen because there is no indication that opposition parties hold any influence over the protesters, who do not have any leader or spokesperson who could hold talks with the authorities. The army clearly wanted to see an end to the crisis when they abandoned Mr Bouteflika in an unexpected move. But they need to find an influential party to discuss the procedure with. For the moment, the protesters' expectations are very high as they demand the departure of ""everybody who has been associated with the regime"", but they do not offer an alternative. Lt Gen Gaid Salah had already dismissed the idea of ""removing everybody"" as expressed in the protests and on social media. Said Bouteflika:Many in Algeria believe the president's younger brother is the de facto ruler of the country. He is described as being the president's gatekeeper, leading the presidential clan and protecting its interests from behind the scenes. Lakhdar Brahimi:One of the country's most respected veteran diplomats, Mr Brahimi had a successful career at the highest level in the UN General Secretariat. When protests in Algeria first began, Mr Brahimi was chosen to head a transitional conference on the country's political future. Ali Benflis:The founder of the state-run Algerian League for Human Rights was appointed minister for justice in 1988. He was named prime minister in 2000 but dismissed in 2003. He is considered a possible successor despite losing presidential bids in 2004 and 2014. Ali Haddad:The former head of Algeria's Business Forum was identified by Algerian and French press as being one of the main financiers of Mr Bouteflika's 2014 re-election campaign. Ahmed Gaid Salah:The army chief of staff has created controversy by commenting on public matters, leading many to believe that he has presidential ambitions. The Lt Gen has also frequently helped Mr Bouteflika undermine the position of other generals.

"Attorney General William Barr is releasing a redacted version of the 400-page report Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 US election will be made public ""by mid-April"". Attorney General William Barr says he is now redacting the 400-page document. In a letter to the heads of the House and Senate judiciary committees, he says he expects to be able to publish by mid-April, ""if not sooner"". It comes a week after he published a four-page note summarising its conclusions - sparking demands for the report to be released in its entirety. On Monday, six Democratic congressional committee chairssent a letter to Mr Barr demanding the release of the full, ""complete and unredacted"" report by 2 April,external. Trump hints at payback for 'evil' enemies Viewpoint: 'Mueller called it (largely) on Trump' The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words ""Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,"" Mr Barr wrote in his letter to congressional committee chiefs - although it will be redacted to remove legally sensitive material. It investigated whether President Donald Trump's campaign had colluded with Russia in 2016, in order to help steal the US election, but after a 22-month inquiry Special Counsel Mueller cleared the president of collusion. His long-awaited report stopped short of exonerating Mr Trump of the charge of obstruction of justice. But in his letter published on 24 March, Mr Barr said that the evidence presented in the report was not enough to charge the president with obstruction. William Barr's four-page letter on the conclusions of the Mueller report, published on 24 March Since former FBI director Mr Mueller was appointed to head up the investigation, his team has charged 34 people - including six former Trump aides and a dozen Russians - as well as three companies. None of those charges are directly related to the allegations of collusion. As well as promising to release a redacted version of the report, Mr Barr says that he won't be giving a copy to President Trump to review before publication, because ""he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me"". He adds that he will testify publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee on 1 May, and the House Judiciary Committee the following day. The attorney general also denies that his letter released last week was a ""summary"" of Mr Mueller's report, instead referring to it as a ""supplemental notification"". Mueller report: Read William Barr's 24 March letter to Congress ""My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel's investigation or report,"" he writes. ""The Special Counsel's report is nearly 400 pages long (exclusive of tables and appendices) and sets forth the Special Counsel's findings, his analysis, and the reasons for his conclusions. Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,"" Mr Barr's letter adds. President Trump called the investigation a ""hoax"" Mr Trump has described the accusations against him as ""treasonous"". Asked about the report's conclusions a day after they were released, the president said: ""There's a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things. I would say, treasonous things, against our country."" He added: ""It was a false narrative, it was a terrible thing, we can never let this happen to another president again, I can tell you that. I say it very strongly."" This video can not be played Trump on Mueller probe: 'We can never let this happen again' In a rally on Thursday - his first since the report was submitted -the president claimed (incorrectly) that the report was a ""total exoneration"".. ""After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead, the collusion delusion is over,"" he told a cheering crowd in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

"File pic: The baby was born with breathing problems but is expected to be allowed out of hospital in three weeks A funeral is being held for a 26-year-old woman who gave birth to a baby boy on Thursday despite being brain dead since December. International sportswoman Catarina Sequeira was declared brain dead after an acute asthma attack at her home. The baby, named Salvador, was born when she was almost 32 weeks pregnant and is being cared for in a neonatal hospital. This is the second such case in Portugal of a baby born to a mother who was brain dead. Baby born to brain dead mother in Portugal Boy born to brain dead mother goes home A talented canoeist who had represented her country, Sequeira had suffered from asthma since she was a child. She suffered an asthma attack when she was 19 weeks pregnant and was put in an induced coma. However, her condition deteriorated and within days she was declared brain dead on 26 December, reports say. For 56 days a ventilator was attached to her to enable her baby to survive in her womb. Doctors said the intention had been to wait until Friday for the mother to reach 32 weeks' gestation, but her respiratory condition had deteriorated and the Caesarean section was brought forward to Thursday. Thirty-two weeks was considered the period at which babies had a very high probability of survival, hospital officials said. The head of the hospital's ethics committee, Filipe Almeida, explained that the decision to keep the baby alive in the mother's womb was made in discussion with the family and because she had never opted out of Portugal's presumed-consent organ donation law. ""Being a donor is not just about being in a position to donate a liver or heart or lung, but also being in a position to give yourself so a child can live,"" he said. ""And no-one has the right to interrupt the mother's decision process,"" he told the Observador website. The baby's father wanted the child to be born, as did the rest of the family. Sequeira's mother, Maria de FÃ¡tima Branco, told Portuguese TV that she had said goodbye to her daughter on 26 December and the decision to keep the baby had been made because the father, Bruno, had always wanted to be a father. The baby was born weighing 1.7kg (3.75 lbs) and is expected to remain in hospital for at least three weeks, reports say. In 2016 another baby, LourenÃ§o, was born in Lisbon after surviving 15 weeks in his dead mother's womb.

"This video can not be played Band killed in crash were 'lovely, lovely men' The crash that killed both members of British band Her's and their tour manager was caused by a ""wrong-way driver"", according to US authorities. Stephen Fitzpatrick, 24, and Audun Laading, 25,died in the collision in Arizona while travelling to a gig in Californiaon Wednesday. Officials in Arizona said a Nissan pick-up had been ""travelling eastbound on the westbound lane"" of Interstate 10 before hitting the duo's Ford van. There were no survivors. The band, whose members met as students at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts (LIPA), were driving about 350 miles from a performance in Phoenix, Arizona to Santa Ana in California. In a statement, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said the crash happened at about 01:00, shortly after it first received reports of the wrong-way driver. The band's tour manager, 37-year-old Trevor Engelbrektson, from Minneapolis, had been driving their van, the department said. The other driver was named as Francisco Edward Rebollar, 64, of Murrieta, California. ""Both vehicles were engulfed in flames,"" the department said. ""There was no roadway evidence to indicate braking by either vehicle prior to impact. An alcoholic beverage container was located in the debris field."" Officials confirmed Mr Fitzpatrick, from Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, and Mr Laadin, from Norway, were among the deceased.

"AirPower was billed by Apple as a ""world-class wireless charging solution"" In a highly unusual step for the firm, Apple has given up on a product because it could not make it work adequately. AirPower, announced in 2017, was a mat meant to charge multiple devices without needing to plug them in. But it is understood the firmâs engineers were perhaps unable to stop the mat from getting too hot. ""After much effort, weâve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project,"" the firm said. The company did not elaborate further. However, rumours of issues with the product had been circulating since its announcement in September 2017. At the time, Apple said it would be released to the public some time in 2018, promising a ""world-class wireless charging solution"". But late last year, with the product absent from the most recent iPhone launch,noted Apple insider Jon Gruber wrote,external: ""There are engineers who looked at AirPowerâs design and said it could never work, thermally, and now those same engineers have that 'told you so' smug look on their faces."" In a statement emailed to the BBC, Dan Riccio, Appleâs head of hardware engineering, said: ""We apologise to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward."" The cancelled product could affect sales of the companyâs wireless headphones - AirPods - which were promoted and sold with the promise they would be charged using AirPower in future. Packaging for the AirPods contained a diagram of how AirPower would work. Appleâs rivals, such as Huawei and Samsung, have already released products that charge their devices wirelessly.

Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external The public sector employs 5.3 million people, representing about one-sixth of the UK workforce. British universities report a higher median pay gap, 13.7% on average, than the national average of 9.1% in 2018. The university gender pay gap in 2017 was 15.3%. The Universities & Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) said there had been a ""marked narrowing of the gap over the past decade"". It said it had worked with member organisations ""over many years"" on the issue. ""All HE [Higher Education] institutions have been supportive of this and have focused their own work to develop a better understanding of practice and trends... and to explore effective interventions and actions to try to close the gender pay gap,"" it added. Harper Adams University has the widest gap, reporting a 33.7% difference. A spokeswoman for Harper Adams said that the university's pay gap had narrowed in the past year and that it had taken external advice to try to address the issue. Many universities also report a high bonus gender gap - the difference between what men and women are paid in bonuses. The University of Liverpool has a 87.6% bonus gap and Newcastle University 80%. All government departments except the Department for Work and Pensions report a median pay gap. The widest can be found in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), where the difference is 22.9%. The DCMS said it was committed to reducing its gender pay gap and taking action accordingly. ""The overall civil service gender pay gap continues to narrow and we will continue to work hard to balance out wages at all levels of government,"" it added. One in three government departments report that their pay gap has actually widened compared with last year. The average median pay gap in local government is 3.7%. Tonbridge and Malling council reports the largest pay gap in favour of men, 32.7%, followed by Babergh at 27.8% and Dartford at 27.5%. Meanwhile, 78 councils have reported that they pay women more than men. Three Rivers council in Hertfordshire has a 50% pay gap - in favour of women. The gender pay gap does not mean that women are being paid less than men for the same work, something which has been illegal since 1970. However, the pay gap does reflect differences in men and women's working patterns, with part-time roles being predominantly female - and a lack of women in senior roles. Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you line up all the men and women working at a company in two separate lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend per woman and its total spend per man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things - for example, fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. This article is based on the difference in what men and women are paid per hour, but there are other ways of calculating the gender pay gap: theOffice for National Statistics releases annual figures here,external. The individual company data reflects the information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office as of 29 March. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the ""snapshot date"" - the previous year. For businesses and charities, 5 April is the snapshot date, while 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

"AirPower was billed by Apple as a ""world-class wireless charging solution"" In a highly unusual step for the firm, Apple has given up on a product because it could not make it work adequately. AirPower, announced in 2017, was a mat meant to charge multiple devices without needing to plug them in. But it is understood the firmâs engineers were perhaps unable to stop the mat from getting too hot. ""After much effort, weâve concluded AirPower will not achieve our high standards and we have cancelled the project,"" the firm said. The company did not elaborate further. However, rumours of issues with the product had been circulating since its announcement in September 2017. At the time, Apple said it would be released to the public some time in 2018, promising a ""world-class wireless charging solution"". But late last year, with the product absent from the most recent iPhone launch,noted Apple insider Jon Gruber wrote,external: ""There are engineers who looked at AirPowerâs design and said it could never work, thermally, and now those same engineers have that 'told you so' smug look on their faces."" In a statement emailed to the BBC, Dan Riccio, Appleâs head of hardware engineering, said: ""We apologise to those customers who were looking forward to this launch. We continue to believe that the future is wireless and are committed to push the wireless experience forward."" The cancelled product could affect sales of the companyâs wireless headphones - AirPods - which were promoted and sold with the promise they would be charged using AirPower in future. Packaging for the AirPods contained a diagram of how AirPower would work. Appleâs rivals, such as Huawei and Samsung, have already released products that charge their devices wirelessly.

"City of London Police said armed officers were at the scene A suspected gunman has been arrested in the grounds of St Paul's Cathedral. Police - including armed officers - attended the London landmark shortly after midday. A man pointed a weapon at security staff in the Cathedral's crypts and pulled the trigger but no bullet was fired, the BBC was told. He then ran off, hiding the gun in a bush before being detained by City of London Police. The incident is not believed to be terror-related. The force cordoned off an entrance to the cathedral grounds on Paternoster Row. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played The fire broke out in an upmarket area of Dhaka Victims of a tower block fire in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Thursday may have been trapped because emergency exits were locked, officials say. At least 25 people died and 70 others were injured in the blaze. Six of the victims are believed to have fallen to their deaths when they jumped from the burning high-rise building. Shajahan Shikdar, from Dhaka's fire department, told the BBC's Bengali Service that there was also a shortage of fire safety equipment inside. It is not yet clear what caused the fire in the commercial district of Banani. The government has ordered an investigation. The fire broke out at about 12:50 local time (06:50 GMT) on Thursday, quickly engulfing the high-rise property and trapping people inside. Many are believed to have been stuck on the upper floors of the building, above where the fire had started. ""The fire safety system of this building was not satisfactory,"" Mr Shikdar told BBC News. ""There was only a narrow, two-feet-wide iron staircase available as a fire escape, but it was found locked on different floors. So the people in this building were not able to use it during the fire."" Officials say some fire exits in the FR Tower were locked, trapping people inside According to Bengali newspaper the Daily Star, it took 22 firefighting units, backed up by the army, navy and air force, to tackle the blaze. Military helicopters were seen dropping water on the building from above, and rescuing people from the rooftop. The fire was eventually brought under control at 16:45 local time (10:45 GMT), after almost four hours. Analysis by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC South Asia Regional Editor The Bangladeshi capital is a city of high-rise commercial and residential buildings - but how many of these buildings strictly adhere to the government's building code is a big question. It is not uncommon to see emergency exits locked or unwanted office furniture and other junk dumped near fire doors. In some places, the fire exit stairs are so narrow that it will be difficult to navigate through them even under bright light. Some buildings do not carry out regular fire drills or organise awareness programmes for its occupants. In some buildings, steel ladders are used as fire exits and I have seen them particularly in some clothing factories outside Dhaka. 21 February: Fire in historic Dhaka district kills 78 people 17 February: Nine dead in Chittagong blaze In the latest incident, the fire service officials said, even those ladders were locked. Rescue teams also found that there were no water sprinklers inside the tall building. It is still not clear what caused the blaze. The government says a case will be filed against the owner of the building. But there will be questions on how such a commercial building without proper fire safety measures was allowed to operate all these years. Mostaq Ahmed, from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told local media on Friday that 25 victims had been recovered and identified, and that all but one had been handed over to their families. He added that officials from the fire service were still inspecting the building, and that the police would take over shortly afterwards. The fire service initially put the death toll at 19, but on Friday the police confirmed that at least six more people had been killed. Another 70 people are being treated in hospital, with one person said to be in a critical condition. Firefighters stand guard a day after the deadly high-rise fire in the Banani area of Dhaka Large fires are relatively common in Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor building conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. Last month,a massive blaze in Dhaka's old quarter killed at least 78 peopleand injured dozens more. That same month,a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagong killed at least nine people. Dhaka, with a population of more than 18 million, is one of the world's most densely populated cities. Some 3.5 million of its people live in slums, according to the World Bank.

"MPs vote by 286 to 344 to reject the governmentâs withdrawal agreement - on the day the UK was due to leave the EU The Commons has been debating a motion on the terms of the UK's exit The political declaration, which sets out the future relationship, was not considered The vote - the third time the government had been defeated over its deal - throws the UKâs plans into more confusion Theresa May says the result will have ""grave"" implications and the ""legal default"" was that the UK would leave the EU on 12 April Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urges the PM to call an election Thousands of Leave supporters gather outside Parliament to protest against Brexit delay Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Francesca Gillett and Sarah Collerton On the day that the UK was due to leave the EU, there has instead been more delay and continued division over Brexit. Here's what today has meant for the Brexit process:  BBC News Channel BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says there is lots more talk in Westminster tonight about a possible general election. ""Thereâs a recognition that thereâs a lot of weariness about
the potential trip to a polling station,"" he says. But he says that ""Parliament is running out of road â the prime minister used
language to that effect today"". Some MPs have suggested that the prime minister should consider her position. But Mr Mason says: ""Her character would suggest that she would want to see this
through to some conclusion."" While it might be a ""tall order"" for her to get her deal through now, she may wait until ""the point where she has self-evidently failed to do that and the UK ends up committed to a long delay"" after 12 April. If she does eventually trigger a leadership contest, a new leader ""could seek a new mandate and try to get themselves a majority â and then we would be heading for another general election"".

Followingthe government's latest setback, it is no clearer when Brexit will happen. The UK faces a deadline of 12 April to come up with a way forward. By that point, the UK must have approved any deal or decided whether it wants to leave without a deal, which Parliament has said no to, or is prepared to delay Brexit by a much longer period, potentially into next year. The EU is planning an emergency summit on 10 April to discuss its next move. So where does the process go from here? Read more here Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor If we know one thing about the prime minister it is that she does not give up, even when it seems that seems the obvious or rational choice. Parliament has rejected her deal three times now - a reality that would have finished off many previous administrations and leaders. Whether that is foolhardy and stubborn, or admirably resilient, it is highly likely that at least for another couple of weeks, Theresa May will look through every nook and cranny in Parliament to see if there is a way for her deal to pass through - somehow. But that's a decision taken in the bunker, and the walls are closing in. Read the full story Katya AdlerEurope Editor The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says today's vote is ""no great surprise"" to European leaders. She says the mood in Brussels is of ""resignation"" and ""defensiveness"", with ""the EU wanting to protect itself
from any future Brexit fallout"". The UK leaving without a deal is seen as an ""increasingly likely prospect"" by leaders such as Emmanuel Macron. ""Thatâs why he and other European leaders are questioning
whether it makes sense to delay Brexit for that much longer. They look at all
the divisions in Parliament, in government, in cabinet, and they wonder if the UK
will ever unite around Brexit,"" Adler says. She says that doesn't mean they would say no, but there would be ""very heated discussion among EU
leaders as to whether to extend, what for and for how long"". One thing they are certain about is that the UK would need to take part in EU elections for a longer extension, she says. That's because the UK would remain an EU member, and the European Parliament's legality could be questioned if all members are not represented.

Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve says Theresa May's deal is now off the table - and it's down to Parliament to resolve the deadlock. The Tory MP tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""There has to be a reset of all this.  There has to be a plan B. ""If we are to leave the European Union, it's got to be on some very different terms. ""It's clear that the House of Commons has been working in the last week to try and identify a way forward which might provide an alternative to the prime minister's ideas of Brexit, and we certainly need to take that forward next week.""

Vote Leave was fined Â£61,000and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law. The watchdog said it exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. Vote Leave previously said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent There's a bad moon rising over Westminster. Friday's latest government defeat on Brexit may have been by a lower margin than the earlier thrashings, but the convincing 58-vote majority against the EU withdrawal agreement, in the teeth of an all-out whipping operation, hardly suggests that one more heave will see it home. The result looks set to trigger a political chain reaction. And with the prime minister having signalled her departure, albeit making contingent on getting her deal passed, a variety of parliamentary events will become auditions for the contenders for her job. Sajid Javid has Home Office questions on Monday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is up on Tuesday and Andrea Leadsom has her weekly Business Questions outing on Thursday. Other parliamentary events, not least around Brexit, will provide plenty of opportunities for other contenders. Here's Mark's rundown of the week ahead. Former Labour MP Chris Leslie, who is part of the Independent Group, says he supports calls for another public vote - but not a general election. He tells the BBC News Channel: ""If you think that Brexit is complicated, just throw a general election in here to completely throw everything into chaos.  Let's get a grip of this situation. ""There is a route out of it.  The prime minister's deal could go back to the public. ""We could put a customs union, single market back to the public. Ultimately we have to give people the chance to look at this and say do we want to proceed or think again?"" Continuing his speech, ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said: ""This is about our whole system of democracy. ""This is about the bond of trust that needs to exist between the people and those, the governors. ""This is about who we are as a nation. Where our standing is in the world. ""And frankly, I believe that what's happened over there, has not just turned this day that should've been one of great celebration into a day that history will mark as a day of great betrayal, I believe that what's happened over the course of two years is actually one of the saddest and worst chapters in the history of our nation."" He added: ""What they want is for us to go away. Am I downcast, am I disheartened? No. I am more determined."" The crowd broke out in chants of ""Nigel! Nigel! Nigel!"" To music and loud cheers, former UKIP leader and Brexiteer Nigel Farage appeared on stage at the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square. ""It's brave of you to come,"" he told demonstrators. ""Because I sense, being in Westminster, that we are in enemy territory. ""There are hundreds of people just over the street that have treated that referendum and those who voted for it with total and utter contempt of the past three years."" Referring to Theresa May's Brexit deal, Mr Farage called it ""dreadful"" and said he did not spend 25 years campaigning to come out of the EU to see the UK ""signed up to another"" EU treaty. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent The big question everyone is asking is whether the prime
ministerâs deal is dead after this third defeat. Of course, opposition MPs certainly think that it is. But
does she have a plan to bring it back again? There is speculation about maybe some kind of run-off
between her proposal and whatever MPs come up with and coalesce around on
Monday. But weâll have to wait and see. Itâs certainly been an incredibly divisive process - particularly for the Conservative Party. UKIP leader Gerard Batten addressed pro-Brexit supporters on Whitehall after Tommy Robinson. Mr Batten told the crowds: ""As of now we
do not know when we are going to leave the European Union. ""Theresa May has had, for the third
time, her not-really-leaving deal rejected by Parliament."" He added: ""What we do know is that
if we do not leave the EU it will mark the end of democracy in the UK."" Mr Batten also said, to cheers from the crowd, that UKIP was the ""only major political party that actually wants Britain to leave the
EU"". Conservative MP Mark Francois was introduced as a ""massive, massive Brexiteer"" when he took to the stage at the protest organised by campaign group Leave Means Leave. Greeted by a cheering crowd, Mr Francois read out the first part of the poem If by Rudyard Kipling. ""I read it again the other night, and it could have been written for the ERG over the last year,"" he tells the demo, referring to the pro-Brexit European Research Group. ""If you can keep your head when all about youAre losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,But make allowance for their doubting too."" He added: ""Three times this wretched deal has been voted down by the House of Commons. ""Prime minister, which bit of 'no, no, no' don't you understand?"" Tory MPs tweet... Allow Twitter content?

As well as promising to release a redacted version of the report, Mr Barr says that he won't be giving a copy to President Trump to review before publication, because ""he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me"".

"Attorney General William Barr is releasing a redacted version of the 400-page report Robert Mueller's report into Russian interference in the 2016 US election will be made public ""by mid-April"". Attorney General William Barr says he is now redacting the 400-page document. In a letter to the heads of the House and Senate judiciary committees, he says he expects to be able to publish by mid-April, ""if not sooner"". It comes a week after he published a four-page note summarising its conclusions - sparking demands for the report to be released in its entirety. On Monday, six Democratic congressional committee chairssent a letter to Mr Barr demanding the release of the full, ""complete and unredacted"" report by 2 April,external. Trump hints at payback for 'evil' enemies Viewpoint: 'Mueller called it (largely) on Trump' The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words ""Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,"" Mr Barr wrote in his letter to congressional committee chiefs - although it will be redacted to remove legally sensitive material. It investigated whether President Donald Trump's campaign had colluded with Russia in 2016, in order to help steal the US election, but after a 22-month inquiry Special Counsel Mueller cleared the president of collusion. His long-awaited report stopped short of exonerating Mr Trump of the charge of obstruction of justice. But in his letter published on 24 March, Mr Barr said that the evidence presented in the report was not enough to charge the president with obstruction. William Barr's four-page letter on the conclusions of the Mueller report, published on 24 March Since former FBI director Mr Mueller was appointed to head up the investigation, his team has charged 34 people - including six former Trump aides and a dozen Russians - as well as three companies. None of those charges are directly related to the allegations of collusion. As well as promising to release a redacted version of the report, Mr Barr says that he won't be giving a copy to President Trump to review before publication, because ""he has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me"". He adds that he will testify publicly before the Senate Judiciary Committee on 1 May, and the House Judiciary Committee the following day. The attorney general also denies that his letter released last week was a ""summary"" of Mr Mueller's report, instead referring to it as a ""supplemental notification"". Mueller report: Read William Barr's 24 March letter to Congress ""My March 24 letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel's investigation or report,"" he writes. ""The Special Counsel's report is nearly 400 pages long (exclusive of tables and appendices) and sets forth the Special Counsel's findings, his analysis, and the reasons for his conclusions. Everyone will soon be able to read it on their own,"" Mr Barr's letter adds. President Trump called the investigation a ""hoax"" Mr Trump has described the accusations against him as ""treasonous"". Asked about the report's conclusions a day after they were released, the president said: ""There's a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things. I would say, treasonous things, against our country."" He added: ""It was a false narrative, it was a terrible thing, we can never let this happen to another president again, I can tell you that.

"This video can not be played The fire broke out in an upmarket area of Dhaka Victims of a tower block fire in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Thursday may have been trapped because emergency exits were locked, officials say. At least 25 people died and 70 others were injured in the blaze. Six of the victims are believed to have fallen to their deaths when they jumped from the burning high-rise building. Shajahan Shikdar, from Dhaka's fire department, told the BBC's Bengali Service that there was also a shortage of fire safety equipment inside. It is not yet clear what caused the fire in the commercial district of Banani. The government has ordered an investigation. The fire broke out at about 12:50 local time (06:50 GMT) on Thursday, quickly engulfing the high-rise property and trapping people inside. Many are believed to have been stuck on the upper floors of the building, above where the fire had started. ""The fire safety system of this building was not satisfactory,"" Mr Shikdar told BBC News. ""There was only a narrow, two-feet-wide iron staircase available as a fire escape, but it was found locked on different floors. So the people in this building were not able to use it during the fire."" Officials say some fire exits in the FR Tower were locked, trapping people inside According to Bengali newspaper the Daily Star, it took 22 firefighting units, backed up by the army, navy and air force, to tackle the blaze. Military helicopters were seen dropping water on the building from above, and rescuing people from the rooftop. The fire was eventually brought under control at 16:45 local time (10:45 GMT), after almost four hours. Analysis by Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC South Asia Regional Editor The Bangladeshi capital is a city of high-rise commercial and residential buildings - but how many of these buildings strictly adhere to the government's building code is a big question. It is not uncommon to see emergency exits locked or unwanted office furniture and other junk dumped near fire doors. In some places, the fire exit stairs are so narrow that it will be difficult to navigate through them even under bright light. Some buildings do not carry out regular fire drills or organise awareness programmes for its occupants. In some buildings, steel ladders are used as fire exits and I have seen them particularly in some clothing factories outside Dhaka. 21 February: Fire in historic Dhaka district kills 78 people 17 February: Nine dead in Chittagong blaze In the latest incident, the fire service officials said, even those ladders were locked. Rescue teams also found that there were no water sprinklers inside the tall building. It is still not clear what caused the blaze. The government says a case will be filed against the owner of the building. But there will be questions on how such a commercial building without proper fire safety measures was allowed to operate all these years. Mostaq Ahmed, from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told local media on Friday that 25 victims had been recovered and identified, and that all but one had been handed over to their families. He added that officials from the fire service were still inspecting the building, and that the police would take over shortly afterwards. The fire service initially put the death toll at 19, but on Friday the police confirmed that at least six more people had been killed. Another 70 people are being treated in hospital, with one person said to be in a critical condition. Firefighters stand guard a day after the deadly high-rise fire in the Banani area of Dhaka Large fires are relatively common in Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor building conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. Last month,a massive blaze in Dhaka's old quarter killed at least 78 peopleand injured dozens more. That same month,a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagong killed at least nine people. Dhaka, with a population of more than 18 million, is one of the world's most densely populated cities. Some 3.5 million of its people live in slums, according to the World Bank.

"More than half of parents said their child had been tempted by an Easter treat at checkouts Calorie-filled Easter eggs are being sold in shops far too early and that is tempting parents to buy unhealthy treats for their children, a public health body says. It is not unusual to find Easter eggs on sale in the first week of January - but most people are irritated by the practice, the Royal Society of Public Health said. It wants retailers to crack down on early sales of seasonal products high in fat, salt and sugar. Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), said: ""We recognise that special occasions such as Easter are a time for indulgence and treats. ""However, it is clear that many shops and supermarkets are pushing products way too early. ""If supermarkets are serious about tackling the obesity epidemic, we would urge retailers to change their marketing strategies in the interest of the public's health."" In a survey of 2,000 adults in the UK, two-thirds said holidays and special occasions were used too much to sell unhealthy food while a third said it made them eat less healthily. More than half of parents said their child had been tempted by an Easter treat displayed near checkouts and half of those surveyed said they had already bought and eaten at least one chocolate Easter egg or cake this year. A 256g Cadbury's chocolate egg contains about 1,375 calories - that's more than half the recommended daily calorie intake limit of 2000kcal for a woman, and 2,500kcal for a man. With one in four adults and one in five 10 to 11-year-old children in the UK classified as obese, the RSPH says more should be done to reverse these trends. It urges retailers to stop pushing unhealthy products at checkouts - a proposal contained in thegovernment's plan to halve childhood obesity in England by 2030. Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, said: ""The bulk of Easter egg purchases are made in the week before Easter as customers scramble to buy eggs for family and friends. ""However, many of us choose to buy and enjoy eggs even before Easter, and retailers cater to that demand as well.""

"House prices are lower in England compared with a year ago - the first annual fall in property values since 2012, according to the Nationwide. In the first three months of the year, prices in England were down 0.7% from the same period in 2018. But the building society said that annual house price rises in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales meant the UK average was still growing. The typical home was valued at Â£213,102, the Nationwide said. Based on its own lending data, the building society said UK house prices in March were up 0.7% from the same month a year earlier. Robert Gardner, the building society's chief economist, said that the number of sales and the number of mortgages approved for house purchases had remained ""broadly stable"". However, he said that consumer surveys had suggested buyers and sellers were taking a more cautious approach. This has come as a result of a lack of Brexit clarity. Sam Mitchell, chief executive of online estate agents Housesimple, said: ""The market would have preferred a decision one way or the other. Instead, we are now in this state of short-term limbo leaving many buyers and sellers unsure what to do. ""Normally, we would expect to see a spike in transaction levels around this time as we enter the traditional spring bounce period, but with the extension to the EU leaving date, the bounce is likely to be a little subdued this year."" Andrew Montlake, director of mortgage broker Coreco, said: ""London is particularly sensitive to ongoing political uncertainty but it is also paying for the astronomic house price growth of five or six years ago."" This was seen in figures comparing house prices in the first three months of this year with the same quarter in 2017. On this measure, house prices in London had fallen by 3.8% - the biggest fall for a decade, the Nationwide said. However, properties in the capital remained the most expensive in the UK at an average of Â£455,594. Prices in the commuter belt around London and the South East of England also fell compared with a year ago, driving the drop in England as a whole. Over the same period, property values in Wales increased by 0.9%, rose by 2.4% in Scotland, and went up by 3.3% in Northern Ireland. However, prices in Northern Ireland are still more than 35% below their high in 2007, the Nationwide said. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

"Keith Flint was found dead at his home in Essex on 4 March Fans of The Prodigy have travelled from abroad to pay tribute to frontman Keith Flint.

"This video can not be played Can Mike Ashley save debt-laden Debenhams? Struggling department store chain Debenhams has agreed a Â£200m refinancing lifeline with lenders. The deal offered ""reassurance"" for employees, pension holders, suppliers and lenders, it said. The retailer said it would continue with plans to cut the number of its stores and negotiate rent reductions. The financial deal leaves the door open for Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, which has been vying to seize control of Debenhams, to make a bid. ""We are pleased to have agreed this comprehensive funding package which secures the future of the Debenhams business,"" said Debenhams chairman Terry Duddy. ""We have also preserved a route for our shareholders to participate in the future of the business, but this requires the support of our major shareholder."" Sports Direct is the biggest Debenhams shareholder, with a 29.7% stake. Brandes Investment Partners, Odey Asset Management and retail conglomerate Landmark Group are also significant shareholders. Debenhams advisers 'should be jailed' Sports Direct readies Â£61m Debenhams bid The deal will make Â£101m available for Debenhams to draw down. But whether Debenhams can get hold of the remaining Â£99m depends on one of the following options taking place by 8 April. One is that Sports Direct, or another major shareholder with more than a quarter of the company's shares, makes a firm offer for the retailer, including refinancing Debenhams debt, the department store said. Alternatively, Sports Direct could drop its attempt to oust all but one of the Debenhams board, and either agree to underwrite a rights issue or provide funding on terms agreed by Debenhams' lenders. If neither of these happen, Debenhams said the remaining funds would be made available only when the company's lenders take over the business, but added this ""would very likely result in no equity value for the company's current shareholders"". Sports Direct has made a number of attempts to seize control of Debenhams, which have been rebuffed. Debenhams said none of the proposals ""have provided or been compatible with a comprehensive solution"". Shares in Debenhams jumped more than 40% following news of the refinancing deal being completed. A spokesman for the trustees of the Debenhams Pension Schemes said: ""We hope that the agreement will form the basis of a sustainable solution for the trading business that ensures that it will continue to support the pension schemes on a long-term basis."" Earlier on Friday, Mr Ashley hit out afterDebenhams bondholders cleared the way for the refinancing. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that Mike Ashley was now ""between a rock and hard place"". ""He faces either seeing his stake in Debenhams disappear, or having to stump up cash to keep shares in the company alive. ""If Sports Direct doesn't want to pour good money after bad, the equity in Debenhams will almost certainly be wiped out, and the lenders will take control of the company. ""This has been a really desperate period for Debenhams, and it now looks like the company is on the brink of seeing its shares extinguished, unless there's one last twist in the tale, courtesy of Mike Ashley.""

"Nurse Stacey Worsley gambled donations made to her son's cancer treatment fund A mother who gambled away more than Â£100,000 stolen from a fund set up to pay for her son's cancer treatment has been given a suspended sentence. Leeds United fan Toby Nye, who had high-risk neuroblastoma, died in January just days after his sixth birthday. His mother, Stacey Worsley, admitted fraud at a previous Leeds Crown Court hearing. The 32-year-old was given a two-year jail term suspended for two years. Toby Nye, pictured with Leeds captain Liam Cooper, died in January Judge Guy Kearl QC said Worsley, the sole trustee of the fund, started gambling online with the donated money with the intention of increasing it to help her son. However, the nurse began to chase ""spiralling"" losses, he said, and had been under ""extraordinary pressure"" including having to look after two other young children. Read more stories from across Yorkshire The judge told Worsley: ""You became overwhelmed by the situation in which you found yourself. ""No-one could fail to be moved by your story. ""You were under enormous pressure and I have no doubt that all of this started as a result of you wanting to raise the money for his treatment."" Worsley racked up Â£140,000 in gambling debts but the judge noted she had not spent any of the money on ""luxuries"" for herself. Judge Kearl said: ""This case is unique. The confluence of mitigating factors takes it far outside the norm and are unlikely to recur."" He said the money had been recovered from the online gambling companies and would be given back to major donors and other charities. Toby was diagnosed with a stage four neuroblastoma on his fourth birthday Nicholas De La Poer, defending Worsley, said her gambling ""became a compulsive distraction from the horrors of the situation"". West Yorkshire Police previously said Toby's medical treatment was not affected by the fraud. Toby, from Osmondthorpe, Leeds, became ill at Christmas 2016 and on his fourth birthday in January 2017, his family were told he had a stage four neuroblastoma tumour. He had struck up relationships with several players and staff at his beloved Leeds United. Last year,the club raised the Â£200,000 needed to fund his cancer treatment.Players and staff gave a day's salary and fans also donated. Worsley had pleaded guilty to one charge of committing fraud by false representation. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Parliament remains deadlocked after MPs once againrejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. But could a series of votes on different Brexit options offer a way forward? A process, known as indicative votes,has already tried to find a consensus - but it failed to find a majority for any one outcome. No. A second round of indicative votes is expected on Monday. The process is likely to be very similar to last time,according to the order paper,external. MPs will be able to submit their options to the Speaker, John Bercow. He will then select which options are debated and eventually voted on. Last time, eight options were selected. But on this occasion Mr Bercow could decide to select fewer - for example only the three options that commanded the most support on Wednesday. Or, he could choose more. The voting system - where MPs select yes or no on each option - is expected to remain the same. Here is a reminder of what the options were and how MPs voted on them, in the first round. Proposer: Dame Margaret Beckett, Labour Result: 268 for, 295 against This option would require the public to agree to any Brexit deal, through a ""confirmatory referendum"". But it would be up to MPs to decide what the question on the ballot would be - and that could lead to renewed deadlock. For example, should there be two or more options to choose from? How could another referendum work? Proposer: Ken Clarke, Conservative Result: 265 for, 271 against Under this option, MPs could pledge to support Mrs May's Brexit deal (known asthe withdrawal agreement) in exchange for a commitment for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU. A customs union is a trade agreement under which two or more countries do not put tariffs (taxes on imports) on goods coming in from other countries in the union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This arrangement would give the UK a closer trading relationship with the EU and reduce the need for some (but not all) checks at the Irish border. It would go some way towards removing the need for the backstop - the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border (eg border posts) in Ireland. But being part of a permanent customs union with the EU would stop the UK striking its own independent trade deals with other countries (such as the United States). Mrs May has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union as one of her ""red lines"". Proposer: Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Result: 237 for, 307 against Labour's position is to remain in a customs unionin addition to having a ""close alignment"" with the EU single market. While being in a customs union prevents the UK from negotiating its own trade deals, Labour says it wants the UK to be to have ""a say"" in future EU trade talks. But EU law does not currently allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. However, Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. What is Labour's custom union policy? Proposer: Nick Boles, Conservative Result: 189 for, 283 against This option would involve the UK joining Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of theEuropean Free Trade Association (Efta),external. It would mean remaining in the single market, which would ensure the free flow of goods to and from the EU - avoiding friction at the borders. But the UK would have to retain freedom of movement (the right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK and vice-versa) - although some restrictions  could apply. The UK would also need pay into the EU budget and follow many of the EU's rules and regulations. Under the plan, the UK would also remain in a customs union until an alternative plan to a avoid a hard border in Ireland was found. This option is referred to as the Common Market 2.0 or the Norway plus plan. What is Common Market 2.0? Proposer: Joanna Cherry, SNP Result: 184 for, 293 against This would mean cancelling Brexit altogether. Article 50 is the two-year process which triggered the UK's departure from the EU. The original deadline of 29 March has now been extended for at least a couple of weeks. Last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. By revoking Article 50, the UK would bring a halt to the entire Brexit process. It would therefore remain a member of the EU on the same terms, including keeping its budget rebate. Can the UK revoke Article 50? Proposer: John Baron, Conservative Result: 160 for, 400 against No deal is the legal default outcome in the absence of agreeing a deal or revoking Article 50. So if the political deadlock cannot be resolved, a no-deal Brexit could still be the final outcome. If the UK did leave the EU with no deal, it would mean initially trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. The Ministry of Defence says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit, if necessary This means that certain goods would be subject to tariffs. The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these""as far as possible"". In addition to tariffs, UK goods entering the EU would be subject to extra checks. There have been warnings that this could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover). The UK has undertaken preparations, code-named Operation Yellowhammer, to address any disruption in the first few days of a no-deal Brexit. As part of the contingency plans, up to 3,500 troops will be ready to be deployed, if necessary. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What trade deals have been done so far? What is operation Yellowhammer? Proposer: Marcus Fysh, Conservative Result: 139 for, 422 against This option assumes the UK is unable to pass the withdrawal agreement. Under this scenario, the UK would leave the EU but there would be a commitment from both sides to recognise each other's standards and regulations for up to two years. Supporters refer to it as a ""standstill"" agreement and say this would mean that goods could continue to flow freely and tariff-free (ie no taxes on imports). The UK would be able to negotiate its future relationship, but would continue to pay into the EU budget during this period. Supporters say such an arrangement would avoid disruption, but detractors say it would not eliminate the need for checks. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to accept such a plan. Proposer: George Eustice, Conservative Result: 64 for, 377 against Under this option, the UK would participate in the single market and Efta but, unlike the Common Market 2.0 option, it would not enter into an EU customs arrangement. This would give the UK the freedom to sign its own trade deals. However, it is not clear how such an outcome would avoid the need for customs checks at the Irish border - the plan acknowledges the need for ""new protocols relating to the Northern Ireland border"".

"The withdrawal agreement is 585 pages long, while the political declaration is just 26 pages MPs have rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal for a third time. The government lost by 344 votes to 286, a majority of 58. But on this occasion there was a key difference: MPs only voted on the withdrawal agreement and not the political declaration. Previously, both of these were voted on and rejected. So, what are they? This is the deal the UK government negotiated with the European Union, over 18 months, and it sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. First published in November, it is almost 600 pages long,externaland some of the key areas it covers are: The transition Under the withdrawal agreement, the UK would enter into a 21-month transition period with the EU after Brexit. During this time the UK would continue to follow EU rules and remain in the single market and customs union to allow frictionless trade to continue. The UK would also lose membership of EU institutions. The transition period could be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Money This is known as ""the divorce bill"" - the amount of money the UK would need to pay the EU to settle its obligations. Although no figure appears in the document, it is expected that the UK would pay at least Â£39bn over a number of years. The Irish backstop The most controversial part of the withdrawal agreement is the Irish backstop, which has proved to be the main reason it cannot command a majority in Parliament. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The backstop is the insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland after Brexit. It would kick in at the end of the transition period in the event that a comprehensive trade deal, that avoids the needs for checks at the Irish border, is not reached between the UK and EU. The terms of the backstop would effectively place the UK into a temporary customs union with the EU. Critics worry that the UK could find itself trapped in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to pursue its own independent trade policy (signing trade deals with countries like the US). Citizens' rights During the transition period, UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would retain their residency and welfare rights after Brexit. The withdrawal agreement also allows citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK, of course) to be allowed to stay in that country after the transition. Brexit withdrawal agreement: what it all means? The political declaration - also published in November - is all about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, after Brexit. This document,externalis far shorter (just 26 pages) and, unlike the withdrawal agreement, it is not legally binding. Some of the keys areas it covers are: Trade The document calls on the trading relationship to be ""as close as possible"" and says there would be an ""ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced"" economic partnership. But it does not a set out what the final outcome for UK-EU trade will look like. Customs The political declaration refers to an ""ambitious customs arrangement"". The concern, from some, is that this could turn into a permanent arrangement that could prevent the UK from pursuing its own independent trade policy. The government dismisses this concern, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future. Irish border Technology and other alterative arrangements would be considered in order to keep the Irish border open with no physical infrastructure (eg border posts). However, presently, there is no border which the EU shares with a non-EU country that is entirely open and frictionless. Can technology solve the Irish border problem? Freedom of movement The UK, according to the document, would take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK (and UK citizens to the EU) would come to an end. The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays.

"This video can not be played Can Mike Ashley save debt-laden Debenhams? Struggling department store chain Debenhams has agreed a Â£200m refinancing lifeline with lenders. The deal offered ""reassurance"" for employees, pension holders, suppliers and lenders, it said. The retailer said it would continue with plans to cut the number of its stores and negotiate rent reductions. The financial deal leaves the door open for Mike Ashley's Sports Direct, which has been vying to seize control of Debenhams, to make a bid. ""We are pleased to have agreed this comprehensive funding package which secures the future of the Debenhams business,"" said Debenhams chairman Terry Duddy.

"More than half of parents said their child had been tempted by an Easter treat at checkouts Calorie-filled Easter eggs are being sold in shops far too early and that is tempting parents to buy unhealthy treats for their children, a public health body says. It is not unusual to find Easter eggs on sale in the first week of January - but most people are irritated by the practice, the Royal Society of Public Health said. It wants retailers to crack down on early sales of seasonal products high in fat, salt and sugar. Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), said: ""We recognise that special occasions such as Easter are a time for indulgence and treats. ""However, it is clear that many shops and supermarkets are pushing products way too early. ""If supermarkets are serious about tackling the obesity epidemic, we would urge retailers to change their marketing strategies in the interest of the public's health."" In a survey of 2,000 adults in the UK, two-thirds said holidays and special occasions were used too much to sell unhealthy food while a third said it made them eat less healthily. More than half of parents said their child had been tempted by an Easter treat displayed near checkouts and half of those surveyed said they had already bought and eaten at least one chocolate Easter egg or cake this year. A 256g Cadbury's chocolate egg contains about 1,375 calories - that's more than half the recommended daily calorie intake limit of 2000kcal for a woman, and 2,500kcal for a man. With one in four adults and one in five 10 to 11-year-old children in the UK classified as obese, the RSPH says more should be done to reverse these trends. It urges retailers to stop pushing unhealthy products at checkouts - a proposal contained in thegovernment's plan to halve childhood obesity in England by 2030. Andrew Opie, from the British Retail Consortium, said: ""The bulk of Easter egg purchases are made in the week before Easter as customers scramble to buy eggs for family and friends. ""However, many of us choose to buy and enjoy eggs even before Easter, and retailers cater to that demand as well.""

"This video can not be played Leave supporters have gathered outside Parliament Thousands of Leave supporters have protested at Westminster against the delay to Brexit, on the day the UK had been due to leave the EU. Some demonstrators reacted with cheers, while others shouted ""shame on you"", asMPs rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's EU withdrawal agreement. The March to Leave - which began in Sunderland two weeks ago - arrived in Parliament Square on Friday afternoon. A separate Make Brexit Happen rally, organised by UKIP, was also held. The rally was backed by English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson, who spoke to crowds, along with UKIP leader Gerard Batten. Meanwhile, at the March to Leave protest, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Tory Brexiteer MP Mark Francois delivered speeches. Campaign group Stand Up to Racism also held a counter-protest in Westminster, saying it was there ""against the far right who are trying to capitalise on the Brexit crisis"". The protests in Westminster continued into the evening Many of the supporters carried Union Jack flags or placards Pro-Brexit supporters burn an EU flag near to Trafalgar Square Some Brexit protesters continued to demonstrate into the evening, and lines of police were deployed to keep the crowds under control. The Metropolitan Police said five arrests had been made at the demonstrations - although that included one man who was wanted in connection with an offence elsewhere. Two other people were arrested on suspicion of assault, another on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and someone else on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. It comes as MPs on Fridayrejected Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal deal, which she negotiated with the EU, by 58 votes. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but both sides agreed to postpone the date last week after Mrs May had twice been unable to get her Brexit deal through the Commons. Brexit: What could happen next? A really simple guide to Brexit Friday's defeat of the withdrawal agreement led to mixed reactions. Some in the crowd, who saw Mrs May's deal as too soft, welcomed its rejection, while others feared it could lead to another EU referendum. Two separate pro-Brexit demonstrations ended in Parliament Square on Friday Protesters release balloons in Parliament Square Police lined up outside the House of Commons in Parliament Square Former UKIP leader and Brexiteer Nigel Farage spoke at the March to Leave rally - organised by campaign group Leave Means Leave - and was greeted by loud cheers as he took to the stage. ""It's brave of you to come,"" he told demonstrators. ""Because I sense, being in Westminster, that we are in enemy territory. ""There are hundreds of people just over the street that have treated that referendum, and those who voted for it, with total and utter contempt for the past three years."" Among those on the March to Leave through London were sisters Beatrice and Alice Grant The 270-mile, 14-day march ended at Parliament, after the last leg from Fulham Mr Farage told Leave supporters ""not to be disheartened"", and also signalled that he would be willing to stand again as an MEP if the UK takes part in the European Parliament elections in May. The UK has a new Brexit deadline of 12 April, by which point it needs to have told the EU what its next steps are. If the UK wants to delay Brexit further, the EU is expected to insist that it takes part in the elections. A crowd gathered around the stage for a speech by MEP and Brexiteer Nigel Farage Mr Farage said he believed Leave would win in another referendum ""by a bigger margin than last time"" By BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, in Parliament Square The mood and atmosphere in Parliament Square is very strange for a demonstration. There is a really significant police presence, yet a lot of quiet but angry, angry people who believe that Parliament has ""betrayed"" Brexit. When the news came through that MPs had, yet again, refused to back the PM's draft deal, the reaction was rather muted. George, from St Albans, told me he was satisfied, because he hoped the UK could now crash out without a deal, as the public demanded. One man has a coffin as a prop, declaring the death of democracy. ""Bring out your dead,"" goes the prop's recording. UKIP leader Gerard Batten told the crowd at the Make Brexit Happen protest: ""As of now we do not know when we are going to leave the European Union. ""Theresa May has had, for the third time, her not-really-leaving deal rejected by Parliament."" He added: ""What we do know is that if we do not leave the EU it will mark the end of democracy in the UK."" Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - also took to the stage, addressing the confusion over the latest defeat of the deal: ""So Theresa May has lost her vote. Many people will be asking what does that even mean. ""It means we were betrayed. Today is supposed to be our Independence Day."" Tommy Robinson spoke during the Make Brexit Happen demo on Friday afternoon The BBC's Sarah Walton, who was also at the scene, said there were some pro-Remain campaign groups demonstrating in central London. ""But at the moment here, the majority are pro-Brexit supporters,"" she said, ""some of whom have been telling me that they were always planning on coming to London today, 29 March, but for a celebration to celebrate the day the UK would leave the EU."" ""People have been saying they have come here from all across the country. They are angry and frustrated. Some of the rally groups have said they plan to be here well into the evening."" Many protesters held flags - including both the Union Jack and England flag Other protesters donned Union Jack-themed wigs Some of the protesters wore hi-vis yellow vests, like those worn by the ""gilets jaunes"" anti-government rioters in Paris. Former black cab driver Colin Grostate, who was at the demonstration, said they were a ""symbol from France"", adding: ""We support the populism. ""Our politicians are not listening. Too many people are trying to stop what people voted for."" The Metropolitan Police said it had ""appropriate policing plans"" in place.

"Mike Ashley owns more than 60% of Sports Direct Sports Direct's Mike Ashley has lashed out after Debenhams bondholders cleared the way for a restructuring which could see shareholders' stakes wiped out. ""If there were any justice in the world the majority of the advisors would be put in prison,"" he said. Mr Ashley, who owns almost 30% of Debenhams, is vying to take control of the struggling department store chain. He wants to install himself as boss and take control in exchange for providing Debenhams with a much-needed loan. But on Thursday, a majority of the chain's bondholders voted to change the terms of some of their bonds, moving Debenhams closer to a Â£200m refinancing. ""Now the results of the vote are known... I think that if there were any justice in the world the majority of the advisors would be put in prison,"" said Mr Ashley. Accountancy and audit firm KPMG, which has been advising Debenhams, declined to comment. Shares in Debenhams, which had surged on Wednesday after Debenhams said it noted that Sports Direct was considering a Â£61.4m takeover offer, were down more than 25% at about 2p per share at the close of the markets on Thursday. Sports Direct said on Friday that it wasstill considering its Debenhams bid,external. Debenhams is expected to continue to favour either a debt-for-equity swap or a pre-pack administration - an insolvency procedure in which a firm arranges to sell its assets to a buyer before appointing administrators to facilitate the sale. Both options would lead to existing investors losing their holdings in the company. Sports Direct is the biggest Debenhams shareholder, with a 29.7% stake. Brandes Investment Partners, Odey Asset Management and retail conglomerate Landmark Group are also significant shareholders. A company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to speed up store closures and rent reductions could also be part of the plans, or come at a later stage.

"Mike Thalassitis' death sparked a conversation about reality TV and mental health ITV's chief executive Carolyn McCall has said the broadcaster cannot keep up the aftercare of Love Island contestants ""indefinitely"". There was criticism of the hit reality show following thedeath of Mike Thalassitis, who took part in 2017. ""We can do everything we possibly can to look after people and to do our duty of care but you can't do that forever,"" McCall said. ""There has got to be a framework and it will come to an end."" However, McCall said the broadcaster was changing its procedures to make sure counsellors do stay in contact with former contestants for longer. ""We will do much more in a much more structured way,"" she said. McCall also said making a link between what happened to Thalassitis and Love Island would be ""an extremely tenuous thing to do given how happy he was"" on the ITV2 show. ""All his mates have said that, and that he'd done two other reality programmes since then,"" she told the Broadcasting Press Guild on Thursday, Sophie Gradon, a Love Island contestant in 2016, died at the age of 32 last June The ITV boss also acknowledged the ""devastating""death of Sophie Gradonand revealed how ""tragic"" it was for the Love Island team because ""they know them as people and they become friends"". How do reality TV shows care for their stars? Love Island winner Dani Dyer has also given her views on the debate, saying many of her fellow contestants had experienced moments when they had been ""struggling"". ""It is tough going from literally being no-one then all of a sudden overnight coming out and being someone,"" she told ITV's Jonathan Ross Show. She said Thalassitis's death had been ""such a shock"" and ""absolutely devastating for everyone"". She added: ""It is difficult, you go from one extreme to the other and it's sad that it ended that way."" Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer won Love Island in 2018 Asked whether she felt she had been given access to help after her triumphant stint on the show, she said: ""Yes I have had that, I have 100% had that fully."" In an interview, which will be aired on Saturday, she also detailed the tests she had to go through before and after going into the villa, and said Love Island's psychologist told her to contact them whenever she needed to. Inan interview with GQ magazine,external, Josh Denzel, who was on Love Island with Dyer in 2018, said: ""I do feel like you kind of get thrown into the lion's den and if you survive then you're just free to enter the world again."" Denzel said there should be more focus on contestants after the fame starts to ""slow down"". He said: ""It's like, 'How do I transition to going back to just the guy or the girl that I was before?'"" Josh Denzel (far right) with his co-stars Jack Fowler and Adam Collard He and his co-stars such as Wes Nelson, Jack Fowler and Adam Collard have a Whatsapp group and all checked on each other after hearing the news about Thalassitis, he revealed. Speaking to BBC News earlier this month, Collard praised the team behind the show. ""I know they obviously want to make good TV but the main priority is always looking after you,"" he said. The 23-year-old revealed that before appearing on the show he was made aware by producers in advance how he was going to be portrayed and had a ""thorough"" psychiatric assessment. ""When I left the villa, the chaperone I lived with the week before I went in came to see me and we became good friends. ""Even when I broke up with my girlfriend, who I met on the show, I think I got a text or phone call from every single one of [the Love Island] team, including the runners and producers,"" he said. Following Thalassitis's death,ITV said,externalthe show's medical support would be independently reviewed, and that the production team would ""proactively"" check up on contestants after they had left the show. The statement also said ITV would deliver ""bespoke"" training to all future contestants to include social media and financial management.

"This video can not be played ""The secret to long life is to avoid dying"" says England's oldest man. Britain's two oldest men are marking their 111th birthdays. Alf Smith, from St Madoes, Perthshire, and Bob Weighton, from Alton, Hampshire, were both born on 29 March 1908. Mr Weighton, who grew up in Hull, said he had requested not to have a birthday card from the Queen in order to save public funds. The men have never met but have exchanged birthday cards in recent years. It is not known which of them was born first. Alf Smith spent much of his life in farming Mr Weighton is celebrating his birthday by officially launching his new book of poems, to raise funds for elderly people in Alton. He said he asked not to receive a royal birthday card because ""I do not see why the state should pay for the Queen to send out all these things. It's not a personal thing"". The former teacher and engineer has two sons and a daughter, 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. Bob Weighton was born in Hull and was one of seven children He said the world had changed ""enormously"" in his lifetime but people had mostly stayed the same. ""The basic concerns of human beings [are] exactly the same - 'can this person be trusted?'"" he added. He said Brexit was ""a total mess"", following Britain's failure to leave the European Union on his birthday. ""My own feeling is that if there were defects, and there were quite obviously defects, we can negotiate on the inside rather than walking off the field with the cricket ball and saying 'I'm not playing'."" Mr Weighton said the most common question he was asked was about the secret of his longevity. But his only advice on the matter was ""to avoid dying"", he said. Mr Weighton said he had asked to save public funds by not having a birthday card from the Queen The UK's other oldest man, Alf Smith was born in Invergowrie, in Perth and Kinross, and later farmed at Kinfauns where he raised two children, He and Mr Weighton both spent part of their lives in Canada. Asked for the secret of a long and happy life in a previous interview he said: ""Porridge is helpful and having a job you enjoy.""

"Mike Thalassitis' death sparked a conversation about reality TV and mental health ITV's chief executive Carolyn McCall has said the broadcaster cannot keep up the aftercare of Love Island contestants ""indefinitely"". There was criticism of the hit reality show following thedeath of Mike Thalassitis, who took part in 2017. ""We can do everything we possibly can to look after people and to do our duty of care but you can't do that forever,"" McCall said. ""There has got to be a framework and it will come to an end."" However, McCall said the broadcaster was changing its procedures to make sure counsellors do stay in contact with former contestants for longer. ""We will do much more in a much more structured way,"" she said. McCall also said making a link between what happened to Thalassitis and Love Island would be ""an extremely tenuous thing to do given how happy he was"" on the ITV2 show. ""All his mates have said that, and that he'd done two other reality programmes since then,"" she told the Broadcasting Press Guild on Thursday, Sophie Gradon, a Love Island contestant in 2016, died at the age of 32 last June The ITV boss also acknowledged the ""devastating""death of Sophie Gradonand revealed how ""tragic"" it was for the Love Island team because ""they know them as people and they become friends"". How do reality TV shows care for their stars? Love Island winner Dani Dyer has also given her views on the debate, saying many of her fellow contestants had experienced moments when they had been ""struggling"". ""It is tough going from literally being no-one then all of a sudden overnight coming out and being someone,"" she told ITV's Jonathan Ross Show. She said Thalassitis's death had been ""such a shock"" and ""absolutely devastating for everyone"". She added: ""It is difficult, you go from one extreme to the other and it's sad that it ended that way."" Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer won Love Island in 2018 Asked whether she felt she had been given access to help after her triumphant stint on the show, she said: ""Yes I have had that, I have 100% had that fully."" In an interview, which will be aired on Saturday, she also detailed the tests she had to go through before and after going into the villa, and said Love Island's psychologist told her to contact them whenever she needed to. Inan interview with GQ magazine,external, Josh Denzel, who was on Love Island with Dyer in 2018, said: ""I do feel like you kind of get thrown into the lion's den and if you survive then you're just free to enter the world again."" Denzel said there should be more focus on contestants after the fame starts to ""slow down"". He said: ""It's like, 'How do I transition to going back to just the guy or the girl that I was before?'"" Josh Denzel (far right) with his co-stars Jack Fowler and Adam Collard He and his co-stars such as Wes Nelson, Jack Fowler and Adam Collard have a Whatsapp group and all checked on each other after hearing the news about Thalassitis, he revealed. Speaking to BBC News earlier this month, Collard praised the team behind the show. ""I know they obviously want to make good TV but the main priority is always looking after you,"" he said. The 23-year-old revealed that before appearing on the show he was made aware by producers in advance how he was going to be portrayed and had a ""thorough"" psychiatric assessment. ""When I left the villa, the chaperone I lived with the week before I went in came to see me and we became good friends. ""Even when I broke up with my girlfriend, who I met on the show, I think I got a text or phone call from every single one of [the Love Island] team, including the runners and producers,"" he said. Following Thalassitis's death,ITV said,externalthe show's medical support would be independently reviewed, and that the production team would ""proactively"" check up on contestants after they had left the show. The statement also said ITV would deliver ""bespoke"" training to all future contestants to include social media and financial management.

"Whatever you think about Brexit - or even if you try not to think about it at all - we can probably all agree on one thing. It has gone on for a long, long time. We're more than 1,000 days on from when the UK voted to leave the European Union and it seems politicians are only just starting to enter the endgame. Maybe. The UK and the EU have now agreed on anextension to Brexituntil 31 October, here are five things that don't - or didn't - last as long as Brexit. ERROR: Metaphor not found Before it rose to international fame as the home ofthe backstop, Northern Ireland was legendary for many reasons. Among them, the construction of the Titanic. The mighty liner was built in Belfast - the keel was laid in 1909 and the ship launched just 26 months later - that's about 790 days. The Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in 1912. Similarly frozen and bigger than it appeared at first sight: the question of what happens to the Irish border in the future. The frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic will become the only land crossing between the UK and the EU - so there's huge controversy about what customs arrangements could be put in place. That, simply put, is the issue that's been stopping Theresa May's deal sailing through Parliament. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mars yesterday Distant, lonely, red. Thirty-five million miles away from the House of Commons. Sounds idyllic, doesn't it? When Mars and Earth are closest together, it should take around 300 days to fly between them. So since the referendum in 2016, you'd have had time to get there, harvest an entire crop of potatoes like Matt Damon and bring them home to make Mars mash for your friends. And here's something that sounds like a distant planet but isn't: MV3. That stands for Meaningful Vote 3: Theresa May's planned third attempt to get MPs to back her deal. She's promised that if they do, she'll go. Not to Mars, just out of her job as prime minister. ""He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes"" (said no-one about Brexit ever) Estimates vary, but all the events of the epic swords 'n' sorcery saga seem to take place over a period of around three or four years (around 1,100 - 1,400 days) And Brexit has packed in enough plot twists and backstabbing in the same timescale to make Lord Baelish look like a rank amateur. Allegiances have shifted, people have been double-crossed and deep-seated loyalties have been tested. Who will be sitting on the Iron Throne - and in 10 Downing Street - when the dust settles? Only one thing is certain: both battles are going to be messy. Wait, what? The average lifespan of a hamster is around three years (around 1,100 days) So countless hamsters have lived out their entire lives knowing nothing but endless Brexit negotiations. Just think of that. Fun fact: hamsters are immigrants. They were native to Syria and Turkey before being bred domestically. They've been with us a while now though, so like EU citizens already living here they should be fine to stay after Brexit. Who doesn't love Brexit in the springtime? How long does it take to build a proud, majestic symbol of national identity? Well, if you're French, around two years (a little more than 700 days). The Eiffel Tower was erected between 1887 and 1889. The tower was supposed to be dismantled after 20 years, but of course that never happened. Because, as Theresa May has discovered, plans can change. Especially where Europe is concerned. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

"Remainers and leavers alike have had their plans scuppered by the delay to Brexit The UK is no longer leaving the EU on 29 March. Brexit day has been postponed- to exactly when remains uncertain. But where does that leave the parties, merchandise and TV specials planned to mark the occasion? The government hadpromised a commemorative 50p cointo mark the UK's departure from the EU. The original design, announced in October, featured the phrase ""peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"", as well as the date of 29 March. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. No harm done, though, as the Treasury has confirmed that the coinshave not yet been minted.,external The department said a small number of trial coins had been produced, as is standard procedure at the Royal Mint, but this incurs no cost to the taxpayer. And a commemorative 50p will still be produced following the UK's departure from the EU, a spokesman confirmed. Those interested in buying one can register their interest on the Royal Mint website. The Lanark Print Co. has been making and selling Brexit-themed T-shirts for people on both sides of the debate for a while. One of its designs reads ""British Independence Day 29.03.2019"" - and it is still listed for sale on eBay. Will they be axing that design? No, says company manager John Douglas. ""We still sell 1986 World Cup ones,"" he says, adding that the shop will keep selling the Brexit date ones. And there won't be any of them ending up as reduced-to-clear, as, ""we only make them to order, we don't have any on the shelf"". Mr Douglas added that there's been a steady stream of orders, although their most popular design has been their ""citizen of Europe"" slogan, he said. Just under a fortnight ago, a group of pro-Brexit campaigners set off on a 270-mile march from Sunderland to London. Organised by the Leave Means Leave campaign, the marchers are due to end at a rally in Parliament Square on 29 March. The ""March to Leave"" was led through Nottinghamshire by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage But rather than a triumphant arrival to celebrate Brexit day, the group's co-chair, Richard Tice, said the event would now be a protest at the delay. ""The message is very much that democracy is dying in this country,"" he told the BBC. ""We should be leaving with no deal on 29 March."" Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: What could happen next? What preparations are being made for a no-deal? However, a ""Big Brexit Bash"" organised by the group will also still be going ahead, he said. But instead of a celebration, Mr Tice said the private party would now be ""a review of where we are and what needs to be done"". The ""Big Brexit Bash"" is being held at Millbank Tower in Westminster - the same venue where the Leave.EU campaign celebrated their victory on the night of the referendum in 2016 Lucy Harris, director of Leavers of Britain, a network of Brexit-supporters across the country, said it was still important to mark the date the UK was supposed to leave. Ms Harris said she would be joining the Leave Means Leave rally in London on Friday, while local branches of the group are still planning parties in cities across the country. ""We always knew there was a very high chance these events wouldn't actually be a celebration,"" she admitted. ""But it's still important to hold them so we can voice our concerns."" Lucy Harris says she wants to make sure Leave voters' concerns are heard on 29 March Landlady Louise Emery was one of those who had planned a party for 29 March at her pub in Doncaster - a town which voted 69% to leave - but has decided to cancel the event. ""We're not leaving on Friday so there isn't anything to celebrate anymore,"" she said. There have also been postponements on the other side of the Brexit debate. Group London Swedes, which is the largest community for Swedes in the UK and which supported remain in the EU referendum, had organised a ""tongue-in-cheek"" event called the UK's Leaving Drinks. The event on Facebook went viral, with 14,000 people registering interest and another 2,600 saying they would go. The event was later combined with another on Facebook, attracting interest from hundreds of thousands of people. But the event was postponed last week as uncertainty grew in Westminster about when the UK would actually leave. The new date for the event is 31 May. Charlotte Ãgren, founder of the group, said: ""The postponement of the event was not an easy decision - but we felt a bit strange going ahead with 'leaving drinks' on a date that isn't necessarily close to our actual departure date... or indeed if we're even going to leave at all."" Charlotte Ãgren, right, at one of the group's events last year, with colleague Alexia BergstrÃ¶m She added: ""We think it would be more fun to have it on the actual day. ""No one wants to be at home alone on that day grieving. We also noticed that the ticket sales didn't really move after the latest news about Brexit being postponed. ""This is understandable and it did affect our decision."" Other club nights appear to be going ahead. LGBT+ bar The Chateau in Camberwell, south London, is hosting an ""I Will Always Love EU"" club night on Saturday. Tickets have sold out, and organisers promise the event will be ""a safe space of zero political chat and maximum bangers all night long"". TV networks have also had to tweak their plans for the UK's exit, which was due to happen at 23:00 GMT. A copy of last week's Radio Times showed that two BBC News specials had been planned - one from 21:30 and another after the News at 10. But a later schedule, on Sky's TV guide, shows that those specials have now been scrapped. EastEnders and the Masterchef final have both been shunted back by half an hour, and a repeat episode of Would I Lie to You also been added to the schedule. And the Friday night film, Sliding Doors, has been brought forward to start an hour earlier - covering the time the UK was initially scheduled to leave the UK. What film is better to mark the moment when the UK could have left the EU than Sliding Doors, the story of one British woman's (Gwyneth Paltrow) two parallel storylines Meanwhile, Channel 4 comedy panel show The Last Leg has a problem of its own. In the last episode, filmed after the Brexit delay had been announced, host Adam Hills told viewers: ""It's ruined our plans as well. ""We started this series thinking we were counting down to our final episode coinciding with Britain leaving the EU. ""We were even finishing at 11pm next week which is the moment Britain was going to leave."" The team had come up with an alternative plan for the show - which they called the ""backstop"" - to instead celebrate model Elle Macpherson's birthday instead. (She turns 55 on Friday). But, as Adam Hills said: ""Unfortunately much like Brexit, we didn't check whether we could do this before saying we would. Turns out, Elle Macpherson is not available next week."" But the clear winners from the Brexit delay could be those hoping for a holiday soon. The uncertainty over whether the UK would be leaving the EU without a deal had led to fears that there could be travel disruption after 29 March. Emma Coulthurst, from travel comparison site TravelSupermarket, said this meant some people had put off booking holidays soon after that date, meaning there are some last-minute bargains up for grabs in April. She said package holidays to destinations, including Ibiza, Majorca, Portugal and Corfu were ""much more affordable"" this year and available at prices which were ""virtually unheard of"" for the school holiday period. Ms Coulthurst said other factors - including renewed competition from destinations like Egypt and Turkey - could also be at play. And while there is no longer a risk of the UK leaving with no deal on 29 March, this could still happen at a later date. Brexit: A really simple guide What happens after Brexit?

"This video can not be played Theresa May: The rejection of the EU withdrawal agreement will have ""grave"" implications MPs have rejected Theresa Mayâs EU withdrawal agreement on the day the UK was due to leave the EU. The government lost by 344 votes to 286, a margin of 58, and means the UK has missed an EU deadline to delay Brexit to 22 May and leave with a deal. The prime minister said the UK would have to find ""an alternative way forward"", which was ""almost certain"" to involve holding European elections. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said ""this deal now has to change"" or the PM must quit. Meanwhile, thousands of Leave supportersgathered outside Parliamentto protest against the delay to Brexit, bringing traffic to a standstill. Brexit: What happens next? Long Brexit delay depends on UK - Varadkar Business 'devastated' by Brexit vote Mrs May now has until 12 April to seek a longer extension to the negotiation process to avoid a no-deal Brexit on that date. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  With a clear majority in the Commons against a no-deal Brexit, and with MPs holding more votes on alternative plans on Monday, Mrs May said that the UK would have to find ""an alternative way forward"". The prime minister said that the outcome was ""a matter of profound regret"", adding that ""I fear we are reaching the limits of this process in this House"". Downing Street said it was still not an ""inevitability"" that the UK would have to take part in elections to the European Parliament in May. It is highly likely that at least for another couple of weeks, Theresa May will look through every nook and cranny in Parliament to see if there is a way for her deal to pass through - somehow. But that's a decision taken in the bunker, and the walls are closing in. There is little reason tonight to think that, in the end, the burning core of Euroscepticism in the Tory Party will ever accept her deal. There are few signs that any more than a handful of Labour MPs are really going to take the plunge and ultimately walk through the same lobbies as Theresa May, and Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith. The prime minister concluded today that our political process is reaching its limits. But maybe soon it will be her leadership, her deal, that has passed its limits. A No 10 source indicated that the prime minister would continue to seek support in the Commons for her deal. ""Clearly it was not the result we wanted. But, that said, we have had a number of senior Conservative colleagues who have felt able to vote with the government today. They have done so in higher numbers than previously,"" the source said. ""Clearly there is more work to do. We are at least going in the right direction."" Downing Street said Mrs May would continue to talk to the Democratic Unionist Party about more reassurances over theIrish backstop, which it says risks splitting Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. But the DUP's leader at Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, told the BBC's Newsnight political editor Nick Watt: ""I would stay in the European Union and remain, rather than risk Northern Ireland's position. That's how strongly I feel about the Union."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This deal now has to change"" Responding to the vote, European Council President Donald Tusk tweeted: ""In view of the rejection of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons, I have decided to call a European Council on 10 April."" In a statement, the European Commission said the UK would have to ""indicate a way forward"" by 12 April ""for consideration by the European Council"". ""A 'no-deal' scenario on 12 April is now a likely scenario. The EU has been preparing for this since December 2017 and is now fully prepared for a 'no-deal' scenario at midnight on 12 April. The EU will remain united,"" the statement said. ""The benefits of the withdrawal agreement, including a transition period, will in no circumstances be replicated in a 'no-deal' scenario. Sectoral mini-deals are not an option."" Despite all the drama, the money and time spent by EU leaders on Brexit (summits, dedicated governmental departments, no-deal planning) and all the hard, hard graft put in by the EU and UK negotiating teams, Europe's leaders are asking themselves what there is to show for it all. Ongoing Brexit divisions in Parliament, in government and in Theresa May's cabinet were on screaming technicolour display again last week. EU leaders used to use the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic (as did the UK). They now believe it to be a very real prospect. That has led to a number of countries - notably France - questioning the logic of delaying Brexit for much longer. They wonder if the UK will ever unite around a Brexit Way Forward - be it a softer Brexit, no deal or no Brexit. Would a Brexit extension, allowing for a general election or a second referendum, really settle the issue, they ask? Read Katya's blog in full Monday, 1 April:MPs hold another set of votes on various Brexit options to see if they can agree on a way forward Wednesday, 3 April:Potentially another round of so-called ""indicative votes"" Wednesday, 10 April: Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday, 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek/EU does not grant further delay 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections This video can not be played The result is announced as MPs vote by 286 to 344 to reject the governmentâs withdrawal agreement Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The House has been clear, this deal now has to change. ""There has to be an alternative found. And if the prime minister can't accept that then she must go, not at an indeterminate date in the future but now. ""So that we can decide the future of this country through a general election."" Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the European Research Group of Brexiteer Conservatives, said it was time for Mrs May to quit. ""This must be the final defeat for Theresa May's deal. It's finished. And we must move on. ""It has not passed. It will not pass. I regret to say it is time for Theresa May to follow through on her words and make way so that a new leader can deliver a withdrawal agreement which will be passed by Parliament."" Mr Baker was one of 34 Conservative rebels to vote against the agreement, along with the Democratic Unionist Party and the Labour Party. Five Labour MPs voted for the agreement. A number of high profile Tory Brexiteers, including Dominic Raab and Iain Duncan Smith, did vote for the agreement, but it was not enough to prevent another damaging defeat for Mrs May, who had offered to stand down to persuade her critics to back the deal. This was not a third ""meaningful vote"" on the PM's EU deal, which also includes a political declaration on future relations between the UK and the EU, and which has previously been rejected by larger margins. By holding a vote on the withdrawal agreement only, the government had hoped to secure a short delay to Brexit and avoid the UK taking part in May's European elections. MPs are set to have another go at reaching a Brexit compromise in another series of votes on Monday and Wednesday next week. If one of the options receives a majority, the government could use it as a basis for negotiating changes to the political declaration.

"Whatever you think about Brexit - or even if you try not to think about it at all - we can probably all agree on one thing. It has gone on for a long, long time. We're more than 1,000 days on from when the UK voted to leave the European Union and it seems politicians are only just starting to enter the endgame. Maybe. The UK and the EU have now agreed on anextension to Brexituntil 31 October, here are five things that don't - or didn't - last as long as Brexit. ERROR: Metaphor not found Before it rose to international fame as the home ofthe backstop, Northern Ireland was legendary for many reasons. Among them, the construction of the Titanic. The mighty liner was built in Belfast - the keel was laid in 1909 and the ship launched just 26 months later - that's about 790 days. The Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in 1912. Similarly frozen and bigger than it appeared at first sight: the question of what happens to the Irish border in the future. The frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic will become the only land crossing between the UK and the EU - so there's huge controversy about what customs arrangements could be put in place. That, simply put, is the issue that's been stopping Theresa May's deal sailing through Parliament. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Mars yesterday Distant, lonely, red. Thirty-five million miles away from the House of Commons. Sounds idyllic, doesn't it? When Mars and Earth are closest together, it should take around 300 days to fly between them. So since the referendum in 2016, you'd have had time to get there, harvest an entire crop of potatoes like Matt Damon and bring them home to make Mars mash for your friends. And here's something that sounds like a distant planet but isn't: MV3. That stands for Meaningful Vote 3: Theresa May's planned third attempt to get MPs to back her deal. She's promised that if they do, she'll go. Not to Mars, just out of her job as prime minister. ""He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes"" (said no-one about Brexit ever) Estimates vary, but all the events of the epic swords 'n' sorcery saga seem to take place over a period of around three or four years (around 1,100 - 1,400 days) And Brexit has packed in enough plot twists and backstabbing in the same timescale to make Lord Baelish look like a rank amateur. Allegiances have shifted, people have been double-crossed and deep-seated loyalties have been tested. Who will be sitting on the Iron Throne - and in 10 Downing Street - when the dust settles? Only one thing is certain: both battles are going to be messy. Wait, what? The average lifespan of a hamster is around three years (around 1,100 days) So countless hamsters have lived out their entire lives knowing nothing but endless Brexit negotiations. Just think of that. Fun fact: hamsters are immigrants. They were native to Syria and Turkey before being bred domestically. They've been with us a while now though, so like EU citizens already living here they should be fine to stay after Brexit. Who doesn't love Brexit in the springtime? How long does it take to build a proud, majestic symbol of national identity? Well, if you're French, around two years (a little more than 700 days). The Eiffel Tower was erected between 1887 and 1889. The tower was supposed to be dismantled after 20 years, but of course that never happened. Because, as Theresa May has discovered, plans can change. Especially where Europe is concerned. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

"Remainers and leavers alike have had their plans scuppered by the delay to Brexit The UK is no longer leaving the EU on 29 March. Brexit day has been postponed- to exactly when remains uncertain. But where does that leave the parties, merchandise and TV specials planned to mark the occasion? The government hadpromised a commemorative 50p cointo mark the UK's departure from the EU. The original design, announced in October, featured the phrase ""peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"", as well as the date of 29 March. Allow Twitter content?

No harm done, though, as the Treasury has confirmed that the coinshave not yet been minted.,external The department said a small number of trial coins had been produced, as is standard procedure at the Royal Mint, but this incurs no cost to the taxpayer. And a commemorative 50p will still be produced following the UK's departure from the EU, a spokesman confirmed. Those interested in buying one can register their interest on the Royal Mint website. The Lanark Print Co. has been making and selling Brexit-themed T-shirts for people on both sides of the debate for a while. One of its designs reads ""British Independence Day 29.03.2019"" - and it is still listed for sale on eBay. Will they be axing that design? No, says company manager John Douglas. ""We still sell 1986 World Cup ones,"" he says, adding that the shop will keep selling the Brexit date ones. And there won't be any of them ending up as reduced-to-clear, as, ""we only make them to order, we don't have any on the shelf"". Mr Douglas added that there's been a steady stream of orders, although their most popular design has been their ""citizen of Europe"" slogan, he said. Just under a fortnight ago, a group of pro-Brexit campaigners set off on a 270-mile march from Sunderland to London. Organised by the Leave Means Leave campaign, the marchers are due to end at a rally in Parliament Square on 29 March. The ""March to Leave"" was led through Nottinghamshire by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage But rather than a triumphant arrival to celebrate Brexit day, the group's co-chair, Richard Tice, said the event would now be a protest at the delay. ""The message is very much that democracy is dying in this country,"" he told the BBC. ""We should be leaving with no deal on 29 March."" Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: What could happen next? What preparations are being made for a no-deal? However, a ""Big Brexit Bash"" organised by the group will also still be going ahead, he said. But instead of a celebration, Mr Tice said the private party would now be ""a review of where we are and what needs to be done"". The ""Big Brexit Bash"" is being held at Millbank Tower in Westminster - the same venue where the Leave.EU campaign celebrated their victory on the night of the referendum in 2016 Lucy Harris, director of Leavers of Britain, a network of Brexit-supporters across the country, said it was still important to mark the date the UK was supposed to leave. Ms Harris said she would be joining the Leave Means Leave rally in London on Friday, while local branches of the group are still planning parties in cities across the country. ""We always knew there was a very high chance these events wouldn't actually be a celebration,"" she admitted. ""But it's still important to hold them so we can voice our concerns."" Lucy Harris says she wants to make sure Leave voters' concerns are heard on 29 March Landlady Louise Emery was one of those who had planned a party for 29 March at her pub in Doncaster - a town which voted 69% to leave - but has decided to cancel the event. ""We're not leaving on Friday so there isn't anything to celebrate anymore,"" she said. There have also been postponements on the other side of the Brexit debate. Group London Swedes, which is the largest community for Swedes in the UK and which supported remain in the EU referendum, had organised a ""tongue-in-cheek"" event called the UK's Leaving Drinks. The event on Facebook went viral, with 14,000 people registering interest and another 2,600 saying they would go. The event was later combined with another on Facebook, attracting interest from hundreds of thousands of people. But the event was postponed last week as uncertainty grew in Westminster about when the UK would actually leave. The new date for the event is 31 May. Charlotte Ãgren, founder of the group, said: ""The postponement of the event was not an easy decision - but we felt a bit strange going ahead with 'leaving drinks' on a date that isn't necessarily close to our actual departure date... or indeed if we're even going to leave at all."" Charlotte Ãgren, right, at one of the group's events last year, with colleague Alexia BergstrÃ¶m She added: ""We think it would be more fun to have it on the actual day. ""No one wants to be at home alone on that day grieving. We also noticed that the ticket sales didn't really move after the latest news about Brexit being postponed. ""This is understandable and it did affect our decision."" Other club nights appear to be going ahead. LGBT+ bar The Chateau in Camberwell, south London, is hosting an ""I Will Always Love EU"" club night on Saturday. Tickets have sold out, and organisers promise the event will be ""a safe space of zero political chat and maximum bangers all night long"". TV networks have also had to tweak their plans for the UK's exit, which was due to happen at 23:00 GMT. A copy of last week's Radio Times showed that two BBC News specials had been planned - one from 21:30 and another after the News at 10. But a later schedule, on Sky's TV guide, shows that those specials have now been scrapped. EastEnders and the Masterchef final have both been shunted back by half an hour, and a repeat episode of Would I Lie to You also been added to the schedule. And the Friday night film, Sliding Doors, has been brought forward to start an hour earlier - covering the time the UK was initially scheduled to leave the UK. What film is better to mark the moment when the UK could have left the EU than Sliding Doors, the story of one British woman's (Gwyneth Paltrow) two parallel storylines Meanwhile, Channel 4 comedy panel show The Last Leg has a problem of its own. In the last episode, filmed after the Brexit delay had been announced, host Adam Hills told viewers: ""It's ruined our plans as well. ""We started this series thinking we were counting down to our final episode coinciding with Britain leaving the EU. ""We were even finishing at 11pm next week which is the moment Britain was going to leave."" The team had come up with an alternative plan for the show - which they called the ""backstop"" - to instead celebrate model Elle Macpherson's birthday instead. (She turns 55 on Friday). But, as Adam Hills said: ""Unfortunately much like Brexit, we didn't check whether we could do this before saying we would. Turns out, Elle Macpherson is not available next week."" But the clear winners from the Brexit delay could be those hoping for a holiday soon. The uncertainty over whether the UK would be leaving the EU without a deal had led to fears that there could be travel disruption after 29 March. Emma Coulthurst, from travel comparison site TravelSupermarket, said this meant some people had put off booking holidays soon after that date, meaning there are some last-minute bargains up for grabs in April. She said package holidays to destinations, including Ibiza, Majorca, Portugal and Corfu were ""much more affordable"" this year and available at prices which were ""virtually unheard of"" for the school holiday period. Ms Coulthurst said other factors - including renewed competition from destinations like Egypt and Turkey - could also be at play. And while there is no longer a risk of the UK leaving with no deal on 29 March, this could still happen at a later date. Brexit: A really simple guide What happens after Brexit?

"Protesters outside Parkfield Community School said lessons on same-sex relationships were not age appropriate People who identify as LGBT say they have ""never felt more vulnerable"" in Birmingham, following protests against same-sex relationship education. Some Muslim parents have been protesting since January against the No Outsiders programme at Parkfield Community School in Alum Rock. A West Midlands Police officer said the protests did not constitute a hate crime despite coming ""very close"". Some members of the LGBT community were critical of the protests' policing. This video can not be played Saima Razzaq from equality campaign Supporting Education of Equality and Diversity in Schools, or 'SEEDS' More than 100 people attended an open meeting on Thursday in Birmingham's gay village, the majority of whom agreed they felt increasingly threatened, anxious and frightened. Birmingham LGBT said it had recorded a rise in hate crime. However, Insp Matt Crowley said protests outside Parkfield school did not constitute a crime, despite coming ""very close to that line"". He said policing ""hadn't been perfect"" but the force took hate crime ""very seriously"". Deputy head teacher Andrew Moffat said the school was ""simply teaching children about different families"" For several weeks, parents, mostly of Muslim faith, have been calling on the school to scrap the programme that teaches children about same sex couples through story books.

Ann Sawyer and Saima Razzaq have organised meetings with some of the parents as part of the Supporting Education of Equality and Diversity in Schools, or 'SEEDS', campaign, which was set up in response to the protests. Ms Sawyer said:  ""Hate comes from ignorance and we've been trying to dispel that ignorance by sharing our lives."" ""Clearly there were bigots, but it's pitting two marginalised communities against each other,"" Ms Razzaq added. ""Conversations are just starting, it's going to take many years."" At one protest, Fatima Shah spoke on behalf of the protesters, saying: ""Our children, our choice"" Four other Birmingham schools have also stopped teaching No Outsidersfollowing complaints by parents. The city's Anderton Park Primary School - which does not teach the programme - was the scene of a ninth day of protests on Thursday by parents concerned about the teaching of LGBT issues.

Here's what today has meant for the Brexit process:  BBC News Channel BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says there is lots more talk in Westminster tonight about a possible general election. ""Thereâs a recognition that thereâs a lot of weariness about
the potential trip to a polling station,"" he says. But he says that ""Parliament is running out of road â the prime minister used
language to that effect today"". Some MPs have suggested that the prime minister should consider her position. But Mr Mason says: ""Her character would suggest that she would want to see this
through to some conclusion."" While it might be a ""tall order"" for her to get her deal through now, she may wait until ""the point where she has self-evidently failed to do that and the UK ends up committed to a long delay"" after 12 April. If she does eventually trigger a leadership contest, a new leader ""could seek a new mandate and try to get themselves a majority â and then we would be heading for another general election"".

Followingthe government's latest setback, it is no clearer when Brexit will happen. The UK faces a deadline of 12 April to come up with a way forward. By that point, the UK must have approved any deal or decided whether it wants to leave without a deal, which Parliament has said no to, or is prepared to delay Brexit by a much longer period, potentially into next year. The EU is planning an emergency summit on 10 April to discuss its next move. So where does the process go from here? Read more here Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor If we know one thing about the prime minister it is that she does not give up, even when it seems that seems the obvious or rational choice. Parliament has rejected her deal three times now - a reality that would have finished off many previous administrations and leaders. Whether that is foolhardy and stubborn, or admirably resilient, it is highly likely that at least for another couple of weeks, Theresa May will look through every nook and cranny in Parliament to see if there is a way for her deal to pass through - somehow. But that's a decision taken in the bunker, and the walls are closing in. Read the full story Katya AdlerEurope Editor The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says today's vote is ""no great surprise"" to European leaders. She says the mood in Brussels is of ""resignation"" and ""defensiveness"", with ""the EU wanting to protect itself
from any future Brexit fallout"". The UK leaving without a deal is seen as an ""increasingly likely prospect"" by leaders such as Emmanuel Macron. ""Thatâs why he and other European leaders are questioning
whether it makes sense to delay Brexit for that much longer. They look at all
the divisions in Parliament, in government, in cabinet, and they wonder if the UK
will ever unite around Brexit,"" Adler says. She says that doesn't mean they would say no, but there would be ""very heated discussion among EU
leaders as to whether to extend, what for and for how long"". One thing they are certain about is that the UK would need to take part in EU elections for a longer extension, she says. That's because the UK would remain an EU member, and the European Parliament's legality could be questioned if all members are not represented.

Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve says Theresa May's deal is now off the table - and it's down to Parliament to resolve the deadlock. The Tory MP tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""There has to be a reset of all this.  There has to be a plan B. ""If we are to leave the European Union, it's got to be on some very different terms. ""It's clear that the House of Commons has been working in the last week to try and identify a way forward which might provide an alternative to the prime minister's ideas of Brexit, and we certainly need to take that forward next week."" He adds that what they are debating is ""utterly different"" to the 2016 referendum and any decision should be put to a public vote. Allow Twitter content?

Vote Leave was fined Â£61,000and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law. The watchdog said it exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. Vote Leave previously said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent There's a bad moon rising over Westminster. Friday's latest government defeat on Brexit may have been by a lower margin than the earlier thrashings, but the convincing 58-vote majority against the EU withdrawal agreement, in the teeth of an all-out whipping operation, hardly suggests that one more heave will see it home. The result looks set to trigger a political chain reaction. And with the prime minister having signalled her departure, albeit making contingent on getting her deal passed, a variety of parliamentary events will become auditions for the contenders for her job. Sajid Javid has Home Office questions on Monday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is up on Tuesday and Andrea Leadsom has her weekly Business Questions outing on Thursday. Other parliamentary events, not least around Brexit, will provide plenty of opportunities for other contenders. Here's Mark's rundown of the week ahead. Former Labour MP Chris Leslie, who is part of the Independent Group, says he supports calls for another public vote - but not a general election. He tells the BBC News Channel: ""If you think that Brexit is complicated, just throw a general election in here to completely throw everything into chaos.  Let's get a grip of this situation. ""There is a route out of it.  The prime minister's deal could go back to the public. ""We could put a customs union, single market back to the public. Ultimately we have to give people the chance to look at this and say do we want to proceed or think again?"" Continuing his speech, ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said: ""This is about our whole system of democracy. ""This is about the bond of trust that needs to exist between the people and those, the governors. ""This is about who we are as a nation. Where our standing is in the world. ""And frankly, I believe that what's happened over there, has not just turned this day that should've been one of great celebration into a day that history will mark as a day of great betrayal, I believe that what's happened over the course of two years is actually one of the saddest and worst chapters in the history of our nation."" He added: ""What they want is for us to go away. Am I downcast, am I disheartened? No. I am more determined."" The crowd broke out in chants of ""Nigel! Nigel! Nigel!"" To music and loud cheers, former UKIP leader and Brexiteer Nigel Farage appeared on stage at the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square. ""It's brave of you to come,"" he told demonstrators. ""Because I sense, being in Westminster, that we are in enemy territory. ""There are hundreds of people just over the street that have treated that referendum and those who voted for it with total and utter contempt of the past three years."" Referring to Theresa May's Brexit deal, Mr Farage called it ""dreadful"" and said he did not spend 25 years campaigning to come out of the EU to see the UK ""signed up to another"" EU treaty. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent The big question everyone is asking is whether the prime
ministerâs deal is dead after this third defeat. Of course, opposition MPs certainly think that it is. But
does she have a plan to bring it back again? There is speculation about maybe some kind of run-off
between her proposal and whatever MPs come up with and coalesce around on
Monday. But weâll have to wait and see. Itâs certainly been an incredibly divisive process - particularly for the Conservative Party. UKIP leader Gerard Batten addressed pro-Brexit supporters on Whitehall after Tommy Robinson. Mr Batten told the crowds: ""As of now we
do not know when we are going to leave the European Union. ""Theresa May has had, for the third
time, her not-really-leaving deal rejected by Parliament."" He added: ""What we do know is that
if we do not leave the EU it will mark the end of democracy in the UK."" Mr Batten also said, to cheers from the crowd, that UKIP was the ""only major political party that actually wants Britain to leave the
EU"". Conservative MP Mark Francois was introduced as a ""massive, massive Brexiteer"" when he took to the stage at the protest organised by campaign group Leave Means Leave. Greeted by a cheering crowd, Mr Francois read out the first part of the poem If by Rudyard Kipling. ""I read it again the other night, and it could have been written for the ERG over the last year,"" he tells the demo, referring to the pro-Brexit European Research Group. ""If you can keep your head when all about youAre losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,But make allowance for their doubting too."" He added: ""Three times this wretched deal has been voted down by the House of Commons. ""Prime minister, which bit of 'no, no, no' don't you understand?"" Tory MPs tweet... Allow Twitter content?

"It won't be third time lucky, or unlucky for the prime minister when she puts part of her deal back to MPs. But what Number 10 is asking for is Parliament to give her backing for Meaningful Vote 2.5. Theresa May knows that the Commons is not yet ready to accept her deal in its entirety.

Brexit: MPs asked to vote on withdrawal agreement only Brexit: What could happen next? What are MPs doing on Friday? But the vote, on what was meant to be Brexit Day, is a request to MPs to allow her to keep going, to carry on pursuing her route, with its well-documented flaws. There's a challenge there too, not just to her own Brexiteers but to Labour and the other opposition parties, to say ""no"" to a long delay to our departure from the EU, the last moment when Number 10 believes anything even approaching a timely exit can be guaranteed. There are signs now that many Eurosceptic MPs are ready to say ""yes"" - not because they suddenly have realised Mrs May's deal is perfect, but because more of them officially realise that it is the clearest break from the EU they can realistically hope for.

Labour, even though they have sometimes accepted that what's on the table - the divorce deal - will never be unpicked by the EU, will still, in the main, resist. As things stand, even though some influential Brexiteers believe there is a chance it will get through, it looks like the prime minister is heading for another loss.

"Attorney General Geoffrey Cox opened Friday's Brexit debate Today should have been the day the UK officially left the EU. But Parliament still hasn't come to an agreement on the best way forward for Brexit. On Thursday, the Commons Leader, Andrea Leadsom, revealed the government would give MPs another vote. But what on this time? Here is what we know... The government tabled a motion to be debated in the Commons on Friday about Brexit. But unlike previous occasions, where MPs have been talking about the entirety of Theresa May's deal, this time it is just the one of two elements. This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom explains the timetable for Friday's Brexit vote Part one is the withdrawal agreement - the legally binding document that sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. This includes a settlement, details of a transition period for after we leave and protections for citizens' rights. It also includes the controversial backstop, or the insurance policy that aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. Part two is the political declaration - non-legally binding document that outlines plans for the future relationship between the UK and the bloc after exit day. The government will only put part one - the withdrawal agreement - to the Commons for a vote. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Mrs May has put her whole deal to Parliament twice in what were called ""meaningful votes"" to secure her deal, but both times her plan has been voted down by historic margins. After it became clear the government would not be able to pass the deal and complete all the legislation by the original Brexit date of 29 March - today - Mrs May asked the EU for an extension. They said that if the withdrawal agreement was agreed by MPs by 29 March, the UK could then have until 22 May to sort out the paperwork. If not, the UK would only have until 12 April to come up with an alternative or face leaving the EU without a deal. Theresa May has put her deal to Parliament twice - and lost Then the Speaker, John Bercow, warned the government they could not bring back the deal for a third meaningful vote unless it had changed substantially - seen by some as torpedoing a quick return to the Commons. Ministers have been trying to win MPs over to back the deal and this culminated in Mrs May offering to resign to allow someone else to lead the next set of negotiations with the EU - on the proviso they voted for it when it came back to the House. By splitting the withdrawal agreement from the political declaration, the government would adhere to the rules set out by the EU of agreeing that section by the 29 March - meaning the extension of 22 May would stand. MPs only sit on a Friday to debate private members' bills - but they more usually use the day to carry out work in their constituencies. But they are sitting today for this debate and vote. Proceedings began at 09:30 GMT, with votes expected at about 14:30 GMT. Andrea Leadsom announced plans for Friday in the Commons The government has tabled a motion on the withdrawal agreement to allow MPs to debate it. It is an amendable motion, which allowed MPs to put forward their own changes to it. Three amendments were tabled - on revoking Article 50, giving Parliament more say over the future relationship and giving the devolved legislatures in Scotland and Wales a say over future Brexit policy - but none of those were chosen for debate by the Speaker. Once the debate is finished, MPs will vote on the motion itself. If MPs approve the withdrawal agreement on Friday, they will have met the requirements to push exit day back to 22 May. But under current law, it would not be enough to ratify the whole deal because only one part would be approved. The government would either have to pass part two of the deal - the political declaration on the future relationship - at a later date, or change the law so that it is not needed to ratify the treaty. If the withdrawal agreement does not get approved, ministers will have until 12 April - the date by which the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the European Parliament elections in May - to ""indicate a way forward"". The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the choices will be leaving without a deal or a having a longer extension - involving taking part in the elections. It would also be expected that the EU would hold an emergency summit to decide if the conditions for a longer delay are met.

"The withdrawal agreement is 585 pages long, while the political declaration is just 26 pages MPs have rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal for a third time. The government lost by 344 votes to 286, a majority of 58. But on this occasion there was a key difference: MPs only voted on the withdrawal agreement and not the political declaration. Previously, both of these were voted on and rejected. So, what are they? This is the deal the UK government negotiated with the European Union, over 18 months, and it sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU. First published in November, it is almost 600 pages long,externaland some of the key areas it covers are: The transition Under the withdrawal agreement, the UK would enter into a 21-month transition period with the EU after Brexit. During this time the UK would continue to follow EU rules and remain in the single market and customs union to allow frictionless trade to continue. The UK would also lose membership of EU institutions. The transition period could be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Money This is known as ""the divorce bill"" - the amount of money the UK would need to pay the EU to settle its obligations. Although no figure appears in the document, it is expected that the UK would pay at least Â£39bn over a number of years. The Irish backstop The most controversial part of the withdrawal agreement is the Irish backstop, which has proved to be the main reason it cannot command a majority in Parliament. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The backstop is the insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland after Brexit. It would kick in at the end of the transition period in the event that a comprehensive trade deal, that avoids the needs for checks at the Irish border, is not reached between the UK and EU. The terms of the backstop would effectively place the UK into a temporary customs union with the EU. Critics worry that the UK could find itself trapped in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to pursue its own independent trade policy (signing trade deals with countries like the US). Citizens' rights During the transition period, UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would retain their residency and welfare rights after Brexit. The withdrawal agreement also allows citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK, of course) to be allowed to stay in that country after the transition. Brexit withdrawal agreement: what it all means? The political declaration - also published in November - is all about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, after Brexit. This document,externalis far shorter (just 26 pages) and, unlike the withdrawal agreement, it is not legally binding. Some of the keys areas it covers are: Trade The document calls on the trading relationship to be ""as close as possible"" and says there would be an ""ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced"" economic partnership. But it does not a set out what the final outcome for UK-EU trade will look like. Customs The political declaration refers to an ""ambitious customs arrangement"". The concern, from some, is that this could turn into a permanent arrangement that could prevent the UK from pursuing its own independent trade policy. The government dismisses this concern, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future. Irish border Technology and other alterative arrangements would be considered in order to keep the Irish border open with no physical infrastructure (eg border posts). However, presently, there is no border which the EU shares with a non-EU country that is entirely open and frictionless. Can technology solve the Irish border problem? Freedom of movement The UK, according to the document, would take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK (and UK citizens to the EU) would come to an end. The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays.

The Arizona Department of Public Safety said it was investigating a crash on Interstate 10 at 01:00 local time (08:00 GMT) on Wednesday, but could not confirm the identity of four people killed. A spokesman said the release of information about the crash would be delayed as a result of ""almost all evidence being lost in the fire"". ""The bodies are not identifiable and we are relying on the Medical Examiner's office to help with positive identification,"" added the spokesman.

"Brian McConnachie QC represented child killer Aaron Campbell during the nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow The lawyer who represented child killer Aaron Campbell says he is grateful for the comments of the trial judge who commended his professionalism.

But when the schoolboy returned to the dock to be sentenced last week it emerged he had finally admitted the rape and murder. Aaron Campbell will spend a minimum of 27 years in prison and has been warned he may never be released Sentencing Campbell, Lord Matthews highlighted the role of the defence during the distressing case.

"This video can not be played ""The secret to long life is to avoid dying"" says England's oldest man. Britain's two oldest men are marking their 111th birthdays. Alf Smith, from St Madoes, Perthshire, and Bob Weighton, from Alton, Hampshire, were both born on 29 March 1908. Mr Weighton, who grew up in Hull, said he had requested not to have a birthday card from the Queen in order to save public funds. The men have never met but have exchanged birthday cards in recent years. It is not known which of them was born first. Alf Smith spent much of his life in farming Mr Weighton is celebrating his birthday by officially launching his new book of poems, to raise funds for elderly people in Alton. He said he asked not to receive a royal birthday card because ""I do not see why the state should pay for the Queen to send out all these things. It's not a personal thing"". The former teacher and engineer has two sons and a daughter, 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. Bob Weighton was born in Hull and was one of seven children He said the world had changed ""enormously"" in his lifetime but people had mostly stayed the same. ""The basic concerns of human beings [are] exactly the same - 'can this person be trusted?'"" he added. He said Brexit was ""a total mess"", following Britain's failure to leave the European Union on his birthday. ""My own feeling is that if there were defects, and there were quite obviously defects, we can negotiate on the inside rather than walking off the field with the cricket ball and saying 'I'm not playing'."" Mr Weighton said the most common question he was asked was about the secret of his longevity. But his only advice on the matter was ""to avoid dying"", he said. Mr Weighton said he had asked to save public funds by not having a birthday card from the Queen The UK's other oldest man, Alf Smith was born in Invergowrie, in Perth and Kinross, and later farmed at Kinfauns where he raised two children, He and Mr Weighton both spent part of their lives in Canada. Asked for the secret of a long and happy life in a previous interview he said: ""Porridge is helpful and having a job you enjoy.""

"As well as being a journalist, Jill Dando presented series such as travel programme Holiday The detective who led the inquiry into Jill Dando's murder has told the BBC her case will never be solved. Hamish Campbell told a documentary to mark 20 years since the newsreader's shooting: ""Do I think somebody will come back to court? Probably not, no."" His team arrested Barry George in 2000, one year after Dando, 37, was killed on her doorstep in Fulham, west London. Mr George was convicted of murder and spent eight years in jail, before being acquitted at a retrial and released. In the second trial, the jury accepted that one particle of gunshot residue found in the pocket of a coat police retrieved from Mr George's house was insufficient to place him at the scene of the murder. It had been the key forensic evidence relied on by detectives. Dando documentary to mark anniversary Jill Dando: The golden girl of TV,external Why Dando murder remains unsolved,external Ms Dando was a popular presenter of programmes such as the Six O'Clock News, Breakfast News, Crimewatch and Holiday. The BBC has said ""previously unseen archive and photographs"" will feature in the documentary, alongside interviews with Jill's colleagues, friends and family members. The film reveals the decision-making behind the scenes of the murder inquiry. Mr Campbell told the programme that senior officers were pressing him on the likelihood of the case being resolved. ""Sometimes I felt we were a day away from solving it and other times, I thought 'no, we're a long way away',"" he said. This video can not be played Hamish Campbell: ""Do I think somebody will come back to court? Probably not, no."" More than 2,000 people had been named as potential suspects.

""But there's thousands of them and that's the issue of managing stranger homicides."" The film will also show how BBC director general Tony Hall, then the corporation's head of news, was targeted with three telephone threats in the weeks after Ms Dando's murder. ""I listened to the voice of one of them, which said basically, I was next,"" he told the programme. Lord Hall said he had ""no idea"" if the threat was real.

"Pharmaceutical industry leaders want a temporary ban on drugs exports to prevent the NHS being hit by shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The call came from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. It told the BBC a drop in the value of the pound would create an incentive for wholesalers to sell medicines overseas instead of to the NHS. The Department of Health says it is working closely with the industry to ensure continuity of supply. Government contingency planning has been welcomed by the industry. Concerns there could be long tailbacks of lorries at Channel ports have prompted months of preparation by officials, who have set up an advice hotline for drug companies. They have been working to ensure six weeks' worth of medicines are stockpiled, and chartering more ferries to bring in supplies. How does Brexit affect the pound? No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry? Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit But the industry body told BBC News that further action was needed to counter the risk that pharmacists and wholesalers with export licences could find it more lucrative to sell products in the Eurozone if the pound weakened. The association wants the government to impose a temporary export ban on certain vital medicines, aimed at the ""parallel trade"" in which wholesalers buy products intended by manufacturers for one market and export them to another EU member state. The practice is legal but can give rise to what is known as arbitrage, that is taking advantage of varying prices in different markets. The Greek government took similar emergency action during the financial crisis in 2013. Steps were taken to stop medicines intended for Greek patients being exported from the country as distributors sought higher prices elsewhere. Industry leaders fear hospital patients could be affected It is understood that wholesalers and pharmacists with licenses to export cover a minority share of the UK medicines market. But pharmaceutical industry leaders are concerned that if a no-deal Brexit is looming these companies could move enough of their stock out of the country to cause problems for patients. Hospital trust managers have expressed concerns about medicine and equipment shortages, withone suggesting they could ""quickly run out of vital medical supplies"", leading to widespread cancellations of non-urgent operations. In recent months there have been reports of shortages of some drugs partly caused by unofficial stockpiling by distributors. A Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said: ""We are aware of concerns raised about this issue and continue to work closely with the NHS, industry and the supply chain to ensure patients continue to access medicines in the same way they do now - whatever the EU exit outcome."" Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said: ""These are serious warnings that I've raised directly with the Secretary of State in the Commons as patients are rightly worried about not being able to get access to medicines. Ministers should get a grip and suspend the necessary export licenses as those in the pharmaceutical industry are calling for.""  No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry?

Varda, who was easily recognisable for her bowl-cut bob, worked up to the end. Her autobiographical documentary Varda by Agnes premiered at the Berlin Film Festival last month, where she also received a lifetime achievement award. Also a noted photographer, screenplay writer, actress and visual artist, she often used her own life as the framework for her films.

Appearing at the BFI in London in 2018, she told the audience: ""I wanted to invent cinema, and be happy to be a woman. I wanted to be a radical.""

"The current system of checking newborns for hip problems is failing, resulting in too many late diagnoses and corrective surgery, a study suggests. All newborns in England have their hips examined but only those at risk or with problems receive a scan. Surgeons from Southampton Children's Hospital said the rate of late diagnoses had not improved since screening started, over 30 years ago. But Public Health England said scanning all newborns could cause more problems. Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), if picked up early in babies, can be treated using a removable splint worn for two to three months. But if there is a delay in diagnosis of up to a year or more, untreated hip dysplasia can lead to a shortened leg, surgery and the risk of continuing hip pain and long-term complications. Alexander Aarvold, study author and consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Southampton, said untreated hip dysplasia was ""a significant public health issue"" and the current approach had ""failed to impact"" on late diagnoses in children. ""The signs are easily missed. They can be subtle,"" he said. ""Doctors, midwives and nurses may be doing the checks and if they are not used to seeing hip dysplasia, it is hard to pick up."" The research, by orthopaedic surgeons inThe Bone and Joint Journal,external, looked at 754 cases of children diagnosed late with the hip problem - defined as after the age of one - between 1990 and 2016, a rate of 1.28 cases per 1,000 births. But UK studies before the hip screening programme began, in 1986, show the rate of late diagnoses then was only 0.88 per 1,000 births. And smaller regional studies from the 1960s and 70s reveal even lower figures. Tim Theologis, president of the British Society for Children's Orthopaedic Surgery, said: ""This study has provided evidence that the current selective screening for neonatal hip dysplasia is ineffective and the percentage of infants diagnosed late is unacceptably high."" Other countries, such as Germany and Austria, perform ultrasound scans of the hips of all newborns - and late diagnosis is extremely low there. But Prof Anne Mackie, director of screening at Public Health England, said: ""Offering a universal scan can cause more harm and evidence shows that it can lead to 20 times more babies being unnecessarily treated compared to the UK programme. ""We know that wearing a splint in the crucial early months can affect the bond between mother and baby and can also cause avascular necrosis where the hip 'dies'."" PHE said it was planning to introduce some changes to the screening process and looking at more training for clinicians carrying out the examinations. It's a condition where the ""ball and socket"" joint of the hip does not form properly. This socket of the hip is too shallow and so the head of the thigh bone is not held tightly in place, making the hip joint loose. Sometimes, it can come out of the socket or dislocate Babies' hips are checked as part of a physical examination within 72 hours of being born and again at six to eight weeks old. The examination involves gentle manipulation of a baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems. DDH is more common in girls than boys and more common in the left hip. Without treatment, DDH may lead to problems later in life, including: developing a limp hip pain - especially during the teenage years painful and stiff joints (osteoarthritis) With early diagnosis and treatment, most children are able to develop normally and have a full range of movement in their hip.

"Pharmaceutical industry leaders want a temporary ban on drugs exports to prevent the NHS being hit by shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The call came from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. It told the BBC a drop in the value of the pound would create an incentive for wholesalers to sell medicines overseas instead of to the NHS. The Department of Health says it is working closely with the industry to ensure continuity of supply. Government contingency planning has been welcomed by the industry. Concerns there could be long tailbacks of lorries at Channel ports have prompted months of preparation by officials, who have set up an advice hotline for drug companies. They have been working to ensure six weeks' worth of medicines are stockpiled, and chartering more ferries to bring in supplies. How does Brexit affect the pound? No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry? Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit But the industry body told BBC News that further action was needed to counter the risk that pharmacists and wholesalers with export licences could find it more lucrative to sell products in the Eurozone if the pound weakened. The association wants the government to impose a temporary export ban on certain vital medicines, aimed at the ""parallel trade"" in which wholesalers buy products intended by manufacturers for one market and export them to another EU member state. The practice is legal but can give rise to what is known as arbitrage, that is taking advantage of varying prices in different markets. The Greek government took similar emergency action during the financial crisis in 2013. Steps were taken to stop medicines intended for Greek patients being exported from the country as distributors sought higher prices elsewhere. Industry leaders fear hospital patients could be affected It is understood that wholesalers and pharmacists with licenses to export cover a minority share of the UK medicines market. But pharmaceutical industry leaders are concerned that if a no-deal Brexit is looming these companies could move enough of their stock out of the country to cause problems for patients. Hospital trust managers have expressed concerns about medicine and equipment shortages, withone suggesting they could ""quickly run out of vital medical supplies"", leading to widespread cancellations of non-urgent operations. In recent months there have been reports of shortages of some drugs partly caused by unofficial stockpiling by distributors. A Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said: ""We are aware of concerns raised about this issue and continue to work closely with the NHS, industry and the supply chain to ensure patients continue to access medicines in the same way they do now - whatever the EU exit outcome."" Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said: ""These are serious warnings that I've raised directly with the Secretary of State in the Commons as patients are rightly worried about not being able to get access to medicines. Ministers should get a grip and suspend the necessary export licenses as those in the pharmaceutical industry are calling for.""  No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry?

"This video can not be played New Zealanders came together to pay respect to those killed in the mosque attacks A memorial service has been held in Christchurch, New Zealand, and screened around the nation, to honour the 50 victims of the 15 March shootings. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke at the televised event, along with Muslim leaders and a survivor of the attack. Cat Stevens, the British singer who converted to Islam in the 1970s, also performed. More than 20,000 people attended the event at the city's Hagley Park, amid tight security. New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, spoke directly to relatives of victims of the mosque attacks Addressing the crowd in the park near the Al Noor mosque, where more than 40 people were killed earlier this month, Ms Ardern said New Zealand had ""a responsibility to be the place we wish to be"". ""We are not immune to the viruses of hate, of fear, of other. We never have been,"" she said, ""but we can be the nation that discovers the cure"". Christchurch shootings: How the attacks unfolded In all, 50 people died on 15 March when a white supremacist attacked two mosques in Christchurch, while livestreaming part of his attack on Facebook. Ms Arden described how the world had been ""stuck in a vicious cycle of extremism breeding extremism"" but said ""the answer lies in our humanity"". Wearing a Maori cloak, she received a standing ovation as she took to the stage. Dozens of government representatives from around the world attended the memorial, including the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. Farid Ahmed, one of the survivors of the Christchurch shootings, garnered huge round of applause for his speech Farid Ahmed, who survived the attack by a far-right gunman but whose wife Husna was killed, made a plea for peace. He said he had forgiven the gunman. ""I don't want a heart that is boiling like a volcano,"" he said. ""I want a heart that will be full of love and care, and will have mercy."" The lives lost and the world they revealed The people killed as they prayed,external by Hywel Griffith at Hagley Park, Christchurch Two weeks may have passed, but the events of 15 March still weigh heavily on people here. They gathered on the verdant fields of Hagley Park to honour victims very few of them would have known. Some women wore headscarves, as a sign of solidarity towards followers of Islam. As the names of the dead were read out, thousands stood in sombre silence. One woman told me how proud she was of how Jacinda Ardern has represented the nation in its grief. But there was also an emphasis here on resilience and recovery - the need to stay united as normal life slowly starts to return. British singer Cat Stevens, who is a convert to Islam, performed at the service Cat Stevens, whose Muslim name is Yusuf Islam, sang his songs Peace Train and Don't be Shy. ""It's only when good people stay sitting that evil rises,"" he said. ""We've seen the opposite in this country."" Shaggaf Khan, president of the Muslim Council of Canterbury, praised New Zealand's response to the attacks and said he felt ""ultimately hopeful"". ""From this hate, how much love has been shared? Out of this darkness, how much light has been spread?"" he asked the crowd. An estimated 20,000 attended the ceremony in Hagley Park, with many more watching the live television broadcast The mayor of Christchurch, Lianne Dalziel, called on social media platforms to ""take more responsibility"". The shootings were live-streamed on Facebook and shared worldwide before the social media network could remove the footage. Anger as shooter video spreads around world Facebook: NZ attack video viewed 4,000 times ""We each have a responsibility to ask the hard questions of ourselves about what comfort we give to people who might harbour racist or hateful views,"" she said. People cried as they sang the New Zealand national anthem All 50 names of the victims who died in the attacks were read out at the event by members of the city's Muslim community. The victims included men, women and children from across the world. The youngest victim was just three years old. There are still 22 people recovering in hospital, including a critically injured four-year-old girl. NZ falls silent for mosque attack victims Father and son in first NZ mosque funeral Many had moved to New Zealand in the hope of a better life and some were refugees. Ms Ardern described the attacks as one of the nation's ""darkest days"". Family members of victims of the Christchurch shootings attended the event Since the mass shooting, Ms Ardern has announced a ban on all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. Police Commissioner Mike Bush said the remembrance service was one of the largest security events ever conducted by the police. The service was livestreamed at smaller events across the country, butthe New Zealand Herald reported that many of these were cancelled,externaldue to stretched police resources.

"The current system of checking newborns for hip problems is failing, resulting in too many late diagnoses and corrective surgery, a study suggests. All newborns in England have their hips examined but only those at risk or with problems receive a scan. Surgeons from Southampton Children's Hospital said the rate of late diagnoses had not improved since screening started, over 30 years ago. But Public Health England said scanning all newborns could cause more problems. Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), if picked up early in babies, can be treated using a removable splint worn for two to three months. But if there is a delay in diagnosis of up to a year or more, untreated hip dysplasia can lead to a shortened leg, surgery and the risk of continuing hip pain and long-term complications. Alexander Aarvold, study author and consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Southampton, said untreated hip dysplasia was ""a significant public health issue"" and the current approach had ""failed to impact"" on late diagnoses in children. ""The signs are easily missed. They can be subtle,"" he said. ""Doctors, midwives and nurses may be doing the checks and if they are not used to seeing hip dysplasia, it is hard to pick up."" The research, by orthopaedic surgeons inThe Bone and Joint Journal,external, looked at 754 cases of children diagnosed late with the hip problem - defined as after the age of one - between 1990 and 2016, a rate of 1.28 cases per 1,000 births. But UK studies before the hip screening programme began, in 1986, show the rate of late diagnoses then was only 0.88 per 1,000 births. And smaller regional studies from the 1960s and 70s reveal even lower figures. Tim Theologis, president of the British Society for Children's Orthopaedic Surgery, said: ""This study has provided evidence that the current selective screening for neonatal hip dysplasia is ineffective and the percentage of infants diagnosed late is unacceptably high."" Other countries, such as Germany and Austria, perform ultrasound scans of the hips of all newborns - and late diagnosis is extremely low there. But Prof Anne Mackie, director of screening at Public Health England, said: ""Offering a universal scan can cause more harm and evidence shows that it can lead to 20 times more babies being unnecessarily treated compared to the UK programme. ""We know that wearing a splint in the crucial early months can affect the bond between mother and baby and can also cause avascular necrosis where the hip 'dies'."" PHE said it was planning to introduce some changes to the screening process and looking at more training for clinicians carrying out the examinations. It's a condition where the ""ball and socket"" joint of the hip does not form properly. This socket of the hip is too shallow and so the head of the thigh bone is not held tightly in place, making the hip joint loose. Sometimes, it can come out of the socket or dislocate Babies' hips are checked as part of a physical examination within 72 hours of being born and again at six to eight weeks old. The examination involves gentle manipulation of a baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems. DDH is more common in girls than boys and more common in the left hip. Without treatment, DDH may lead to problems later in life, including: developing a limp hip pain - especially during the teenage years painful and stiff joints (osteoarthritis) With early diagnosis and treatment, most children are able to develop normally and have a full range of movement in their hip.

"Debris from Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 Officials probing the crash in Ethiopia of a Boeing 737 Max have preliminarily concluded that a flight-control feature automatically activated before it crashed, the Wall Street Journal says. The newspaper, citing unnamed sources, says the findings were relayed on Thursday,externalat a briefing at the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The flight-control feature is meant to help prevent the plane from stalling. Boeing said it could not comment as the investigation was still under way. It said all inquiries should be referred to the investigating authorities. The BBC has approached the FAA for a response. Meanwhile, Ethiopia's Ministry of Transport said: ""We have seen the WSJ report. We'll comment shortly."" Thursday also saw what is thought to be the first lawsuit filed on the crash. The Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) flight-control feature was also implicated in a fatal crash by Lion Air flight in Indonesia last year. Together, the two crashes have claimed 346 lives. â¢Ethiopian Airlines crash: Six charts on what we know â¢ Boeing grounded: What it means for air travel â¢Airline crash boss wants aircraft grounded â¢Ethiopian Airlines: Who are the victims? MCAS is software designed to help prevent the 737 Max 8 from stalling. It reacts when sensors in the nose of the aircraft show the jet is climbing at too steep an angle, which can cause planes to stall. But an investigation of the Lion Air flight last year suggested the system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea, killing all 189 passengers and crew. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says there are similarities between that crash and the Ethiopian accident on 10 March. Boeing has redesigned the software so that it will disable MCAS if it receives conflicting data from its sensors. As part of the upgrade, Boeing will install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. Neither of the planes, operated by Lion Air in Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines, that were involved in the fatal crashes carried the alert systems, which are designed to warn pilots when sensors produce contradictory readings. Earlier this week, Boeing said that the upgrades were not an admission that the system had caused the crashes. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the accidents. A preliminary report from Ethiopian authorities is expected within days. The report comes a day after a lawsuit was filed in a Chicago federal court by the family of one of the victims of the Ethiopian crash, Jackson Musoni, a citizen of Rwanda. It alleges that Boeing had defectively designed the automated flight control system All Boeing 737 Max are currently grounded. It is still not certain when the planes will be allowed to fly.

"This video can not be played US President Donald Trump: No collusion At his first rally since the Mueller report was submitted, Donald Trump railed against his political opponents and reiterated his claim that the report was a ""total exoneration"". The report found no evidence of Russian collusion but did not exonerate Mr Trump of obstruction of justice. In a typically free-form, 90-minute speech, Mr Trump used crude language to deride the investigation. He was speaking at a rally in Grand Rapids in the state of Michigan. Warning: this report contains strong language ""After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead. The collusion delusion is over,"" the president told a cheering crowd of thousands. Former FBI director Robert Mueller was appointed to head an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election almost two years ago. His team have charged 34 people - including six former Trump aides and a dozen Russians - as well as three companies. None of those charges directly related to the allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Stormy Daniels lawyer accused of extortion 'Mueller called it (largely) right on Trump' The best day of Trump's presidency In his speech on Thursday night, Mr Trump called the investigation ""a plan by those who lost the election to try and illegally regain power by framing innocent Americans - many of them, they suffered - with an elaborate hoax"". Mr Mueller's report was submitted a week ago to the US Attorney General William Barr. After two days,Mr Barr released a four-page summary of the more-than 300-page report. According to Mr Barr's summary, Mr Mueller's team did not establish that Trump campaign members colluded with Russians - a significant political victory for the president, who has lived for two years under a cloud of suspicion about alleged collusion. Democrats have been stepping up their demands for access to the full Mueller report, threatening to issue a subpoena for it if it has not been released by next Tuesday. The leader of the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, shook her fist on Thursday as she demanded the attorney general disclose the full findings. She asked what Mr Trump and the Republicans were afraid of and called them ""scaredy cats"". But Mr Barr has said he will not divulge the full report to Congress immediately because he is redacting grand jury testimony and other elements. President Trump addressed the crowd at his rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan After a period of uncharacteristic silence on the issue as Mr Mueller neared the end of his investigation, Mr Trump let loose this week in attacks on those who he saw as supporters of the investigation, as well as his Democratic opponents. Speaking at the rally in Grand Rapids, he said: ""These are sick people and there has to be accountability because it's all lies and they know it's lies."" Using unusually crude language for a public appearance, he called the investigation ""ridiculous bullshit"". Read Barr's full summary of the report What liberals make of the special counsel now Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? President Trump went on to repeat his claim that the report was a ""total exoneration, complete vindication"" - an expression which has jarred with some, given that Mr Mueller's report explicitly stated that investigators were unable to exonerate the president of obstruction of justice. The obstruction charge was a secondary plank of Mr Mueller's investigation, alongside efforts to establish whether any collusion had taken place. But Mr Mueller declined to draw a conclusion on whether Mr Trump had obstructed justice, saying only that the president could not be exonerated. Attorney General Barr, who was appointed by the president, concluded in his summary of the report that there was not enough evidence to determine if the president had committed the offence. Leading Democrats have called for the Mueller report to be published in full, and pledged to make use of the party's majority control of House committees to continue investigating the president. Despite the end of the Mueller investigation, Mr Trump still faces more than a dozen other criminal investigations and lawsuits looking into his businesses, family, and associates - including allegations that he instructed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to pay hush money to two porn stars over alleged sexual affairs. Mr Cohen was sentenced in December to three years in prison. In all, six former Trump aides were indicted during the Mueller investigation, including his former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.

"This video can not be played ""The secret to long life is to avoid dying"" says England's oldest man. Britain's two oldest men are marking their 111th birthdays. Alf Smith, from St Madoes, Perthshire, and Bob Weighton, from Alton, Hampshire, were both born on 29 March 1908. Mr Weighton, who grew up in Hull, said he had requested not to have a birthday card from the Queen in order to save public funds. The men have never met but have exchanged birthday cards in recent years. It is not known which of them was born first. Alf Smith spent much of his life in farming Mr Weighton is celebrating his birthday by officially launching his new book of poems, to raise funds for elderly people in Alton. He said he asked not to receive a royal birthday card because ""I do not see why the state should pay for the Queen to send out all these things. It's not a personal thing"". The former teacher and engineer has two sons and a daughter, 10 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren. Bob Weighton was born in Hull and was one of seven children He said the world had changed ""enormously"" in his lifetime but people had mostly stayed the same. ""The basic concerns of human beings [are] exactly the same - 'can this person be trusted?'"" he added. He said Brexit was ""a total mess"", following Britain's failure to leave the European Union on his birthday. ""My own feeling is that if there were defects, and there were quite obviously defects, we can negotiate on the inside rather than walking off the field with the cricket ball and saying 'I'm not playing'."" Mr Weighton said the most common question he was asked was about the secret of his longevity. But his only advice on the matter was ""to avoid dying"", he said. Mr Weighton said he had asked to save public funds by not having a birthday card from the Queen The UK's other oldest man, Alf Smith was born in Invergowrie, in Perth and Kinross, and later farmed at Kinfauns where he raised two children, He and Mr Weighton both spent part of their lives in Canada.

"Pharmaceutical industry leaders want a temporary ban on drugs exports to prevent the NHS being hit by shortages in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The call came from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. It told the BBC a drop in the value of the pound would create an incentive for wholesalers to sell medicines overseas instead of to the NHS. The Department of Health says it is working closely with the industry to ensure continuity of supply. Government contingency planning has been welcomed by the industry. Concerns there could be long tailbacks of lorries at Channel ports have prompted months of preparation by officials, who have set up an advice hotline for drug companies. They have been working to ensure six weeks' worth of medicines are stockpiled, and chartering more ferries to bring in supplies. How does Brexit affect the pound? No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry? Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit But the industry body told BBC News that further action was needed to counter the risk that pharmacists and wholesalers with export licences could find it more lucrative to sell products in the Eurozone if the pound weakened. The association wants the government to impose a temporary export ban on certain vital medicines, aimed at the ""parallel trade"" in which wholesalers buy products intended by manufacturers for one market and export them to another EU member state. The practice is legal but can give rise to what is known as arbitrage, that is taking advantage of varying prices in different markets. The Greek government took similar emergency action during the financial crisis in 2013. Steps were taken to stop medicines intended for Greek patients being exported from the country as distributors sought higher prices elsewhere. Industry leaders fear hospital patients could be affected It is understood that wholesalers and pharmacists with licenses to export cover a minority share of the UK medicines market. But pharmaceutical industry leaders are concerned that if a no-deal Brexit is looming these companies could move enough of their stock out of the country to cause problems for patients. Hospital trust managers have expressed concerns about medicine and equipment shortages, withone suggesting they could ""quickly run out of vital medical supplies"", leading to widespread cancellations of non-urgent operations. In recent months there have been reports of shortages of some drugs partly caused by unofficial stockpiling by distributors. A Department of Health and Social care spokesperson said: ""We are aware of concerns raised about this issue and continue to work closely with the NHS, industry and the supply chain to ensure patients continue to access medicines in the same way they do now - whatever the EU exit outcome."" Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said: ""These are serious warnings that I've raised directly with the Secretary of State in the Commons as patients are rightly worried about not being able to get access to medicines. Ministers should get a grip and suspend the necessary export licenses as those in the pharmaceutical industry are calling for.""  No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry?

"Brian McConnachie QC represented child killer Aaron Campbell during the nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow The lawyer who represented child killer Aaron Campbell says he is grateful for the comments of the trial judge who commended his professionalism. Brian McConnachie QC is forbidden from discussing his work with the teenager who abducted, raped and murdered six-year-old Alesha MacPhail. But he welcomed the remarks of judge Lord Matthews who made clear he did not make up Campbell's defence. The 16-year-old was jailed last week for at least 27 years. Alesha was killed on 2 July last year while she was on holiday on the Isle of Bute. What do we know about Alesha's killer? Read the judge's sentencing statement in full,external Campbell denied the crime throughout his nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow and told the jury he had never met the child. The killer even lodged a special defence of incrimination in which he blamed 18-year-old Toni McLachlan. But when the schoolboy returned to the dock to be sentenced last week it emerged he had finally admitted the rape and murder. Aaron Campbell will spend a minimum of 27 years in prison and has been warned he may never be released Sentencing Campbell, Lord Matthews highlighted the role of the defence during the distressing case. Lord Matthews told Campbell: ""Mr McConnachie has said all that could be said on your behalf, entirely in keeping with the exemplary way the trial was conducted on both sides of the bar. ""All matters of fact which could reasonably be agreed were agreed and the issues were well focused and laid before the jury. ""As I said to the jury after they returned their verdict, Counsel do not make up defences but present the case on the basis of their instructions. ""It is obvious what your instructions were and your evidence was entirely in keeping with them, albeit it was a tissue of lies."" This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Lord Matthews imposes life sentence Speaking toBBC Scotland's The Ninein his first broadcast interview since the trial, Mr McConnachie welcomed the comments. The QC said he hoped the judge speaking out would ""perhaps help to educate the public in the way that the system works"" He added: ""I am sure there are plenty of people who would take the view that it is the solicitor or the advocate who decides what the defence is going to be and makes it up for the accused and, of course, that could not be further from the truth. ""It was very welcome to hear a judge making the kind of comments that he did. At the time I was very grateful to him."" Campbell told Alesha he was a friend of her father and he was taking her home after she woke up The QC also gave an insight into the legal process and explained advocates are allocated clients and instructed by solicitors using the ""cab rank rule"". Mr McConnachie added: ""You can't refuse a case because, for example, you don't like the look of the accused or because you don't like the subject matter or anything of that nature."" And he stressed the client alone, despite the advice of their advocate, has the final say on whether they plead guilty or not. The Alesha MacPhail murder is rare in that Campbell denied the crime throughout the trial but then admitted it when he was interviewed for the pre-sentencing reports. The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' Asked if he had encountered such a scenario in a career spanning three decades, Mr McConnachie replied: ""I can't recall that happening before."" But he said it was not his job to judge clients accused of committing terrible crimes. ""It's not my job, it's not any solicitor's job or any advocate's job to decide whether or not a person is guilty or innocent,"" he said. ""In High Court cases there are 15 people, namely the jury, who will determine that fact. ""If you as the representative of that person started carrying out that process, then whichever way you went you would not be doing your job properly."" Mr McConnachie also admitted he is not affected by personal criticism or criticism of his profession. And he said he considered it a ""privilege"" to be part of a process that ensures that justice is done and the accused person has had a fair trial. What do we know about Alesha's killer?

"MPs vote by 286 to 344 to reject the governmentâs withdrawal agreement - on the day the UK was due to leave the EU The Commons has been debating a motion on the terms of the UK's exit The political declaration, which sets out the future relationship, was not considered The vote - the third time the government had been defeated over its deal - throws the UKâs plans into more confusion Theresa May says the result will have ""grave"" implications and the ""legal default"" was that the UK would leave the EU on 12 April Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urges the PM to call an election Thousands of Leave supporters gather outside Parliament to protest against Brexit delay Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Francesca Gillett and Sarah Collerton On the day that the UK was due to leave the EU, there has instead been more delay and continued division over Brexit. Here's what today has meant for the Brexit process:  BBC News Channel BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says there is lots more talk in Westminster tonight about a possible general election. ""Thereâs a recognition that thereâs a lot of weariness about
the potential trip to a polling station,"" he says. But he says that ""Parliament is running out of road â the prime minister used
language to that effect today"". Some MPs have suggested that the prime minister should consider her position. But Mr Mason says: ""Her character would suggest that she would want to see this
through to some conclusion."" While it might be a ""tall order"" for her to get her deal through now, she may wait until ""the point where she has self-evidently failed to do that and the UK ends up committed to a long delay"" after 12 April. If she does eventually trigger a leadership contest, a new leader ""could seek a new mandate and try to get themselves a majority â and then we would be heading for another general election"".

Followingthe government's latest setback, it is no clearer when Brexit will happen. The UK faces a deadline of 12 April to come up with a way forward. By that point, the UK must have approved any deal or decided whether it wants to leave without a deal, which Parliament has said no to, or is prepared to delay Brexit by a much longer period, potentially into next year. The EU is planning an emergency summit on 10 April to discuss its next move. So where does the process go from here? Read more here Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor If we know one thing about the prime minister it is that she does not give up, even when it seems that seems the obvious or rational choice. Parliament has rejected her deal three times now - a reality that would have finished off many previous administrations and leaders. Whether that is foolhardy and stubborn, or admirably resilient, it is highly likely that at least for another couple of weeks, Theresa May will look through every nook and cranny in Parliament to see if there is a way for her deal to pass through - somehow. But that's a decision taken in the bunker, and the walls are closing in. Read the full story Katya AdlerEurope Editor The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says today's vote is ""no great surprise"" to European leaders. She says the mood in Brussels is of ""resignation"" and ""defensiveness"", with ""the EU wanting to protect itself
from any future Brexit fallout"". The UK leaving without a deal is seen as an ""increasingly likely prospect"" by leaders such as Emmanuel Macron. ""Thatâs why he and other European leaders are questioning
whether it makes sense to delay Brexit for that much longer. They look at all
the divisions in Parliament, in government, in cabinet, and they wonder if the UK
will ever unite around Brexit,"" Adler says. She says that doesn't mean they would say no, but there would be ""very heated discussion among EU
leaders as to whether to extend, what for and for how long"". One thing they are certain about is that the UK would need to take part in EU elections for a longer extension, she says. That's because the UK would remain an EU member, and the European Parliament's legality could be questioned if all members are not represented.

Vote Leave was fined Â£61,000and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law. The watchdog said it exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. Vote Leave previously said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent There's a bad moon rising over Westminster. Friday's latest government defeat on Brexit may have been by a lower margin than the earlier thrashings, but the convincing 58-vote majority against the EU withdrawal agreement, in the teeth of an all-out whipping operation, hardly suggests that one more heave will see it home. The result looks set to trigger a political chain reaction. And with the prime minister having signalled her departure, albeit making contingent on getting her deal passed, a variety of parliamentary events will become auditions for the contenders for her job. Sajid Javid has Home Office questions on Monday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is up on Tuesday and Andrea Leadsom has her weekly Business Questions outing on Thursday. Other parliamentary events, not least around Brexit, will provide plenty of opportunities for other contenders. Here's Mark's rundown of the week ahead. Former Labour MP Chris Leslie, who is part of the Independent Group, says he supports calls for another public vote - but not a general election. He tells the BBC News Channel: ""If you think that Brexit is complicated, just throw a general election in here to completely throw everything into chaos.  Let's get a grip of this situation. ""There is a route out of it.  The prime minister's deal could go back to the public. ""We could put a customs union, single market back to the public. Ultimately we have to give people the chance to look at this and say do we want to proceed or think again?"" Continuing his speech, ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said: ""This is about our whole system of democracy. ""This is about the bond of trust that needs to exist between the people and those, the governors. ""This is about who we are as a nation. Where our standing is in the world. ""And frankly, I believe that what's happened over there, has not just turned this day that should've been one of great celebration into a day that history will mark as a day of great betrayal, I believe that what's happened over the course of two years is actually one of the saddest and worst chapters in the history of our nation."" He added: ""What they want is for us to go away. Am I downcast, am I disheartened? No. I am more determined."" The crowd broke out in chants of ""Nigel! Nigel! Nigel!"" To music and loud cheers, former UKIP leader and Brexiteer Nigel Farage appeared on stage at the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square. ""It's brave of you to come,"" he told demonstrators. ""Because I sense, being in Westminster, that we are in enemy territory. ""There are hundreds of people just over the street that have treated that referendum and those who voted for it with total and utter contempt of the past three years."" Referring to Theresa May's Brexit deal, Mr Farage called it ""dreadful"" and said he did not spend 25 years campaigning to come out of the EU to see the UK ""signed up to another"" EU treaty. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent The big question everyone is asking is whether the prime
ministerâs deal is dead after this third defeat. Of course, opposition MPs certainly think that it is. But
does she have a plan to bring it back again? There is speculation about maybe some kind of run-off
between her proposal and whatever MPs come up with and coalesce around on
Monday. But weâll have to wait and see. Itâs certainly been an incredibly divisive process - particularly for the Conservative Party. UKIP leader Gerard Batten addressed pro-Brexit supporters on Whitehall after Tommy Robinson. Mr Batten told the crowds: ""As of now we
do not know when we are going to leave the European Union. ""Theresa May has had, for the third
time, her not-really-leaving deal rejected by Parliament."" He added: ""What we do know is that
if we do not leave the EU it will mark the end of democracy in the UK."" Mr Batten also said, to cheers from the crowd, that UKIP was the ""only major political party that actually wants Britain to leave the
EU"". Conservative MP Mark Francois was introduced as a ""massive, massive Brexiteer"" when he took to the stage at the protest organised by campaign group Leave Means Leave.

"MPs would like Lloyd's chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio to respond to allegations raised by customers MPs are pressing the Treasury Select Committee to open an immediate inquiry into the alleged forgery of signatures in bank court documents. They also want Lloyds chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio to be questioned over how the bank treats customers who say they have found evidence of systemic fraud. The all-party group on fair business banking says Lloyds appears to be repeating the same conduct it displayed towards customers who uncovered the HBOS Reading fraud, seeking to silence them. Lloyds has denied there is evidence of systemic fraud and said it ""does not recognise the issue"" as set out by the group of MPs. Kevin Hollinrake MP, chair of the all-party group, made the call for an inquiry after getting what he says was an unsatisfactory response from the bank. He wrote to Mr Horta-Osorio last month, asking for an explanation of the bank's treatment of a Lloyds customer, who had notified the board about an alleged forgery and who claimed to have faced a hostile reaction. Mr Hollinrake cited a letter from the customer pointing to signatures on statements of truth which were used in proceedings to repossess homes. Handwriting experts confirm that signatures purporting to be from the same person, appeared to be constructed differently, supporting the allegation that different people were signing them. Handwriting experts said the two signatures were dissimilar Adam Brand, an expert witness on handwriting and former president of the Institute of Graphologists, told the BBC the construction of the signatures was different. ""If you look at them you've got a sort of fading on the one at the top which is different to the one at the bottom, which starts differently and finishes differently. My reaction is I would agree that the signatures are differently constructed."" The customer's husband, Julian Watts, wrote to non-executive directors of Lloyds in 2016, after discovering seeming discrepancies in signatures used in repossession proceedings in 2011. He also asked the bank to provide signature comparison information to test if the signatures were forged. Mr Hollinrake said a week after non-executives received the letters, Lloyds recommenced litigation against the customer after a gap of six years. Lloyds then allegedly offered, repeatedly, to withdraw the litigation if the customer signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The customer refused. Mr Hollinrake wrote to Mr Horta-Osorio demanding an explanation, accusing Lloyds of attempting to silence its customers. ""Lloyds refused eight times to provide signature comparison information which would confirm whether or not signatures were being forged on Lloyds court documents. There are some extremely serious questions which, as Group CEO, you personally need to answer,"" he wrote. ""Why did Lloyds offer four times to withdraw the litigation if the customer signed an NDA, gagging her from talking about fraudulently forged signatures? ""As chief executive, please state if it is Lloyds corporate policy to attempt to silence customers who notify it of alleged fraud by the bank?"" Mr Hollinrake's letter also asked: ""Why did you, as CEO, and Lloyds board refuse to conduct an audit of signatures on Lloyds court documentsâ¦ despite being fully aware of the identical issue of alleged forged signatures on US bank court documents?"" He reminded the Lloyds chief executive of a scandal in the United States where widespread signature forgery led to banks being fined by attorneys general and forced to compensate customers at a cost of $25bn (Â£19bn). The Lloyds chief executive delegated the reply to a subordinate, who replied to Mr Hollinrake that ""we simply do not recognise the issue as you set it outâ¦ to the best of my knowledge there has been no suggestion of a similar issue in the UK over the years since the US issue arose."" He added: ""You repeat your allegation about Lloyds attempting to 'silence customers' who allege fraud by 'using NDAs to gag customers'.  This is untrue. Our proceedings or agreements with customers do not prevent them raising any concerns, issues or evidence with the police, FCA or any other lawful authority."" But Mr Hollinrake says his questions still have not been answered by the Lloyds chief executive. In a letter urging a Treasury select committee inquiry, the all-party group says: ""My concern is that Lloyds corporately, and its chief executive personally, are now demonstrating a persistent course of conduct that when asked questions by members of parliament, they routinely refuse to answer them and when asked for a personal response, Mr Horta-Osorio continually refuses and evades personal responsibility."" The BBC asked Mr Horta-Osorio for a personal response but none was forthcoming. In a statement, Lloyds told the BBC: ""Whenever concerns are raised, we take them very seriously, but there are no foundations to the allegations raised by Mr Hollinrake. We have reviewed the allegations raised, which relate to an individual customer and can confirm that all the details within the court documents were accurate and signed off by the appropriate person where necessary. ""Where we have reached a settlement with third parties, including customers, the agreement never restricts them from raising concerns, issues or evidence with the appropriate authorities, including regulators and police, and they have always been able to do so."" The Bank Signature Forgery Campaign has identified further examples in addition to the Lloyds customer concerned, including signatures from Lloyds and other banks. MPs on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking announced their support last month for the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign, which is calling for anyone who suspects forgery of signatures to contact them. ""The APPG receives frequent and consistent representations from constituents over the forgery of signatures, so this campaign will provide a vital method of gathering evidence of possible signature forgeries by UK banks in court documents,"" the APPG announced. The MPs are calling on all bank customers to send examples of signatures on bank court documents, whether or not they believe they are suspect, to theBank Signature Forgery Campaign,external. In the United States, reviews of documents by local county legal departments found thousands of suspect signatures dating back to 1998. In the foreclosure fraud scandal, so-called 'foreclosure mill' law firms set themselves up to process repossession claims in volume, both for homes and other secured loans such as cars. Ordinary homeowners facing foreclosure - the US equivalent of repossession - had uncovered violations including ""robo-signing"", where low-paid employees would routinely sign documents at speed attesting to their truth - when they could not have had time to read them. Mr Watts has questioned whether banks and their lawyers have been using the same cost-cutting business process. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking has said it receives frequent and consistent representations from constituents over the possible forgery of signatures. Multiple examples have been discovered across the banking sector by the Bank Signature Forgery Campaign. The following signature appeared on a witness statement. It starts near the centre, writing right to left before looping up and around. The following signature, said in court documents to be by the same person, appeared on a court checklist testifying to its accuracy. It starts on the right and loops first up and then down. The start and end of the first signature above point in the same direction. The start and end of the second signature point in different directions. Handwriting experts have said they are likely to have been signed by different people. Questions over signatures are not confined to Lloyds. The following four signatures were purportedly all signed by the same person at a different company on the same day: Examples 4 and 6 were signatures on two statements of service. Examples 5 and 7, dated the same day, purport to be from the same person. But the signatures are markedly different. One of the country's leading hand-writing experts has told the BBC the signatures, both on court documents, are ""highly likely"" to have been signed by two different people. Adam Brand, former chairman of the British Institute of Graphologists and a leading expert witness on handwriting in court cases, said on seeing the signatures: ""It's highly probable that two different people have been signing under the same name on the same day."" In a further example, three different people appear to have signed under the same name: Asked if the above signatures could be from the same person, Mr Brand said ""absolutely not"". Further evidence suggests one person has been signing under more than one name. Mr Brand said the signature above was the same person signing in multiple different names. ""It's highly probably this is the same person; that is very powerful."" The Civil Procedure Rules govern how law firms must behave in legal proceedings including repossessions. They state: Practice Direction 22 Statements of Truth 3.9  The individual who signs a statement of truth must print his full name clearly beneath his signature. 3.10  A legal representative who signs a statement of truth must sign in his own name and not that of his firm or employer Lloyds boss gives up pension perk Lloyds sets aside further Â£750m for PPI Lloyds' overdraft fees are 'unacceptable' Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures 'Where do I go?'

"Chinese telecoms giant Huawei said revenues topped $100bn in 2018 despite a US-led campaign against the business on fears it poses a security threat. The firm said revenue for 2018 hit 721.2bn yuan ($107bn), while net profit jumped 25% to 59.3bn yuan. The US and others have restricted the company over concerns that its ties to Beijing represent a security threat. Huawei says it is independent and strongly denies its products pose a security risk. The Shenzhen-based firm said global revenue surged 19.5% in 2018, its fastest pace of growth in two years. The result was supported by strong sales of smartphones in China. At the same time its carrier business, which sells telecoms infrastructure to countries around the world, eased 1.3%. Huawei is the world's largest maker of telecoms equipment. It faces a growing backlash from Western countries on concerns over the security of its products used in next-generation5G mobile networks. The US, Australia and New Zealand have all blocked local firms from using Huawei to provide the technology for their 5G networks. Should we worry about Huawei? The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss The storm over Huawei Several European telecoms operators are considering removing Huawei equipment from their networks, and areport by UK cyber authorities out this week strongly criticised the tech firm. The report, issued by the National Cyber Security Centre, said it can provide ""only limited assurance that the long-term security risks can be managed in the Huawei equipment currently deployed in the UK"". Huawei has begun pushing back. It has launched a more aggressive strategy in recent months to counter what it sees as an American ""smear"" campaign. Earlier this month, itfiled a lawsuit against the US governmentover a ban that restricts federal agencies from using its products, arguing it is ""unconstitutional.""

"Parliament remains deadlocked after MPs once againrejected Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal agreement. But could a series of votes on different Brexit options offer a way forward? A process, known as indicative votes,has already tried to find a consensus - but it failed to find a majority for any one outcome. No. A second round of indicative votes is expected on Monday. The process is likely to be very similar to last time,according to the order paper,external. MPs will be able to submit their options to the Speaker, John Bercow. He will then select which options are debated and eventually voted on. Last time, eight options were selected. But on this occasion Mr Bercow could decide to select fewer - for example only the three options that commanded the most support on Wednesday. Or, he could choose more. The voting system - where MPs select yes or no on each option - is expected to remain the same. Here is a reminder of what the options were and how MPs voted on them, in the first round. Proposer: Dame Margaret Beckett, Labour Result: 268 for, 295 against This option would require the public to agree to any Brexit deal, through a ""confirmatory referendum"". But it would be up to MPs to decide what the question on the ballot would be - and that could lead to renewed deadlock. For example, should there be two or more options to choose from? How could another referendum work? Proposer: Ken Clarke, Conservative Result: 265 for, 271 against Under this option, MPs could pledge to support Mrs May's Brexit deal (known asthe withdrawal agreement) in exchange for a commitment for the UK to remain in a customs union with the EU. A customs union is a trade agreement under which two or more countries do not put tariffs (taxes on imports) on goods coming in from other countries in the union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. This arrangement would give the UK a closer trading relationship with the EU and reduce the need for some (but not all) checks at the Irish border. It would go some way towards removing the need for the backstop - the insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border (eg border posts) in Ireland. But being part of a permanent customs union with the EU would stop the UK striking its own independent trade deals with other countries (such as the United States). Mrs May has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union as one of her ""red lines"". Proposer: Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Result: 237 for, 307 against Labour's position is to remain in a customs unionin addition to having a ""close alignment"" with the EU single market. While being in a customs union prevents the UK from negotiating its own trade deals, Labour says it wants the UK to be to have ""a say"" in future EU trade talks. But EU law does not currently allow non-EU members to have a formal say or veto in its trade talks. However, Labour says the EU has shown flexibility in the past and its proposal cannot be ruled out until the party has had a chance to negotiate formally. What is Labour's custom union policy? Proposer: Nick Boles, Conservative Result: 189 for, 283 against This option would involve the UK joining Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as part of theEuropean Free Trade Association (Efta),external. It would mean remaining in the single market, which would ensure the free flow of goods to and from the EU - avoiding friction at the borders. But the UK would have to retain freedom of movement (the right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK and vice-versa) - although some restrictions  could apply. The UK would also need pay into the EU budget and follow many of the EU's rules and regulations. Under the plan, the UK would also remain in a customs union until an alternative plan to a avoid a hard border in Ireland was found. This option is referred to as the Common Market 2.0 or the Norway plus plan. What is Common Market 2.0? Proposer: Joanna Cherry, SNP Result: 184 for, 293 against This would mean cancelling Brexit altogether. Article 50 is the two-year process which triggered the UK's departure from the EU. The original deadline of 29 March has now been extended for at least a couple of weeks. Last year, the European Court of Justice ruled that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission. By revoking Article 50, the UK would bring a halt to the entire Brexit process. It would therefore remain a member of the EU on the same terms, including keeping its budget rebate. Can the UK revoke Article 50? Proposer: John Baron, Conservative Result: 160 for, 400 against No deal is the legal default outcome in the absence of agreeing a deal or revoking Article 50. So if the political deadlock cannot be resolved, a no-deal Brexit could still be the final outcome. If the UK did leave the EU with no deal, it would mean initially trading on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms. The Ministry of Defence says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit, if necessary This means that certain goods would be subject to tariffs. The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these""as far as possible"". In addition to tariffs, UK goods entering the EU would be subject to extra checks. There have been warnings that this could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover). The UK has undertaken preparations, code-named Operation Yellowhammer, to address any disruption in the first few days of a no-deal Brexit. As part of the contingency plans, up to 3,500 troops will be ready to be deployed, if necessary. What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Brexit: What trade deals have been done so far? What is operation Yellowhammer? Proposer: Marcus Fysh, Conservative Result: 139 for, 422 against This option assumes the UK is unable to pass the withdrawal agreement. Under this scenario, the UK would leave the EU but there would be a commitment from both sides to recognise each other's standards and regulations for up to two years. Supporters refer to it as a ""standstill"" agreement and say this would mean that goods could continue to flow freely and tariff-free (ie no taxes on imports). The UK would be able to negotiate its future relationship, but would continue to pay into the EU budget during this period. Supporters say such an arrangement would avoid disruption, but detractors say it would not eliminate the need for checks. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs that the EU has repeatedly said it is unwilling to accept such a plan. Proposer: George Eustice, Conservative Result: 64 for, 377 against Under this option, the UK would participate in the single market and Efta but, unlike the Common Market 2.0 option, it would not enter into an EU customs arrangement. This would give the UK the freedom to sign its own trade deals. However, it is not clear how such an outcome would avoid the need for customs checks at the Irish border - the plan acknowledges the need for ""new protocols relating to the Northern Ireland border"".

"This video can not be played Andrea Leadsom explains the timetable for Friday's Brexit vote MPs will be asked to vote again on Brexit on Friday but only on part of the deal negotiated with the EU. They will vote on the withdrawal agreement on the Irish ""backstop"", divorce bill and citizens' rights. But it will not amount to a third ""meaningful vote"" on the deal, as it will not include a vote on the UK's future relationship with the EU. Amid anger from MPs, Andrea Leadsom said it was ""crucial"" if the UK wanted to secure a Brexit delay until 22 May. Brexit: What could happen next? What are MPs doing on Friday? DUP will vote against deal, says Dodds MPs will be debating the motion on the day the UK was supposed to leave the European Union - 29 March. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Theresa May was essentially asking MPs to turn it into a game of two halves - just voting on the first part of the deal which sorts out the UK's departure and leaving the longer term part for the next few weeks. But it is still not certain it will get through - both Labour and the Democratic Unionist Party say they will vote against the withdrawal agreement on Friday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the withdrawal agreement could not be separated from the political declaration ""because otherwise you move into a blindfold Brexit"". The DUP's deputy leader Nigel Doddssaid he was not expecting ""any last minute rabbits out of the hat""that would change the party's position. The vote, on what was meant to be Brexit Day, is a request to MPs to allow her to keep going, to carry on pursuing her route, with its well-documented flaws. There's a challenge there too, not just to her own Brexiteers but to Labour and the other opposition parties, to say ""no"" to a long delay to our departure from the EU, the last moment when Number 10 believes anything even approaching a timely exit can be guaranteed. There are signs now of course that many Eurosceptic MPs are ready to say yes - not because they suddenly have realised her deal is perfect but because more of them officially realise that it is the clearest break from the EU they can realistically hope for. Yet her Northern Irish allies are not persuaded. Labour, even though they have sometimes accepted that what's on the table tomorrow, the divorce deal, will never be unpicked by the EU, will still, in the main, resist. Read Laura's blog He told the BBC that the DUP was concerned about plans for ""a trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and what that would mean in terms of who makes our laws - not Stormont or Westminster"". The PM's deal includes a withdrawal agreement - setting out how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and the backstop arrangements - and a political declaration on the way the future EU-UK relationship will work. Last week the European Council agreed to postpone Brexit beyond the expected date of 29 March - offering an extension until 22 May, if MPs approved the withdrawal agreement by the end of this week. If not, it offered a shorter delay until 12 April - the date by which the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the 2019 European Parliament elections - allowing the UK time to get the deal through or to ""indicate a way forward"". BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the official conclusions from last week's summit only mention the need to pass the withdrawal agreement by Friday, not the political declaration.

Leader of the Commons Mrs Leadsom told MPs that the European Council would only agree to the 22 May extension if MPs approved the withdrawal agreement by 23:00 GMT on Friday. ""It's crucial therefore that we make every effort to give effect to the council's decision and tomorrow's motion gives Parliament the opportunity to secure that extension,"" she said. ""I think we can all agree that we don't want to be in the situation of asking for another extension and facing the potential requirement of participating in European Parliament elections."" But she faced anger from some MPs. Labour's Mary Creagh described it as an ""extraordinary and unprecedented reverse ferret of the commitments that have been made... that we should have our say on both items together"". Friday's vote would not allow Parliament to ratify the withdrawal package, because Brexit legislation allows this only after the passage of a ""meaningful vote"" on both the Withdrawal Agreement and a Political Declaration on the future relationship. What do voters make of Brexit now? How did my MP vote on Brexit options? Indicative vote options in detail The government would either have to pass part two of the deal - the political declaration on the future relationship - at a later date, or change the law so that it is not needed to ratify the treaty. Some MPs questioned the government's motion, with Labour's Valerie Vaz saying ""on the face of it breaks the law"". ""This is no way to run a government,"" she told MPs. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button And the Labour chairman of the Brexit select committee, Hilary Benn, asked if Brexit was delayed to 22 May, whether at that point it would ""no longer be possible"" to apply for a further extension beyond that - because it would be too late to take part in the European Parliamentary elections. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said he would address this point on Friday. Commons Speaker John Bercow said the government's ""new"" motion complied with his ruling that he would not allow a third ""meaningful vote"" on the motion MPs have already rejected twice by large margins. On Wednesday, the Commons failed to find a majority for a way forward after voting for eight different options to take Brexit forward - including leaving without a deal, creating a customs union and backing a confirmatory referendum on any deal.

Mrs May told a meeting of Conservative backbenchers on Wednesday that she would not lead the talks with Brussels over the future relationship between the UK and EU and would resign as party leader after 22 May if her deal was passed, but stay on as PM until a new leader is elected. While she has won over some, including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, a number of Brexiteers are still refusing to vote for the deal. She needs to win over 75 rebels to overturn the 149-vote rejection of her deal when it was last voted on, on 13 March. Meanwhile a petition calling for Brexit to be halted by revoking Article 50, which has attracted nearly six million signatures - is to be debated by MPs on Monday. They will also debate a petition calling for another EU referendum, which has more than 160,000 signatures, and another - with 165,000 signatures - demanding that ""Parliament must honour the referendum result"".

"This video can not be played Attorney General Geoffrey Cox: This is the 'last opportunity' Theresa May has told MPs this is their ""last opportunity to guarantee Brexit"", as they vote on her EU withdrawal agreement. The PM said it would allow Brexit to happen on 22 May, avoiding European elections or a no-deal Brexit. MPs are only voting on part of the PM's Brexit deal, the withdrawal agreement, covering the terms of exit. Labour said separating that from the political declaration would mean voting on a ""blindfold Brexit"". Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC's Today programme: ""Take the political declaration off and it is completely blind - you have no idea what you are really voting for."" Live: Brexit debate as it happens Brexit: What could happen next? What are MPs doing on Friday? Brexit: A really simple guide But Mrs May said passing the withdrawal agreement would not pre-empt future negotiations. ""By voting for this motion you are not closing any doors,"" she told MPs. She said they would still have the opportunity to shape Brexit through the withdrawal bill the government will publish next week. ""Today's motion is not about a blind Brexit it is about a guaranteed Brexit,"" she said. ""I have said I am prepared to leave this job earlier than I intended to secure the right outcome for our country,"" she added. ""Every one of us will have to look into our hearts and decide what is best for our constituents and our country."" But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May was ""trying to bounce this House into voting for a damaging deal that we have twice rejected"". He said it was ""an affront to democracy"" as she had previously said the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration were ""indivisible"". Up to 13 separate scheduled protests and counter protests are expected in Westminster on Friday - the day that Britain was scheduled to leave the EU. These include the ""March to Leave"" procession, which left Sunderland two weeks ago, which is due to arrive in Parliament Square. MPs will vote on the withdrawal agreement, a legally-binding document setting out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU, at 14:30 GMT. It includes: Details of the UK's Â£39bn financial settlement with the EU Guarantees about the rights of EU and UK citizens Details of ""transition period"" until the end of 2020 Controversial arrangements for the backstop, which seeks to prevent the return of customs infrastructure at the Irish border in the event no UK-EU trade deal is enforced.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told MPs the withdrawal agreement must be approved by 23:00 GMT if the UK wants to ""secure our legal right"" to an extension to Brexit. He said that the European Council last week had agreed that Brexit could be delayed until 22 May - if the withdrawal agreement was approved by the end of this week. If they do not, EU leaders have offered a shorter delay until 12 April - the date by which the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the 2019 European Parliament elections - to allow the UK time to get the PM's whole deal through or to ""indicate a way forward"". ""This is therefore the last opportunity to take advantage of our legal right and the government has taken the view that it would be wrong to allow that time and date to expire, without giving this House the opportunity to consider whether it should avail itself of the legal right,"" Mr Cox told MPs. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button He said it did not amount to a ""meaningful vote"" on the overall deal - as it did not include the political declaration but he said the EU had accepted that that part of the deal was still open to negotiation, while the withdrawal agreement was not. The government says that voting on the withdrawal agreement alone will be enough to meet the criteria laid down by EU leaders for the postponement of Brexit from 29 March to 22 May while also meeting Speaker John Bercow's requirement that any more votes on the whole deal - which has been twice rejected by large margins - must be different from the last two. This video can not be played Raab indicates support in Commons vote Mr Cox indicated that the government would have been willing to accept a Labour backbench amendment - had it been accepted by the Commons Speaker - which would have meant the prime minister would not have been able to sign an agreement with the EU on the longer term future relationship, without approval from MPs. He said approving the deal on Friday would ""bring certainty to thousands of businesses and millions of individuals throughout this country and one million citizens of our country residing in the EU"". But Labour's Chris Bryant said it would bring ""no certainty"" as it would not mean the overall deal was ratified: ""If anything, today throws more uncertainty into the process."" And Labour MP Hilary Benn questioned whether if Brexit was delayed until 22 May, but no agreement was reached by then on the political declaration, whether the UK would be able to seek a further extension. He suggested it would then be too late to take part in the European parliamentary elections, which the EU has indicated the UK would need to do if it was to get a longer delay to Brexit. The SNP's Ian Blackford accused the prime minister of having ""run down this clock, only to ignore the wishes of Parliament, the wishes of the people and engage in a game of blackmail and trickery to win support"". But Conservative former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has voted against the deal twice, tweeted that he would now vote for it - despite remaining ""intensely critical"" of it.

And fellow Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith also said he would reluctantly back the process, as did former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who said that although it was a ""bad deal"" there was a ""significant risk of losing Brexit altogether"" if it did not go through. But Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party said they would be voting against the deal, with its Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson telling MPs: ""We as a party cannot put our hand to an agreement which would have Northern Ireland treated differently."" There is little expectation in the EU today that the withdrawal agreement will pass. If it does, EU leaders will breath a huge sigh of relief. They are not bothered that the political declaration on post Brexit EU-UK relations is being kept out of the vote. Brussels has always said it was open to renegotiating it. The divorce issues in the withdrawal agreement are their priority. The overwhelming mood in the EU today is one of resignation. For the first time, EU leaders are looking at a no-deal Brexit as a very real possibility, rather than a distant, unlikely prospect. It's forcing them to grapple with internal issues that up until now were viewed as too much of a hot potato. Primarily what happens on the Ireland/Northern Ireland border in a no-deal scenario. EU leaders are putting pressure on Dublin to do more to prepare. The EU priority is to safeguard the single market, meaning that checks and some infrastructure will likely be necessary even if they are away from the border itself. But we're not there yet. If the vote fails today, the prime minister could opt to delay Brexit even longer. EU leaders plan to hold an emergency summit on 10 April to hear what she decides. But attitudes hardened at their last meeting. The EU will insist the UK takes part in European Parliamentary elections in May as a condition for getting a longer extension. EU leaders' focus is no longer on the UK and whether it stays or goes. They see their priority now as damage control - protecting themselves as much as possible from any Brexit fall-out. With the DUP also planning to vote against it, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it looked like the PM was heading for another defeat although the result was likely to be far closer this time around. What do voters make of Brexit now? Brexit parties and special coins put on hold DUP will vote against deal, says Dodds If it passes, Friday's vote will not allow Parliament to ratify the entire withdrawal package, because the law allows this only after the passage of a ""meaningful vote"" on both parts of the deal. It would either have to pass the political declaration on the future relationship at a later date, or change the law so that it is not needed to ratify the treaty. Laura Kuenssberg said she expected ministers to bring forward a new withdrawal bill as early as next week to begin this process. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has warned the UK will face leaving the EU without a deal or a longer extension - involving taking part in European Parliament elections - if the deal does not pass. Speaking in Poland, Mr Barnier said the UK would have to decide ""very quickly"" how it wanted to proceed if the withdrawal agreement is not approved today. ""We are open to work on a permanent customs union should the UK decide to take this path,"" he added. Ministers would have until 12 April - the date by which the UK would have to indicate whether it would stand candidates in the elections - to ""indicate a way forward"", with the EU expected to hold an emergency summit to decide if the conditions for a longer delay are met. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said an extension of about a year was being touted at an EU meeting on Thursday, but only if the UK had a ""clear plan"" and if it took part in the European elections. The Withdrawal Agreement is a 599-page document setting out the precise terms of the UK's departure from the European Union The text will be legally binding if approved by the UK and EU Parliaments and the EU has said it cannot be changed It includes guarantees on the rights of EU and UK citizens after Brexit, the UK's Â£39bn ""divorce"" settlement, the terms of a 21-month transition period and contingency arrangements for the Irish border, known as the backstop The Political Declaration is a much shorter, 26-page document setting out the broad parameters of the UK's future relations with the EU The text is largely aspirational and the EU has said it can be beefed-up to make it ""more ambitious"" The framework outlines future trade and economic co-operation, in areas such as financial services and fishing, mutual security and defence arrangements and how the UK and EU will work together and resolve disputes.

"This video can not be played President Trump: ""I want to fund the Special Olympics"" President Donald Trump has said he is reversing a budget request to eliminate funding for the Special Olympics. His remarks came a day after education secretary Betsy DeVos was criticised for defending a proposed $17.6m (Â£13.5m) cut to the organisation, which is designed for disabled children. The request was included in Mr Trump's $4.75tn federal budget, which was not expected to pass Congress. Mrs DeVos responded she had pushed for funding ""behind the scenes"". ""I heard about it this morning. I have overridden my people. We're funding the Special Olympics,"" Mr Trump said of the world's largest sport organisation for people with intellectual disabilities. Mrs DeVos rushed to clarify the contradiction on Thursday, tweeting: ""I am pleased and grateful the President and I see eye-to-eye on this issue and that he has decided to fund our Special Olympics grant."" She had earlier told Congress the US Department of Education had to make ""tough choices"" following a 10% cut to her agency's budget, adding that the nonprofit group should be funded through private donations. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos rushed to clarify her own support for the Special Olympics The cuts came as part of the administration'sproposed budgetfor the 2020 fiscal year, which totals $4.75tn, the largest in federal history. The budget request slashed $17.6m in funding for the Special Olympics, about 10% of the nonprofit organisation's overall revenue. Majority of the group's support comes from individual and corporate donations as well as fundraising campaigns. Britain could host 'best ever' Games, say organisers Why is Betsy DeVos so unpopular? The spending plan also included more than $1tn in cuts to the Medicaid health programme for the poor and disabled, while allotting $8.6bn for the US-Mexico border wall. But the budget proposal is not expected to pass Congress, which must approve it. Who wouldthe cutsaffect? Andrea Cahn, the Senior Director of Unified Champion Schools for Special Olympics who runs the Unified Champion programmes in the United States says the budget cuts would have affected programmes in 6,500 schools. ""The funding we receive from the US Department of Education is specifically for our Unified Champion schools programming,"" says Ms Cahn though the budget cuts would not impact any state games, world games, or any ongoing competitions that are scheduled. This video can not be played Middlesbrough gymnasts at Special Olympics World Games Raymond S Kellis High School in Arizona is one of the schools that has adopted this type of programme.  It has enabled children with intellectual disabilities to be more outgoing says Michael Wakeford, a special education teacher and Unified Sports coach at the school. ""It helps our society bring faith back to humanity in a divisive world in a place where it's easy to fear what we don't know and to fear what we don't understand,"" Mr Wakeford adds. The Special Olympics, founded in 1968 in Washington DC, provides year-round training, health education, community building and athletic competition for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. It currently serves over five million athletes across 190 countries. The sports organisation is separate from theParalympics, which are mostly for elite athletes who have physical disabilities. Both groups are recognised by the International Olympics Committee. The US Special Olympics chapter provides trainings and competitions in 18 sports, including soccer, swimming, equestrian and basketball.

Always put on a great show and could tell how much they loved this music and each other. All the love to you all."" Writing about the band in 2017, music magazine NME,externalsaid Her's were ""not a group to stand still"". It added: ""Each song they produce, from the lo-fi bedroom pop power of debut track to 'Dorothy' to the duo's equally melodic take on slacker-rock on 'Marcel', sees the Liverpool-based duo shift and float between sounds, never really fitting into one genre, but somehow nailing whatever they end up doing."" LIPA said the pair graduated from three-year degrees in music in 2016. Head of music Martin Isherwood paid tribute to ""the funniest, sweetest, loveliest, most creative lads you can ever meet"". ""The songs are just great and we all thought that they were going to be one of the biggest things out of Liverpool,"" he added.

"The mossy red-eyed frog (Duellmanohyla soralia) A fungus that kills amphibians is responsible for the biggest documented loss of nature from a single disease, say researchers. Better biosecurity and wildlife trade restrictions are urgently needed to prevent any more extinctions, they say. The disease, chytridiomycosis, has caused mass die-offs in frogs, toads and salamanders over the past 50 years, including extinctions of 90 species, according to a review of evidence. It has spread to over 60 countries. Australia, Central America and South America are particularly hard hit. ""Highly virulent wildlife disease, including chytridiomycosis, is contributing to the Earth's sixth mass extinction,"" said Dr Ben Scheele of The Australian National University in Canberra. ""We've lost some really amazing species."" A chytrid-infected Tyrrhenian painted frog Three decades ago, scientists began to notice amphibians were dying around the world. The suspect was identified as a fungus calledBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis(Bd), which attacks the skin of amphibians, effectively ""eating them"" alive. A big review of the evidence, published in the journalScience,external, reveals: The fungus has pushed at least 501 amphibians towards extinction (6.5% of known species) 90 are confirmed or presumed extinct in the wild, while the other species have declined by more than 90% In many species, the fungus is the main factor in the deaths of amphibians, but in others it acts together with habitat loss, climate change and predation from invasive species to push species towards oblivion More stories you might like: Should cats be culled to stop extinctions? 'Living fossil' heading for extinction New 'mystery' frog discovered in India The scientists say globalisation and the wildlife trade are the main causes of this global pandemic and are enabling the spread of the disease. ""Humans are moving plants and animals around the world at an increasingly rapid rate, introducing pathogens into new areas,"" said Dr Scheele. Male of Telmatobius sanborni from Pelechuco (La Paz, Bolivia), photographed in March 2001 According to two Canadian experts, the fungus is ""one more nail in the coffin for the state of amphibians globally"". Habitat loss, exploitation and climate change are still the main threat for thousands of species, say Dan Greenberg and Wendy Palen of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada. ""These stressors often act in concert, but clear management actions exist to address at least some of them: protect habitat, limit collection of wild populations, and restrict trade,"" they wrote in an article commenting on the new research in Science.
