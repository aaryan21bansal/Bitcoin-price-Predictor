"Mary used to work at the cafe where Fred West was a regular customer Police are searching for a body at a cafe in Gloucester linked to a girl feared to have been murdered by serial killer Fred West. Mary Bastholm, 15, went missing on 6 January 1968 and has not been found. Officers were called to The Clean Plate by filmmakers working on a documentary. West was a regular customer when the teenager worked at the cafe. The film crew told police on Friday they had found evidence that a body could be buried within the property. Officers could be at the site ""for a number of weeks"" and excavation work is yet to begin, Gloucestershire Police said. Gloucestershire Police said the search might alarm those who worked nearby but it would carry out a proportionate investigation Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said: ""This could be a significant development on a case which has gained a lot of public interest over the years. ""On the basis of the information provided to us, we consider this to be new and potentially important evidence in the case of Mary Bastholm, however further detailed assessments will take place over the following few days to determine the extent of excavation needed. ""First and foremost our thoughts are with Mary's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time."" In a statement released via the force, Miss Bastholm's family said: ""We are aware of the ongoing developments around Mary's disappearance and are being kept up to date and supported by Gloucestershire Police family liaison officers. ""At this time please may we ask for privacy so we can grieve for Mary."" Police have begun removing evidence from the site A white tent has been set up outside the building in Southgate Street and officers are stationed at the scene. The cafe is close to Cromwell Street, where officers found the bodies of West's victims at the home he shared with his wife Rosemary. A spokesperson for The Nelson Trust, a women's charity that owns The Clean Plate, said: ""As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we have done everything we can to accommodate the investigation. ""The Clean Plate will remain closed until all necessary activity is complete. ""It is an extraordinary twist of fate that this building, now associated with a story as tragic as that of the victims of Fred and Rosemary West, is part of a charity working to support women at risk from violence."" A police cordon has been set up around the property By Andrew Plant, BBC News Mary Bastholm disappeared at a bus stop on her way to meet her boyfriend. There has been no trace of her since. It's been a mystery for 53 years. The cafe has been there for decades and has been under several different names. One of its waitresses was Mary, who was 15 at the time when Fred West was a regular customer and was known to him. It was also known he was a builder at the time renovation was needed on the cellar and the toilets at the cafe - work he was believed to have carried out in 1968. A lot of people locally put two and two together and suggested that perhaps he was responsible for her disappearance and that was where she ended up. Police say their activity will take place over a number of weeks and there will be disruption for some time. Fred West took his own life while awaiting trial for the murders of 12 people In 2012, a petition was set up calling for afresh investigationinto Miss Bastholm's disappearance but it was rejected by then Chief Constable Tony Melville. In 1994, West admitted murdering his daughter Heather. The confession came as police began to search 25 Cromwell Street, where they found the bodies of nine girls and young women. He and his wife Rose were jointly charged with nine murders and he was charged with a further three. West took his own life while awaiting the murder trial the following year.

"This video can not be played Cafes, pubs and restaurants get ready to reopen indoors Up to six people from different households will be able to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed indoor hospitality can reopen from 17 May as Wales' Covid case rate continues to fall. Extra cash support for hospitality businesses still affected by Covid restrictions has also been announced. Mr Drakeford said the funding would ""support firms and safeguard jobs"". The support is available to businesses such as pubs, clubs, restaurants and late-night entertainment venues. They can claim up to Â£25,000 to help them through to the end of June, as they prepare for re-opening and more normal trading conditions. The news comes after calls from some in the hospitality industry for allsignificant restrictions on trading to be lifted before July. In England pubs will also open indoors on Monday, with people from different households or not in a bubble having to stay one metre apart. When they reopen in Wales, six people from any households will be able to meet, but those who do not live together, or who are not in bubbles, will have to socially distance, with the rule being two metres apart. Numbers have been increased from the four peopleset out in the Welsh government's lockdown easing plan.,external BBC Wales understands this was changed to make it easier to enforce, bringing it into line with beer garden rules, and indoor meeting drinking rules in England. This video can not be played Sarah John began home brewing in her garage Sarah John, of Boss Brewery in Swansea, said while she was ""breathing a sigh of relief"" to reopen indoors, many small pubs would not be able to reopen unless the two-metre rule was reconsidered. ""Capacity-wise you can get a lot fewer people in, for some small venues it might not be feasible... ideally we would have liked to have seen that taken down to one metre as well,"" she said. Ms John said she hoped the Welsh government would reduce social distancing at the next lockdown briefing on Friday, and the industry needed clarity for the future. ""The back and forth has been difficult... it's very important to be on the home straight, we want to see some commitment from Mark Drakeford on when we will be totally restriction free,"" she said. Paul Slater, landlord of the Trotting Mare Inn in Overton-on-Dee, which is right on the Welsh-English border said he was delighted to open indoors, after two weeks of ""hit and miss weather"" with customers sitting outside with hot water bottles and blankets. He said the two-metre social distancing rule would mean numbers able to sit indoors would halve from 72, and would be a ""balancing act"". ""In the week it won't make too much of a difference, but at weekends we are going to be very limited... We have a lot of drinkers at a weekend, so it's a balancing act between reserving tables for drinkers or people eating,"" he toldRadio Wales Breakfast. Robin Fitzpatrick and Sabine LÃ¶eber said while they were sure many patrons would come back, some may return less frequently At the Cross Keys in Penrhynside, near Llandudno, Conwy county, landlords Robin Fitzpatrick and Sabine LÃ¶eber said they had concerns people's habits might have changed during lockdown. They said people may have saved money while being unable to go out, and want to spend money in their homes, and it may led to a ""slow recovery"". Due to social-distancing measures, the pub had temporarily got rid of its pool table to sit more people inside, but they said even then numbers would be reduced by a third. However the couple said they had not considered staying closed. ""We are a community pub, so long as we break even and provide a service...we are doing what we are passionate about,"" Mr Fitzpatrick said. Amy Wilson will keep groups to a maximum of four indoors at her premises Amy Wilson, who runs her grandfather's business Elmers Cafe, on Crwys Road in Cardiff, said they would be sticking to four people per table indoors because the cafe did not have a large area.

""Our customer base includes students, builders and older local people. We have a 91-year-old regular called Bryn. He comes in every day and has a tea and toast. ""But it's been so sad seeing him having a takeaway and eating outside, sometimes even in the rain. We put a little chair out there for him. It'll be nice to have him coming back inside."" Marco Orsi, who runs the CafÃ© Royale in Pontypridd, said social distancing needed to be reduced to the same rules as in England After being closed since 18 December, Marco Orsi said he was looking forward to reopening his cafÃ© in Pontypridd and said he hoped people would be ""queueing out the door"". He said that he believed cafes should have been allowed to open indoors weeks ago, when non-essential shops pulled up their shutters. ""What we will be opening up to is a slight question mark...with the town centres, but I am confident, in due course, that things will get back to normal,"" he said. He added he believed it was customers' own responsibility to social distance and business owners should not be made to police it. ""People should know how to behave now, if they don't I'm not going to educate them, we will keep social distancing, but I don't expect to police it myself,"" he said. Sophia Joannides said the last year had been a rollercoaster, with the family-run business having to adapt to survive the pandemic Sophia Joannides, Owner of Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in TycÃ´ch, Swansea, said she was excited to see all her regulars again, some who had not visited for over a year due to having to shield. ""Outside dining hasn't really worked for us due to our lovely Welsh weather, we are lucky we have quite a bit of space inside Bluebell, but we are still working on a very reduced capacity,"" she said. ""Our customers are the most loyal and supportive, so we know the next few weeks will be great."" Supply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF) can also apply for support. Mr Drakeford said the cash announced was part of a Â£200m package earmarked for the incoming Welsh government to help businesses affected by the pandemic. ""We know the restrictions have helped to keep us all safe but they have had a big impact on Welsh businesses, which is why we are making more funding available to support firms and safeguard jobs,"" he said. Tell us when we can reopen, nightclubs ask FM Let pubs reopen to control drinking, says Tory As leader of Welsh Labour, Mr Drakeford had faced criticism during the Senedd election campaign for not announcing the extra financial support for the hospitality sector. At the time, he said ""election rules"" prevented him from releasing the cash - and the move did not apparently harm Labour's chances of being re-elected last week. This video can not be played Outdoor hospitality in Wales opened on 26 April Hospitality businesses which can apply for this funding include pubs, clubs, restaurants, nightclubs, late night entertainment venues, supply chain firms, events and conference venues not covered by the Welsh government's Cultural Recovery Fund (CRF). The government said an ""eligibility checker"" would open on the Business Wales website at midday on 17 May so businesses can find out how much support they are likely to be entitled to and how to apply. Mr Drakeford added: ""The public health situation continues to improve in Wales - we have the lowest coronavirus rates and the best vaccination rates in the UK."" The relaxation is the latest development in the Welsh government's route out of the lockdown imposed last year to contain the spread of coronavirus. Gyms, swimming pools and community centres have already reopened while cinemas, theatres and museums are also due to reopen from 17 May, though with strict social-distancing rules still in place. The news came asonly six Welsh council areas reported deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekof figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Deaths overall were also below normal levels for a ninth week in succession. The number of deaths where Covid was mentioned on death certificates dropped to seven in the week ending 30 April - half the previous week's total and the lowest for more than seven months. These accounted for 1.2% of all registered deaths in Wales. It is a further indication of the retreat of Covid, which has resulted in low case numbers and falling hospital cases. The trend has been for a steady decline in deaths and the weekly total is 93% fewer than registered two months ago.

"It is ""not viable"" for small cinemas to open under current rules, says UK Cinema Association boss Only a ""small minority"" of cinemas in Wales will be able to reopen next week under current restrictions, according to an industry trade body. Confirmation is expected on Friday that cinemas canreopen from 17 May. But the UK Cinema Association said regulations were different in Wales to the other nations, with venues following the same, stricter rules as indoor hospitality. The Welsh government said cinemas would open ""when safe to do so"". Phil Clapp, chief executive of the association which represents 90% of the industry including big cinema chains, said because many cinemas were licensed for the sale of alcohol it meant Welsh officials had ""lumped them in"" with pubs and restaurants. He said the rules in Wales differed to England and Scotland in three ways. Under Welsh government guidelines the following rules will apply to cinemas: Customers will have to be seated while ordering and buying food and drink Even if customers use the QR code system to ""check in"" and register their details, they will still have to be collected by the venue The venue is also expected to verify details by asking people for photo ID, for example a passport or driving licence The time customers leave the cinema will also have to be recorded Mr Clapp said cinemas reopening was ""much anticipated"" but some venues have to have a ""serious rethink"" Mr Clapp said the rules were ""impractical and unnecessary"". ""So even if a customer just walks up to a concession stand to buy a tub of popcorn, they have to be seated,"" he said. ""For many of the smaller venues there simply isn't the space for that kind of seating. ""And it will cause queuing and all manner of problems which we presume these restrictions are intended to avoid."" Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Call for pub rules to be lifted as ministers meet Cinemas in Wales have been closed since 4 December with a return now much anticipated, according to Mr Clapp. ""I would say the mood in the industry is one of frustration, you know, there is a huge amount of excitement and optimism about the return of cinema,"" he said. ""Finding an administrative barrier to that late in the day and unnecessarily we would say, in terms of the safe-guarding of customers and staff, is hugely frustrating."" Mr Clapp also said while cinemas were selling tickets for showings from next week, the likes of Cineworld and Showcase had said they would not be able to open, with Vue and Odeon having a ""significant rethink"" on whether they can reopen. Cineworld has venues in Llandudno, Broughton, Cardiff and Newport, while Showcase has a single cinema in Nantgarw. Vue has cinemas in Rhyl, Carmarthenshire, Cardiff, Merthyr Tydfil, Cwmbran and Swansea, and there are Odeons in Wrexham, Llanelli, Swansea and Bridgend. Mr Clapp said the rules were also a ""nonsense"" for the many smaller venues in Wales and the issues around collecting contact details and being seated for food were ""magnified"" for them. He continued: ""I very much fear that when we come to next Monday, even if cinemas are allowed to open, only a small minority of cinemas in Wales will feel they can viably reopen."" Beth Watkins has decided not to open her cinema in Brynmawr and is frustrated to be classed as hospitality as they do not serve alcohol or hot food Beth Watkins is chair of the trustees of the Market Hall Cinema in Brynmawr - which has been closed since mid March 2020 and has not set a date to reopen. She said: ""Most disappointingly for us is the fact that small independent cinemas, and many of them are charities like us, are being included in hospitality. ""We don't have a bar, we don't serve alcohol, we don't serve food but we still fall within that category. ""Organising for someone to be able to order a box of popcorn or a bar of chocolate from their seat is impossible for us. ""Social distancing means that out of our 195 seats around 40 tickets can be sold.  So for us it is not financially viable to reopen. You build your hopes and then suddenly you're hit by this red tape."" Steve Reynolds said there is a lot of interest in getting back into the cinema with 750 tickets sold for just one film Steve Reynolds is director of Picturedrome Cinemas, which runs the Maxime Cinema in Blackwood, which will reopen on Monday. He said: ""When we were told cinemas could open we put our programmes on sale and we've sold 750 tickets so far just for Peter Rabbit without the other films. ""Obviously we've got this obstacle now with the food and drink which has to be delivered to the seats.  We are looking at ways around that - click and collect where you can order when you reserve your tickets but it's a very difficult situation for us."" Chapter Arts Centre will reopen both its cinemas on Monday at about 30% capacity, if permitted Chapter Arts Centre, in Cardiff, will reopen its cinema at about 30% capacity on Monday, if permitted, its chairwoman Elin Wyn told BBC Radio Cymru'sDros Frecwast programme. Ms Wyn said the anticipated rules would not affect Chapter as much as the bigger chains because it had never allowed customers to eat or drink inside its two cinemas. ""The thing that would make the biggest difference for us, is if they decided to relax the 2m rule,"" she said. ""If they took it down to a metre or got rid of social distancing altogether - that's what would really change things. We could then get more people into our cinemas."" Due to different rules across the UK, cinemas in Wales are classed as hospitality and must abide to same rules as pubs and restaurants A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We have been working closely with Ffilm Cymru and UK Cinema Association to prepare for the opening of cinemas when it is safe to do so. ""Contact tracing is an important and effective part of keeping people safe. ""Cinemas have been and continue to receive support from the Welsh government's Culture Recovery Fund (CRF). Those within larger arts centres may also have received assistance from the CRF delivered via the Arts Council of Wales. ""The first minister will set out the results of the next coronavirus restrictions regulations on Friday and confirm whether cinemas can reopen in Wales next week.""

"This video can not be played Queens Speech: Starmer and Johnson on government plans Boris Johnson has said the government ""won't settle for going back to the way things were"", as the UK emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. He promised to end the ""criminal waste of talent"" in parts of the UK by spreading opportunity more evenly. It came as the government unveiled 30 planned new laws for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's programme lacked urgency and ambition. ""Today we needed a Queen's Speech that rose to scale of the moment,"" said Sir Keir, but instead, he claimed, it was ""packed with short-term gimmicks and distant promises"". Follow live: Queen's Speech and reaction What was in the Queen's Speech? Starmer: Lack of social care plan 'unforgivable' First major event for Queen since Philip's death Sir Keir seized on the absence of new legislation to fix the funding of adult social care - something he said the prime minister had promised on the steps of Downing Street two years ago. He said the government's failure to act on the issue after the pandemic was ""nothing short of an insult"" and it was ""a similar story on skills and education"". The government has promised to bring forward social care proposals later this year. Sir Keir Starmer accuses the government of dragging its heels over social care funding Many of the measures in the Queen's Speech are aimed at the Conservatives'new electoral strongholdsin the Midlands and north of England. The prime minister told MPs: ""We intend to unite and level up across the whole of our United Kingdom because we one nation Conservatives understand this crucial point - that you will find flair and imagination and enthusiasm and genius distributed evenly across this country while opportunity is not. ""And we need to change that because it is not just a moral and social disgrace, it is an economic mistake. It is a criminal waste of talent. ""And though we cannot for one moment minimise the damage that Covid has done - the loss of learning, the NHS backlogs, the courts delays, the massive fiscal consequences - we must use this opportunity to achieve a national recovery so that jabs, jabs jabs becomes jobs, jobs, jobs."" Among the planned new laws are: A Skills and Post-16 Education Bill for England, with loans for adults wanting to retrain and more powers to deal with failing colleges A bill aimed at deterring asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel A bill to ease planning controls and increase housebuilding in England Plans to improve bus and train service connectivity in England New laws to scrap the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, meaning it will be easier for Mr Johnson to call an early general election before 2024 Missing from the government's programme was a specific bill on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, although the speech saidlegislation will be introduced. Andtrade unions accused the government of ""rowing back""on a promise to protect workers' rights. Downing Street said an Employment Bill would be introduced ""when the time is right"", citing the pandemic as the reason for the delay. This video can not be played Spot the difference: How the Queen's Speech changed this year Mr Johnsoncommitted to setting up a ""full, proper"" public inquiryinto the government's handling of the pandemic, which could begin in the coming year, in response to a question from Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey. Sir Ed also raised concerns about plans to introduce voter ID for future general elections, which he said would hit the disadvantaged and ethnic minorities, and were ""straight from the Donald Trump playbook"". And he echoedcriticism of planning reformsby former Prime Minister Theresa May, who said they would hand too much power to developers and ""see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the prime minister there was a fresh mandate for a Scottish independence referendum after Thursday's elections. He also attacked ""further power grabs"" by the Westminster government in the Queen's Speech. One of the pleasures of the Queen's Speech for journalists is hearing Her Majesty reading out the political slogans of the government of the day. So 15 seconds in there was mention of the prime minister's favourite: plans to ""level up"" the country. The meaning of the phrase is gradually being refined but the agenda is still vast and encompasses jobs, schools, health, policing, industry, productivity, civic pride, the strength of local leadership and the quality of life. But the real detail in this area will come later this year when the government publishes a White Paper where it will spell out much more detail about what levelling up means and the ""bold"" action that ministers will take to achieve it. So for now the government is trumpeting what it's already doing: a Â£4.8bn fund for infrastructure projects, Â£830m for redeveloping High Streets, along with eight freeports and 40 new hospitals in England. And where there are such big promises, Labour stands ready to highlight pledges that go unmet. This year's speech also included changes to the policing of protests, including setting time and noise limits. A previous discussion of this by MPs earlier this year led toangry demonstrations. Critics say the measures impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest - but ministers say the proposals will respect human rights and will only affect very disruptive gatherings. Queen's Speech commits to Troubles legislation UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare Government to consult before conversion therapy ban A ban on so-calledconversion therapy- attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity - is also planned. The Queen's Speech is part of the State Opening of Parliament, normally the grandest of Westminster occasions. But it was pared back this year because of Covid, with fewer MPs and peers than normal gathering in the House of Lords to hear it - and the Queen arriving by car rather than the usual carriage. It was the Queen's first major public engagement since thedeath of the Duke of Edinburgh.

"This video can not be played Brits 2021: Highlights from a female-dominated night Dua Lipa demanded a pay rise for NHS workers as she won two major awards at the Brits - the UK's first major in-person ceremony of the Covid era. And Little Mix called out sexism in the music industry after becoming the first all-female outfit to win best British group. The other big winners on the night were J Hus, Harry Styles and Taylor Swift. The test event at London's O2 Arena took place with a 4,000-strong audience and no social distancing or face masks. Rappers Headie One and AJ Tracey used several verses of their performance to call out the demonisation of drill music and criticise the government, while highlighting the work done by footballer and free school meals campaigner Marcus Rashford. The best outfits from the Brit Awards red carpet Great show, shame about the videos Brits 2021: Full list of winners While the 2021 Brits were not on a leap year it was very much a Lipa year, as the singer won two of the three awards for which she was nominated. Future Nostalgia, the best-selling album released last year in the UK, predictably won best album. But it was after winning the best British female award, her first of the night, that the star called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to give nurses and NHS workers pay rises, as opposed to mere applause. This year, each of the Brit award trophies came in two parts and Dua dedicated hers to British nurse Dame Elizabeth Anionwu - who she noted has spent ""a stellar nursing career fighting racial injustice"" and ""protecting frontline workers"". ""She has also said that there's a massive disparity between gratitude and respect for frontline workers,"" said the singer. ""Because it's very good to clap for them, but we need to pay them. How much will NHS staff be paid? ""So I think what we should do, is we should all give a massive, massive round of applause and give Boris a message that we all support a fair pay rise is for our frontline."" The audience, which was packed with key workers, gave her a standing ovation. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, environment secretary George Eustice responded to Dua Lipa's speech by stressing there was a ""difficult public finance environment"". ""There's been a pay freeze for most of the public sector and it's also important to recognise that in recent years that there have been some pay rises as well, particularly for nurses and the lower paid,"" he said. ""We can't always go as far as you'd like, but it's also the case that there's a pay review that's going on into the NHS,"" he continued. The government recommended in March that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year, while many other public sector workers will have their pay frozen. Before her double win, Dua Lipa had performed a medley of hits from her latest floor-filling record. It was a visual love letter to her home city of London, complete with a Tube platform string quartet, Amy Winehouse-style beehive hair and a union jack skirt which evoked memories of Spice Girl Geri Halliwell's famous patriotic dress. The night's big winner also shared her delight at seeing more women on both the stage and the winners' podium - several years after she called out the Brits for overlooking female artists. This year, by contrast, women won four of the five mixed categories. One such example, Little Mix dedicated their award to some of the great all-female bands who could and should have won in previous years. ""It's not easy, being a female in the UK pop industry,"" said Leigh-Anne Pinnock while accepting their award. ""We've seen white male dominance, misogyny and sexism, and a lack of diversity. ""We're proud that we've stuck together, surrounded ourselves with strong women and are now using our voices more than ever."" ""The fact that a girl band has never won this award really does speak volumes,"" added bandmate Jade Thirlwall. ""So this award isn't just for us, it's for the Spice Girls, Sugababes, All Saints, Girls Aloud. ""All of the incredible female bands - this one's for you."" Since the departure of Jesy Nelson, Little Mix are now a three-piece. Two of them - Pinnock and Perrie Edwards - have recently announced that they are pregnant. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC the day after Little Mix's speech, former Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts said: ""They absolutely deserved that award last night and it's long overdue. I feel very proud of the girls because obviously they've been going for 10 years and it's not too dissimilar from the story of Girls Aloud."" She told 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake: ""We were nominated a good few times for that award but we never received it, it was always a male indie band that would be recognised."" Elsewhere, rapper J Hus was not on hand on the night to pick up his award for best male solo star. But Harry Styles was - in typically well-tailored fashion, sporting a brown and white Gucci suit - to collect best British single for his ubiquitous hit Watermelon Sugar. If last month's Oscars took place in tinsel town then the Brits was very much tonsil town, as spectators underwent Covid tests on their way into the event. The event formed part the government's pilot scheme for reopening live events safely, which includes the forthcoming FA Cup Final. The live audience of about 4,000 people was about one-fifth of the O2's capacity and more than half of the ticket-holders were key workers from Greater London and their guests. Several performances were pre-recorded including Coldplay's show opener from a pontoon on the River Thames, and another from best international male The Weeknd. After being introduced by Jackie Weaver - of local council Zoom meeting fame - Chris Martin and co played their new single Higher Power with a little help from some holograms and pyrotechnics. Sir Elton John later appeared on tape too alongside Years & Years star Olly Alexander for a rendition of Pet Shop Boys track It's a Sin, title track of the latter's recent drama series. This video can not be played Dua Lipa is among the music stars readjusting to being back on a red carpet Before the event, US pop star Taylor Swift - who best international group-winners Haim described as ""the most incredible human being"" - was announced as the first female winner of the global icon award. Swift, who normally resides in Los Angeles, was there in-person to accept it and also praised the ""help and support we got from the NHS"" over the past year. Allow Twitter content?

In the only other award announced beforehand, young singer Griff was named as the winner of the rising star prize, and she demonstrated why with a career-making performance. Previous winners of the award include Adele, who went on to win a host of more senior Brit Awards in the years that followed. Another star in bloom, Arlo Parks, said it was ""a dream come true"" to win the breakthrough award and she sang - in front of a garden centre's worth of sunflowers - like she had been doing it forever. The event finished with a collaboration between Rag 'n' Bone Man, a virtual Pink, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Choir. Before teeing them up, comedian Jack Whitehall, hosting the awards for a fourth time, gave ""a massive big up to the key workers here tonight, and across the country"". ""We will never be able to thank you guys enough,"" he said.

"Upsides to living on St Michael's Mount include sea views but the downside is no pizza deliveries If you love sea views and can live without pizza deliveries then a unique job opportunity could be for you. The historic island of St Michael's Mount, off the coast of Cornwall, is looking for a new castle officer. The estate wants someone who can stay at the castle at least five nights a week and take a ""hands-on approach"" to maintenance duties. But those who suffer from sea sickness need not apply, as the only way on and off the island at high tide is by boat. Castle steward Duncan Murdoch said: ""The best thing about living here is having a sea view from every window. ""The worst thing is not being able to get a pizza delivered to your door."" A causeway, which is submerged at high tide, is the only land route between the island and the mainland The island is jointly run by the National Trust and St Aubyn Estates - and the St Aubyn family live in the castle. The estate said it was looking for someone discreet and compassionate with a tactful demeanour. It added: ""[You will] have a strong motivation to be based in West Cornwall,"" where the tidal island takes a commanding position in Mount's Bay. Other duties include a hands-on approach to conservation and checking the public rooms at the end of each day. Kate Cornwell, head of HR at St Aubyn Estates, added: ""People who suffer from sea sickness need not apply - you'll need to love boats as it's the only way to get on and off the island at high tide."" The island was acquired by the St Aubyn family following the English Civil War The castle dates back to 1135 when construction is said to have begun. Situated 500 yards off the coast, the island is reached by ferry boats to and from Marazion. A causeway, which is submerged at high tide, is the only land route between the island and the mainland. The island takes its name from St Michael who supposedly appeared to a group of fishermen in 495 AD. The oldest surviving buildings date from the 12th Century, when a Benedictine priory was founded there. Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"Lord Frost said the protocol is presenting significant challenges for many in Northern Ireland The UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost has said it is hard to see that the way the Northern Ireland Protocol is currently operating ""can be sustainable for long"". He was speaking after a visit to Northern Ireland. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which creates a border in the Irish Sea. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation in 2020. It keeps NI in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. Lord Frost met businesses from several sectors including aerospace, food, retail, and life sciences. He also visited the Border Control Post at Larne Harbour. Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? Irish Sea border 'still causing difficulties' He said: ""It's clear from my visit that the protocol is presenting significant challenges for many in Northern Ireland. ""Businesses have gone to extraordinary efforts to make the current requirements work, but it is hard to see that the way the protocol is currently operating can be sustainable for long."" He added that he hoped the EU would take a ""pragmatic way forward"" and that the UK government will ""continue to consider all our options in meeting our overriding responsibility for sustaining the peace and prosperity of everyone in Northern Ireland"". UK and EU officials are currently engaged in low key talks aimed at simplifying the operation of the protocol. The NI Protocol means significant new paperwork, processes and checks when importing materials and equipment from Great Britain Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney says there is pressure to come up with solutions by June, ahead of the loyalist marching season. Speaking on Monday after a meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, Mr Coveney said: ""I think there is a pressure that we find a way to come up with solutions by some point in June, and I think the Commission is very much aware of that and I'm sure the British government is too."" He continued: ""It's not for me as an Irish minister to be setting deadlines. ""My role in this is to work as part of the EU, but also to reach out to colleagues in London as well, and of course in Belfast, to find a sensible, pragmatic way forward here that everyone can live with.""

"A pilot event was recently held in Circus nightclub in Liverpool - with no masks or social distancing Nightclubs have called on Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford to give a date when the sector can plan to reopen without restrictions. An industry body warned ministers could be condemning thousands of businesses to bankruptcy without a date and extra financial help. One licensee said some operators were ""desperate"" and running out of cash. The Welsh government said any decision to relax restrictions must be based on the latest advice. But it said it would give businesses ""as much notice as possible"". Businesses fear that under current plans they have ""no hope"" of resuming trade except for test events. In England the UK government has given a tentative date of 21 June at the earliest for when nightclubs may be allowed to reopen. No date has been set in Wales. Mr Drakeford is expected to reveal his next steps on Covid at a press conference on Friday, following discussions with ministers on Monday. Coronavirus case rates currently stand at the lowest since last August, with 8.6 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Health boss 'confident' in Covid gig pilot success Pubs and restaurants reopen outdoors in Wales Friends soak up the sun as restrictions ease Nick Newman, a licensee at Croeso Pubs which owns the Philharmonic and Brewhouse venues in Cardiff, said the situation was bad for nightclub businesses. The chairman of the Cardiff Licensee Forum said: ""There's still a huge sector of our business which has no clarity whatsoever as to when it's going to reopen - nightclubs, venues that specialise in music. ""I know operators of nightclubs who are quite frankly desperate - there's no money left in the bank account. ""The licensees forum compromises roughly 100 businesses - or at least it did before the pandemic started. We've probably lost eight or nine businesses through this. Some of them are smallish businesses - some have been quite iconic."" Pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen indoors from 17 May, with four allowed to meet inside venues. But Mr Newman warned that would have a ""crippling effect"" on traders' ability to trade profitably. ""The way the night time economy has been treated in Wales during the pandemic just isn't good enough,"" he added. It is not clear when nightclubs in Wales will be able to reopen Under the current system, coronavirus restrictions are set according to which alert level the Welsh government believes is needed, according to what the risk is deemed to be. The traffic light control plan has nightclubs and late-night entertainment venues closed at all coronavirus alert levels, except for pilot events at the low risk alert level one. Mr Drakeford has dubbed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap for England""very optimistic"". Wales is currently in the high risk alert level three, with plans to move into alert level two if rates remain low on Monday. An open letter from the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) asks for ""an indicative date for when nightclubs, entertainment-led, and late-night venues will be able to reopen without restrictions"". ""Under the alert levels as described in the current 'control plan', these businesses have no hope for reopening other than for test events in the lowest alert level. ""We would stress the importance for our sector of knowing when they will be able to operate without or with minimal restrictions and take deliberate decisions about staffing, debt and investment now, as night time economy businesses in England are currently doing."" It asks for additional financial support: ""Welsh government support initiatives to date have been neither sufficient nor comprehensive enough to prevent many businesses in the sector falling into significant debt. ""Without either a clear path to unrestricted opening, or extended and enhanced financial support, the Welsh government is condemning thousands of businesses in our sector.... to bankruptcy,"" it added. The letter also calls for consistency for groups that can meet indoors and outdoors - six are currently able to meet outside, and for guidance to be changed so it does not ""discriminate"" against venues with amplified sound and music. It is backed by licensee groups in Cardiff and Swansea. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said only businesses in England could have ""some optimism"" of reopening soon. ""In Wales, we've only got 17 May as a date to cling on to for indoor hospitality,"" she told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""We do need that same timeline, that same line of sight that we've got in England and in Scotland, to be able to look at reopening those closed segments of the economy and then looking forward to ending all restrictions altogether."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We understand the difficulties faced by all businesses, and particularly those involved in the night-time economy. ""We will continue to work with the sector and give businesses as much notice as possible. However, any decision to relax restrictions must be based on the latest medical and scientific advice."" A recent set of pilot events took place in Liverpool, with a music festival, two club nights and a business conference heldwith no masks or social distancing.

Since the departure of Jesy Nelson, Little Mix are now a three-piece. Two of them - Pinnock and Perrie Edwards - have recently announced that they are pregnant. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC the day after Little Mix's speech, former Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts said: ""They absolutely deserved that award last night and it's long overdue. I feel very proud of the girls because obviously they've been going for 10 years and it's not too dissimilar from the story of Girls Aloud."" She told 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake: ""We were nominated a good few times for that award but we never received it, it was always a male indie band that would be recognised."" Elsewhere, rapper J Hus was not on hand on the night to pick up his award for best male solo star. But Harry Styles was - in typically well-tailored fashion, sporting a brown and white Gucci suit - to collect best British single for his ubiquitous hit Watermelon Sugar. If last month's Oscars took place in tinsel town then the Brits was very much tonsil town, as spectators underwent Covid tests on their way into the event. The event formed part the government's pilot scheme for reopening live events safely, which includes the forthcoming FA Cup Final. The live audience of about 4,000 people was about one-fifth of the O2's capacity and more than half of the ticket-holders were key workers from Greater London and their guests. Several performances were pre-recorded including Coldplay's show opener from a pontoon on the River Thames, and another from best international male The Weeknd. After being introduced by Jackie Weaver - of local council Zoom meeting fame - Chris Martin and co played their new single Higher Power with a little help from some holograms and pyrotechnics. Sir Elton John later appeared on tape too alongside Years & Years star Olly Alexander for a rendition of Pet Shop Boys track It's a Sin, title track of the latter's recent drama series. This video can not be played Dua Lipa is among the music stars readjusting to being back on a red carpet Before the event, US pop star Taylor Swift - who best international group-winners Haim described as ""the most incredible human being"" - was announced as the first female winner of the global icon award. Swift, who normally resides in Los Angeles, was there in-person to accept it and also praised the ""help and support we got from the NHS"" over the past year. Allow Twitter content?

In the only other award announced beforehand, young singer Griff was named as the winner of the rising star prize, and she demonstrated why with a career-making performance. Previous winners of the award include Adele, who went on to win a host of more senior Brit Awards in the years that followed. Another star in bloom, Arlo Parks, said it was ""a dream come true"" to win the breakthrough award and she sang - in front of a garden centre's worth of sunflowers - like she had been doing it forever. The event finished with a collaboration between Rag 'n' Bone Man, a virtual Pink, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Choir. Before teeing them up, comedian Jack Whitehall, hosting the awards for a fourth time, gave ""a massive big up to the key workers here tonight, and across the country"". ""We will never be able to thank you guys enough,"" he said.

"Texts published by the Treasury Committee reveal the extent of David Cameron's lobbying for the now-collapsed firm Greensill Capital. Between 5 March and 26 June 2020, the ex-PM and his staff sent ministers and officials 45 messages on behalf of the company, including to the chancellor. The committee is examining Mr Cameron's role in trying to access government funding for the financial company. Company founder Lex Greensill appeared at the committee earlier on Tuesday. Answering questions from MPs, Mr Greensill said he bore ""complete responsibility"" for the failure of his company adding that he was ""desperately saddened"" by the job losses. Mr Cameron is due to face MPs on the same committee on Thursday afternoon. Reports of Mr Cameron's lobbying for Greensill prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to order a review by lawyer Nigel Boardman into decisions made in government around the finance scheme and the role of Mr Greensill. The Treasury Committeealso published a letterfrom the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in which it confirmed it is formally investigating the company. In full: David Cameron's Greensill statement Government launches probe into Cameron's lobbying What is the David Cameron lobbying row about? The Treasury Committee's documents - provided by Mr Cameron - revealed that the former prime minister made strenuous efforts on behalf of Greensill including sending nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 texts to Sir Tom Scholar, the permanent secretary of the Treasury. Mr Cameron also contacted Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi, as well as ministers in the Treasury. Greensill had hoped to take part in a government scheme - the Covid Corporate Financing Facility (CCFF) - set up to help businesses during the pandemic. However the Treasury rejected their application concluding the firm's proposals were not suitable. On 3 April, Mr Cameron contacted Sir Tom: ""Again Greensill have got a ""no"". Am genuinely baffled. Letter says CCFF is there to provide liquidity for ""non financial corporates"". That is what we do. The fact the notes are issued by a financial entity is irrelevant. The recipients of the money are all non financials and mostly SMEs [Small and medium enterprises]! Can I have 5 minutes for a call? This seems bonkers.  Am now calling CX, Gove, everyone."" And on the same day he messaged Mr Sunak: ""HMT are refusing to extend CCFF to include supply chain finance, which is nuts as it pumps billions of cheap credit into SMEs... think there is a simple misunderstanding that I can explain."" Also on 3 April, Mr Cameron messaged Mr Gove: ""I know you are manically busy - and doing a great job, by the way (this is bloody hard and I think the team is coping extremely well). But do you have a moment for a word? I am on this number and v free."" This video can not be played Lex Greensill appears before Treasury Select Committee Later that month on 22 April, Mr Cameron wrote to Mr Sunak: ""Just to report back. Three weeks later and while constructive conversations have taken place, the situation is still stuck."" ""Could you try and give it another nudge over the finish line - this is clearly in the national interest, creates instant value for tens of thousands of SMEs and complies with the spirit (and we believe the letter) of the CCFF Market Notice?"" Responding to criticism over his lobbying efforts, Mr Cameron released a statement last month in which he acknowledged he should have contacted the government ""through only the most formal of channels"". However, he insisted that he had not broken any codes of conduct or government rules on lobbying. The collapse of Greensill - which filed for insolvency in March - has threatened thousands of UK jobs at Liberty Steel, which was dependent on it for its financing. Giving evidence to the Treasury Committee, Mr Greensill said that his company had sought to take part in the CCFF scheme to ensure ""continued liquidity"" for its clients which included small businesses. Committee chair Mel Stride asked if he was also motivated by a desire to ""shore up against potential problems"" Greensill itself might face during the pandemic. Mr Greensill replied that his company had ""at no time sought funding for itself"" from the CCFF scheme. He also said there had been ""no loss to the UK taxpayer"" from Greensill's collapse.

"This video can not be played Brits 2021: Highlights from a female-dominated night Dua Lipa demanded a pay rise for NHS workers as she won two major awards at the Brits - the UK's first major in-person ceremony of the Covid era. And Little Mix called out sexism in the music industry after becoming the first all-female outfit to win best British group. The other big winners on the night were J Hus, Harry Styles and Taylor Swift. The test event at London's O2 Arena took place with a 4,000-strong audience and no social distancing or face masks. Rappers Headie One and AJ Tracey used several verses of their performance to call out the demonisation of drill music and criticise the government, while highlighting the work done by footballer and free school meals campaigner Marcus Rashford. The best outfits from the Brit Awards red carpet Great show, shame about the videos Brits 2021: Full list of winners While the 2021 Brits were not on a leap year it was very much a Lipa year, as the singer won two of the three awards for which she was nominated. Future Nostalgia, the best-selling album released last year in the UK, predictably won best album. But it was after winning the best British female award, her first of the night, that the star called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to give nurses and NHS workers pay rises, as opposed to mere applause. This year, each of the Brit award trophies came in two parts and Dua dedicated hers to British nurse Dame Elizabeth Anionwu - who she noted has spent ""a stellar nursing career fighting racial injustice"" and ""protecting frontline workers"". ""She has also said that there's a massive disparity between gratitude and respect for frontline workers,"" said the singer. ""Because it's very good to clap for them, but we need to pay them. How much will NHS staff be paid? ""So I think what we should do, is we should all give a massive, massive round of applause and give Boris a message that we all support a fair pay rise is for our frontline."" The audience, which was packed with key workers, gave her a standing ovation. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, environment secretary George Eustice responded to Dua Lipa's speech by stressing there was a ""difficult public finance environment"". ""There's been a pay freeze for most of the public sector and it's also important to recognise that in recent years that there have been some pay rises as well, particularly for nurses and the lower paid,"" he said. ""We can't always go as far as you'd like, but it's also the case that there's a pay review that's going on into the NHS,"" he continued. The government recommended in March that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year, while many other public sector workers will have their pay frozen. Before her double win, Dua Lipa had performed a medley of hits from her latest floor-filling record. It was a visual love letter to her home city of London, complete with a Tube platform string quartet, Amy Winehouse-style beehive hair and a union jack skirt which evoked memories of Spice Girl Geri Halliwell's famous patriotic dress. The night's big winner also shared her delight at seeing more women on both the stage and the winners' podium - several years after she called out the Brits for overlooking female artists. This year, by contrast, women won four of the five mixed categories. One such example, Little Mix dedicated their award to some of the great all-female bands who could and should have won in previous years. ""It's not easy, being a female in the UK pop industry,"" said Leigh-Anne Pinnock while accepting their award. ""We've seen white male dominance, misogyny and sexism, and a lack of diversity. ""We're proud that we've stuck together, surrounded ourselves with strong women and are now using our voices more than ever."" ""The fact that a girl band has never won this award really does speak volumes,"" added bandmate Jade Thirlwall. ""So this award isn't just for us, it's for the Spice Girls, Sugababes, All Saints, Girls Aloud. ""All of the incredible female bands - this one's for you."" Since the departure of Jesy Nelson, Little Mix are now a three-piece. Two of them - Pinnock and Perrie Edwards - have recently announced that they are pregnant. Allow Twitter content?

"Mary used to work at the cafe where Fred West was a regular customer Police are searching for a body at a cafe in Gloucester linked to a girl feared to have been murdered by serial killer Fred West. Mary Bastholm, 15, went missing on 6 January 1968 and has not been found. Officers were called to The Clean Plate by filmmakers working on a documentary. West was a regular customer when the teenager worked at the cafe. The film crew told police on Friday they had found evidence that a body could be buried within the property. Officers could be at the site ""for a number of weeks"" and excavation work is yet to begin, Gloucestershire Police said. Gloucestershire Police said the search might alarm those who worked nearby but it would carry out a proportionate investigation Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said: ""This could be a significant development on a case which has gained a lot of public interest over the years. ""On the basis of the information provided to us, we consider this to be new and potentially important evidence in the case of Mary Bastholm, however further detailed assessments will take place over the following few days to determine the extent of excavation needed. ""First and foremost our thoughts are with Mary's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time."" In a statement released via the force, Miss Bastholm's family said: ""We are aware of the ongoing developments around Mary's disappearance and are being kept up to date and supported by Gloucestershire Police family liaison officers. ""At this time please may we ask for privacy so we can grieve for Mary."" Police have begun removing evidence from the site A white tent has been set up outside the building in Southgate Street and officers are stationed at the scene. The cafe is close to Cromwell Street, where officers found the bodies of West's victims at the home he shared with his wife Rosemary. A spokesperson for The Nelson Trust, a women's charity that owns The Clean Plate, said: ""As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we have done everything we can to accommodate the investigation. ""The Clean Plate will remain closed until all necessary activity is complete. ""It is an extraordinary twist of fate that this building, now associated with a story as tragic as that of the victims of Fred and Rosemary West, is part of a charity working to support women at risk from violence."" A police cordon has been set up around the property By Andrew Plant, BBC News Mary Bastholm disappeared at a bus stop on her way to meet her boyfriend. There has been no trace of her since. It's been a mystery for 53 years. The cafe has been there for decades and has been under several different names. One of its waitresses was Mary, who was 15 at the time when Fred West was a regular customer and was known to him. It was also known he was a builder at the time renovation was needed on the cellar and the toilets at the cafe - work he was believed to have carried out in 1968. A lot of people locally put two and two together and suggested that perhaps he was responsible for her disappearance and that was where she ended up. Police say their activity will take place over a number of weeks and there will be disruption for some time. Fred West took his own life while awaiting trial for the murders of 12 people In 2012, a petition was set up calling for afresh investigationinto Miss Bastholm's disappearance but it was rejected by then Chief Constable Tony Melville. In 1994, West admitted murdering his daughter Heather. The confession came as police began to search 25 Cromwell Street, where they found the bodies of nine girls and young women. He and his wife Rose were jointly charged with nine murders and he was charged with a further three. West took his own life while awaiting the murder trial the following year. West's former home, 25 Cromwell Street, has been demolished and was replaced with a walkway The impact of the West murders 25 years on Gloucestershire Constabulary New plan revealed for proposed Thornbury Lidl store Police and army spotted in Cotswold village after incident Second phase of work on famous Cirencester walk starting this month Stroud woman in VW Polo was 'unfit to drive' due to alcohol Stroud lager thief who also assaulted woman due in court Woman caught in  VW Polo near Cirencester was 'unfit to drive' due to alcohol Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas says No 10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"". In her constituency, Hackney South and Shoreditch, the average house price is 17 times of the average wage, she states. She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Upsides to living on St Michael's Mount include sea views but the downside is no pizza deliveries If you love sea views and can live without pizza deliveries then a unique job opportunity could be for you. The historic island of St Michael's Mount, off the coast of Cornwall, is looking for a new castle officer. The estate wants someone who can stay at the castle at least five nights a week and take a ""hands-on approach"" to maintenance duties. But those who suffer from sea sickness need not apply, as the only way on and off the island at high tide is by boat. Castle steward Duncan Murdoch said: ""The best thing about living here is having a sea view from every window. ""The worst thing is not being able to get a pizza delivered to your door."" A causeway, which is submerged at high tide, is the only land route between the island and the mainland The island is jointly run by the National Trust and St Aubyn Estates - and the St Aubyn family live in the castle. The estate said it was looking for someone discreet and compassionate with a tactful demeanour. It added: ""[You will] have a strong motivation to be based in West Cornwall,"" where the tidal island takes a commanding position in Mount's Bay. Other duties include a hands-on approach to conservation and checking the public rooms at the end of each day. Kate Cornwell, head of HR at St Aubyn Estates, added: ""People who suffer from sea sickness need not apply - you'll need to love boats as it's the only way to get on and off the island at high tide."" The island was acquired by the St Aubyn family following the English Civil War The castle dates back to 1135 when construction is said to have begun. Situated 500 yards off the coast, the island is reached by ferry boats to and from Marazion. A causeway, which is submerged at high tide, is the only land route between the island and the mainland. The island takes its name from St Michael who supposedly appeared to a group of fishermen in 495 AD. The oldest surviving buildings date from the 12th Century, when a Benedictine priory was founded there. Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches.

BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"". In her constituency, Hackney South and Shoreditch, the average house price is 17 times of the average wage, she states. She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Brits 2021: Highlights from a female-dominated night Dua Lipa demanded a pay rise for NHS workers as she won two major awards at the Brits - the UK's first major in-person ceremony of the Covid era. And Little Mix called out sexism in the music industry after becoming the first all-female outfit to win best British group. The other big winners on the night were J Hus, Harry Styles and Taylor Swift. The test event at London's O2 Arena took place with a 4,000-strong audience and no social distancing or face masks. Rappers Headie One and AJ Tracey used several verses of their performance to call out the demonisation of drill music and criticise the government, while highlighting the work done by footballer and free school meals campaigner Marcus Rashford. The best outfits from the Brit Awards red carpet Great show, shame about the videos Brits 2021: Full list of winners While the 2021 Brits were not on a leap year it was very much a Lipa year, as the singer won two of the three awards for which she was nominated. Future Nostalgia, the best-selling album released last year in the UK, predictably won best album. But it was after winning the best British female award, her first of the night, that the star called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to give nurses and NHS workers pay rises, as opposed to mere applause. This year, each of the Brit award trophies came in two parts and Dua dedicated hers to British nurse Dame Elizabeth Anionwu - who she noted has spent ""a stellar nursing career fighting racial injustice"" and ""protecting frontline workers"". ""She has also said that there's a massive disparity between gratitude and respect for frontline workers,"" said the singer. ""Because it's very good to clap for them, but we need to pay them. How much will NHS staff be paid? ""So I think what we should do, is we should all give a massive, massive round of applause and give Boris a message that we all support a fair pay rise is for our frontline."" The audience, which was packed with key workers, gave her a standing ovation. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, environment secretary George Eustice responded to Dua Lipa's speech by stressing there was a ""difficult public finance environment"". ""There's been a pay freeze for most of the public sector and it's also important to recognise that in recent years that there have been some pay rises as well, particularly for nurses and the lower paid,"" he said. ""We can't always go as far as you'd like, but it's also the case that there's a pay review that's going on into the NHS,"" he continued. The government recommended in March that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year, while many other public sector workers will have their pay frozen. Before her double win, Dua Lipa had performed a medley of hits from her latest floor-filling record. It was a visual love letter to her home city of London, complete with a Tube platform string quartet, Amy Winehouse-style beehive hair and a union jack skirt which evoked memories of Spice Girl Geri Halliwell's famous patriotic dress. The night's big winner also shared her delight at seeing more women on both the stage and the winners' podium - several years after she called out the Brits for overlooking female artists. This year, by contrast, women won four of the five mixed categories. One such example, Little Mix dedicated their award to some of the great all-female bands who could and should have won in previous years. ""It's not easy, being a female in the UK pop industry,"" said Leigh-Anne Pinnock while accepting their award. ""We've seen white male dominance, misogyny and sexism, and a lack of diversity. ""We're proud that we've stuck together, surrounded ourselves with strong women and are now using our voices more than ever."" ""The fact that a girl band has never won this award really does speak volumes,"" added bandmate Jade Thirlwall. ""So this award isn't just for us, it's for the Spice Girls, Sugababes, All Saints, Girls Aloud. ""All of the incredible female bands - this one's for you."" Since the departure of Jesy Nelson, Little Mix are now a three-piece. Two of them - Pinnock and Perrie Edwards - have recently announced that they are pregnant. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to the BBC the day after Little Mix's speech, former Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts said: ""They absolutely deserved that award last night and it's long overdue. I feel very proud of the girls because obviously they've been going for 10 years and it's not too dissimilar from the story of Girls Aloud."" She told 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake: ""We were nominated a good few times for that award but we never received it, it was always a male indie band that would be recognised."" Elsewhere, rapper J Hus was not on hand on the night to pick up his award for best male solo star. But Harry Styles was - in typically well-tailored fashion, sporting a brown and white Gucci suit - to collect best British single for his ubiquitous hit Watermelon Sugar. If last month's Oscars took place in tinsel town then the Brits was very much tonsil town, as spectators underwent Covid tests on their way into the event. The event formed part the government's pilot scheme for reopening live events safely, which includes the forthcoming FA Cup Final. The live audience of about 4,000 people was about one-fifth of the O2's capacity and more than half of the ticket-holders were key workers from Greater London and their guests. Several performances were pre-recorded including Coldplay's show opener from a pontoon on the River Thames, and another from best international male The Weeknd. After being introduced by Jackie Weaver - of local council Zoom meeting fame - Chris Martin and co played their new single Higher Power with a little help from some holograms and pyrotechnics. Sir Elton John later appeared on tape too alongside Years & Years star Olly Alexander for a rendition of Pet Shop Boys track It's a Sin, title track of the latter's recent drama series. This video can not be played Dua Lipa is among the music stars readjusting to being back on a red carpet Before the event, US pop star Taylor Swift - who best international group-winners Haim described as ""the most incredible human being"" - was announced as the first female winner of the global icon award. Swift, who normally resides in Los Angeles, was there in-person to accept it and also praised the ""help and support we got from the NHS"" over the past year. Allow Twitter content?

In the only other award announced beforehand, young singer Griff was named as the winner of the rising star prize, and she demonstrated why with a career-making performance. Previous winners of the award include Adele, who went on to win a host of more senior Brit Awards in the years that followed. Another star in bloom, Arlo Parks, said it was ""a dream come true"" to win the breakthrough award and she sang - in front of a garden centre's worth of sunflowers - like she had been doing it forever. The event finished with a collaboration between Rag 'n' Bone Man, a virtual Pink, and the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust Choir. Before teeing them up, comedian Jack Whitehall, hosting the awards for a fourth time, gave ""a massive big up to the key workers here tonight, and across the country"".

"The Prince of Wales has spoken about how his family have ""an empty seat at their dinner table"" after the death of his father, the Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Charles made the comment during a video message wishing Muslims an Eid Mubarak ahead of the end of Ramadan. He said the last year had been ""deeply challenging for us all"" and he was ""only too aware of the impact of the pandemic on the Muslim community"". Prince Philip, the UK's longest-serving royal consort, died aged 99 on 9 April. Dear papa was very special, says Charles Royals reflect on the 'rock in the Queenâs life' First major event for Queen since Philip's death In a video posted by the Naz Legacy Foundation, a charity promoting education and integration, Prince Charles said: ""This year so many families, like my own, will have an empty seat at their dinner table and friends are no longer able to share the celebratory hug after Eid prayer."" The message was shared with young people from the foundation and the British Asian Trust, who were taking part in a virtual iftar, the evening meal where Muslims break their daily Ramadan fast, on Monday. The iftar meal is usually shared with family and friends but such gatherings have been restricted during the pandemic. The end of Ramadan, during which Muslims fast during daylight hours for a month, is marked with a celebration called Eid. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Video shows students escaping from school windows Seven children and two adults have been killed in a shooting at a school in the Russian city of Kazan, officials say. Twenty-one other people, mostly children, were injured. A 19-year-old suspect was detained. The attack happened in the capital of the republic of Tatarstan, 820km (510 miles) east of Moscow. Russian PM Mikhail Mishustin spoke of ""great sorrow"" while Tatarstan's leader Rustam Minnikhanov described the attack as a ""major tragedy"". ""We are deeply saddened that this has happened,"" he said. Responding to the shooting, Russian President Vladimir Putin saidhe would review the country's gun control laws. School shootings are relatively rare in Russia. One of the last major incidentshappened in Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018. Mr Minnikhanov confirmed the deaths of seven children - four boys and three girls - as well as a female teacher and a female school worker at School No 175. It is believed the children were eighth graders (aged around 15). Eighteen children and three adults were being treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds, fractures and bruising, Mr Minnikhanov added. The attack began at about 09:20 local time (06:20 GMT), a source in the emergency services told Russian news agency Tass. The first signal from a panic button at the school was sent five minutes later. ""Everyone started panicking and saying 'shut the doors',"" a student who witnessed the attack told the Mediazona news website. ""About a minute later the head teacher started yelling: 'We're shutting the doors!' Armed police arrived at the school and then sealed off the fourth floor, reports said ""We got out about 15 minutes later, not out of the windows. I wanted to do that, but the teacher closed the window immediately and said no."" Footage shared on social media shows some children jumping from windows to escape as well as injured people being evacuated. Russian TV reported that two of the children had died after jumping from a second-floor window. Heavily armed police and emergency vehicles responded to the incident. A Kazan resident outside the school told Moscow Echo radio station that people there were hysterical. ""Parents are crying, medics are giving out medicine,"" she said. Elvira Ignatyeva, a 25-year-old English teacher, was killed trying to shield one of the children, a police source told Tass news agency, quoting eyewitnesses. She had pushed the child out of the way in a corridor and tried to block the gunman but was shot and mortally wounded, the source said. On her Instagram account, Ms Ignatyeva had often posted upbeat messages over photos of herself enjoying walks  and nights out. ""It's not that hard to make your life happy,"" she wrote on 1 February. You just need to stop thinking that happiness is only possible somewhere over there, in the future, and learn to enjoy every actual minute, here and now..."" Allow Instagram content?

Reports initially said that there were two gunmen and that one of them had been killed. But officials later said there was only one suspect, named locally as Ilnaz Galyaviev. Russian investigators say he is a Kazan resident and it is believed he once studied at the school. Medics comforted relatives of students at the school Mr Minnikhanov said the suspect was a registered firearm owner. According to Russian MP Alexander Khinshteyn, the suspect received a firearms licence only recently. The MP said it was for a semi-automatic shotgun. Officials did not comment on the possible motive for the attack although Mr Minnikhanov called the attacker a ""terrorist"". The suspect went on social media before the attack, posting that he planned to kill a ""huge number"" of people before shooting himself. Screenshots of his account, now blocked, show him wearing a black mask with the word ""god"" written across it in red.

Authorities have called for all schools in Tatarstan to be inspected and have their security stepped up. A day of mourning will be held on Wednesday to honour the victims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin had ordered the chief of Russia's National Guard to ""work out as a matter of urgency new regulations on the types of weapon that can be in civilian circulation and that can be owned by the public"". The instruction was issued ""given the type of firearm used by the shooter"", Mr Peskov said. ""The fact is that sometimes types of small arms are registered as hunting weapons, which in some countries are used as assault rifles,"" he explained. Russia to tighten gun rules after school shooting School shooting tragedy leaves Russia in shock Olga Ivshina, BBC News People in Kazan seem to be completely shocked and devastated by what has happened. It is a big city - with more than one million people - which has enjoyed peace and stability over the past decade. Schools in Kazan - as well as in most other Russian cities - are not really guarded. Usually it is just one or two unarmed private security guards who meet people coming to the school at the gates. Often many of these so-called security officers are pensioners with no special training. But even if they had any it is hard to confront an armed person with bare hands. It is worth mentioning that the Kazan gunman allegedly used a gun very similar to one the attacker in Crimea used in 2018. It is a relatively cheap but powerful rifle which can be bought for the equivalent of just $280 (Â£200). There are a lot of discussions now in Russia about whether the regulations for civilian gun ownership should be changed. Shootings at schools are relatively rare in Russia compared with other countries. In November 2019 a 19-year-old student shot dead a classmate and injured three others before killing himself in the far eastern city of Blagoveshchensk. Investigators said the motive for the attack may have been a personal conflict In October 2018 a teenager armed with a semi-automatic shotgunkilled 20 people at a technical college in the city of Kerchin Russian-annexed Crimea. He then shot himself dead In February 2013, a 15-year-old student shot dead a teacher and a police officer, injuring a second police officer, when he took hostages at a school in Moscow. Investigators saidthe killer appeared to have had an ""emotional breakdown"" Are you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

We'll be back tomorrow, but here are the top stories: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff on strike at a hospital near Paris, France Here are some of the day's key developments from around the world: The US will attempt to boost its vaccination campaign by partnering with ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft to provide free transport to and from tens of thousands of sites, the White House says. ""People will be able to simply select a vaccination site near them, follow simple directions to redeem their ride, and then get a ride to take them to and from a nearby vaccination site free of charge,""the Biden administration said in a statement,externaltoday. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until 4 July. President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70% of the US adult population vaccinated with at least one shot by 4 July to ensure safer Independence Day gatherings.

""Bio-secure bubbles"" enabled England's men to play international cricket last summer The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announceda loss of Â£16.1m in the past financial yearas a result of the pandemic. The postponed launch of The Hundred tournament was cited as one reason for a drop in revenue, alongside the cost of running bio-secure cricket. The loss has been transferred to their reserves, which now stand at Â£2.2m - down from more than Â£70m in 2016. Scott Smith, chief financial officer at the ECB, said: ""This has been a challenging year, but by being able to stage international cricket and by taking decisive action early in the pandemic, we have been able to support the network and avoid a far worse financial scenario. ""There remains considerable uncertainty over the year ahead, but we hope that delivering another full summer of cricket - and with crowds beginning to return from next week - we are able to protect the revenue we need to invest in growing our game."" Jo Goodman is part of a group of bereaved families campaigning for an inquiry A bit more now on the prime minister's promise thatthere will be a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic within the current Parliamentary session. Boris Johnson made the comments earlier during a debate in the House of Commons - the first time he has put a timeframe on when a probe into the pandemic will be held. He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future. The Prime Minister knows that and he's said as much.
""So why does he think it can wait? Who delays learning critical lessons that can save lives? This video can not be played Queen's Speech: State Opening of Parliament Slovakia's health ministry has ordered a halt to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people receiving their first doses following the death of a 47-year-old woman. The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham is asking the government for everyone over the age of 16 in the region to get a Covid vaccine to curb the spread of the Indian variant. Andy Burnham said it came after a ""worrying"" spike of cases in Bolton among the under-25s, which has seen cases double in a week.

A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced.

A body representing night-time economy businesses in Scotland has said the sector has been ""left in limbo"" over reopening due to a lack of clarity on dates from the government. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland, which has previously launched legal action against the Scottish government over the emergency coronavirus legislation put in place last year, has called for more certainty for the sector. NTIA Scotland chairman, Mike Grieve, said: ""As our neighbours south of the border prepare to unlock and remove all restrictions within the coming weeks, in Scotland we remain stuck in perpetual limbo with still no indicative date for reopening or even an outline of the conditions which will allow nightlife to restart. He called on the government to establish an ""a constructive path towards the unrestricted reopening"" of the sector. Under England's roadmap for easing restrictions, it is hoped that  nightclubs will be able to reopen in late June, as well as all legal limits on social contact being removed. However,in late June in Scotland there are still due to be limits on the number of people who can meet indoors,while nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in ""limited circumstances"".  As we reported first thing this morning, La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, reopened on Monday evening after being closed for six months. Only 500 spectators were allowed in for the performance - a fraction of the theatre's normal capacity of 2,000.

"Cruise has won Golden Globes for Jerry Maguire, Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July Tom Cruise has handed back his three Golden Globes in protest at a lack of diversity among the body that runs the glittering annual Hollywood awards. He is the latest star to join a growing chorus of criticism. NBC, which has aired the event since 1996, has said it won't broadcast the ceremony next year. NBC said it wanted to see ""meaningful reform"" from the organisers, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The Golden Globes are second only to the Oscars in terms of profile. Time's Up, a leading advocate for industry reform, described NBC's move as a ""defining moment for Hollywood"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It added that it was committed ""to achieving these goals with extreme urgency"". The plans will widen the HFPA's membership, with an emphasis on recruiting black members and the hiring of diversity advisers. It has pledged to increase its membership by 50% over the next 18 months. The association also indicated it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules by publishing its membership list and accepting foreign entertainment journalists who are based across the US, not just in California. Diversity, equity and inclusion training will be given to all members, as well as sexual harassment awareness training. And members will be barred from accepting promotional items from film and TV studios. Scarlett Johansson claimed she had been asked sexist questions by HFPA members Time's Up described the proposals as ""window-dressing platitudes"". ""Any organisation or sponsors that set themselves up to pass judgement on our vibrant community of creators and talent must do better,"" said Time's Up president Tina Tchen.

The main issues appears to be that the implementation of changes isn't fast enough. According to Variety,external, organisations will continue to boycott the Globes and other HFPA events until the reforms are actually enacted. The timeline published by the HFPA,externalstates that a new board and new members will be in place by the first week of August. In a statement on Monday, NBC said: ""Change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes. ""Assuming the organisation executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023."" The TV network's decision also follows a steep drop inviewing figures for the Globes,external, which hit a 13-year low this year. That is a trend for film award shows in general - particularly during the pandemic, with many ceremonies eschewing the red carpet and conducting their events virtually. Sam Asi, who works for BBC Arabic and is a member of the HFPA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he found it ""bizarre"" that Hollywood was ""suddenly shocked"" about the lack of black members of the HFPA ""when this has been the case for 20 years"". ""HFPA members are seen every day by Hollywood talent, executives and publicistsâ¦ why the sudden shock?"" He added: ""Once the tide turned against the HFPA, everyone wanted to jump on the wagon and benefit from it. It's a political game.""

"This video can not be played Video shows students escaping from school windows Seven children and two adults have been killed in a shooting at a school in the Russian city of Kazan, officials say. Twenty-one other people, mostly children, were injured. A 19-year-old suspect was detained. The attack happened in the capital of the republic of Tatarstan, 820km (510 miles) east of Moscow. Russian PM Mikhail Mishustin spoke of ""great sorrow"" while Tatarstan's leader Rustam Minnikhanov described the attack as a ""major tragedy"". ""We are deeply saddened that this has happened,"" he said. Responding to the shooting, Russian President Vladimir Putin saidhe would review the country's gun control laws. School shootings are relatively rare in Russia. One of the last major incidentshappened in Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018. Mr Minnikhanov confirmed the deaths of seven children - four boys and three girls - as well as a female teacher and a female school worker at School No 175. It is believed the children were eighth graders (aged around 15). Eighteen children and three adults were being treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds, fractures and bruising, Mr Minnikhanov added. The attack began at about 09:20 local time (06:20 GMT), a source in the emergency services told Russian news agency Tass. The first signal from a panic button at the school was sent five minutes later. ""Everyone started panicking and saying 'shut the doors',"" a student who witnessed the attack told the Mediazona news website. ""About a minute later the head teacher started yelling: 'We're shutting the doors!' Armed police arrived at the school and then sealed off the fourth floor, reports said ""We got out about 15 minutes later, not out of the windows. I wanted to do that, but the teacher closed the window immediately and said no."" Footage shared on social media shows some children jumping from windows to escape as well as injured people being evacuated. Russian TV reported that two of the children had died after jumping from a second-floor window. Heavily armed police and emergency vehicles responded to the incident. A Kazan resident outside the school told Moscow Echo radio station that people there were hysterical. ""Parents are crying, medics are giving out medicine,"" she said. Elvira Ignatyeva, a 25-year-old English teacher, was killed trying to shield one of the children, a police source told Tass news agency, quoting eyewitnesses. She had pushed the child out of the way in a corridor and tried to block the gunman but was shot and mortally wounded, the source said. On her Instagram account, Ms Ignatyeva had often posted upbeat messages over photos of herself enjoying walks  and nights out. ""It's not that hard to make your life happy,"" she wrote on 1 February. You just need to stop thinking that happiness is only possible somewhere over there, in the future, and learn to enjoy every actual minute, here and now..."" Allow Instagram content?

Reports initially said that there were two gunmen and that one of them had been killed. But officials later said there was only one suspect, named locally as Ilnaz Galyaviev. Russian investigators say he is a Kazan resident and it is believed he once studied at the school. Medics comforted relatives of students at the school Mr Minnikhanov said the suspect was a registered firearm owner. According to Russian MP Alexander Khinshteyn, the suspect received a firearms licence only recently. The MP said it was for a semi-automatic shotgun. Officials did not comment on the possible motive for the attack although Mr Minnikhanov called the attacker a ""terrorist"". The suspect went on social media before the attack, posting that he planned to kill a ""huge number"" of people before shooting himself. Screenshots of his account, now blocked, show him wearing a black mask with the word ""god"" written across it in red.

Authorities have called for all schools in Tatarstan to be inspected and have their security stepped up. A day of mourning will be held on Wednesday to honour the victims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin had ordered the chief of Russia's National Guard to ""work out as a matter of urgency new regulations on the types of weapon that can be in civilian circulation and that can be owned by the public"". The instruction was issued ""given the type of firearm used by the shooter"", Mr Peskov said. ""The fact is that sometimes types of small arms are registered as hunting weapons, which in some countries are used as assault rifles,"" he explained. Russia to tighten gun rules after school shooting School shooting tragedy leaves Russia in shock Olga Ivshina, BBC News People in Kazan seem to be completely shocked and devastated by what has happened. It is a big city - with more than one million people - which has enjoyed peace and stability over the past decade. Schools in Kazan - as well as in most other Russian cities - are not really guarded. Usually it is just one or two unarmed private security guards who meet people coming to the school at the gates. Often many of these so-called security officers are pensioners with no special training. But even if they had any it is hard to confront an armed person with bare hands. It is worth mentioning that the Kazan gunman allegedly used a gun very similar to one the attacker in Crimea used in 2018. It is a relatively cheap but powerful rifle which can be bought for the equivalent of just $280 (Â£200). There are a lot of discussions now in Russia about whether the regulations for civilian gun ownership should be changed. Shootings at schools are relatively rare in Russia compared with other countries. In November 2019 a 19-year-old student shot dead a classmate and injured three others before killing himself in the far eastern city of Blagoveshchensk. Investigators said the motive for the attack may have been a personal conflict In October 2018 a teenager armed with a semi-automatic shotgunkilled 20 people at a technical college in the city of Kerchin Russian-annexed Crimea. He then shot himself dead In February 2013, a 15-year-old student shot dead a teacher and a police officer, injuring a second police officer, when he took hostages at a school in Moscow. Investigators saidthe killer appeared to have had an ""emotional breakdown"" Are you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

We'll be back tomorrow, but here are the top stories: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff on strike at a hospital near Paris, France Here are some of the day's key developments from around the world: The US will attempt to boost its vaccination campaign by partnering with ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft to provide free transport to and from tens of thousands of sites, the White House says. ""People will be able to simply select a vaccination site near them, follow simple directions to redeem their ride, and then get a ride to take them to and from a nearby vaccination site free of charge,""the Biden administration said in a statement,externaltoday. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until 4 July. President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70% of the US adult population vaccinated with at least one shot by 4 July to ensure safer Independence Day gatherings. The president is said to be discussing with state governors ""creative and innovative ways"" to get people vaccinated with the help of federal resources. ""Bio-secure bubbles"" enabled England's men to play international cricket last summer The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announceda loss of Â£16.1m in the past financial yearas a result of the pandemic. The postponed launch of The Hundred tournament was cited as one reason for a drop in revenue, alongside the cost of running bio-secure cricket. The loss has been transferred to their reserves, which now stand at Â£2.2m - down from more than Â£70m in 2016. Scott Smith, chief financial officer at the ECB, said: ""This has been a challenging year, but by being able to stage international cricket and by taking decisive action early in the pandemic, we have been able to support the network and avoid a far worse financial scenario. ""There remains considerable uncertainty over the year ahead, but we hope that delivering another full summer of cricket - and with crowds beginning to return from next week - we are able to protect the revenue we need to invest in growing our game."" Jo Goodman is part of a group of bereaved families campaigning for an inquiry A bit more now on the prime minister's promise thatthere will be a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic within the current Parliamentary session. Boris Johnson made the comments earlier during a debate in the House of Commons - the first time he has put a timeframe on when a probe into the pandemic will be held. He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future. The Prime Minister knows that and he's said as much.
""So why does he think it can wait? Who delays learning critical lessons that can save lives? This video can not be played Queen's Speech: State Opening of Parliament Slovakia's health ministry has ordered a halt to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people receiving their first doses following the death of a 47-year-old woman. The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here.

A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced.

A body representing night-time economy businesses in Scotland has said the sector has been ""left in limbo"" over reopening due to a lack of clarity on dates from the government. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland, which has previously launched legal action against the Scottish government over the emergency coronavirus legislation put in place last year, has called for more certainty for the sector. NTIA Scotland chairman, Mike Grieve, said: ""As our neighbours south of the border prepare to unlock and remove all restrictions within the coming weeks, in Scotland we remain stuck in perpetual limbo with still no indicative date for reopening or even an outline of the conditions which will allow nightlife to restart. He called on the government to establish an ""a constructive path towards the unrestricted reopening"" of the sector. Under England's roadmap for easing restrictions, it is hoped that  nightclubs will be able to reopen in late June, as well as all legal limits on social contact being removed. However,in late June in Scotland there are still due to be limits on the number of people who can meet indoors,while nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in ""limited circumstances"".  As we reported first thing this morning, La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, reopened on Monday evening after being closed for six months. Only 500 spectators were allowed in for the performance - a fraction of the theatre's normal capacity of 2,000. Bad news too for half-time Spritz fans, there was also no intermission last night and the bars were closed. But the show went on... To respect social distancing, the musicians took over the ground-floor seating area... ...while the audience took their seats on the balconies Only 500 ticket-holders will be admitted for each performance for the time being The performance came a day before the 75th anniversary of a historic concert in 1946 that celebrated the post-war re-opening of the opera house - which had been bombed three years earlier and rebuilt. ""We have all listened to recorded concerts from our armchairs, but this has nothing to do with the emotion of live music, the quality and beauty of natural sound,"" Dominique Meyer, La Scala's director since 2020, told the AFP news agency. At lunchtime today, Scotland announced it will adopt the same traffic light system for foreign travel as England from Monday 17 May. Green-list destinations have the fewest rules - and Scotland's green list is currently the same as England's. The 12 countries and territories on the list are:  The majority of countries are on the amber list. People arriving from those countries must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests when they're back. Read more on the new travel rules here. Â© 2025 BBC.

She had pushed the child out of the way in a corridor and tried to block the gunman but was shot and mortally wounded, the source said. On her Instagram account, Ms Ignatyeva had often posted upbeat messages over photos of herself enjoying walks  and nights out. ""It's not that hard to make your life happy,"" she wrote on 1 February. You just need to stop thinking that happiness is only possible somewhere over there, in the future, and learn to enjoy every actual minute, here and now..."" Allow Instagram content?

Reports initially said that there were two gunmen and that one of them had been killed. But officials later said there was only one suspect, named locally as Ilnaz Galyaviev. Russian investigators say he is a Kazan resident and it is believed he once studied at the school. Medics comforted relatives of students at the school Mr Minnikhanov said the suspect was a registered firearm owner. According to Russian MP Alexander Khinshteyn, the suspect received a firearms licence only recently. The MP said it was for a semi-automatic shotgun. Officials did not comment on the possible motive for the attack although Mr Minnikhanov called the attacker a ""terrorist"". The suspect went on social media before the attack, posting that he planned to kill a ""huge number"" of people before shooting himself. Screenshots of his account, now blocked, show him wearing a black mask with the word ""god"" written across it in red. A video on social media captured a teenager lying on the ground apparently being detained outside the building. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Authorities have called for all schools in Tatarstan to be inspected and have their security stepped up. A day of mourning will be held on Wednesday to honour the victims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin had ordered the chief of Russia's National Guard to ""work out as a matter of urgency new regulations on the types of weapon that can be in civilian circulation and that can be owned by the public"". The instruction was issued ""given the type of firearm used by the shooter"", Mr Peskov said. ""The fact is that sometimes types of small arms are registered as hunting weapons, which in some countries are used as assault rifles,"" he explained. Russia to tighten gun rules after school shooting School shooting tragedy leaves Russia in shock Olga Ivshina, BBC News People in Kazan seem to be completely shocked and devastated by what has happened. It is a big city - with more than one million people - which has enjoyed peace and stability over the past decade. Schools in Kazan - as well as in most other Russian cities - are not really guarded. Usually it is just one or two unarmed private security guards who meet people coming to the school at the gates. Often many of these so-called security officers are pensioners with no special training. But even if they had any it is hard to confront an armed person with bare hands. It is worth mentioning that the Kazan gunman allegedly used a gun very similar to one the attacker in Crimea used in 2018. It is a relatively cheap but powerful rifle which can be bought for the equivalent of just $280 (Â£200). There are a lot of discussions now in Russia about whether the regulations for civilian gun ownership should be changed. Shootings at schools are relatively rare in Russia compared with other countries. In November 2019 a 19-year-old student shot dead a classmate and injured three others before killing himself in the far eastern city of Blagoveshchensk. Investigators said the motive for the attack may have been a personal conflict In October 2018 a teenager armed with a semi-automatic shotgunkilled 20 people at a technical college in the city of Kerchin Russian-annexed Crimea. He then shot himself dead In February 2013, a 15-year-old student shot dead a teacher and a police officer, injuring a second police officer, when he took hostages at a school in Moscow. Investigators saidthe killer appeared to have had an ""emotional breakdown"" Are you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

"This video can not be played Queens Speech: Starmer and Johnson on government plans Boris Johnson has said the government ""won't settle for going back to the way things were"", as the UK emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. He promised to end the ""criminal waste of talent"" in parts of the UK by spreading opportunity more evenly. It came as the government unveiled 30 planned new laws for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's programme lacked urgency and ambition. ""Today we needed a Queen's Speech that rose to scale of the moment,"" said Sir Keir, but instead, he claimed, it was ""packed with short-term gimmicks and distant promises"". Follow live: Queen's Speech and reaction What was in the Queen's Speech? Starmer: Lack of social care plan 'unforgivable' First major event for Queen since Philip's death Sir Keir seized on the absence of new legislation to fix the funding of adult social care - something he said the prime minister had promised on the steps of Downing Street two years ago. He said the government's failure to act on the issue after the pandemic was ""nothing short of an insult"" and it was ""a similar story on skills and education"". The government has promised to bring forward social care proposals later this year. Sir Keir Starmer accuses the government of dragging its heels over social care funding Many of the measures in the Queen's Speech are aimed at the Conservatives'new electoral strongholdsin the Midlands and north of England. The prime minister told MPs: ""We intend to unite and level up across the whole of our United Kingdom because we one nation Conservatives understand this crucial point - that you will find flair and imagination and enthusiasm and genius distributed evenly across this country while opportunity is not. ""And we need to change that because it is not just a moral and social disgrace, it is an economic mistake. It is a criminal waste of talent. ""And though we cannot for one moment minimise the damage that Covid has done - the loss of learning, the NHS backlogs, the courts delays, the massive fiscal consequences - we must use this opportunity to achieve a national recovery so that jabs, jabs jabs becomes jobs, jobs, jobs."" Among the planned new laws are: A Skills and Post-16 Education Bill for England, with loans for adults wanting to retrain and more powers to deal with failing colleges A bill aimed at deterring asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel A bill to ease planning controls and increase housebuilding in England Plans to improve bus and train service connectivity in England New laws to scrap the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, meaning it will be easier for Mr Johnson to call an early general election before 2024 Missing from the government's programme was a specific bill on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, although the speech saidlegislation will be introduced. Andtrade unions accused the government of ""rowing back""on a promise to protect workers' rights. Downing Street said an Employment Bill would be introduced ""when the time is right"", citing the pandemic as the reason for the delay. This video can not be played Spot the difference: How the Queen's Speech changed this year Mr Johnsoncommitted to setting up a ""full, proper"" public inquiryinto the government's handling of the pandemic, which could begin in the coming year, in response to a question from Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey. Sir Ed also raised concerns about plans to introduce voter ID for future general elections, which he said would hit the disadvantaged and ethnic minorities, and were ""straight from the Donald Trump playbook"". And he echoedcriticism of planning reformsby former Prime Minister Theresa May, who said they would hand too much power to developers and ""see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the prime minister there was a fresh mandate for a Scottish independence referendum after Thursday's elections. He also attacked ""further power grabs"" by the Westminster government in the Queen's Speech. One of the pleasures of the Queen's Speech for journalists is hearing Her Majesty reading out the political slogans of the government of the day. So 15 seconds in there was mention of the prime minister's favourite: plans to ""level up"" the country. The meaning of the phrase is gradually being refined but the agenda is still vast and encompasses jobs, schools, health, policing, industry, productivity, civic pride, the strength of local leadership and the quality of life. But the real detail in this area will come later this year when the government publishes a White Paper where it will spell out much more detail about what levelling up means and the ""bold"" action that ministers will take to achieve it. So for now the government is trumpeting what it's already doing: a Â£4.8bn fund for infrastructure projects, Â£830m for redeveloping High Streets, along with eight freeports and 40 new hospitals in England. And where there are such big promises, Labour stands ready to highlight pledges that go unmet. This year's speech also included changes to the policing of protests, including setting time and noise limits. A previous discussion of this by MPs earlier this year led toangry demonstrations. Critics say the measures impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest - but ministers say the proposals will respect human rights and will only affect very disruptive gatherings. Queen's Speech commits to Troubles legislation UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare Government to consult before conversion therapy ban A ban on so-calledconversion therapy- attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity - is also planned. The Queen's Speech is part of the State Opening of Parliament, normally the grandest of Westminster occasions. But it was pared back this year because of Covid, with fewer MPs and peers than normal gathering in the House of Lords to hear it - and the Queen arriving by car rather than the usual carriage. It was the Queen's first major public engagement since thedeath of the Duke of Edinburgh.

"Mary used to work at the cafe where Fred West was a regular customer Police are searching for a body at a cafe in Gloucester linked to a girl feared to have been murdered by serial killer Fred West. Mary Bastholm, 15, went missing on 6 January 1968 and has not been found. Officers were called to The Clean Plate by filmmakers working on a documentary. West was a regular customer when the teenager worked at the cafe. The film crew told police on Friday they had found evidence that a body could be buried within the property. Officers could be at the site ""for a number of weeks"" and excavation work is yet to begin, Gloucestershire Police said. Gloucestershire Police said the search might alarm those who worked nearby but it would carry out a proportionate investigation Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said: ""This could be a significant development on a case which has gained a lot of public interest over the years. ""On the basis of the information provided to us, we consider this to be new and potentially important evidence in the case of Mary Bastholm, however further detailed assessments will take place over the following few days to determine the extent of excavation needed. ""First and foremost our thoughts are with Mary's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time."" In a statement released via the force, Miss Bastholm's family said: ""We are aware of the ongoing developments around Mary's disappearance and are being kept up to date and supported by Gloucestershire Police family liaison officers. ""At this time please may we ask for privacy so we can grieve for Mary."" Police have begun removing evidence from the site A white tent has been set up outside the building in Southgate Street and officers are stationed at the scene. The cafe is close to Cromwell Street, where officers found the bodies of West's victims at the home he shared with his wife Rosemary. A spokesperson for The Nelson Trust, a women's charity that owns The Clean Plate, said: ""As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we have done everything we can to accommodate the investigation. ""The Clean Plate will remain closed until all necessary activity is complete. ""It is an extraordinary twist of fate that this building, now associated with a story as tragic as that of the victims of Fred and Rosemary West, is part of a charity working to support women at risk from violence."" A police cordon has been set up around the property By Andrew Plant, BBC News Mary Bastholm disappeared at a bus stop on her way to meet her boyfriend. There has been no trace of her since. It's been a mystery for 53 years. The cafe has been there for decades and has been under several different names. One of its waitresses was Mary, who was 15 at the time when Fred West was a regular customer and was known to him. It was also known he was a builder at the time renovation was needed on the cellar and the toilets at the cafe - work he was believed to have carried out in 1968. A lot of people locally put two and two together and suggested that perhaps he was responsible for her disappearance and that was where she ended up. Police say their activity will take place over a number of weeks and there will be disruption for some time. Fred West took his own life while awaiting trial for the murders of 12 people In 2012, a petition was set up calling for afresh investigationinto Miss Bastholm's disappearance but it was rejected by then Chief Constable Tony Melville. In 1994, West admitted murdering his daughter Heather. The confession came as police began to search 25 Cromwell Street, where they found the bodies of nine girls and young women. He and his wife Rose were jointly charged with nine murders and he was charged with a further three. West took his own life while awaiting the murder trial the following year. West's former home, 25 Cromwell Street, has been demolished and was replaced with a walkway The impact of the West murders 25 years on Gloucestershire Constabulary New plan revealed for proposed Thornbury Lidl store Police and army spotted in Cotswold village after incident Second phase of work on famous Cirencester walk starting this month Stroud woman in VW Polo was 'unfit to drive' due to alcohol Stroud lager thief who also assaulted woman due in court Woman caught in  VW Polo near Cirencester was 'unfit to drive' due to alcohol Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas says No 10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Boris Johnson promises there will be a full public inquiry into the Covid pandemic, set up within this parliamentary session He makes the commitment in the Queen's Speech debate in the House of Commons Lib Dem leader Ed Davey asked him if he would set it up âon behalf of bereaved families across the country"" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms further relaxation of Scotland's coronavirus restrictions from Monday Saying she feels ""a wee bit emotional"", she confirms people in Scotland will be able to hug loved ones again Pubs will be allowed to sell alcohol indoors and up to six people from three households will be able to meet in homes In the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords, Her Majesty outlines the UK government's plans for the next parliament She says the government will deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the UK stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before Dozens more bodies wash up on the banks of the Ganges in northern India as the country struggles with a second Covid wave The European Union files a lawsuit against AstraZeneca over the delivery of coronavirus vaccine doses The Brit Awards take place this evening in front of a live audience at London's O2, as part of the government's pilot scheme for events Edited by Claire Heald Pub visits will no longer have to be outside in Scotland from next Monday We're wrapping up our live coverage for the day. Updates were brought to you by Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Mal Siret, Lauren Turner, Ella Wills, Katie Wright and Claire Heald. We'll be back tomorrow, but here are the top stories: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff on strike at a hospital near Paris, France Here are some of the day's key developments from around the world: The US will attempt to boost its vaccination campaign by partnering with ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft to provide free transport to and from tens of thousands of sites, the White House says. ""People will be able to simply select a vaccination site near them, follow simple directions to redeem their ride, and then get a ride to take them to and from a nearby vaccination site free of charge,""the Biden administration said in a statement,externaltoday. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until 4 July. President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70% of the US adult population vaccinated with at least one shot by 4 July to ensure safer Independence Day gatherings. The president is said to be discussing with state governors ""creative and innovative ways"" to get people vaccinated with the help of federal resources. ""Bio-secure bubbles"" enabled England's men to play international cricket last summer The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announceda loss of Â£16.1m in the past financial yearas a result of the pandemic. The postponed launch of The Hundred tournament was cited as one reason for a drop in revenue, alongside the cost of running bio-secure cricket. The loss has been transferred to their reserves, which now stand at Â£2.2m - down from more than Â£70m in 2016. Scott Smith, chief financial officer at the ECB, said: ""This has been a challenging year, but by being able to stage international cricket and by taking decisive action early in the pandemic, we have been able to support the network and avoid a far worse financial scenario. ""There remains considerable uncertainty over the year ahead, but we hope that delivering another full summer of cricket - and with crowds beginning to return from next week - we are able to protect the revenue we need to invest in growing our game."" Jo Goodman is part of a group of bereaved families campaigning for an inquiry A bit more now on the prime minister's promise thatthere will be a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic within the current Parliamentary session. Boris Johnson made the comments earlier during a debate in the House of Commons - the first time he has put a timeframe on when a probe into the pandemic will be held. He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future. The Prime Minister knows that and he's said as much.
""So why does he think it can wait? Who delays learning critical lessons that can save lives? This video can not be played Queen's Speech: State Opening of Parliament Slovakia's health ministry has ordered a halt to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people receiving their first doses following the death of a 47-year-old woman. The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham is asking the government for everyone over the age of 16 in the region to get a Covid vaccine to curb the spread of the Indian variant. Andy Burnham said it came after a ""worrying"" spike of cases in Bolton among the under-25s, which has seen cases double in a week. Bolton Council urged everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and tested. Mr Burnham said the rise in the town was a ""cause of concern"". Read more here. Antonietta said she had looked forward to a professional haircut ""I feel like a different woman altogether,"" says Antonietta Orfeo, 84, after getting her first haircut in more than a year. Antoinetta lives at Arden House care home in Bedford, which put out an appeal for a hair stylist after its regular one has not been able to come since lockdown in March 2020. Two stylists came forward, leaving the care home manager relieved that she no longer had to ""hack away"" at hair. ""I've had to apologise to everyone whose hair I've cut,"" she added. ""The residents have all needed to be restyled due to my attempts."" A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors and social distancing will be relaxed further - echoing similar changes on the same date in England. Rule changes in Wales are also expected but are yet to be confirmed. Check what's changing in your area. This video can not be played Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that lockdown can be eased in most of Scotland from 17 May. It means people can mix in each others' homes again (up to six people from three households) and physical contact is no longer banned. You canread about the changes here. A body representing night-time economy businesses in Scotland has said the sector has been ""left in limbo"" over reopening due to a lack of clarity on dates from the government. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland, which has previously launched legal action against the Scottish government over the emergency coronavirus legislation put in place last year, has called for more certainty for the sector. NTIA Scotland chairman, Mike Grieve, said: ""As our neighbours south of the border prepare to unlock and remove all restrictions within the coming weeks, in Scotland we remain stuck in perpetual limbo with still no indicative date for reopening or even an outline of the conditions which will allow nightlife to restart. He called on the government to establish an ""a constructive path towards the unrestricted reopening"" of the sector. Under England's roadmap for easing restrictions, it is hoped that  nightclubs will be able to reopen in late June, as well as all legal limits on social contact being removed. However,in late June in Scotland there are still due to be limits on the number of people who can meet indoors,while nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in ""limited circumstances"".  As we reported first thing this morning, La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, reopened on Monday evening after being closed for six months. Only 500 spectators were allowed in for the performance - a fraction of the theatre's normal capacity of 2,000. Bad news too for half-time Spritz fans, there was also no intermission last night and the bars were closed. But the show went on... To respect social distancing, the musicians took over the ground-floor seating area... ...while the audience took their seats on the balconies Only 500 ticket-holders will be admitted for each performance for the time being The performance came a day before the 75th anniversary of a historic concert in 1946 that celebrated the post-war re-opening of the opera house - which had been bombed three years earlier and rebuilt. ""We have all listened to recorded concerts from our armchairs, but this has nothing to do with the emotion of live music, the quality and beauty of natural sound,"" Dominique Meyer, La Scala's director since 2020, told the AFP news agency. At lunchtime today, Scotland announced it will adopt the same traffic light system for foreign travel as England from Monday 17 May. Green-list destinations have the fewest rules - and Scotland's green list is currently the same as England's. The 12 countries and territories on the list are:  The majority of countries are on the amber list. People arriving from those countries must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests when they're back. Read more on the new travel rules here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Englandâs NHS app will be available to use as a vaccine passport from Monday, the government has said - but only for those who have had both doses of the jab. A paper version will also be available - by calling 119 but not through a GP. Both will be available from Monday, 17 May, when the ban on foreign travel is eased. The NHS app is separate to the NHS Covid-19 app, which is used for contact tracing. People can already use the NHS app to: request repeat prescriptions arrange appointments to see their doctor view medical records It can also show vaccine statuses, including for coronavirus, but currently this feature must be enabled by a GP before it appears on the app. The new update will contain a separate feature to display coronavirus vaccine records, so the government said there should be no need to contact GPs. The app will not show coronavirus test results, but the NHS plans to incorporate this in the future,the government website said.,external It advised people to register to use the app at least two weeks before travelling. A paper letter can be requested only at least five days after a second vaccine dose and can take five days to arrive. âThere are not many countries that currently accept proof of vaccination,â the government advice warns. âSo for the time being, most people will still need to follow other rules when travelling abroad â like getting a negative pre-departure test.â The government has announced 12 countriespeople in England can travel to, without having to quarantine when they return. But not all of these destinations allow UK tourists. For example, travel to mainland Portugal and the Azores is currently for essential purposes only. The list will be reviewed every three weeks. Countries can be added or removed at short notice. It's finally becoming clearer exactly how the government plans to use the NHS app as a vaccine passport. It had been assumed it depended on getting GPs to share a patient's data with the app. I'd been on the phone to my GP surgery because neither of my two jabs was showing up in the app. But this morning a Department of Health spokeswoman told me that NHS X - the health service digital division - has designed an update to the app which doesn't depend on GP records. The update won't go live until May 17th  and will provide a new tab displaying your vaccine record, the idea being that this is all you need to show rather than any other sensitive data being visible. What's not clear however is whether this solution will be acceptable to foreign airlines or border police. But there is one message the government is keen to get out - don't do what I did and ring your GP. Travellers also need to take coronavirus tests before returning to England and after arrival. Some countries may also require tests to be taken upon entry to the holiday destination. European officials have announced plans for anEU-wide ""Green Digital Certificate"". This would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the region. Officials hopethe certificate will be in place,externalbefore the summer. Several companies have been working on apps to make travel easier, including trade body the International Air Transport Association, who are piloting 'Travel Pass'. It said it has been in discussions with government to ensure the pass can read data from the NHS App. ""We're keen to go further and faster now that the Secretary of State has confirmed that travellers will have access to their covid vaccination status by 17 May,"" a spokesperson added. ""Globally there are now 20+ countries that are either easing testing or quarantine requirements for vaccinated passengers so the UK needs to move quickly if it does not want to fall behind globally in supporting its citizens' ability to freely travel.""

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"".

She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist.

"Stock markets across the world have slid amid worries that US inflation is set to rise. In the US, the Dow fell 474 points to lose 1.4% on Tuesday - its largest one-day drop since late February. European bourses also saw steep declines on fears among traders that rising consumer prices could push up interest rates. The UK's benchmark share index, the FTSE 100, closed 2.47% lower. The indexretreated below the 7,000 mark to 6,947.99 after hitting a post-pandemic high of 7,164 on Monday. ""The market just can't shake the inflation fears which are clouding the recovery from Covid,"" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. ""Surging commodity prices are acting as a canary in the coal mine for inflation - with the huge infrastructure and stimulus packages in the US a key contributing factor."" In March, US President Joe Biden signeda $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) economic relief billthat saw the government send $1,400 cheques to most Americans, and last monthhe set out plans for more government spendingon jobs, education and social care. It has led to a build-up of savings which is now being spent as the economy reopens, driving prices higher. Inflation hit 2.6% in the 12 months to March, breaching the Federal Reserve's target of 2% and raising fears it might raise rates to cool things down. There are similar concerns in other economies, but central banks have so far played down the risks. The tech-heavy US Nasdaq share index initially fell more than 2% on Tuesday as markets opened, but reversed those losses later on. The sell-off also continued in Asia and Europe, with both France's Cac 40 index and Germany's Dax index down nearly 2%. Ben Yearsley, investment director at Shore Financial, said inflation was always likely to pick-up over the next few months given that in the same period a year ago economies were closed and oil prices slumped. He said investors should only get concerned if higher inflation continues. ""If inflation persists and we are still talking about it in six months, for example, then that is a different scenario and will maybe lead to higher interest rates."" Other analysts raised concerns that new data released by the US Labor Department on Tuesday showed that the number of job vacancies jumped by 597,000 to a record high of 8.1 million on the last day of March. The food and hotels sectors added the most vacancies, with the report following figures that showed last week that job growth slowed sharply in April, curbed by shortages of available workers despite huge fiscal stimulus. On the London Stock Exchange, British Airways owner IAG was one of the biggest fallers, with its shares falling more than 7% on the back of negative investor reaction to the government's green list of safe countries to travel to. Shares in NatWest Group fell more than 3%.The government announced on Tuesday morning it had sold another chunk of shares in the bank, reducing its stake from 59.8% to 54.8% and raising Â£1.1bn for taxpayers. The concerns in markets are not only about the United States, but that is the main focus of the nervousness. In common with many other governments, the US has supported household incomes, at a time when people have been unable or unwilling to spend as they normally would. So there has been a build-up of unplanned savings. As restrictions are lifted and vaccinations make people feel more confident, much of that is likely to be spent. If there are any persistent disturbances to supply chains, that would only add to the pressure pushing prices higher. Will it lead the Federal Reserve and other central banks to change policy, to raise interest rates or curb their purchases of financial assets, or quantitative easing? So far, the Fed has said it thinks the rise in inflation is due to ""transitory factors"" and it saysexpectations about future inflation are ""well anchored"",external. So there is clearly no rush on its part to change policy. But investors are likely to remain wary that inflationary pressures might prove to be persistent and lead the Fed to rethink.

Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"". In her constituency, Hackney South and Shoreditch, the average house price is 17 times of the average wage, she states. She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Plans to outlaw so-called conversion therapy in England and Wales have been announced in The King's Speech. The Labour government wants to ban what it calls ""abusive"" practices intended to change people's sexual orientation or their gender identity. According to the British Psychological Society (BPS), conversion therapy - sometimes called ""reparative therapy"" or ""gay cure therapy"" - tries to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. In practice, it means trying to stop or suppress someone from being gay, or from identifying as a different gender to their sex recorded at birth. It can include talking therapies and prayer, but more extreme forms can include exorcism, physical violence and food deprivation. The BPS and other professional bodies, including NHS England and the Royal College of Psychiatrists, have warned that all types of conversion therapy are""unethical and potentially harmful"".,external This video can not be played Justin Beck: 'Conversion therapy left me emotionally traumatised' The new Labour government has said it will introduce a Conversion Practices Bill, to ban practices aimed at changing or suppressing someone's gender identity or sexual orientation in England and Wales. It says the bill will not stop professionals offering support to those exploring their sexual orientation or gender identity, or those providing medical care and support. Once a draft bill is published, it will undergo consultation before a full bill is formally introduced to Parliament. Key points in the King's Speech The previous Conservative government had also worked to introduce a ban, but said banning conversion therapy practices related to gender identity was complex, and required further consideration. It warned of ""unintended consequences"", which might affect teachers, parents and therapists helping children who are struggling with their gender identity. AnNHS-commissioned report,externalwhich called for a rethink of children's gender identity services in England said that some healthcare professionals already felt under pressure to ""take a purely affirmative approach"" to young people who said they wanted to transition. However, anumber of medical practitionerssaid a ban which still allowed for explorative therapies was possible, and had already been enacted in other countries. The BPS' Dr Adam Jowett said: ""Clinicians can still help people fully explore their gender identity where appropriate, but it's time for this unacceptable and harmful practice to end."" What does trans mean and what is the Cass review? It's difficult to know exactly how widespread the practice is. There is no standard legal definition and victims may be reluctant to share their experiences. About 5% of the 108,000 people who responded to the government'sUK-wide LGBT Survey in 2018,externalsaid they had been offered some form of conversion therapy, while 2% had undergone it. Those from an ethnic minority background were more likely to be affected, as were people with religious faith. About 10% of Christian respondents and 20% of Muslims said they had undergone or been offered conversion therapy, compared to 6% of those with no religion. More than half of those who had received the therapy said it had been conducted by a faith group, while a fifth received it from healthcare professionals. A higher proportion of transgender respondents had experience of the practice. Almost one in 10 trans men said they had been offered conversion therapy, while one in 25 said they had undergone it. But the survey did not define what it meant by conversion therapy, and did not ask when or where it had happened. Some religious groups oppose any ban on conversion therapy, and warn that it would infringe on traditional religious teachings, including the belief that sex outside a heterosexual marriage is sinful. The Evangelical Alliance, which says it represents 3,500 churches, argues a bancould jeopardise religious freedoms,external. However, the Church of England says the practice has ""no place in the modern world"". In Northern Ireland, politicians passeda non-binding motionin April 2021 calling for a ban, and work is continuing on a policy to end conversion practices. The Welsh government isseeking legal adviceon whether it can bring in its own ban. In Scotland,a government consultation into a ban closed in April 2024,external, and the findings are now being considered. Approximately 16 countries have introduced a full or partial ban, including Brazil, Canada and Germany. About 20 US states have banned the practice for minors, although many of these do not include religious counsellors and organisations. Some other countries, including Ireland, have proposed bans or are consulting on the issue. Update 20 September 2024:We added some additional text to the article to clarify that although a Conversion Practices Bill had been signalled in the King's Speech a draft bill had not at that stage been published, as we originally reported.

"Pret a Manger will trial opening its concessions in Tesco supermarkets after seeing a huge drop in demand as more people work from home. The sandwich chain has struggled in the pandemic as many of its branches are in city centres and rely on office trade. With the remote working trend set to continue post-pandemic, it is exploring new ways to operate. ""We're transforming our business model to adjust to a new way of living and working,"" said Pret. With more companies switching to hybrid working, chains such as Pret have been forced to respond. The move will involve just four Pret branches opening in Tesco stores at first, but if successful, it will spread. The first shop will open in Tesco's Kensington superstore in London in June, with three other shops set to open later in the summer. The company launched its first grocery food range in Tesco earlier this year, selling frozen croissants and granola through the supermarket. The move is the latest attempt by Pret to adapt to the changes imposed by coronavirus. In the days before Covid struck, the food chain's extensive network of branches in prime urban locations was seen as its greatest strength. But when lockdowns dramatically reduced the number of commuters, the firm became a symbol of the economic woes inflicted by the pandemic. During 2020, it closed 74 outlets in the UK and 22 in the US. Last summer,it cut 3,000 jobs, more than a third of its workforce, as part of a rescue plan to save the business. Earlier this year, it scrapped its dividend payment to shareholders and warned of ""material uncertainties"" over its future. ""As the UK emerges from lockdown, this partnership with Tesco is one way in which we're transforming our business model,"" said Pano Christou, Pret's chief executive. The chain is also increasing its motorway service shops in partnership with Moto. It opened the first of three at Cherwell Valley in December 2020, followed by a second at Moto's Rugby service which opened last month. The chain has also introduced a subscription serviceallowing customers up to five cups of coffee a day for a Â£20 monthly fee, while Pret-branded ground coffee and espresso beans are now available via Amazon.

"Mary used to work at the cafe where Fred West was a regular customer Police are searching for a body at a cafe in Gloucester linked to a girl feared to have been murdered by serial killer Fred West. Mary Bastholm, 15, went missing on 6 January 1968 and has not been found. Officers were called to The Clean Plate by filmmakers working on a documentary. West was a regular customer when the teenager worked at the cafe. The film crew told police on Friday they had found evidence that a body could be buried within the property. Officers could be at the site ""for a number of weeks"" and excavation work is yet to begin, Gloucestershire Police said. Gloucestershire Police said the search might alarm those who worked nearby but it would carry out a proportionate investigation Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said: ""This could be a significant development on a case which has gained a lot of public interest over the years. ""On the basis of the information provided to us, we consider this to be new and potentially important evidence in the case of Mary Bastholm, however further detailed assessments will take place over the following few days to determine the extent of excavation needed. ""First and foremost our thoughts are with Mary's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time."" In a statement released via the force, Miss Bastholm's family said: ""We are aware of the ongoing developments around Mary's disappearance and are being kept up to date and supported by Gloucestershire Police family liaison officers. ""At this time please may we ask for privacy so we can grieve for Mary."" Police have begun removing evidence from the site A white tent has been set up outside the building in Southgate Street and officers are stationed at the scene. The cafe is close to Cromwell Street, where officers found the bodies of West's victims at the home he shared with his wife Rosemary. A spokesperson for The Nelson Trust, a women's charity that owns The Clean Plate, said: ""As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we have done everything we can to accommodate the investigation. ""The Clean Plate will remain closed until all necessary activity is complete. ""It is an extraordinary twist of fate that this building, now associated with a story as tragic as that of the victims of Fred and Rosemary West, is part of a charity working to support women at risk from violence."" A police cordon has been set up around the property By Andrew Plant, BBC News Mary Bastholm disappeared at a bus stop on her way to meet her boyfriend. There has been no trace of her since. It's been a mystery for 53 years. The cafe has been there for decades and has been under several different names. One of its waitresses was Mary, who was 15 at the time when Fred West was a regular customer and was known to him. It was also known he was a builder at the time renovation was needed on the cellar and the toilets at the cafe - work he was believed to have carried out in 1968. A lot of people locally put two and two together and suggested that perhaps he was responsible for her disappearance and that was where she ended up. Police say their activity will take place over a number of weeks and there will be disruption for some time. Fred West took his own life while awaiting trial for the murders of 12 people In 2012, a petition was set up calling for afresh investigationinto Miss Bastholm's disappearance but it was rejected by then Chief Constable Tony Melville. In 1994, West admitted murdering his daughter Heather. The confession came as police began to search 25 Cromwell Street, where they found the bodies of nine girls and young women. He and his wife Rose were jointly charged with nine murders and he was charged with a further three. West took his own life while awaiting the murder trial the following year. West's former home, 25 Cromwell Street, has been demolished and was replaced with a walkway The impact of the West murders 25 years on Gloucestershire Constabulary New plan revealed for proposed Thornbury Lidl store Police and army spotted in Cotswold village after incident Second phase of work on famous Cirencester walk starting this month Stroud woman in VW Polo was 'unfit to drive' due to alcohol Stroud lager thief who also assaulted woman due in court Woman caught in  VW Polo near Cirencester was 'unfit to drive' due to alcohol Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction UK has enough gas says No 10 after supply warning UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The Prince of Wales has spoken about how his family have ""an empty seat at their dinner table"" after the death of his father, the Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Charles made the comment during a video message wishing Muslims an Eid Mubarak ahead of the end of Ramadan. He said the last year had been ""deeply challenging for us all"" and he was ""only too aware of the impact of the pandemic on the Muslim community"". Prince Philip, the UK's longest-serving royal consort, died aged 99 on 9 April. Dear papa was very special, says Charles Royals reflect on the 'rock in the Queenâs life' First major event for Queen since Philip's death In a video posted by the Naz Legacy Foundation, a charity promoting education and integration, Prince Charles said: ""This year so many families, like my own, will have an empty seat at their dinner table and friends are no longer able to share the celebratory hug after Eid prayer."" The message was shared with young people from the foundation and the British Asian Trust, who were taking part in a virtual iftar, the evening meal where Muslims break their daily Ramadan fast, on Monday. The iftar meal is usually shared with family and friends but such gatherings have been restricted during the pandemic. The end of Ramadan, during which Muslims fast during daylight hours for a month, is marked with a celebration called Eid. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some religious groups oppose any ban on conversion therapy, and warn that it would infringe on traditional religious teachings, including the belief that sex outside a heterosexual marriage is sinful. The Evangelical Alliance, which says it represents 3,500 churches, argues a bancould jeopardise religious freedoms,external. However, the Church of England says the practice has ""no place in the modern world"". In Northern Ireland, politicians passeda non-binding motionin April 2021 calling for a ban, and work is continuing on a policy to end conversion practices. The Welsh government isseeking legal adviceon whether it can bring in its own ban. In Scotland,a government consultation into a ban closed in April 2024,external, and the findings are now being considered. Approximately 16 countries have introduced a full or partial ban, including Brazil, Canada and Germany. About 20 US states have banned the practice for minors, although many of these do not include religious counsellors and organisations. Some other countries, including Ireland, have proposed bans or are consulting on the issue. Update 20 September 2024:We added some additional text to the article to clarify that although a Conversion Practices Bill had been signalled in the King's Speech a draft bill had not at that stage been published, as we originally reported.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that the planned 17 May lockdown easing will ""go ahead"", but unlikely just yet for Moray Most other council areas will move from level three to level two and some islands will move to level one Ms Sturgeon says that unless the case rate in Moray improves significantly over the next few days it will remain in level three. A final decision will be made on Friday For areas moving down levels, people will be allowed to meet indoors again, initially in groups of up to six from three households, and they will be allowed to hug However, the first minister says everyone should continue to be ""cautious"" and adhere to the rules Indoor hospitality will resume with alcohol being served in pubs or restaurants until 10.30pm From 17 May people in Scotland will be allowed to travel to some destinations without having to quarantine on their return The traffic lights system will be the same as England which is is also making the changes from Monday BBC Scotland News First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the changes will come into effect in most of the country from Monday.

is being eased a little faster than the Scottish government originally planned. Allowing
social mixing in your own home from Monday was anticipated but not with the
removal of social distancing rules. As
the first minister put it: âYou can hug your loved ones againâ - echoing a
similar announcement by the prime minister, relating to England. Scotland
is also aligning with the UK governmentâs plans to open up international travel
but taking more time to consider easing the requirements for face coverings in
school. Ending
social distancing at home creates an anomaly because the rules will remain in
force in other settings, including pubs and restaurants. The
Scottish government said it did not want to remove distancing rules everywhere
at once, to reduce the risk of Covid flare-ups. A wider review of this policy
is to report back in three weeks.   The Scottish government has published an overview of the protection levels and what you can do. Read it here,external Allow Twitter content?

Anas Sarwar says financial help for businesses not yet able to fully reopen must include making sure ""there is no cliff-edge on furlough"". ""If that happens with the furlough scheme, you could still push lots and lots of businesses to going bust and, worse still, push lots and lots of people into unemployment,"" he says. ""That would be a tragedy across our country."" Referencing the situation in Moray, Mr Sarwar says: ""If we get into the situation where we have spikes in individual communities and more micro-lockdowns across the country...we've got to make sure there is a robust economic package available to those communities. ""One, to support people particularly on low incomes so they can get by. ""But also supporting businesses so they can survive - and the job creation schemes that go alongside that."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar tells the BBC programme the whole country can feel a sense of hope and optimism as case numbers, in general, continue to fall. ""The fact that we will get to be out with our families and embrace our loved ones again will be a huge relief,"" he says. ""I know how desperate I am to hug my own granny and I know people across the country will be the same. ""Alongside that, there will be good news in this for businesses and for people's jobs. But we've still got to recognise that the economic troubles we face and the jobs crisis we face doesn't end automatically when the restrictions lift. ""There is more longer-term support that we need to be giving."" Douglas Ross says it ""absolutely not"" his experience that people in Moray had been failing to comply with Covid guidelines and restrictions in the week leading up to the latest spike. He says he travelled all over Scotland during the six-week Holyrood election campaign and the way people were going about their lives was exactly the same as those in Moray. ""I'm sure the health experts will look into the data and see why we have had this spike,"" he says. ""But my message to the people of Moray is stick at it. ""If we work together, we will come through this together - and hopefully only a couple of weeks behind the rest of the country."" Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross, who is the MP for Moray, tells the BBC programme ""everything is being done by the local council, the health board and the Scottish government"" to get on top of the latest outbreak. He says the county remaining in level three will be difficult for local people and it is important to give businesses and families as much help as possible to stabilise and get cases coming down again. He also welcomed the move to give extra government funding to businesses forced to remain closed while level three restrictions are in place. ""It is absolutely vital that we get that support into the community here,"" Mr Ross says. Dr Evans says the Moray population ""seem to have stepped up to the mark"" in coming forward to be tested and having their vaccination jabs following the recent spike in case numbers. ""The possibility of remaining in level three really has helped people raise their guard again and that is what is needed."" Jillian Evans, the head of intelligence at NHS Grampian, tells the BBC One Coronavirus Update programme that all the evidence on case numbers, test positivity and vaccination uptake means we can be ""absolutely positive"" about the situation. ""Everything points to a cautious reopening of our lives as we know them and I feel we are at a real threshold today,"" she says. ""These changes are very significant."" Dr Evans says the figures must be continuously kept under review, ""to make sure we can manage pockets of outbreaks"" as we are seeing in Moray and not endanger the rest of the country.  The first minister also tells the BBC's Glenn Campbell that there was not any change at this stage to guidance on face coverings. On wearing face masks in schools, she says that will be looked at over the next couple of weeks. Again she says she does not want to pre-empt the work of the review by expert advisers. During her briefing, Ms Sturgeon announced the easing of guidance for physical distancing when it is in a person's own home or garden. The BBC's Glenn Campbell asks when it will be eased in other settings. The first minister says a fundamental review of physical distancing will take place over the next three weeks. She says she will not pre-empt that review but says the government is looking at whether there can be further relaxation of physical distancing in pubs, restaurants, cinemas etc.   Gordon Chree from STV points out those without a garden will ask what the difference is between hugging a friend in a garden or in a public park. Ms Sturgeon accepts that people might go a bit further than the rules and says it's ""simply a case of not wanting to do everything all at once"". She expects that the relaxation of physical distancing will be extended in three weeks' time. Ms Sturgeon says next week's changes are ""the most important yet"". The first minister wants us to enjoy the changes, including hugging loved ones. She urges us all to still remember FACTS: Ms Sturgeon says if you arrive from a country on the amber list, which is the majority of countries, you must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests during that time. If you travel from a green list country - those deemed the safest - you will need to take a PCR test shortly after arrival but you won't be required to self-isolate. Ms Sturgeon confirms changes to the rules on international travel, but says she still intends to be ""highly cautious"" given the risk of new variants. She says the situation now allows Scotland to move away from blanket restrictions on non-essential travel overseas. ""From Monday, will move to a traffic-light system...based on the state of the pandemic in each country across the world,"" she says. If you enter Scotland from a red list country, you will still have to isolate a hotel for 10 days. These countries will include Turkey, the Maldives and Nepal. Further changes will also come in on 17 May: Mainland Scotland, with the possible exception of Moray, will move to Level Two from Monday. Here are the main changes from 17 May:  The first minister warns we must be cautious, so the easing on the guidance for physical distancing will only apply to gatherings in our homes or gardens. However a review of physical distancing in public places will be undertaken. Ms Sturgeon calls on us all to use careful judgement as close physical contact does carry a risk. She warns we must be careful, particularly with vulnerable loved ones and we must limit the number of people we have close physical contact with. As we move forward personal judgement will take over from rules, which may pose difficulties, the first minister adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mary used to work at the cafe where Fred West was a regular customer Police are searching for a body at a cafe in Gloucester linked to a girl feared to have been murdered by serial killer Fred West. Mary Bastholm, 15, went missing on 6 January 1968 and has not been found. Officers were called to The Clean Plate by filmmakers working on a documentary. West was a regular customer when the teenager worked at the cafe. The film crew told police on Friday they had found evidence that a body could be buried within the property. Officers could be at the site ""for a number of weeks"" and excavation work is yet to begin, Gloucestershire Police said. Gloucestershire Police said the search might alarm those who worked nearby but it would carry out a proportionate investigation Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said: ""This could be a significant development on a case which has gained a lot of public interest over the years. ""On the basis of the information provided to us, we consider this to be new and potentially important evidence in the case of Mary Bastholm, however further detailed assessments will take place over the following few days to determine the extent of excavation needed. ""First and foremost our thoughts are with Mary's family and we would ask that their privacy is respected at this difficult time."" In a statement released via the force, Miss Bastholm's family said: ""We are aware of the ongoing developments around Mary's disappearance and are being kept up to date and supported by Gloucestershire Police family liaison officers. ""At this time please may we ask for privacy so we can grieve for Mary."" Police have begun removing evidence from the site A white tent has been set up outside the building in Southgate Street and officers are stationed at the scene. The cafe is close to Cromwell Street, where officers found the bodies of West's victims at the home he shared with his wife Rosemary. A spokesperson for The Nelson Trust, a women's charity that owns The Clean Plate, said: ""As soon as we were made aware of the situation, we have done everything we can to accommodate the investigation. ""The Clean Plate will remain closed until all necessary activity is complete. ""It is an extraordinary twist of fate that this building, now associated with a story as tragic as that of the victims of Fred and Rosemary West, is part of a charity working to support women at risk from violence."" A police cordon has been set up around the property By Andrew Plant, BBC News Mary Bastholm disappeared at a bus stop on her way to meet her boyfriend. There has been no trace of her since. It's been a mystery for 53 years. The cafe has been there for decades and has been under several different names. One of its waitresses was Mary, who was 15 at the time when Fred West was a regular customer and was known to him. It was also known he was a builder at the time renovation was needed on the cellar and the toilets at the cafe - work he was believed to have carried out in 1968. A lot of people locally put two and two together and suggested that perhaps he was responsible for her disappearance and that was where she ended up. Police say their activity will take place over a number of weeks and there will be disruption for some time. Fred West took his own life while awaiting trial for the murders of 12 people In 2012, a petition was set up calling for afresh investigationinto Miss Bastholm's disappearance but it was rejected by then Chief Constable Tony Melville. In 1994, West admitted murdering his daughter Heather. The confession came as police began to search 25 Cromwell Street, where they found the bodies of nine girls and young women. He and his wife Rose were jointly charged with nine murders and he was charged with a further three. West took his own life while awaiting the murder trial the following year.

"MPs have criticised levelling up schemes after finding that only 10% of the promised funding has been spent so far. The Public Accounts Committee also criticised a lack of transparency in how the money was allocated. Levelling up is a government policy to reduce inequality based on where people live. It was a big slogan for the Conservatives in the 2019 election and was inthe party's manifesto,external. Rishi Sunak says its aim is ""to create jobs, drive growth, and make sure that people feel enormous pride in the places that they call home"". Only 10% of flagship levelling up funds spent, say MPs The Levelling Up Fund awarded Â£1.7bn to projects in October 2021, Â£2.1bn in January 2023 and another Â£1.1bn in November 2023. The North West of England received the most money overall, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber. Questions were raised when the South East of England was awarded the second largest amount of funding in the second round. The government highlighted funding per head of the population. If you look at the funding awards this way, Wales comes out on top and the North of England does better than the South of England. The Public Accounts Committee said that only Â£3.7bn had been allocated to local authorities by December 2023, while councils had been able to spend only Â£1.24bn as of Sept 2023. It said the first round of levelling up funding was awarded to ""shovel-ready"" projects that were due to be completed in March, but 60 out of 71 (85%) have had to extend their deadlines, with further delays in other schemes said to be ""likely"". Levelling up funding process is broken, says Conservative mayor Andy Street Levelling up: Cost of living could deepen inequality, says Gove Areas were invited to bid for investment in transport, cultural, town centre and regeneration projects. Local MPs were allowed to give their formal support to two bids before the proposals were judged by officials from the Treasury, Levelling Up Department and Department for Transport. Assessing how fair this is, is not straightforward. Some projects - such as transport - may spread across several constituencies, represented by MPs from different parties. For the projects that can be allocated to a single party, we can say that more money was allocated to Conservative constituencies than to Labour ones. But there are significantly more Conservative ones. BBC analysis of the second round of funding found: 52% of successful bids that can be allocated to a party were in Conservative constituencies (the Conservatives won 56% of seats in the Commons in 2019) 24% of them were in Labour areas (Labour won 31% of the seats in 2019) Projects in Tory constituencies were awarded a total of Â£1.21bn, compared with Â£471m in Labour ones. There was one successful bid in a Lib Dem constituency, seven for the SNP, five for the DUP, three for Sinn Fein, and one each for the Alliance Party and Plaid Cymru. Areas have also been competing for money under the government's Towns Fund. In that contest, of the 56 constituencies that won, 47 had Conservative MPs. A zoo, a park and a pool - who got first round levelling up cash? Towns Fund: How were the winners chosen? On the second round of funding, Rishi Sunak said: ""two thirds of all the levelling up funding is going to the most deprived parts of our country"". BBC analysis shows that using the government'sindex of multiple deprivation,external, which is the usual measure, in the second round about 57% of England's funding went to the areas with the highest deprivation, down from 69% in the first round. That analysis excludes a small number of awards that were given to areas covering multiple local authorities. We asked the Levelling Up department about Mr Sunak's claim. It said it was not based on the government's index of multiple deprivation but was instead based on measures involving productivity, employment, vacancy rates, lack of skills and transport links. Labour said the money awarded was dwarfed by the cuts to local authority funding since 2010, with Alex Norris telling MPs: ""the government have nicked a tenner from our wallets and expect us to be grateful for getting less than two quid back."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies found,externalthat between 2009-10 and 2019-20, English councils' non-education funding per resident had fallen by almost a quarter, after adjusting for rising prices. The Institute for Government found,externalthat councils in the most deprived areas had been worst hit because they were the most reliant on central government funding. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlandscriticised the Levelling Up funding processas being part of Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"". He suggested the money would have been allocated better by local decision-makers than civil servants in London. Some government departments will have a new hub in Darlington Having 22,000 civil servants based outside London by the end of the decade, with a target for 25% of roles to be outside London by 2025 The government wants to level up skills with an extra Â£126m announced in March 2021 to fund work placements and training for 16 to 24-year-olds in England Locations for eight freeports have been chosen in England,external, with two planned in Scotland and two in Wales.

We'll be back tomorrow, but here are the top stories: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff on strike at a hospital near Paris, France Here are some of the day's key developments from around the world: The US will attempt to boost its vaccination campaign by partnering with ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft to provide free transport to and from tens of thousands of sites, the White House says. ""People will be able to simply select a vaccination site near them, follow simple directions to redeem their ride, and then get a ride to take them to and from a nearby vaccination site free of charge,""the Biden administration said in a statement,externaltoday. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until 4 July. President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70% of the US adult population vaccinated with at least one shot by 4 July to ensure safer Independence Day gatherings. The president is said to be discussing with state governors ""creative and innovative ways"" to get people vaccinated with the help of federal resources. ""Bio-secure bubbles"" enabled England's men to play international cricket last summer The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announceda loss of Â£16.1m in the past financial yearas a result of the pandemic. The postponed launch of The Hundred tournament was cited as one reason for a drop in revenue, alongside the cost of running bio-secure cricket. The loss has been transferred to their reserves, which now stand at Â£2.2m - down from more than Â£70m in 2016. Scott Smith, chief financial officer at the ECB, said: ""This has been a challenging year, but by being able to stage international cricket and by taking decisive action early in the pandemic, we have been able to support the network and avoid a far worse financial scenario. ""There remains considerable uncertainty over the year ahead, but we hope that delivering another full summer of cricket - and with crowds beginning to return from next week - we are able to protect the revenue we need to invest in growing our game."" Jo Goodman is part of a group of bereaved families campaigning for an inquiry A bit more now on the prime minister's promise thatthere will be a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic within the current Parliamentary session. Boris Johnson made the comments earlier during a debate in the House of Commons - the first time he has put a timeframe on when a probe into the pandemic will be held. He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future. The Prime Minister knows that and he's said as much.
""So why does he think it can wait? Who delays learning critical lessons that can save lives? This video can not be played Queen's Speech: State Opening of Parliament Slovakia's health ministry has ordered a halt to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people receiving their first doses following the death of a 47-year-old woman. The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham is asking the government for everyone over the age of 16 in the region to get a Covid vaccine to curb the spread of the Indian variant. Andy Burnham said it came after a ""worrying"" spike of cases in Bolton among the under-25s, which has seen cases double in a week. Bolton Council urged everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and tested. Mr Burnham said the rise in the town was a ""cause of concern"". Read more here.

A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors and social distancing will be relaxed further - echoing similar changes on the same date in England. Rule changes in Wales are also expected but are yet to be confirmed. Check what's changing in your area. This video can not be played Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that lockdown can be eased in most of Scotland from 17 May. It means people can mix in each others' homes again (up to six people from three households) and physical contact is no longer banned. You canread about the changes here. A body representing night-time economy businesses in Scotland has said the sector has been ""left in limbo"" over reopening due to a lack of clarity on dates from the government. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland, which has previously launched legal action against the Scottish government over the emergency coronavirus legislation put in place last year, has called for more certainty for the sector. NTIA Scotland chairman, Mike Grieve, said: ""As our neighbours south of the border prepare to unlock and remove all restrictions within the coming weeks, in Scotland we remain stuck in perpetual limbo with still no indicative date for reopening or even an outline of the conditions which will allow nightlife to restart. He called on the government to establish an ""a constructive path towards the unrestricted reopening"" of the sector. Under England's roadmap for easing restrictions, it is hoped that  nightclubs will be able to reopen in late June, as well as all legal limits on social contact being removed. However,in late June in Scotland there are still due to be limits on the number of people who can meet indoors,while nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in ""limited circumstances"".  As we reported first thing this morning, La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, reopened on Monday evening after being closed for six months. Only 500 spectators were allowed in for the performance - a fraction of the theatre's normal capacity of 2,000. Bad news too for half-time Spritz fans, there was also no intermission last night and the bars were closed. But the show went on... To respect social distancing, the musicians took over the ground-floor seating area... ...while the audience took their seats on the balconies Only 500 ticket-holders will be admitted for each performance for the time being The performance came a day before the 75th anniversary of a historic concert in 1946 that celebrated the post-war re-opening of the opera house - which had been bombed three years earlier and rebuilt. ""We have all listened to recorded concerts from our armchairs, but this has nothing to do with the emotion of live music, the quality and beauty of natural sound,"" Dominique Meyer, La Scala's director since 2020, told the AFP news agency. At lunchtime today, Scotland announced it will adopt the same traffic light system for foreign travel as England from Monday 17 May. Green-list destinations have the fewest rules - and Scotland's green list is currently the same as England's. The 12 countries and territories on the list are:  The majority of countries are on the amber list. People arriving from those countries must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests when they're back. Read more on the new travel rules here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that the planned 17 May lockdown easing will ""go ahead"", but unlikely just yet for Moray Most other council areas will move from level three to level two and some islands will move to level one Ms Sturgeon says that unless the case rate in Moray improves significantly over the next few days it will remain in level three. A final decision will be made on Friday For areas moving down levels, people will be allowed to meet indoors again, initially in groups of up to six from three households, and they will be allowed to hug However, the first minister says everyone should continue to be ""cautious"" and adhere to the rules Indoor hospitality will resume with alcohol being served in pubs or restaurants until 10.30pm From 17 May people in Scotland will be allowed to travel to some destinations without having to quarantine on their return The traffic lights system will be the same as England which is is also making the changes from Monday BBC Scotland News First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the changes will come into effect in most of the country from Monday.

That's all from us on the live page today. Please take care and stay safe. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Lockdown
is being eased a little faster than the Scottish government originally planned. Allowing
social mixing in your own home from Monday was anticipated but not with the
removal of social distancing rules. As
the first minister put it: âYou can hug your loved ones againâ - echoing a
similar announcement by the prime minister, relating to England. Scotland
is also aligning with the UK governmentâs plans to open up international travel
but taking more time to consider easing the requirements for face coverings in
school. Ending
social distancing at home creates an anomaly because the rules will remain in
force in other settings, including pubs and restaurants. The
Scottish government said it did not want to remove distancing rules everywhere
at once, to reduce the risk of Covid flare-ups. A wider review of this policy
is to report back in three weeks.   The Scottish government has published an overview of the protection levels and what you can do. Read it here,external Allow Twitter content?

Anas Sarwar says financial help for businesses not yet able to fully reopen must include making sure ""there is no cliff-edge on furlough"". ""If that happens with the furlough scheme, you could still push lots and lots of businesses to going bust and, worse still, push lots and lots of people into unemployment,"" he says. ""That would be a tragedy across our country."" Referencing the situation in Moray, Mr Sarwar says: ""If we get into the situation where we have spikes in individual communities and more micro-lockdowns across the country...we've got to make sure there is a robust economic package available to those communities. ""One, to support people particularly on low incomes so they can get by. ""But also supporting businesses so they can survive - and the job creation schemes that go alongside that."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar tells the BBC programme the whole country can feel a sense of hope and optimism as case numbers, in general, continue to fall. ""The fact that we will get to be out with our families and embrace our loved ones again will be a huge relief,"" he says. ""I know how desperate I am to hug my own granny and I know people across the country will be the same. ""Alongside that, there will be good news in this for businesses and for people's jobs. But we've still got to recognise that the economic troubles we face and the jobs crisis we face doesn't end automatically when the restrictions lift. ""There is more longer-term support that we need to be giving."" Douglas Ross says it ""absolutely not"" his experience that people in Moray had been failing to comply with Covid guidelines and restrictions in the week leading up to the latest spike. He says he travelled all over Scotland during the six-week Holyrood election campaign and the way people were going about their lives was exactly the same as those in Moray. ""I'm sure the health experts will look into the data and see why we have had this spike,"" he says. ""But my message to the people of Moray is stick at it. ""If we work together, we will come through this together - and hopefully only a couple of weeks behind the rest of the country."" Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross, who is the MP for Moray, tells the BBC programme ""everything is being done by the local council, the health board and the Scottish government"" to get on top of the latest outbreak. He says the county remaining in level three will be difficult for local people and it is important to give businesses and families as much help as possible to stabilise and get cases coming down again. He also welcomed the move to give extra government funding to businesses forced to remain closed while level three restrictions are in place. ""It is absolutely vital that we get that support into the community here,"" Mr Ross says. Dr Evans says the Moray population ""seem to have stepped up to the mark"" in coming forward to be tested and having their vaccination jabs following the recent spike in case numbers. ""The possibility of remaining in level three really has helped people raise their guard again and that is what is needed."" Jillian Evans, the head of intelligence at NHS Grampian, tells the BBC One Coronavirus Update programme that all the evidence on case numbers, test positivity and vaccination uptake means we can be ""absolutely positive"" about the situation. ""Everything points to a cautious reopening of our lives as we know them and I feel we are at a real threshold today,"" she says. ""These changes are very significant."" Dr Evans says the figures must be continuously kept under review, ""to make sure we can manage pockets of outbreaks"" as we are seeing in Moray and not endanger the rest of the country.  The first minister also tells the BBC's Glenn Campbell that there was not any change at this stage to guidance on face coverings. On wearing face masks in schools, she says that will be looked at over the next couple of weeks. Again she says she does not want to pre-empt the work of the review by expert advisers. During her briefing, Ms Sturgeon announced the easing of guidance for physical distancing when it is in a person's own home or garden. The BBC's Glenn Campbell asks when it will be eased in other settings. The first minister says a fundamental review of physical distancing will take place over the next three weeks. She says she will not pre-empt that review but says the government is looking at whether there can be further relaxation of physical distancing in pubs, restaurants, cinemas etc.   Gordon Chree from STV points out those without a garden will ask what the difference is between hugging a friend in a garden or in a public park. Ms Sturgeon accepts that people might go a bit further than the rules and says it's ""simply a case of not wanting to do everything all at once"". She expects that the relaxation of physical distancing will be extended in three weeks' time. Ms Sturgeon says next week's changes are ""the most important yet"". The first minister wants us to enjoy the changes, including hugging loved ones. She urges us all to still remember FACTS: Ms Sturgeon says if you arrive from a country on the amber list, which is the majority of countries, you must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests during that time. If you travel from a green list country - those deemed the safest - you will need to take a PCR test shortly after arrival but you won't be required to self-isolate. Ms Sturgeon confirms changes to the rules on international travel, but says she still intends to be ""highly cautious"" given the risk of new variants. She says the situation now allows Scotland to move away from blanket restrictions on non-essential travel overseas. ""From Monday, will move to a traffic-light system...based on the state of the pandemic in each country across the world,"" she says. If you enter Scotland from a red list country, you will still have to isolate a hotel for 10 days. These countries will include Turkey, the Maldives and Nepal. Further changes will also come in on 17 May: Mainland Scotland, with the possible exception of Moray, will move to Level Two from Monday. Here are the main changes from 17 May:  The first minister warns we must be cautious, so the easing on the guidance for physical distancing will only apply to gatherings in our homes or gardens. However a review of physical distancing in public places will be undertaken. Ms Sturgeon calls on us all to use careful judgement as close physical contact does carry a risk. She warns we must be careful, particularly with vulnerable loved ones and we must limit the number of people we have close physical contact with. As we move forward personal judgement will take over from rules, which may pose difficulties, the first minister adds. Â© 2025 BBC.

He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future. The Prime Minister knows that and he's said as much.
""So why does he think it can wait? Who delays learning critical lessons that can save lives?

The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the
O2,â says one of the officials on the red carpet at the Brits. 
For many people, this is the first live event theyâve been to since last year.
In fact, I found my 2020 Brits ticket in my suit as I got ready this
morning.
Itâs shaping up to be a big night. Dua Lipa, Arlo Parks, Coldplay and The
Weeknd are all performing - and thereâs a rumour that Taylor Swift has flown
in from the US to collect her global icon award. The ceremony, which will take place soon in front of a 4,000-strong live audience without social distancing or face masks at London's O2 Arena, is part of the government's pilot scheme for reopening live events. The red carpet kicks off at 5pm. Keep across the @BBCNewsEnts Twitter feed for

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham is asking the government for everyone over the age of 16 in the region to get a Covid vaccine to curb the spread of the Indian variant. Andy Burnham said it came after a ""worrying"" spike of cases in Bolton among the under-25s, which has seen cases double in a week. Bolton Council urged everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and tested. Mr Burnham said the rise in the town was a ""cause of concern"". Read more here. Antonietta said she had looked forward to a professional haircut ""I feel like a different woman altogether,"" says Antonietta Orfeo, 84, after getting her first haircut in more than a year. Antoinetta lives at Arden House care home in Bedford, which put out an appeal for a hair stylist after its regular one has not been able to come since lockdown in March 2020. Two stylists came forward, leaving the care home manager relieved that she no longer had to ""hack away"" at hair. ""I've had to apologise to everyone whose hair I've cut,"" she added. ""The residents have all needed to be restyled due to my attempts."" A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors and social distancing will be relaxed further - echoing similar changes on the same date in England. Rule changes in Wales are also expected but are yet to be confirmed. Check what's changing in your area. This video can not be played Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that lockdown can be eased in most of Scotland from 17 May. It means people can mix in each others' homes again (up to six people from three households) and physical contact is no longer banned. You canread about the changes here. A body representing night-time economy businesses in Scotland has said the sector has been ""left in limbo"" over reopening due to a lack of clarity on dates from the government. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland, which has previously launched legal action against the Scottish government over the emergency coronavirus legislation put in place last year, has called for more certainty for the sector. NTIA Scotland chairman, Mike Grieve, said: ""As our neighbours south of the border prepare to unlock and remove all restrictions within the coming weeks, in Scotland we remain stuck in perpetual limbo with still no indicative date for reopening or even an outline of the conditions which will allow nightlife to restart. He called on the government to establish an ""a constructive path towards the unrestricted reopening"" of the sector. Under England's roadmap for easing restrictions, it is hoped that  nightclubs will be able to reopen in late June, as well as all legal limits on social contact being removed. However,in late June in Scotland there are still due to be limits on the number of people who can meet indoors,while nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in ""limited circumstances"".  As we reported first thing this morning, La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, reopened on Monday evening after being closed for six months. Only 500 spectators were allowed in for the performance - a fraction of the theatre's normal capacity of 2,000. Bad news too for half-time Spritz fans, there was also no intermission last night and the bars were closed. But the show went on... To respect social distancing, the musicians took over the ground-floor seating area... ...while the audience took their seats on the balconies Only 500 ticket-holders will be admitted for each performance for the time being The performance came a day before the 75th anniversary of a historic concert in 1946 that celebrated the post-war re-opening of the opera house - which had been bombed three years earlier and rebuilt. ""We have all listened to recorded concerts from our armchairs, but this has nothing to do with the emotion of live music, the quality and beauty of natural sound,"" Dominique Meyer, La Scala's director since 2020, told the AFP news agency. At lunchtime today, Scotland announced it will adopt the same traffic light system for foreign travel as England from Monday 17 May. Green-list destinations have the fewest rules - and Scotland's green list is currently the same as England's. The 12 countries and territories on the list are:  The majority of countries are on the amber list. People arriving from those countries must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests when they're back. Read more on the new travel rules here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Cruise has won Golden Globes for Jerry Maguire, Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July Tom Cruise has handed back his three Golden Globes in protest at a lack of diversity among the body that runs the glittering annual Hollywood awards. He is the latest star to join a growing chorus of criticism. NBC, which has aired the event since 1996, has said it won't broadcast the ceremony next year. NBC said it wanted to see ""meaningful reform"" from the organisers, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The Golden Globes are second only to the Oscars in terms of profile. Time's Up, a leading advocate for industry reform, described NBC's move as a ""defining moment for Hollywood"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It added that it was committed ""to achieving these goals with extreme urgency"". The plans will widen the HFPA's membership, with an emphasis on recruiting black members and the hiring of diversity advisers. It has pledged to increase its membership by 50% over the next 18 months. The association also indicated it would loosen its cloak of secrecy and strict admission rules by publishing its membership list and accepting foreign entertainment journalists who are based across the US, not just in California. Diversity, equity and inclusion training will be given to all members, as well as sexual harassment awareness training. And members will be barred from accepting promotional items from film and TV studios. Scarlett Johansson claimed she had been asked sexist questions by HFPA members Time's Up described the proposals as ""window-dressing platitudes"". ""Any organisation or sponsors that set themselves up to pass judgement on our vibrant community of creators and talent must do better,"" said Time's Up president Tina Tchen.

The main issues appears to be that the implementation of changes isn't fast enough. According to Variety,external, organisations will continue to boycott the Globes and other HFPA events until the reforms are actually enacted. The timeline published by the HFPA,externalstates that a new board and new members will be in place by the first week of August. In a statement on Monday, NBC said: ""Change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the HFPA needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes. ""Assuming the organisation executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023."" The TV network's decision also follows a steep drop inviewing figures for the Globes,external, which hit a 13-year low this year. That is a trend for film award shows in general - particularly during the pandemic, with many ceremonies eschewing the red carpet and conducting their events virtually.

He added: ""Once the tide turned against the HFPA, everyone wanted to jump on the wagon and benefit from it. It's a political game.""

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"". In her constituency, Hackney South and Shoreditch, the average house price is 17 times of the average wage, she states. She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Queens Speech: Starmer and Johnson on government plans Boris Johnson has said the government ""won't settle for going back to the way things were"", as the UK emerges from the coronavirus pandemic. He promised to end the ""criminal waste of talent"" in parts of the UK by spreading opportunity more evenly. It came as the government unveiled 30 planned new laws for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's programme lacked urgency and ambition. ""Today we needed a Queen's Speech that rose to scale of the moment,"" said Sir Keir, but instead, he claimed, it was ""packed with short-term gimmicks and distant promises"". Follow live: Queen's Speech and reaction What was in the Queen's Speech? Starmer: Lack of social care plan 'unforgivable' First major event for Queen since Philip's death Sir Keir seized on the absence of new legislation to fix the funding of adult social care - something he said the prime minister had promised on the steps of Downing Street two years ago. He said the government's failure to act on the issue after the pandemic was ""nothing short of an insult"" and it was ""a similar story on skills and education"". The government has promised to bring forward social care proposals later this year. Sir Keir Starmer accuses the government of dragging its heels over social care funding Many of the measures in the Queen's Speech are aimed at the Conservatives'new electoral strongholdsin the Midlands and north of England. The prime minister told MPs: ""We intend to unite and level up across the whole of our United Kingdom because we one nation Conservatives understand this crucial point - that you will find flair and imagination and enthusiasm and genius distributed evenly across this country while opportunity is not. ""And we need to change that because it is not just a moral and social disgrace, it is an economic mistake. It is a criminal waste of talent. ""And though we cannot for one moment minimise the damage that Covid has done - the loss of learning, the NHS backlogs, the courts delays, the massive fiscal consequences - we must use this opportunity to achieve a national recovery so that jabs, jabs jabs becomes jobs, jobs, jobs."" Among the planned new laws are: A Skills and Post-16 Education Bill for England, with loans for adults wanting to retrain and more powers to deal with failing colleges A bill aimed at deterring asylum seekers from crossing the English Channel A bill to ease planning controls and increase housebuilding in England Plans to improve bus and train service connectivity in England New laws to scrap the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, meaning it will be easier for Mr Johnson to call an early general election before 2024 Missing from the government's programme was a specific bill on dealing with the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, although the speech saidlegislation will be introduced. Andtrade unions accused the government of ""rowing back""on a promise to protect workers' rights. Downing Street said an Employment Bill would be introduced ""when the time is right"", citing the pandemic as the reason for the delay. This video can not be played Spot the difference: How the Queen's Speech changed this year Mr Johnsoncommitted to setting up a ""full, proper"" public inquiryinto the government's handling of the pandemic, which could begin in the coming year, in response to a question from Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey. Sir Ed also raised concerns about plans to introduce voter ID for future general elections, which he said would hit the disadvantaged and ethnic minorities, and were ""straight from the Donald Trump playbook"". And he echoedcriticism of planning reformsby former Prime Minister Theresa May, who said they would hand too much power to developers and ""see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, told the prime minister there was a fresh mandate for a Scottish independence referendum after Thursday's elections. He also attacked ""further power grabs"" by the Westminster government in the Queen's Speech. One of the pleasures of the Queen's Speech for journalists is hearing Her Majesty reading out the political slogans of the government of the day. So 15 seconds in there was mention of the prime minister's favourite: plans to ""level up"" the country. The meaning of the phrase is gradually being refined but the agenda is still vast and encompasses jobs, schools, health, policing, industry, productivity, civic pride, the strength of local leadership and the quality of life. But the real detail in this area will come later this year when the government publishes a White Paper where it will spell out much more detail about what levelling up means and the ""bold"" action that ministers will take to achieve it. So for now the government is trumpeting what it's already doing: a Â£4.8bn fund for infrastructure projects, Â£830m for redeveloping High Streets, along with eight freeports and 40 new hospitals in England. And where there are such big promises, Labour stands ready to highlight pledges that go unmet. This year's speech also included changes to the policing of protests, including setting time and noise limits. A previous discussion of this by MPs earlier this year led toangry demonstrations. Critics say the measures impose disproportionate controls on free expression and the right to protest - but ministers say the proposals will respect human rights and will only affect very disruptive gatherings. Queen's Speech commits to Troubles legislation UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare Government to consult before conversion therapy ban A ban on so-calledconversion therapy- attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity - is also planned. The Queen's Speech is part of the State Opening of Parliament, normally the grandest of Westminster occasions. But it was pared back this year because of Covid, with fewer MPs and peers than normal gathering in the House of Lords to hear it - and the Queen arriving by car rather than the usual carriage. It was the Queen's first major public engagement since thedeath of the Duke of Edinburgh.

"Doug Beattie, a retired Army captain, said he was the right person to be able to ""rekindle the fortunes"" of the UUP Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie has put his name forward to be the next leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). The party has begun the process of appointing a new leader after Steve Aiken announced his resignation. Mr Aiken said the party was ""not breaking through"" and had ""not been working as well as it should be"". Mr Beattie, a retired Army captain, said he was the right person to ""rekindle the fortunes"" of the UUP and give a clear vision for the future. He told BBC Newsline he would have a different style and would be ""able to reach out to all people in Northern Ireland regardless of what your religion is, sexual orientation or ethnicity"". Mr Beattie, who was elected MLA for Upper Bann in 2016, said people underestimated Mr Aiken, whom he described as a strong unionist with liberal views. ""I share [those views] with him,"" he added. ""Maybe the presentation might be slightly different and maybe we have to work on how we get our message out to people."" Mr Beattie said the Northern Ireland Protocol, the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland which places a border in the Irish Sea, must be replaced. This video can not be played Unionism needs to get its act together - Steve Aiken He said it was damaging to the Good Friday Agreement but the party had an alternative ready to go. ""I do not want a hardened border on the island of Ireland. But neither do I want a border in the Irish Sea,"" Mr Beattie said. Earlier, outgoing leader Mr Aiken said unionism needed to ""get its act together"" and there was now a time for reflection. Mr Aiken will remain in charge temporarily until his successor is found. A virtual meeting of the party's ruling executive will be held on Tuesday night to discuss the leadership process. Mr Aiken has been in charge since November 2019. Steve Aiken told a press conference in Stormont that the UUP had ""not been working as well as it should be"" Mr Aiken said the UUP continued to do what was right not only for unionists but for all in Northern Ireland. He said his resignation as party leader was a ""bittersweet moment"". ""I am, however, self-aware enough to realise that our party, despite our strengths, is not breaking through,"" he said. ""I am also very aware of my limitations. And despite the successes over the last 19 months, I realise that a change of leadership is needed."" Upper Bann MLA Doug Beattie (right) has been tipped as a possible successor to Mr Aiken (left) Mr Aiken said the UUP was a team in which all parts needed to work effectively. ""Quite frankly, it hasn't been working as well as it should be. That is down to me,"" he said. ""Rather than being the perceived problem, I want to be part of the solution."" Party chairman Danny Kennedy thanked Mr Aiken for his leadership, describing him as a ""dedicated Ulster Unionist"".

"Pret a Manger will trial opening its concessions in Tesco supermarkets after seeing a huge drop in demand as more people work from home. The sandwich chain has struggled in the pandemic as many of its branches are in city centres and rely on office trade. With the remote working trend set to continue post-pandemic, it is exploring new ways to operate. ""We're transforming our business model to adjust to a new way of living and working,"" said Pret. With more companies switching to hybrid working, chains such as Pret have been forced to respond. The move will involve just four Pret branches opening in Tesco stores at first, but if successful, it will spread. The first shop will open in Tesco's Kensington superstore in London in June, with three other shops set to open later in the summer. The company launched its first grocery food range in Tesco earlier this year, selling frozen croissants and granola through the supermarket. The move is the latest attempt by Pret to adapt to the changes imposed by coronavirus. In the days before Covid struck, the food chain's extensive network of branches in prime urban locations was seen as its greatest strength. But when lockdowns dramatically reduced the number of commuters, the firm became a symbol of the economic woes inflicted by the pandemic. During 2020, it closed 74 outlets in the UK and 22 in the US. Last summer,it cut 3,000 jobs, more than a third of its workforce, as part of a rescue plan to save the business. Earlier this year, it scrapped its dividend payment to shareholders and warned of ""material uncertainties"" over its future. ""As the UK emerges from lockdown, this partnership with Tesco is one way in which we're transforming our business model,"" said Pano Christou, Pret's chief executive. The chain is also increasing its motorway service shops in partnership with Moto. It opened the first of three at Cherwell Valley in December 2020, followed by a second at Moto's Rugby service which opened last month. The chain has also introduced a subscription serviceallowing customers up to five cups of coffee a day for a Â£20 monthly fee, while Pret-branded ground coffee and espresso beans are now available via Amazon.

"The damage caused to a vehicle whose driver was innocently caught up in a collision An estimated 170,000 car insurance claims in 15 months are suspected to have been linked to ""crash for cash"" gangs, investigations suggest. Crash for cash is the name given to a fraud when criminals deliberately cause a road collision to claim compensation. The Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB), which shares intelligence within the sector, said that parts of Birmingham were the centre of these cases. Insurers said the fraud cost meant premiums increased for all motorists. Men jailed for crash-for-cash scam Â£2m crash for cash convictions top 150 Facebook posts nail crash for cash gang The IFB said there were 2.7 million motor insurance claims across the UK from October 2019 to the end of last year, of which 170,000 could be linked to suspected crash for cash networks. It said the main hotspots were the B25, B34 and B8 postcode areas of Birmingham, and the BD7 and BD3 areas of Bradford. It hoped that by pinpointing crash for cash hotspots, people would be encouraged to be vigilant as more drivers start to take to the roads. Many innocent drivers are caught up in these collisions. IFB investigations have found single gangs can be behind thousands of orchestrated collisions in some areas, with the combined value of their fraudulent claims running into the millions. James Dalton, director of general insurance policy at the Association of British Insurers (ABI), said: ""These criminal gangs are often highly organised and put lives at risk. ""The amounts that they fraudulently claim can be huge, and can impact on the motor premiums paid by honest motorists."" Between 2011 to 2018, more than 150 people were convicted in south Wales for submitting bogus claims, as part of a Â£2m car insurance scam. The Yandell family's ""crash for cash"" swindlewent undetected for years due to the sheer number of people they roped into the scam. It centred around using vehicles in staged accidents so the fraudsters could submit bogus and exaggerated insurance claims.

"This video can not be played Video shows students escaping from school windows Seven children and two adults have been killed in a shooting at a school in the Russian city of Kazan, officials say. Twenty-one other people, mostly children, were injured. A 19-year-old suspect was detained. The attack happened in the capital of the republic of Tatarstan, 820km (510 miles) east of Moscow. Russian PM Mikhail Mishustin spoke of ""great sorrow"" while Tatarstan's leader Rustam Minnikhanov described the attack as a ""major tragedy"". ""We are deeply saddened that this has happened,"" he said. Responding to the shooting, Russian President Vladimir Putin saidhe would review the country's gun control laws. School shootings are relatively rare in Russia. One of the last major incidentshappened in Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018. Mr Minnikhanov confirmed the deaths of seven children - four boys and three girls - as well as a female teacher and a female school worker at School No 175. It is believed the children were eighth graders (aged around 15). Eighteen children and three adults were being treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds, fractures and bruising, Mr Minnikhanov added. The attack began at about 09:20 local time (06:20 GMT), a source in the emergency services told Russian news agency Tass. The first signal from a panic button at the school was sent five minutes later. ""Everyone started panicking and saying 'shut the doors',"" a student who witnessed the attack told the Mediazona news website. ""About a minute later the head teacher started yelling: 'We're shutting the doors!' Armed police arrived at the school and then sealed off the fourth floor, reports said ""We got out about 15 minutes later, not out of the windows. I wanted to do that, but the teacher closed the window immediately and said no."" Footage shared on social media shows some children jumping from windows to escape as well as injured people being evacuated. Russian TV reported that two of the children had died after jumping from a second-floor window. Heavily armed police and emergency vehicles responded to the incident. A Kazan resident outside the school told Moscow Echo radio station that people there were hysterical. ""Parents are crying, medics are giving out medicine,"" she said. Elvira Ignatyeva, a 25-year-old English teacher, was killed trying to shield one of the children, a police source told Tass news agency, quoting eyewitnesses. She had pushed the child out of the way in a corridor and tried to block the gunman but was shot and mortally wounded, the source said. On her Instagram account, Ms Ignatyeva had often posted upbeat messages over photos of herself enjoying walks  and nights out. ""It's not that hard to make your life happy,"" she wrote on 1 February. You just need to stop thinking that happiness is only possible somewhere over there, in the future, and learn to enjoy every actual minute, here and now..."" Allow Instagram content?

Reports initially said that there were two gunmen and that one of them had been killed. But officials later said there was only one suspect, named locally as Ilnaz Galyaviev. Russian investigators say he is a Kazan resident and it is believed he once studied at the school. Medics comforted relatives of students at the school Mr Minnikhanov said the suspect was a registered firearm owner. According to Russian MP Alexander Khinshteyn, the suspect received a firearms licence only recently. The MP said it was for a semi-automatic shotgun. Officials did not comment on the possible motive for the attack although Mr Minnikhanov called the attacker a ""terrorist"". The suspect went on social media before the attack, posting that he planned to kill a ""huge number"" of people before shooting himself. Screenshots of his account, now blocked, show him wearing a black mask with the word ""god"" written across it in red.

Authorities have called for all schools in Tatarstan to be inspected and have their security stepped up. A day of mourning will be held on Wednesday to honour the victims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin had ordered the chief of Russia's National Guard to ""work out as a matter of urgency new regulations on the types of weapon that can be in civilian circulation and that can be owned by the public"". The instruction was issued ""given the type of firearm used by the shooter"", Mr Peskov said. ""The fact is that sometimes types of small arms are registered as hunting weapons, which in some countries are used as assault rifles,"" he explained. Russia to tighten gun rules after school shooting School shooting tragedy leaves Russia in shock Olga Ivshina, BBC News People in Kazan seem to be completely shocked and devastated by what has happened. It is a big city - with more than one million people - which has enjoyed peace and stability over the past decade. Schools in Kazan - as well as in most other Russian cities - are not really guarded. Usually it is just one or two unarmed private security guards who meet people coming to the school at the gates. Often many of these so-called security officers are pensioners with no special training. But even if they had any it is hard to confront an armed person with bare hands. It is worth mentioning that the Kazan gunman allegedly used a gun very similar to one the attacker in Crimea used in 2018. It is a relatively cheap but powerful rifle which can be bought for the equivalent of just $280 (Â£200). There are a lot of discussions now in Russia about whether the regulations for civilian gun ownership should be changed. Shootings at schools are relatively rare in Russia compared with other countries. In November 2019 a 19-year-old student shot dead a classmate and injured three others before killing himself in the far eastern city of Blagoveshchensk. Investigators said the motive for the attack may have been a personal conflict In October 2018 a teenager armed with a semi-automatic shotgunkilled 20 people at a technical college in the city of Kerchin Russian-annexed Crimea. He then shot himself dead In February 2013, a 15-year-old student shot dead a teacher and a police officer, injuring a second police officer, when he took hostages at a school in Moscow.

"The results add pressure on Beijing to boost measures for couples to have more babies China's population grew at its slowest pace in decades, according to government data released on Tuesday. The average annual growth rate was 0.53% over the past 10 years, down from a rate of 0.57% between 2000 and 2010 - bringing the population to 1.41bn. The results add pressure on Beijing to boost measures for couples to have more babies and avert a population decline. The results were announced in a once-a-decade census, which was originally expected to be released in April. The census was conducted in late 2020 where some seven million census takers had gone door-to-door to collect information from Chinese households. Given the sheer number of people surveyed, it is considered the most comprehensive resource on China's population, which is important for future planning. 'Jaw-dropping' world fertility rate crash expected Mothers, your country needs you! The nations with big (and small) population issues Ning Jizhe, head of the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that 12 million babies were born last year - a significant decrease from the 18 million newborns in 2016. However he added that it was ""still a considerable number"". Mr Ning added that a lower fertility rate is a natural result of China's social and economic development. As countries become more developed, birth rates tend to fall due to education or other priorities such as careers. Its neighbouring countries Japan and South Korea, for example, have also seen birth rates fall to record lows in recent years despite various government incentives for couples to have more children. Last year,South Korea recorded more deaths than birthsfor the first time in history, raising fresh alarm in a country which already has the world's lowest birth rate. Shrinking populations are problematic due to the inverted age structure, with more old people than the young. When that happens, there won't be enough workers in the future to support the elderly, and there may be an increased demand for health and social care. Yes. In 2016, the government ended a controversial one-child policy and allowed couples to have two children. But the reform failed to reverse the country's falling birth rate despite a two-year increase immediately afterwards. Ms Yue Su, principal economist from The Economist Intelligence Unit, said: ""While the second-child policy had a positive impact on the birth rate, it proved short-term in nature."" There had been expectations that China might scrap the family planning policy altogether along with the new census results, but this did not happen. A report by the Financial Times in April also quoted people familiar with the matter as saying the census would reveal a population decline. This did not happen with the 2020 report but experts have told various media outlets that it could still happen over the next few years. ""It will in 2021 or 2022, or very soon,"" Huang Wenzhang, a demography expert at the Centre for China and Globalisation told Reuters. An ageing China may mean that there won't be enough workers in the future to support the elderly China's population trends have over the years been largely shaped by the one-child policy, which was introduced in 1979 to slow population growth. Families that violated the rules faced fines, loss of employment and sometimes forced abortions. China's working-age population - which it defines as people aged between 16 and 59 - has also declined by 40 million as compared to the last census in 2010. But chief methodologist Zeng Yuping said that the total size ""remains big"" with 880 million. ""We still have an abundant labour force,"" he said. However, economist Ms Yue warned that going forward, continued drops in the labour force ""will place a cap on China's potential economic growth."" She added: ""The demographic dividend that propelled the country's economic rise over recent decades is set to dissipate quickly."" After a few extra weeks in which officials were reportedly working to ""prepare"" the numbers and help to ""set the agenda"" the bottom line is the number of Chinese in China is growing - just. Most of that is people getting older - and staying older. There was a small increase in the number of under 14s, a vindication of the decision to end the one-child policy in 2015, according to the government's census chief. But state media is already talking about the population beginning to fall next year. This is not a demographic change unique to China, but with the biggest population in the world and an economy that it's trying to make more reliant on domestic consumption, this is a particularly salient issue. China's Communist leaders have already said retirement age will need to go up to deal with those demands and costs. This could mean more work to come for the country's workers. Experts warned that any impact on China's population, such as a decline, could have a vast effect on other parts of the world. Dr Yi Fuxian, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said: ""China's economy has grown very quickly, and many industries in the world rely on China. The scope of the impact of a population decline would be very wide."" This video can not be played Do China's 'one child generation' want more children?

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"". In her constituency, Hackney South and Shoreditch, the average house price is 17 times of the average wage, she states. She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Millions of Apple's UK customers should be compensated for breaches of competition law, a legal action claims. The case, filed with the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), alleges Apple's 30% commission on app sales is an abuse of dominance and unlawful. Organisers are aiming to include nearly 20 million UK users in the collective action, if it is approved. Those behind the claim say they intend to seek damages of up to Â£1.5bn. Apple said the legal action was ""meritless"". While the UK does not have the same kind of class-action legal structure as the US, so-called ""optout"" claims have been allowed in the CAT since 2015, meaning all affected people could be covered unless they decide to exclude themselves. And anyone in the UK who has bought paid apps, paid subscriptions, or other in-app purchases on an iPhone or iPad since October 2015 is included in the claim. However, such a collective action needs to be approved by the tribunal before proceeding. While the 30% Apple cut on sales is already facing challenges from other companies, the group behind this claim say it is customers who have ultimately paid the fee. It alleges: Apple deliberately shuts out potential competition it requires ordinary users to use Apple's own payment-processing system doing so generates ""unlawfully excessive levels of profit"" the charges are ""an unlawful raid on Apple's customers' purses"" King's College London digital-economy lecturer Dr Rachael Kent, who is taking the case to the tribunal and representing all those affected, said Apple ""charges entry and usage fees that are completely unjustified"". ""This is the behaviour of a monopolist and is unacceptable,"" she said. Apple's estimates of its costs for running the App Store were ""just $100m"" (Â£71m) - but it had made $15bn (Â£10.6bn) last year. ""Apple achieves this by slapping unjustified charges on its users,"" Dr Kent said. ""It would not be able to impose these exorbitant charges if competitor platforms and payment systems were allowed to compete."" Apple charged over 'anti-competitive' app policies Apple faces Epic Games in court The rest of the team behind the case includes law firm Hausfeld and Co and Vannin Capital. Vannin would be paid - a proportion of the total compensation, from ""damages that are left unclaimed"" - only if the case succeeded, the group said, ""putting their money at risk for a lengthy legal battle with one of the wealthiest corporations in the world"". ""Claimants will not lose out,"" the group added. In a statement, Apple said: ""We believe this lawsuit is meritless and welcome the opportunity to discuss with the court our unwavering commitment to consumers and the many benefits the App Store has delivered to the UK's innovation economy."" It highlighted that the 30% cut is ""very much in the mainstream of those charged by all other digital marketplaces"", and said 84% of apps on its App Store were free - so developers paid nothing. It also argued that the ""vast majority"" of developers paid a commission of 15%, in an apparent reference toits recent decision to cut rates on the first $1m. Apple's competitor Google also charges a 30% fee, along with several other digital platforms. But the group said it was ""not in a position to comment on Google at the moment"". Apple has faced abacklash from several developers in the past year, along withscrutiny from an EU competition investigation and the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommitteein the US. It is embroiled in a major US-based legal battle with Epic Games, which says Apple's policies prevent it competing on price. And earlier this year,the competition tribunal rejected Epic's attempt to bring that case into the UK, while allowing a similar one against Google to proceed.

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"". In her constituency, Hackney South and Shoreditch, the average house price is 17 times of the average wage, she states. She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Englandâs NHS app will be available to use as a vaccine passport from Monday, the government has said - but only for those who have had both doses of the jab. A paper version will also be available - by calling 119 but not through a GP. Both will be available from Monday, 17 May, when the ban on foreign travel is eased. The NHS app is separate to the NHS Covid-19 app, which is used for contact tracing. People can already use the NHS app to: request repeat prescriptions arrange appointments to see their doctor view medical records It can also show vaccine statuses, including for coronavirus, but currently this feature must be enabled by a GP before it appears on the app. The new update will contain a separate feature to display coronavirus vaccine records, so the government said there should be no need to contact GPs. The app will not show coronavirus test results, but the NHS plans to incorporate this in the future,the government website said.,external It advised people to register to use the app at least two weeks before travelling. A paper letter can be requested only at least five days after a second vaccine dose and can take five days to arrive. âThere are not many countries that currently accept proof of vaccination,â the government advice warns. âSo for the time being, most people will still need to follow other rules when travelling abroad â like getting a negative pre-departure test.â The government has announced 12 countriespeople in England can travel to, without having to quarantine when they return. But not all of these destinations allow UK tourists. For example, travel to mainland Portugal and the Azores is currently for essential purposes only. The list will be reviewed every three weeks. Countries can be added or removed at short notice. It's finally becoming clearer exactly how the government plans to use the NHS app as a vaccine passport. It had been assumed it depended on getting GPs to share a patient's data with the app. I'd been on the phone to my GP surgery because neither of my two jabs was showing up in the app. But this morning a Department of Health spokeswoman told me that NHS X - the health service digital division - has designed an update to the app which doesn't depend on GP records. The update won't go live until May 17th  and will provide a new tab displaying your vaccine record, the idea being that this is all you need to show rather than any other sensitive data being visible. What's not clear however is whether this solution will be acceptable to foreign airlines or border police. But there is one message the government is keen to get out - don't do what I did and ring your GP. Travellers also need to take coronavirus tests before returning to England and after arrival. Some countries may also require tests to be taken upon entry to the holiday destination. European officials have announced plans for anEU-wide ""Green Digital Certificate"". This would allow anyone vaccinated against Covid or who has tested negative or recently recovered from the virus to travel within the region. Officials hopethe certificate will be in place,externalbefore the summer. Several companies have been working on apps to make travel easier, including trade body the International Air Transport Association, who are piloting 'Travel Pass'. It said it has been in discussions with government to ensure the pass can read data from the NHS App. ""We're keen to go further and faster now that the Secretary of State has confirmed that travellers will have access to their covid vaccination status by 17 May,"" a spokesperson added. ""Globally there are now 20+ countries that are either easing testing or quarantine requirements for vaccinated passengers so the UK needs to move quickly if it does not want to fall behind globally in supporting its citizens' ability to freely travel.""

We'll be back tomorrow, but here are the top stories: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff on strike at a hospital near Paris, France Here are some of the day's key developments from around the world: The US will attempt to boost its vaccination campaign by partnering with ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft to provide free transport to and from tens of thousands of sites, the White House says. ""People will be able to simply select a vaccination site near them, follow simple directions to redeem their ride, and then get a ride to take them to and from a nearby vaccination site free of charge,""the Biden administration said in a statement,externaltoday. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until 4 July. President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70% of the US adult population vaccinated with at least one shot by 4 July to ensure safer Independence Day gatherings. The president is said to be discussing with state governors ""creative and innovative ways"" to get people vaccinated with the help of federal resources. ""Bio-secure bubbles"" enabled England's men to play international cricket last summer The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announceda loss of Â£16.1m in the past financial yearas a result of the pandemic. The postponed launch of The Hundred tournament was cited as one reason for a drop in revenue, alongside the cost of running bio-secure cricket. The loss has been transferred to their reserves, which now stand at Â£2.2m - down from more than Â£70m in 2016. Scott Smith, chief financial officer at the ECB, said: ""This has been a challenging year, but by being able to stage international cricket and by taking decisive action early in the pandemic, we have been able to support the network and avoid a far worse financial scenario. ""There remains considerable uncertainty over the year ahead, but we hope that delivering another full summer of cricket - and with crowds beginning to return from next week - we are able to protect the revenue we need to invest in growing our game."" Jo Goodman is part of a group of bereaved families campaigning for an inquiry A bit more now on the prime minister's promise thatthere will be a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic within the current Parliamentary session. Boris Johnson made the comments earlier during a debate in the House of Commons - the first time he has put a timeframe on when a probe into the pandemic will be held. He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future. The Prime Minister knows that and he's said as much.
""So why does he think it can wait? Who delays learning critical lessons that can save lives? This video can not be played Queen's Speech: State Opening of Parliament Slovakia's health ministry has ordered a halt to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people receiving their first doses following the death of a 47-year-old woman. The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here.

A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced.

"This video can not be played Video shows students escaping from school windows Seven children and two adults have been killed in a shooting at a school in the Russian city of Kazan, officials say. Twenty-one other people, mostly children, were injured. A 19-year-old suspect was detained. The attack happened in the capital of the republic of Tatarstan, 820km (510 miles) east of Moscow. Russian PM Mikhail Mishustin spoke of ""great sorrow"" while Tatarstan's leader Rustam Minnikhanov described the attack as a ""major tragedy"". ""We are deeply saddened that this has happened,"" he said. Responding to the shooting, Russian President Vladimir Putin saidhe would review the country's gun control laws. School shootings are relatively rare in Russia. One of the last major incidentshappened in Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018. Mr Minnikhanov confirmed the deaths of seven children - four boys and three girls - as well as a female teacher and a female school worker at School No 175. It is believed the children were eighth graders (aged around 15). Eighteen children and three adults were being treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds, fractures and bruising, Mr Minnikhanov added. The attack began at about 09:20 local time (06:20 GMT), a source in the emergency services told Russian news agency Tass. The first signal from a panic button at the school was sent five minutes later. ""Everyone started panicking and saying 'shut the doors',"" a student who witnessed the attack told the Mediazona news website. ""About a minute later the head teacher started yelling: 'We're shutting the doors!' Armed police arrived at the school and then sealed off the fourth floor, reports said ""We got out about 15 minutes later, not out of the windows. I wanted to do that, but the teacher closed the window immediately and said no."" Footage shared on social media shows some children jumping from windows to escape as well as injured people being evacuated. Russian TV reported that two of the children had died after jumping from a second-floor window. Heavily armed police and emergency vehicles responded to the incident. A Kazan resident outside the school told Moscow Echo radio station that people there were hysterical. ""Parents are crying, medics are giving out medicine,"" she said. Elvira Ignatyeva, a 25-year-old English teacher, was killed trying to shield one of the children, a police source told Tass news agency, quoting eyewitnesses. She had pushed the child out of the way in a corridor and tried to block the gunman but was shot and mortally wounded, the source said. On her Instagram account, Ms Ignatyeva had often posted upbeat messages over photos of herself enjoying walks  and nights out. ""It's not that hard to make your life happy,"" she wrote on 1 February. You just need to stop thinking that happiness is only possible somewhere over there, in the future, and learn to enjoy every actual minute, here and now..."" Allow Instagram content?

Reports initially said that there were two gunmen and that one of them had been killed. But officials later said there was only one suspect, named locally as Ilnaz Galyaviev. Russian investigators say he is a Kazan resident and it is believed he once studied at the school. Medics comforted relatives of students at the school Mr Minnikhanov said the suspect was a registered firearm owner. According to Russian MP Alexander Khinshteyn, the suspect received a firearms licence only recently. The MP said it was for a semi-automatic shotgun. Officials did not comment on the possible motive for the attack although Mr Minnikhanov called the attacker a ""terrorist"". The suspect went on social media before the attack, posting that he planned to kill a ""huge number"" of people before shooting himself. Screenshots of his account, now blocked, show him wearing a black mask with the word ""god"" written across it in red.

Authorities have called for all schools in Tatarstan to be inspected and have their security stepped up. A day of mourning will be held on Wednesday to honour the victims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin had ordered the chief of Russia's National Guard to ""work out as a matter of urgency new regulations on the types of weapon that can be in civilian circulation and that can be owned by the public"". The instruction was issued ""given the type of firearm used by the shooter"", Mr Peskov said. ""The fact is that sometimes types of small arms are registered as hunting weapons, which in some countries are used as assault rifles,"" he explained. Russia to tighten gun rules after school shooting School shooting tragedy leaves Russia in shock Olga Ivshina, BBC News People in Kazan seem to be completely shocked and devastated by what has happened. It is a big city - with more than one million people - which has enjoyed peace and stability over the past decade. Schools in Kazan - as well as in most other Russian cities - are not really guarded. Usually it is just one or two unarmed private security guards who meet people coming to the school at the gates. Often many of these so-called security officers are pensioners with no special training. But even if they had any it is hard to confront an armed person with bare hands. It is worth mentioning that the Kazan gunman allegedly used a gun very similar to one the attacker in Crimea used in 2018. It is a relatively cheap but powerful rifle which can be bought for the equivalent of just $280 (Â£200). There are a lot of discussions now in Russia about whether the regulations for civilian gun ownership should be changed. Shootings at schools are relatively rare in Russia compared with other countries. In November 2019 a 19-year-old student shot dead a classmate and injured three others before killing himself in the far eastern city of Blagoveshchensk. Investigators said the motive for the attack may have been a personal conflict In October 2018 a teenager armed with a semi-automatic shotgunkilled 20 people at a technical college in the city of Kerchin Russian-annexed Crimea. He then shot himself dead In February 2013, a 15-year-old student shot dead a teacher and a police officer, injuring a second police officer, when he took hostages at a school in Moscow. Investigators saidthe killer appeared to have had an ""emotional breakdown"" Are you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

We'll be back tomorrow, but here are the top stories: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff on strike at a hospital near Paris, France Here are some of the day's key developments from around the world: The US will attempt to boost its vaccination campaign by partnering with ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft to provide free transport to and from tens of thousands of sites, the White House says. ""People will be able to simply select a vaccination site near them, follow simple directions to redeem their ride, and then get a ride to take them to and from a nearby vaccination site free of charge,""the Biden administration said in a statement,externaltoday. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until 4 July. President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70% of the US adult population vaccinated with at least one shot by 4 July to ensure safer Independence Day gatherings. The president is said to be discussing with state governors ""creative and innovative ways"" to get people vaccinated with the help of federal resources. ""Bio-secure bubbles"" enabled England's men to play international cricket last summer The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announceda loss of Â£16.1m in the past financial yearas a result of the pandemic. The postponed launch of The Hundred tournament was cited as one reason for a drop in revenue, alongside the cost of running bio-secure cricket. The loss has been transferred to their reserves, which now stand at Â£2.2m - down from more than Â£70m in 2016. Scott Smith, chief financial officer at the ECB, said: ""This has been a challenging year, but by being able to stage international cricket and by taking decisive action early in the pandemic, we have been able to support the network and avoid a far worse financial scenario. ""There remains considerable uncertainty over the year ahead, but we hope that delivering another full summer of cricket - and with crowds beginning to return from next week - we are able to protect the revenue we need to invest in growing our game."" Jo Goodman is part of a group of bereaved families campaigning for an inquiry A bit more now on the prime minister's promise thatthere will be a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic within the current Parliamentary session. Boris Johnson made the comments earlier during a debate in the House of Commons - the first time he has put a timeframe on when a probe into the pandemic will be held. He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future. The Prime Minister knows that and he's said as much.
""So why does he think it can wait? Who delays learning critical lessons that can save lives? This video can not be played Queen's Speech: State Opening of Parliament Slovakia's health ministry has ordered a halt to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people receiving their first doses following the death of a 47-year-old woman. The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here.

"MPs have criticised levelling up schemes after finding that only 10% of the promised funding has been spent so far. The Public Accounts Committee also criticised a lack of transparency in how the money was allocated. Levelling up is a government policy to reduce inequality based on where people live. It was a big slogan for the Conservatives in the 2019 election and was inthe party's manifesto,external. Rishi Sunak says its aim is ""to create jobs, drive growth, and make sure that people feel enormous pride in the places that they call home"". Only 10% of flagship levelling up funds spent, say MPs The Levelling Up Fund awarded Â£1.7bn to projects in October 2021, Â£2.1bn in January 2023 and another Â£1.1bn in November 2023. The North West of England received the most money overall, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber. Questions were raised when the South East of England was awarded the second largest amount of funding in the second round. The government highlighted funding per head of the population. If you look at the funding awards this way, Wales comes out on top and the North of England does better than the South of England. The Public Accounts Committee said that only Â£3.7bn had been allocated to local authorities by December 2023, while councils had been able to spend only Â£1.24bn as of Sept 2023. It said the first round of levelling up funding was awarded to ""shovel-ready"" projects that were due to be completed in March, but 60 out of 71 (85%) have had to extend their deadlines, with further delays in other schemes said to be ""likely"". Levelling up funding process is broken, says Conservative mayor Andy Street Levelling up: Cost of living could deepen inequality, says Gove Areas were invited to bid for investment in transport, cultural, town centre and regeneration projects. Local MPs were allowed to give their formal support to two bids before the proposals were judged by officials from the Treasury, Levelling Up Department and Department for Transport. Assessing how fair this is, is not straightforward. Some projects - such as transport - may spread across several constituencies, represented by MPs from different parties. For the projects that can be allocated to a single party, we can say that more money was allocated to Conservative constituencies than to Labour ones. But there are significantly more Conservative ones. BBC analysis of the second round of funding found: 52% of successful bids that can be allocated to a party were in Conservative constituencies (the Conservatives won 56% of seats in the Commons in 2019) 24% of them were in Labour areas (Labour won 31% of the seats in 2019) Projects in Tory constituencies were awarded a total of Â£1.21bn, compared with Â£471m in Labour ones. There was one successful bid in a Lib Dem constituency, seven for the SNP, five for the DUP, three for Sinn Fein, and one each for the Alliance Party and Plaid Cymru. Areas have also been competing for money under the government's Towns Fund. In that contest, of the 56 constituencies that won, 47 had Conservative MPs. A zoo, a park and a pool - who got first round levelling up cash? Towns Fund: How were the winners chosen? On the second round of funding, Rishi Sunak said: ""two thirds of all the levelling up funding is going to the most deprived parts of our country"". BBC analysis shows that using the government'sindex of multiple deprivation,external, which is the usual measure, in the second round about 57% of England's funding went to the areas with the highest deprivation, down from 69% in the first round. That analysis excludes a small number of awards that were given to areas covering multiple local authorities. We asked the Levelling Up department about Mr Sunak's claim. It said it was not based on the government's index of multiple deprivation but was instead based on measures involving productivity, employment, vacancy rates, lack of skills and transport links. Labour said the money awarded was dwarfed by the cuts to local authority funding since 2010, with Alex Norris telling MPs: ""the government have nicked a tenner from our wallets and expect us to be grateful for getting less than two quid back."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies found,externalthat between 2009-10 and 2019-20, English councils' non-education funding per resident had fallen by almost a quarter, after adjusting for rising prices. The Institute for Government found,externalthat councils in the most deprived areas had been worst hit because they were the most reliant on central government funding. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlandscriticised the Levelling Up funding processas being part of Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"".

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"". In her constituency, Hackney South and Shoreditch, the average house price is 17 times of the average wage, she states. She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

Updates were brought to you by Alexandra FouchÃ©, Francesca Gillett, Paul Kirby, Mal Siret, Lauren Turner, Ella Wills, Katie Wright and Claire Heald. We'll be back tomorrow, but here are the top stories: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) staff on strike at a hospital near Paris, France Here are some of the day's key developments from around the world: The US will attempt to boost its vaccination campaign by partnering with ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft to provide free transport to and from tens of thousands of sites, the White House says. ""People will be able to simply select a vaccination site near them, follow simple directions to redeem their ride, and then get a ride to take them to and from a nearby vaccination site free of charge,""the Biden administration said in a statement,externaltoday. The feature will launch in the next two weeks and run until 4 July. President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70% of the US adult population vaccinated with at least one shot by 4 July to ensure safer Independence Day gatherings. The president is said to be discussing with state governors ""creative and innovative ways"" to get people vaccinated with the help of federal resources. ""Bio-secure bubbles"" enabled England's men to play international cricket last summer The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announceda loss of Â£16.1m in the past financial yearas a result of the pandemic. The postponed launch of The Hundred tournament was cited as one reason for a drop in revenue, alongside the cost of running bio-secure cricket. The loss has been transferred to their reserves, which now stand at Â£2.2m - down from more than Â£70m in 2016. Scott Smith, chief financial officer at the ECB, said: ""This has been a challenging year, but by being able to stage international cricket and by taking decisive action early in the pandemic, we have been able to support the network and avoid a far worse financial scenario. ""There remains considerable uncertainty over the year ahead, but we hope that delivering another full summer of cricket - and with crowds beginning to return from next week - we are able to protect the revenue we need to invest in growing our game."" Jo Goodman is part of a group of bereaved families campaigning for an inquiry A bit more now on the prime minister's promise thatthere will be a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic within the current Parliamentary session. Boris Johnson made the comments earlier during a debate in the House of Commons - the first time he has put a timeframe on when a probe into the pandemic will be held. He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future. The Prime Minister knows that and he's said as much.
""So why does he think it can wait? Who delays learning critical lessons that can save lives? This video can not be played Queen's Speech: State Opening of Parliament Slovakia's health ministry has ordered a halt to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people receiving their first doses following the death of a 47-year-old woman. The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham is asking the government for everyone over the age of 16 in the region to get a Covid vaccine to curb the spread of the Indian variant. Andy Burnham said it came after a ""worrying"" spike of cases in Bolton among the under-25s, which has seen cases double in a week. Bolton Council urged everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and tested. Mr Burnham said the rise in the town was a ""cause of concern"". Read more here.

A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors and social distancing will be relaxed further - echoing similar changes on the same date in England. Rule changes in Wales are also expected but are yet to be confirmed. Check what's changing in your area. This video can not be played Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that lockdown can be eased in most of Scotland from 17 May. It means people can mix in each others' homes again (up to six people from three households) and physical contact is no longer banned. You canread about the changes here. A body representing night-time economy businesses in Scotland has said the sector has been ""left in limbo"" over reopening due to a lack of clarity on dates from the government. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland, which has previously launched legal action against the Scottish government over the emergency coronavirus legislation put in place last year, has called for more certainty for the sector. NTIA Scotland chairman, Mike Grieve, said: ""As our neighbours south of the border prepare to unlock and remove all restrictions within the coming weeks, in Scotland we remain stuck in perpetual limbo with still no indicative date for reopening or even an outline of the conditions which will allow nightlife to restart. He called on the government to establish an ""a constructive path towards the unrestricted reopening"" of the sector. Under England's roadmap for easing restrictions, it is hoped that  nightclubs will be able to reopen in late June, as well as all legal limits on social contact being removed. However,in late June in Scotland there are still due to be limits on the number of people who can meet indoors,while nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in ""limited circumstances"".  As we reported first thing this morning, La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, reopened on Monday evening after being closed for six months. Only 500 spectators were allowed in for the performance - a fraction of the theatre's normal capacity of 2,000. Bad news too for half-time Spritz fans, there was also no intermission last night and the bars were closed. But the show went on... To respect social distancing, the musicians took over the ground-floor seating area... ...while the audience took their seats on the balconies Only 500 ticket-holders will be admitted for each performance for the time being The performance came a day before the 75th anniversary of a historic concert in 1946 that celebrated the post-war re-opening of the opera house - which had been bombed three years earlier and rebuilt. ""We have all listened to recorded concerts from our armchairs, but this has nothing to do with the emotion of live music, the quality and beauty of natural sound,"" Dominique Meyer, La Scala's director since 2020, told the AFP news agency. At lunchtime today, Scotland announced it will adopt the same traffic light system for foreign travel as England from Monday 17 May. Green-list destinations have the fewest rules - and Scotland's green list is currently the same as England's. The 12 countries and territories on the list are:  The majority of countries are on the amber list. People arriving from those countries must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests when they're back. Read more on the new travel rules here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Queen set out the government's priorities at the State Opening of Parliament She said the government would ""deliver a national recovery from the pandemic that makes the United Kingdom stronger, healthier and more prosperous than before"" She also said the government would ""strengthen the economic ties across the union, investing in and improving national infrastructure"" Other topics covered included education, women's rights, freeports, internet safety, the environment, modernising planning laws, and discouraging asylum seekers crossing the English Channel Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier said the government's plans would put ""rocket boosters"" under its ""levelling up"" agenda Labour has called on the government to deliver ""action"" rather than ""rhetoric"" MPs criticised the lack of detail on plans to reform social care The State Opening was the Queen's first major public engagement since the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh Some ceremonial aspects of the event were pared back this year due to coronavirus restrictions Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics That's where we'll end our reporting of the Queen's Speech. BBC Parliamentwill continue to provide live coverage of the MPs who are lined up to contribute to the debate this evening. The team that brought you all of today's highlights here were: Jennifer Scott, Joseph Lee, Lucy Webster, Richard Morris and Sinead Wilson. Thanks for following along with us. The Queen arrived for the State Opening of Parliament by car, and not in the State coach.  The ceremony was scaled back because of coronavirus. The Queen has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as she officially reopened Parliament. In a ten-minute speech in the House of Lords, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year. This includes a number of bills carried over from the previous ""session"" of Parliament, which ended in April. It also includes a number of bills included in past Queen's Speeches. Here is a summary of the main points. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent An occasion rich in colour and convention; pomp and pageantry. But this, the 67th time the Queen has opened parliament during her reign, was much more low key in its ceremonial theatricals than usual. Peers who were present in the House of Lords wore not just robes but facemasks. MPs arrived to join them to listen to the Queen in single file, socially distant. The monarch arrived by car rather than horse drawn carriage, but the essence of the occasion remained unchanged: the Queen reading out the government's plans. There were 30 bills -- plans for new laws -- in total; the central priority at the heart of the speech getting the economy fired up again. We also learnt a public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic could begin within a year. It is now nearly eighteen months since the general election, much of the time since then consumed by the consequences of the Coronavirus. The government has a big majority and has made big promises. It's challenge now, delivering on them. The Queen delivered her speech at the State Opening of Parliament in the House of Lords, in her first major public engagement since the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. We leave you with a few of our favourite images of the day.And you can find more here. Masked guards: The Yeomen of the Guard, the royal bodyguards, search Parliament's cellar's before the Queen arrives.The ceremony is a tradition that commemorates Guy Fawkes's Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The Queen was accompanied by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.  Instead of the Queen wearing the heavy Imperial State Crown, it was carried on a cushion and placed on a table nearby. As they walked from the Commons to the House of Lords, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a couple of metres ahead of Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and members of the cabinet, due to social distancing requirements. Here are the key points: ""Wales has returned a pro-devolution parliament,"" says Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's leader in Westminster. She says the SNP has a right to hold an independence referendum. She acknowledges the Conservatives' success but says they are the ""party of England and not the UK"". She criticises the government's failure to meet its manifesto commitment to reforming social care, adding that ""in this year of all years"" we should recognise the work of carers. She said, like Dickens saw social horrors of Victorian poverty, ""we might be looking in to the future"" at the conditions in the care system and what people have experienced this year. ""What we have regarded as being acceptable for loved ones in their homes and care homes, that needs to be addressed."" She urges the government to work across Parliament and with the devolved administrations. The former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is taking part via video link. He says post-Covid Britain has demonstrated ""fantastic community solidarity"" but also worsening poverty and a mental health crisis. We have to recognise that we live in a ""deeply unequal society"" he says and the ""way out"" is in investment in infrastructure and public services and legislation to end practices like fire and re-hire in the workplace. Social care must be treated as if it is part of the NHS, he says, with universal access. On housing, he say renters need greater protections that their rents will be controlled and that they will have access to social housing if necessary. There are some ""depressing parts"" of the speech on civil liberties he says such as the Police Bill. Concluding his speech Corbyn says: ""The world is at a crossroads, of inequality in justice and poverty, which Covid has shown, the need for universal health care around the world. It's also shown the need for us to urgently address the environmental crisis."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says it is a testament to the people of Northern Ireland over their past 100 years, that through challenges, the nation of Northern Ireland is here today. He says he believes that the Northern Ireland protocol has an impact on the Northern Ireland economy and livelihoods which is ""unacceptable"". When he speaks to people in his constituency, he says theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit agreement, is impacting their ability to trade with Great Britain. He says he does not believe that the Protocol should continue in its current form, and ""should be replaced with measures"" that fully accept the Northern Irish people's place within the UK, he states. If Northern Ireland is finding that it is harder to trade with Great Britain, then that is a ""levelling down,"" he warns. He adds that this is ""undermining the peace process"" as instability arises from people being unhappy. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey says everyone in the country is grateful to the scientists, the vaccinators and the healthcare workers who have helped the public in the past year. There needs to be a ""better deal for bereaved families,"" many who have lost a parent during the coronavirus pandemic were unmarried, and this complicates payments, he says. Davey says the government are ""dragging their feet"" on obeying the law, and that many families who've lost an unmarried parent during Covid are still not getting payments to help. He says the UK courts have decided that the government must make these payments, but these are still not forthcoming. He criticises the government's ""undemocratic planning reforms,"" which ""are another example of this government's authoritarian"" elements, such as, he says, restricting the right to protest. He says requiring photo ID to vote will disproportionately affect ethnic minorities. He warns that there is a ""workforce disaster"" impending as nearly every hospital has at least one vacancy for an anaesthetist. Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Correspondent The nameGustav Steinhauer,externalwon't be on the tip of your tongue but the urgent need for the Counter-State Threats Bill all goes back to his plotting for the German Kaiser more than 100 years ago. He was a master spy, recruiting helpers to secretly sketch Royal Navy dockyards - and our laws to combat foreign agents were written with him in mind. For years, behind the scenes, the UK's intelligence chiefs have argued for a major overhaul of laws that are insufficient for the modern world. For instance, it's not actually a crime to be a ""spy"" in the UK - nor is it an offence to be in some kind of relationship with a foreign power. The law protects ""official secrets"" - secret information belonging to the government - but it doesn't defend academic or industry research that is critical to our defence and economy. And every day foreign agents - particularly those working for China - are trying to steal that information. The Counter-State Threats Bill, Telecommunications (Security) Bill aims to close all these holes in the law. It aims to also create a register of foreign agents, a requirement that other nations, including the US, has long imposed on other states that would do it harm. The former Conservative PM, Theresa May, is up next. She welcomes the commitment to measures to improve mental health but notes there was no specific Mental Health Act in the speech and says it would be good to see a timetable soon. Ensuring online safety for all, especially children, is also to be welcomed she says but she urges the government not to delay the Bill. Cuts to overseas aid will have an impact on combating modern slavery she says and projects dealing with it will be cut. She urges the government to look again, because ""if we want to show our values as a country"" then ""we should be doing everything we can"" to ensure the UK's contributions are protected. On affordable housing, Theresa May says, ""of course"" we need to build more homes, but the government bill gives more power to property developers and ""will see the wrong homes being built in the wrong places"". Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The governmentâs Environment Bill has been
delayed so long, itâs now on its third Queenâs Speech. Thatâs said to be a
record. It was previously dubbed a lodestar and a
flagship bill. Now itâs a landmark. Mr Johnson wants the Bill passed before the
vital climate meeting, COP26, in November. So it urgently needs Parliamentary
time. The Bill introduces the new green governmental
watchdog â the Office of Environmental Protection, taking over the oversight
role from the EU. Green campaigners say itâs not independent enough. It sets âa frameworkâ for legally-binding
targets on air quality, water, waste and species
diversity. Environmentalists doubt that targets will be firm enough to fulfil
the PMâs ambition of restoring Nature. An amendment to the Bill to prevent sewage flowing into
rivers during storms will be introduced â thatâs welcomed. But greens are  worried about the Planning Bill â the
Govt says it will protect the environment, but others fear the opposite. Follow Roger on Twitter@rharrabin,external. Labour chair of the public accounts committee Meg Hillier asks if levelling up ""actually means levelling down"" for her constituency of Hackey South and Shoreditch in London. She says there are promises of more homes, but over the past six years ""there has been a lack of delivery"". There are bits of the Queen's Speech that she will support, she says, but she ""will watch like a hawk"" the spending of government. The UK needs more homes, she says, but she asks if the ones committed by the government ""will truly be affordable"". She says her constituents are sometimes living in cramped living arrangements, and she says the prime minister ""needs to look at the reality of people's lives"". In her constituency, Hackney South and Shoreditch, the average house price is 17 times of the average wage, she states. She says she is please the Environment Bill has been carried over from the last session of parliament, ""but let's hope we see more detail, more meaningful steps towards action on this issue"", she says. She says her committee has spent some time looking at environment and climate change issues: ""We have found the government wanting, promising, with big, broad brush headlines, the earth, but potentially in its inaction potentially actually damaging the earth. There is no planet B, we have to get it right, now"", she says. She says, in general, he Queen's Speech has bits in it that she wants to support, but ""we've seen promises made and not delivered... cheap headlines over substance just let people down"". Sir Peter ends his speech by asking about plans for a Holocaust memorial in Westminster and he sayscurrent plansare not acceptable. Will the PM get involved to ensure ""there is a proper memorial"" for the sake of all those who died in the Holocaust he asks? ""What is being put forward now is the wrong proposal in the wrong place in the wrong style"" he says. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Father of the House - the current longest serving MP - is up next. He begins by referencing those who were killed inBallymurphy in Belfast in 1971and says the House should consider what lessons need to learned. He says he was glad there was nothing in the Queen's Speech about cutting theoverseas aid budgetand says one of points of leadership is to change your mind. He then turns to building safety and leaseholders being asked to foot the bill for fire safety works. Will the PM have a summit with the cladding groups on fire safety, he asks? Provide all the money that is needed, he says, and then find out who can sue who is responsible, otherwise ""people's lives are impossible"". The government ""has to step in"" he adds. Ian Blackford ends his speech saying the SNP government is investing over Â£1bn in the next parliament to close the school attainment gap. He says the UK government had to be ""shamed into action by a footballer"" to give free school meals to schoolchildren. He states that while benefits are being reduced in the UK, the Scottish government continues to increase them. The government are laying the groundwork for ""more Tory austerity and more Tory cuts,"" he adds. ""Westminster has chosen its future, a job destroying Brexit,"" he states, while saying the SNP are focused on ""steering people through the pandemic and kick starting our economy"". He says there is ""now a fresh democratic commitment,"" and an independence referendum ""is now a question of when, not if"". Ian Blackford says that since the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the UK has lost access to the EU, and people are losing their right to live and work in the EU. Blackford says ""the message is very clear"" and ""there is a mandate for an independence referendum"". He says it is up to the Scottish Parliament when that referendum will take place. If the prime minister secures a majority in Westminster, then people expect their programme of government to be carried out, he adds, but people have voted for the SNP in Holyrood and the government may not be able to get a referendum on independence. He urges the prime minister ""to think again"" on the SNP's request for another referendum. The government has ""contempt"" for Scotland, he states. Those in Scotland are facing ""years of right wing and Brexit obsessed"" government, something which they ""haven't voted for"", he says. The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says this Queen's Speech comes ""at a time of crisis"" but an opportunity for change. He says ""people's clear desire"" is that ""we change things for the better"". He says the people of Scotland ""turned out in record numbers to re-elect the SNP government for afourth consecutive term"". He says ""this electoral earthquake now unlocks the electoral path that will determine Scotland's future,"" and he says it is for the people of Scotland to decide their future. ""It is important that over the coming weeks and months"" that MPs can debate ""honestly"" about the options open to Scotland in the future, he says. He says the SNP stood ""on a very clear manifesto commitment"" to give the people another say in independence. The SNP has won the highest share of votes out of any party, he adds. The prime minister concludes his speech saying: ""We will continue with ever greater intensity to connect talent with opportunity - for the British people to achieve their full potential at last."" Johnson says it is an enormous task, which has been made more difficult and urgent by the pandemic. ""But it is the right task for this country now"", he says, ""and this Queen speech equips us with the essential tools to do it"". Johnson says everything the government does will be done as ""one United Kingdom"". The union has ""seldom proven its worth more emphatically than in this pandemic"" he says. Jobs in Scotland were safeguarded by the Treasury he says, and the entire country will benefit from free trade agreements signed as a result of Brexit. ""We will be a force for good in the world as one United Kingdom"", particularly on the environment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Video shows students escaping from school windows Seven children and two adults have been killed in a shooting at a school in the Russian city of Kazan, officials say. Twenty-one other people, mostly children, were injured. A 19-year-old suspect was detained. The attack happened in the capital of the republic of Tatarstan, 820km (510 miles) east of Moscow. Russian PM Mikhail Mishustin spoke of ""great sorrow"" while Tatarstan's leader Rustam Minnikhanov described the attack as a ""major tragedy"". ""We are deeply saddened that this has happened,"" he said. Responding to the shooting, Russian President Vladimir Putin saidhe would review the country's gun control laws. School shootings are relatively rare in Russia. One of the last major incidentshappened in Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018. Mr Minnikhanov confirmed the deaths of seven children - four boys and three girls - as well as a female teacher and a female school worker at School No 175. It is believed the children were eighth graders (aged around 15). Eighteen children and three adults were being treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds, fractures and bruising, Mr Minnikhanov added. The attack began at about 09:20 local time (06:20 GMT), a source in the emergency services told Russian news agency Tass. The first signal from a panic button at the school was sent five minutes later. ""Everyone started panicking and saying 'shut the doors',"" a student who witnessed the attack told the Mediazona news website. ""About a minute later the head teacher started yelling: 'We're shutting the doors!' Armed police arrived at the school and then sealed off the fourth floor, reports said ""We got out about 15 minutes later, not out of the windows. I wanted to do that, but the teacher closed the window immediately and said no."" Footage shared on social media shows some children jumping from windows to escape as well as injured people being evacuated. Russian TV reported that two of the children had died after jumping from a second-floor window. Heavily armed police and emergency vehicles responded to the incident. A Kazan resident outside the school told Moscow Echo radio station that people there were hysterical. ""Parents are crying, medics are giving out medicine,"" she said. Elvira Ignatyeva, a 25-year-old English teacher, was killed trying to shield one of the children, a police source told Tass news agency, quoting eyewitnesses. She had pushed the child out of the way in a corridor and tried to block the gunman but was shot and mortally wounded, the source said. On her Instagram account, Ms Ignatyeva had often posted upbeat messages over photos of herself enjoying walks  and nights out. ""It's not that hard to make your life happy,"" she wrote on 1 February. You just need to stop thinking that happiness is only possible somewhere over there, in the future, and learn to enjoy every actual minute, here and now..."" Allow Instagram content?

Authorities have called for all schools in Tatarstan to be inspected and have their security stepped up. A day of mourning will be held on Wednesday to honour the victims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Putin had ordered the chief of Russia's National Guard to ""work out as a matter of urgency new regulations on the types of weapon that can be in civilian circulation and that can be owned by the public"". The instruction was issued ""given the type of firearm used by the shooter"", Mr Peskov said. ""The fact is that sometimes types of small arms are registered as hunting weapons, which in some countries are used as assault rifles,"" he explained. Russia to tighten gun rules after school shooting School shooting tragedy leaves Russia in shock Olga Ivshina, BBC News People in Kazan seem to be completely shocked and devastated by what has happened. It is a big city - with more than one million people - which has enjoyed peace and stability over the past decade. Schools in Kazan - as well as in most other Russian cities - are not really guarded. Usually it is just one or two unarmed private security guards who meet people coming to the school at the gates. Often many of these so-called security officers are pensioners with no special training. But even if they had any it is hard to confront an armed person with bare hands. It is worth mentioning that the Kazan gunman allegedly used a gun very similar to one the attacker in Crimea used in 2018. It is a relatively cheap but powerful rifle which can be bought for the equivalent of just $280 (Â£200). There are a lot of discussions now in Russia about whether the regulations for civilian gun ownership should be changed. Shootings at schools are relatively rare in Russia compared with other countries. In November 2019 a 19-year-old student shot dead a classmate and injured three others before killing himself in the far eastern city of Blagoveshchensk. Investigators said the motive for the attack may have been a personal conflict In October 2018 a teenager armed with a semi-automatic shotgunkilled 20 people at a technical college in the city of Kerchin Russian-annexed Crimea. He then shot himself dead In February 2013, a 15-year-old student shot dead a teacher and a police officer, injuring a second police officer, when he took hostages at a school in Moscow.

President Joe Biden has set a target of having 70% of the US adult population vaccinated with at least one shot by 4 July to ensure safer Independence Day gatherings.

""Bio-secure bubbles"" enabled England's men to play international cricket last summer The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announceda loss of Â£16.1m in the past financial yearas a result of the pandemic. The postponed launch of The Hundred tournament was cited as one reason for a drop in revenue, alongside the cost of running bio-secure cricket. The loss has been transferred to their reserves, which now stand at Â£2.2m - down from more than Â£70m in 2016. Scott Smith, chief financial officer at the ECB, said: ""This has been a challenging year, but by being able to stage international cricket and by taking decisive action early in the pandemic, we have been able to support the network and avoid a far worse financial scenario.

Jo Goodman is part of a group of bereaved families campaigning for an inquiry A bit more now on the prime minister's promise thatthere will be a public inquiry into the Covid pandemic within the current Parliamentary session. Boris Johnson made the comments earlier during a debate in the House of Commons - the first time he has put a timeframe on when a probe into the pandemic will be held. He has previously only said there will be an inquiry in the future. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said her party would hold the prime minister to his promise. She added: ""It must be entirely open and truly independent, have the trust and confidence of bereaved families, and cannot be an exercise in the government marking its own homework."" Jo Goodman, co-founder of campaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said this inquiry should begin this summer. ""The prime minister may feel he can wait for answers, but bereaved families certainly can't. ""Learning lessons from the pandemic is critical to saving lives now and in the future.

This video can not be played Queen's Speech: State Opening of Parliament Slovakia's health ministry has ordered a halt to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people receiving their first doses following the death of a 47-year-old woman. The decision was made after the state drugs regulator said the woman's death was probably linked to the vaccine. According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham is asking the government for everyone over the age of 16 in the region to get a Covid vaccine to curb the spread of the Indian variant. Andy Burnham said it came after a ""worrying"" spike of cases in Bolton among the under-25s, which has seen cases double in a week. Bolton Council urged everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and tested. Mr Burnham said the rise in the town was a ""cause of concern"". Read more here. Antonietta said she had looked forward to a professional haircut ""I feel like a different woman altogether,"" says Antonietta Orfeo, 84, after getting her first haircut in more than a year. Antoinetta lives at Arden House care home in Bedford, which put out an appeal for a hair stylist after its regular one has not been able to come since lockdown in March 2020. Two stylists came forward, leaving the care home manager relieved that she no longer had to ""hack away"" at hair. ""I've had to apologise to everyone whose hair I've cut,"" she added. ""The residents have all needed to be restyled due to my attempts."" A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors and social distancing will be relaxed further - echoing similar changes on the same date in England. Rule changes in Wales are also expected but are yet to be confirmed. Check what's changing in your area. This video can not be played Earlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that lockdown can be eased in most of Scotland from 17 May. It means people can mix in each others' homes again (up to six people from three households) and physical contact is no longer banned. You canread about the changes here. A body representing night-time economy businesses in Scotland has said the sector has been ""left in limbo"" over reopening due to a lack of clarity on dates from the government. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland, which has previously launched legal action against the Scottish government over the emergency coronavirus legislation put in place last year, has called for more certainty for the sector. NTIA Scotland chairman, Mike Grieve, said: ""As our neighbours south of the border prepare to unlock and remove all restrictions within the coming weeks, in Scotland we remain stuck in perpetual limbo with still no indicative date for reopening or even an outline of the conditions which will allow nightlife to restart. He called on the government to establish an ""a constructive path towards the unrestricted reopening"" of the sector. Under England's roadmap for easing restrictions, it is hoped that  nightclubs will be able to reopen in late June, as well as all legal limits on social contact being removed. However,in late June in Scotland there are still due to be limits on the number of people who can meet indoors,while nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in ""limited circumstances"".  As we reported first thing this morning, La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, reopened on Monday evening after being closed for six months. Only 500 spectators were allowed in for the performance - a fraction of the theatre's normal capacity of 2,000. Bad news too for half-time Spritz fans, there was also no intermission last night and the bars were closed. But the show went on... To respect social distancing, the musicians took over the ground-floor seating area... ...while the audience took their seats on the balconies Only 500 ticket-holders will be admitted for each performance for the time being The performance came a day before the 75th anniversary of a historic concert in 1946 that celebrated the post-war re-opening of the opera house - which had been bombed three years earlier and rebuilt. ""We have all listened to recorded concerts from our armchairs, but this has nothing to do with the emotion of live music, the quality and beauty of natural sound,"" Dominique Meyer, La Scala's director since 2020, told the AFP news agency. At lunchtime today, Scotland announced it will adopt the same traffic light system for foreign travel as England from Monday 17 May. Green-list destinations have the fewest rules - and Scotland's green list is currently the same as England's. The 12 countries and territories on the list are:  The majority of countries are on the amber list. People arriving from those countries must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests when they're back. Read more on the new travel rules here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Video shows students escaping from school windows Seven children and two adults have been killed in a shooting at a school in the Russian city of Kazan, officials say. Twenty-one other people, mostly children, were injured. A 19-year-old suspect was detained. The attack happened in the capital of the republic of Tatarstan, 820km (510 miles) east of Moscow. Russian PM Mikhail Mishustin spoke of ""great sorrow"" while Tatarstan's leader Rustam Minnikhanov described the attack as a ""major tragedy"". ""We are deeply saddened that this has happened,"" he said. Responding to the shooting, Russian President Vladimir Putin saidhe would review the country's gun control laws. School shootings are relatively rare in Russia. One of the last major incidentshappened in Russian-annexed Crimea in 2018. Mr Minnikhanov confirmed the deaths of seven children - four boys and three girls - as well as a female teacher and a female school worker at School No 175. It is believed the children were eighth graders (aged around 15). Eighteen children and three adults were being treated in hospitals for gunshot wounds, fractures and bruising, Mr Minnikhanov added. The attack began at about 09:20 local time (06:20 GMT), a source in the emergency services told Russian news agency Tass. The first signal from a panic button at the school was sent five minutes later. ""Everyone started panicking and saying 'shut the doors',"" a student who witnessed the attack told the Mediazona news website. ""About a minute later the head teacher started yelling: 'We're shutting the doors!' Armed police arrived at the school and then sealed off the fourth floor, reports said ""We got out about 15 minutes later, not out of the windows. I wanted to do that, but the teacher closed the window immediately and said no."" Footage shared on social media shows some children jumping from windows to escape as well as injured people being evacuated. Russian TV reported that two of the children had died after jumping from a second-floor window. Heavily armed police and emergency vehicles responded to the incident. A Kazan resident outside the school told Moscow Echo radio station that people there were hysterical. ""Parents are crying, medics are giving out medicine,"" she said. Elvira Ignatyeva, a 25-year-old English teacher, was killed trying to shield one of the children, a police source told Tass news agency, quoting eyewitnesses. She had pushed the child out of the way in a corridor and tried to block the gunman but was shot and mortally wounded, the source said. On her Instagram account, Ms Ignatyeva had often posted upbeat messages over photos of herself enjoying walks  and nights out. ""It's not that hard to make your life happy,"" she wrote on 1 February. You just need to stop thinking that happiness is only possible somewhere over there, in the future, and learn to enjoy every actual minute, here and now..."" Allow Instagram content?

According to Slovak media reports, the suspension concerns first doses only - those who have already had a first dose will receive a second. State regulators said last week that the woman had probably died of a blood clot and that a post mortem had revealed a previously undiagnosed hereditary condition, without providing further details. According to the regulator, this is the third reported death in Slovakia following vaccination against Covid-19. Reports of adverse reactions to a first dose of the AstraZeneca jab are extremely rare, and the link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and rare blood clots have not been proven. The next big day for lockdown easing is less than a week away. England, Scotland and Wales are all planning to ease rules on 17 May (the next easing date in Northern Ireland is 24 May). Having friends over and indoor dining are among the main changes. InEngland, six people or two households can meet indoors, with overnight stays allowed. And slightly larger celebrations are back on with up to30 people allowed to attend weddings, receptions and other life events. Pubs, bars and restaurants will be able to open indoor, as well as museums, cinemas, children's play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadiums. All remaining university students will be able to return to in-person teaching and people will be able totravel abroad to a small number of green list countrieswithout having to quarantine when they return. InWales, subject to government approval on 13 May, similar changes will be happening. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be able to open indoorsand cinemas, theatres and museums can reopen. And inScotland- from 17 Maypeople will be able to hug againand meet in homes. More on the rules here. Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News âI had a little tear in my eye when I saw the

For many people, this is the first live event theyâve been to since last year.
In fact, I found my 2020 Brits ticket in my suit as I got ready this
morning.
Itâs shaping up to be a big night. Dua Lipa, Arlo Parks, Coldplay and The
Weeknd are all performing - and thereâs a rumour that Taylor Swift has flown
in from the US to collect her global icon award. The ceremony, which will take place soon in front of a 4,000-strong live audience without social distancing or face masks at London's O2 Arena, is part of the government's pilot scheme for reopening live events. The red carpet kicks off at 5pm. Keep across the @BBCNewsEnts Twitter feed for

Currently, it has a traffic-light system which is broken down on a regional level, for example some council areas are classed as green while others are amber or red. But from 28 May, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be classed as single regions. As things stand England, Wales and Scotland, as well as Guernsey and the Isle of Man, will be in this green category, with arrivals only expected to take one further test on day eight after arriving. This means they only need to self-isolate until they get a negative test. Read more here. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham is asking the government for everyone over the age of 16 in the region to get a Covid vaccine to curb the spread of the Indian variant. Andy Burnham said it came after a ""worrying"" spike of cases in Bolton among the under-25s, which has seen cases double in a week. Bolton Council urged everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated and tested. Mr Burnham said the rise in the town was a ""cause of concern"". Read more here. Antonietta said she had looked forward to a professional haircut ""I feel like a different woman altogether,"" says Antonietta Orfeo, 84, after getting her first haircut in more than a year. Antoinetta lives at Arden House care home in Bedford, which put out an appeal for a hair stylist after its regular one has not been able to come since lockdown in March 2020. Two stylists came forward, leaving the care home manager relieved that she no longer had to ""hack away"" at hair. ""I've had to apologise to everyone whose hair I've cut,"" she added. ""The residents have all needed to be restyled due to my attempts."" A mass crematorium site for Covid-19 victims on the banks of the Ganges river in India Dozens more bodies have washed up on the banks of the Ganges river in northern India, as a second wave of coronavirus ravages parts of the country. More than 50 bodies have been discovered in Gahmar in Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, in recent days. On Monday,at least 40 bodies were pulled from the river about 55km (34 miles) downstream from Gahmar. It is not known how any of the the bodies got there, but it is thought they are Covid-19 victims. A local journalist has told BBC Hindi that bodies have been washing up on embankments in the village of Gahmar for several days. Locals claimed they had been complaining about the smell, but authorities had only taken action after hearing the news about the bodies found downstream in the state of Bihar on Monday. Officials said those bodies appeared to be bloated and partially burnt, and that they may have ended up in the river as part of the practice of cremating victims of coronavirus along the river Ganges in Uttar Pradesh. India is now the epicentre of the global pandemic and has recorded more than 22 million cases and 249,992 deaths. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has committed to setting up a public inquiry into the UK government's handling of coronavirus during the current session of Parliament. ""I can certainly say that we will do that within this session,"" the prime minister said, when asked during a debate in the House of Commons. ""I have made that clear before... I do believe it's essential we have a full, proper public inquiry into the Covid pandemic."" There is no fixed length for a parliamentary session, although they typically last for around a year. A group of families bereaved by Covid-19 has been calling for an urgent inquiryinto the handling of the pandemic since last summer. Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been readmitted to hospital in connection with the after-affects of Covid, just days after being discharged, according to reports. It is the third time that the 84-year-old has been hospitalised over the coronavirus. Berlusconi was treated for early-stage double pneumonia after testing positive for Covid-19 last October. Last month, he underwent 24 days of tests at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan before being released again on 1 May. Today, a source close to Berlusconi's right-wing Forza Italia party said he was back at the same hospital for reasons related to his Covid recovery, AFP news agency reports. Berlusconi, a billionaire who served as Italian prime minister four times and used to own AC Milan football team, was due to attend a court hearing on Thursday in a case related to his alleged""bunga bunga"" parties. Hearings have previously been postponed because of his ill health. Lockdown rules will ease for most of Scotland from Monday 17 May, it's been announced. Pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors and social distancing will be relaxed further - echoing similar changes on the same date in England. Rule changes in Wales are also expected but are yet to be confirmed. Check what's changing in your area.

It means people can mix in each others' homes again (up to six people from three households) and physical contact is no longer banned. You canread about the changes here. A body representing night-time economy businesses in Scotland has said the sector has been ""left in limbo"" over reopening due to a lack of clarity on dates from the government. The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) Scotland, which has previously launched legal action against the Scottish government over the emergency coronavirus legislation put in place last year, has called for more certainty for the sector. NTIA Scotland chairman, Mike Grieve, said: ""As our neighbours south of the border prepare to unlock and remove all restrictions within the coming weeks, in Scotland we remain stuck in perpetual limbo with still no indicative date for reopening or even an outline of the conditions which will allow nightlife to restart. He called on the government to establish an ""a constructive path towards the unrestricted reopening"" of the sector. Under England's roadmap for easing restrictions, it is hoped that  nightclubs will be able to reopen in late June, as well as all legal limits on social contact being removed. However,in late June in Scotland there are still due to be limits on the number of people who can meet indoors,while nightclubs and adult entertainment will remain closed, except for use in ""limited circumstances"".  As we reported first thing this morning, La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, reopened on Monday evening after being closed for six months. Only 500 spectators were allowed in for the performance - a fraction of the theatre's normal capacity of 2,000. Bad news too for half-time Spritz fans, there was also no intermission last night and the bars were closed. But the show went on... To respect social distancing, the musicians took over the ground-floor seating area... ...while the audience took their seats on the balconies Only 500 ticket-holders will be admitted for each performance for the time being The performance came a day before the 75th anniversary of a historic concert in 1946 that celebrated the post-war re-opening of the opera house - which had been bombed three years earlier and rebuilt. ""We have all listened to recorded concerts from our armchairs, but this has nothing to do with the emotion of live music, the quality and beauty of natural sound,"" Dominique Meyer, La Scala's director since 2020, told the AFP news agency. At lunchtime today, Scotland announced it will adopt the same traffic light system for foreign travel as England from Monday 17 May. Green-list destinations have the fewest rules - and Scotland's green list is currently the same as England's. The 12 countries and territories on the list are:  The majority of countries are on the amber list. People arriving from those countries must self-isolate at home for 10 days and take two PCR tests when they're back. Read more on the new travel rules here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson warns the public not to ""throw caution to the wind"" People in England will be allowed to hug loved ones and enjoy indoor hospitality from next Monday, the PM has said - whilst urging people to ""exercise caution and common sense"". Boris Johnson said this was the ""single biggest step"" to unlocking society but that people should remain vigilant. Indoor mixing and overnight stays in groups of up to six people or two households will also resume. Leisure venues such as cinemas, museums and children's play areas will reopen. Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson said the further relaxation of England's lockdown would go ahead on 17 May as the government had met its four tests for easing restrictions. These tests relied on the success of the vaccine rollout, evidence that the jabs were reducing serious illness and death, infection rates remaining under control and the risks from new Covid variants not changing. Zero Covid deaths for England, Scotland and NI HSBC to pilot Zoom-free Friday afternoons Face masks no longer required in classrooms People can meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors Six people or two households can meet indoors Overnight stays will be allowed in groups of up to six people or two households Pubs, restaurants and other hospitality venues can reopen indoors Adult indoor group sports and exercise classes can restart Indoor entertainment such as museums, theatres, cinemas, bingo halls, sports stadia and children's play areas can reopen Performances and large events can restart, with limits on audience numbers Remaining outdoor entertainment, such as outdoor theatres and cinemas can open Hotels, hostels and B&Bs can reopen Holidays abroad togreen list countries will be allowed Up to 30 people can attend weddings (although dancing will still not be allowed) and more than 30 can attend funerals The prime minister said the latest data showed deaths and hospitalisations had dropped to their lowest level since last July. Zero coronavirus deathswere announced in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland on Monday, while Wales recorded four deaths. More than two-thirds of adults across the UK have now received a coronavirus vaccine,  with almost 18 million people having had their second dose. The UK's four chief medical officers said earlier that the UK'sCovid alert level should be lowered from level four to three. It means that although coronavirus is in general circulation, transmission is no longer high or rising exponentially, so restrictions can be gradually reduced. Mr Johnson said that all the data supported the latest easing of restrictions, which he said amounted to ""a considerable step on the road back to normality"". ""And today we're taking a step toward that moment when we learn to live responsibly with Covid, when we cease eventually to rely on detailed government edicts and make our own decisions based on the best scientific advice about how best to protect our families and those around us."" He added that, as part of the latest lockdown easing, the government would update its guidance on close contact between close family and friends shortly. The advice would explain the risks involved so people could make informed choices, he said. ""This doesn't mean that we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. We all know that close contacts such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease,"" he said. ""So I urge you to think about the vulnerability of your loved ones."" Mr Johnson said social distancing should still be followed when people are not with their friends and family in workplaces, shops, pubs, restaurants and other settings.

He also confirmed that the wearing of face masks in secondary school classrooms in England will not be required after 17 May. Care home residents will be able to have up to five named visitors, he said, and greater freedoms to enjoy low- risk visits outside their home without having to isolate on their return. This next unlocking is - as the prime minister and his scientists stressed - the most significant step yet. Indoors is, after all, where transmission is most likely to take place, which explains why quite a sober tone accompanied the confirmation that restrictions would lift. It means vaccines are going to have to do most of the work in terms of controlling infection levels - during the winter it has been lockdown and social distancing that has played a key role in getting cases down. The good news is that all the evidence is pointing to the vaccines being incredibly effective. It means the threat of the NHS being overwhelmed and lockdowns reimposed has gone - unless a new variant comes along that can evade the vaccines in a significant way (considered unlikely by most experts). But cases could still creep up and there could be local outbreaks that need intervening on. It's why the key message is proceed with caution. The devolved nations are working to their own timeframe for easing restrictions. Under current plans inWales, indoor attractions, cinemas and theatres will open alongside pubs and restaurants serving customers inside on 17 May. InScotland, indoor hospitality venues are expected to resume with alcohol being served until 22:30. Cinemas, amusement arcades and bingo halls should reopen and indoor group exercise restart. More restrictions might be lifted inNorthern Irelandon 24 May, including the reopening of indoor hospitality, B&Bs and hotels. The prime minister said subject to the impact of the latest easing on the data, England was still on track to progress to step four of the government's roadmap from 21 June - when it is hoped that all legal limits on social contact will be removed. Asked by BBC Health editor Hugh Pym if the final stage of unlocking would be brought forward, Mr Johnson said every time restrictions are relaxed, ""we give ourselves breathing space"" to make sure that cases are not rising too much due to more social contact being allowed. The easing of measures next week is the most significant step, he added, saying that businesses want to get ready for the next planned relaxation on 21 June with the ""biggest certainty"" they can have. In order to give businesses time to prepare, further details will be released later this month ""about what the world will look like and what role there could be, if any, for certification and social distancing"", Mr Johnson said. Meanwhile, new data published by Public Health England shows that a single dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab reduces the risk of death with Covid by 80% compared with unvaccinated individuals. Researchers also found the two doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine reduced the risk of death by 97%.
