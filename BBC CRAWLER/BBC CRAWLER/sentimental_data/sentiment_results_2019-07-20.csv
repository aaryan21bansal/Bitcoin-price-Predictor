"Bianca Devins, surrounded by hearts, in an image she posted on Instagram in May Like many other teenagers her age, Bianca Devins lived her life online. The 17 year old had recently graduated from high school and was looking forward to starting a psychology course at a community college later this year. As last Saturday approached, she wrote on a gaming platform about how excited she was to be travelling the 250 miles from upstate New York to a concert in Queens. But before she could return home on Sunday morning, Bianca was dead. The exact relationship she'd had with the man accused of killing her remains unclear. But in the hours after his arrest, it emerged he had shared graphic photographs of the murder online. In the days since, her story has spread across the world - as have the violent images of her death. Her murder, which played out so publicly, is the latest case to place scrutiny on how social media companies police extreme content. Here, we detail how Bianca's murder was shared and exploited online in the hours and days after her death. ""Here comes Hell. It's redemption, right?"" Brandon Andrew Clark posed that question, taken from a rock song, to his Instagram followers in a temporary 24-hour story posted before dawn last Sunday. The next image he shared was far more disturbing. A blurry photograph captioned ""I'm sorry Bianca"" appeared to show a woman's bloodied torso. Before then his Instagram account, which we have chosen not to name, was mostly used to catalogue selfies and posts about music and art. Police believe the 21 year old had met Bianca through the platform two months earlier and their relationship had progressed in person since. A quote from the 1999 film Fight Club (left) was also shared to the account On Saturday, he drove Bianca to New York City from Utica, where she lived, to see Canadian singer Nicole Dollanganger perform. Police said they believed the pair had got into an argument on the way back, possibly about her kissing someone else, and he had fatally attacked her with a knife. Police said the suspect shared an even more graphic photograph of Bianca's body on Discord - a popular messaging platform for gamers. This image showed the extent of injuries to Bianca's throat and made clear her wounds had been fatal. Screenshots from the now-deleted private chat on Discord, apparently used by friends of Bianca, show he shared the image at about 06:00. As concerned friends scrambled to work out if the photo was real, the suspect continued to post offensive content in the group. Members then took screengrabs of the messages and of his Snapchat account, and raised the alarm. By 07:20, Utica Police had received ""numerous"" calls, including some from other US states, about the disturbing posts. Police said the suspect had also called 911 himself and made ""incriminating statements"" about his actions. When an officer tracked him down to a wooded area at the end of a residential road, he stabbed himself in the neck. He then lay down on top of a tarpaulin, which police said he had placed over Bianca's body, all the while taking and posting more photographs online. After a brief struggle, the suspect was arrested and taken to hospital. A day later, after emergency surgery, he was charged with Bianca's murder. Instagram has not confirmed when it received the first reports about the violent image on the suspect's public story. But as Sunday rolled on, word was beginning to spread beyond Bianca's social group, much of it clouded by misinformation. By Sunday evening, users on Twitter had started to talk about and re-share the Instagram posts. Other users implored people to avoid watching his story and report the account. From the outset, users said their reporting attempts were being rejected for not violating Instagram's terms. When approached by the BBC, Instagram did not say how long the original posts on the suspect's story had been allowed to stay up, but screenshots suggest they had been publicly available for more than 20 hours. Dr James Densley, a professor of criminal justice in Minnesota, said this kind of public violence carried the risk of secondary trauma for viewers, and also re-victimised Bianca herself. ""We have this term for people to rest in peace,"" he told the BBC. ""Well, really, she can't, because she's living in this sort of perpetual infamy online every time her image is shared."" Some of the first people to discuss the murder were users on website 4chan - a barely moderated internet messageboard where users can post anonymously. Both it, and the even more extreme website 8chan, have become notorious in recent years for the increasingly radical rhetoric posted by some users and their links to a number of deadly attacks. Bianca Devins murder images flood Instagram Social media's role in Christchurch attacks Social media sites struggle to contain attack video Before 51 people were shot dead in two Christchurch mosques in March, a manifesto in the suspected gunman's name was posted to 8chan. He also live-streamed the shooting on Facebook, telling viewers at the start of the attack to ""Subscribe to PewDiePie"". This ironic meme, about a popular YouTuber, also appears to have been used by the Utica suspect after he posted images of Bianca's murder to Discord. This and other comments attributed to the Utica suspect during the attack echoed the language being used in these extreme online communities, Robert Evans, an investigative journalist who specialises in radicalisation online, told the BBC. Both the suspect and Bianca are said to have used 4chan themselves in the past. Users on the forum on Sunday celebrated ""another 4chan murder"" and discussed her death in offensive and misogynistic terms, victim-blaming and even photoshopping the graphic images of her into sadistic memes. People have used #RIPBianca to share positivity online after her death - including artwork Evans said violent images and language like this were ""extremely common"" on these platforms. He compared the way that some young men were being radicalised on these websites to how terror groups recruit. ""All you have to do is shotgun out propaganda in the hopes that a couple of times a year, one individual will have enough commitment and hate in their heart to do something,"" he told the BBC. He believes law-enforcement need to take radicalisation on these websites more seriously. ""I don't think IS would get away with proliferating in a place like 8chan,"" he said. ""But at the same time - the internet is what is. And I don't know how you could police every dark little corner of it. This is a very 21st Century problem - and it's not one with a roadmap to solve it."" Dr Densley said these websites have become a place where otherwise ""lost souls"" are able to congregate. ""These are views that in polite society would be massively offensive,"" he told the BBC. ""I think because it's an echo chamber, these individuals talk up and amp up one another."" By Monday, when the police confirmed the images of Bianca were real, the case had already spilled from the fringes of the internet into mainstream social media. For hours #RIPBianca even trended on Twitter in the US. As the story proliferated, some people inevitably tried to search for the accounts and images being mentioned on their newsfeeds. With this attention, the number of Bianca's Instagram followers started to snowball. The teenager had been a heavy internet user, but some news outlets drastically overstated the scale of her following. Sensationalist headlines described the murder of an ""Instagram influencer"" or used the often derogatory and misogynist term ""e-girl"" to describe her. In reality, Bianca had only about 2,000 followers on her main Instagram account before the news of her killing went viral, according to tracking website SocialBlade. But in the week since, that number has increased to more than 160,000. The numbers of followers on Bianca's now-memorialised accounts continue to grow The suspect's account also attracted attraction. Despite his profile being edited to reflect his suicidal intentions at some point during the attack, Instagram did not deactivate it until the police confirmed his identity on Monday, more than a day after the murder. By that time, his following had grown by thousands and his profile was inundated with comments. Some people capitalised on Bianca's murder, which had already played out so publicly, as an opportunity to gain followers. Comments like: ""FOLLOW ME!!!& DM !! me for full video and picture"" were spammed on the suspect's posts. Dozens of users promised the images of her body were hidden within their private pages. Others tried to trick people into seeing cruel memes or even products they were trying to sell. Some even went as far as to change their username, or create brand-new accounts, to mimic the suspect's handle and lure people searching for the photographs. Instagram hides likes 'to remove pressure' Suicide note sparks plan to regulate influencers Instagram now asks bullies 'Are you sure?' One person behind one of these accounts, when challenged in a message about their motivations, said they had changed their name out of curiosity but did ""feel a little guilty"" for the victim and her family. They initially vowed to stop, but about an hour after abandoning the handle, reverted to it. Another person emulating the suspect's username told the BBC they did so ""for social media clout"", adding: ""People will do anything that gains them followers and some popularity."" On Tuesday, that user claimed to have amassed more than 1,000 follower requests and about 100 messages. They even considered trying to solicit online payments for the images, they said. Instagram told the BBC it was reviewing hashtags and accounts where people were claiming to share the graphic content. At the time of publication, most of these appeared to have been removed. Bianca's mother (right) said their family were ""devastated by the loss of our beautiful angel"" Dr Densley said cases like Bianca's exposed the ""weird incentive structures"" that exist across the social media we use every day. ""The entire enterprise is built on the number of likes and retweets and friends and followers that you can accumulate,"" he said, explaining that people who perpetrate violence online see the value in the online infamy it can bring. He said those who viewed the violent images then faced a choice: ""Do I report it? Do I ignore it and pretend I didn't see it? Or do I capture it in my own way, and then share it myself?"" The proliferation of images from Bianca's murder has renewed scrutiny of the way social media is policed day-to-day, just four months after platforms publicly struggled to contain the spread of graphic video from the Christchurch attacks. Sites like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook do have human moderators - but also rely on artificial intelligence technology and user reports to support their systems. The scale of their membership, which in Instagram's case is one billion users a month, makes for an overwhelming challenge. ""They use a technique called hashing - which very basically creates a digital fingerprint of an image or video,"" BBC technology reporter Zoe Kleinman explains. ""This means anything bearing that fingerprint can be automatically flagged and removed, or even blocked at the point of upload."" ""But, it only works if the original material is copied in its entirety. If an image or video is edited or clipped, the ""fingerprint"" is no longer complete and it can be more difficult to identify."" The teenager had recently graduated from high school Bianca's case, after that of Christchurch, will do little to alleviate mounting pressure on social platforms from international governments. The UK and Australia have announced new measures where social media companies may face fines, or even criminal charges, if they fail to moderate adequately. So far this year, Facebook executives have already introduced new restrictions on their live-streaming tool. Instagram also launched new anti-bullying initiatives and a crackdown against self-harm content after the suicide of a British teenager. Social media companies have reiterated their commitment to their community guidelines since Bianca's death. Despite this, some graphic content is still slipping through the net. At the time of publication, the BBC found even the most graphic photographs of Bianca's body - posted up to a week ago - still on Twitter. The day after her murder, Bianca's stepmother condemned those sharing the graphic images as ""disgusting"". ""I will FOREVER have those images in my mind when I think of her. When I close my eyes, those images haunt me,"" she posted on Facebook, urging people to consider the feelings of the family and report offensive content. Many have done so. And many have gone even further, demonstrating how online communities can act as a force for good. An online spamming war has been launched against those trying to exploit Bianca's death. Accounts have sprung up to flood tags being used to share graphic photographs and cruel memes of the teenager. The grassroots campaign vowed to turn Instagram #PinkForBianca Instead, tens of thousands of pastel-coloured cloudscapes, flowers, hearts and photographs of cute animals - in the style of Bianca's own selfies - now fill her tagged posts. Most accounts appear to be run by girls of a similar age to Bianca, who appear to be spending hours on the effort. Often the accounts come with offers of emotional support to others and guidance on how to report upsetting content. One teenage girl called Taylor has shared almost 1,000 ""filler"" images on the account she set up. ""Seeing the images plastered online broke my heart,"" she said in a private message from her account. ""I wanted to do whatever I could to protect her and her family."" A 19 year old named Brianna is among those who created artwork of Bianca as part of the fight to flush out the graphic posts. ""I'm glad that her family know that amongst the horror, people still care,"" she told the BBC. Naomi, 21, who is running another ""cute clean-up"" page, agreed: ""I just couldn't let these monsters win."" Bianca's mother Kimberly Devins is among those from her family who have embraced #PinkForBianca on their own social media accounts. In a statement released on Wednesday, she said: ""My heart is completely shattered, having lost my best friend. We will always remember her beautiful smile that lit up our lives. Her spirit will strengthen us and live on forever."" A vigil for Bianca Devins was held in Utica on Monday night As they prepared for Bianca's funeral, her family also launched a scholarship fund in her name, in the hope that others can fulfil her dream of helping young people with mental illness. Kimberly Devins has thanked those who shared support for the family, and implored people to continue spreading the message of ""love, not violence"" in her daughter's name.

"This video can not be played 'This is glorious stuff' - Lowry lights up Open with eight-birdie 63 The 148th Open Championship - third-round leaderboard -16S Lowry (Ire);-12T Fleetwood (Eng);-10JB Holmes (US);-9B Koepka (US), J Rose (Eng);-8R Fowler (US), L Westwood;-7D Willett (Eng), J Rahm (Spa), T Finau (US), J Spieth (US) Selected others:-2G McDowell (NI), D Johnson (US),-1S Garcia (Spa), E Els (SA);+2P Casey (Eng) Ireland's Shane Lowry produced one of the great major championship rounds with a sensational eight-under-par 63 that sees him take a four-shot lead into Sunday's final round of The Open. Lowry, who called it ""one of the most incredible days of my life,"" carded eight birdies to finish on 16 under overall at Royal Portrush. England's Tommy Fleetwood is Lowry's closest rival on 12 under after a 66. JB Holmes is third on 10 under, one head of Justin Rose and Brooks Koepka. World number one Koepka, who won this year's US PGA Championship and finished runner-up at the Masters and US Open, finished with successive birdies on the 17th and 18th holes to keep himself in contention to win a fifth major in his last 10 appearances. But the day belonged to the 32-year-old Lowry who started the day tied at the top of the leaderboard alongside Holmes and was in sensational form from the first hole until the last, hitting 17 of the 18 greens in regulation as he set a new course record. A partisan crowd at the Northern Irish course cheered his every birdie, the noise being so raucous that Fleetwood and playing partner Lee Westwood, who were in the group in front, had to wait to play their tee shots on the 18th. And there were incredible scenes as Lowry walked down the last. Scenes usually reserved for the final day of the championship, as fans stood to applaud and cheer their man as he completed a memorable round of golf. With adverse weather forecast for Sunday, tee times have been brought forward with the first tee time at 07:32 BST with the leaders beginning their final round at 13:47 BST. This video can not be played Fleetwood, Holmes & Koepka in best shots from day three With home favourite Rory McIlroy - who shot a 61 on this course before two new holes were created on the Dunluce Links for The Open - missing Friday's halfway cut, the fans put their support behind Lowry, and he rose to the occasion. He came agonisingly close to matching Branden Grace's major-championship record of 62, set at The Open two years ago at Birkdale, but his effort for birdie on the 18th missed by an inch. Nevertheless, his 16-under overall total of 197 is the lowest after 54 holes in Open history and he has, so far, shown little signs of faltering in his pursuit of a first major success. This video can not be played The Open 2019: Shane Lowry 'struggling to take in' amazing third round Even as Fleetwood rose up the leaderboard Lowry kept his cool, picking up a shot on the par-five fourth before taking the outright lead with another gain on the 12th before successive birdies on the 15th, 16th and 17th stretched his advantage to four. And amid the chaotic scenes on the 18th as Lowry putted for par, his playing partner Holmes holed a birdie putt to ensure a positive end to a mixed round. The American had kept pace with Lowry through the first 12 holes, sinking three birdies without dropping a shot, but bogeys on the 13th and 14th allowed Lowry to move clear. Holmes finished with a two-under 69 and starts Sunday's round six shots off the pace. However, Lowry knows as well as anyone that there is still a long way to go. Three years ago he went into the final round of the US Open with a four-shot lead only to let that tournament slip from his grasp with a final-round 76. ""I hope I'm going to be able to deal with it better,"" said Lowry. ""I know it's going to be difficult and hard but hopefully I am ready for it. ""I have a tough 24 hours ahead of me, but there's nowhere I would rather be. I have a four-shot lead in an Open in Ireland. Sunday is going to be incredible no matter what happens."" Fleetwood is hoping to become the first English winner of the Open since Nick Faldo (pictured) triumphed 27 years ago Waiting to pounce should Lowry slip up, however, is Fleetwood. The Southport native is aiming to become the first English winner of the Open since Nick Faldo in 1992 and he, like Lowry, made the most of the calm conditions to shoot a low score on the front nine, hitting three birdies to reach the turn in three under. Fleetwood picked up another birdie on the par-five 12th but finished with six straight pars to post a bogey-free 66. ""We'll see what happens, but Sunday is going to be special and very loud,"" Fleetwood told BBC Radio 5 live. ""It will be a challenge to keep your concentration all day but I wouldn't have it any other way."" This video can not be played 'Exploding into life' - Rose eagles 12th and birdies 13th England's Rose, who finished in a share of second place at last year's Open Championship at Carnoustie, threatened to trouble the leaders when an eagle on the par-five 12th followed by two birdies propelled him up the leaderboard. However, a bogey on the par-three 16th meant he finished with a three-under 68 and will start Sunday seven shots behind Lowry, alongside Koepka, who shot six birdies and two bogeys. Compatriot Lee Westwood briefly climbed to the top of the leaderboard after a run of three successive birdies from the second, sparking hopes the 46-year-old might finally break his major duck, but his form slipped on the back nine and two bogeys meant he signed for a 70 to finish on eight under. This video can not be played 'Oh my goodness' - Willett birdies the fifth on way to round of 65 But it was a good day for 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett as the Yorkshireman shot the second lowest total of the day. The 31-year-old hit six birdies without dropping a shot, giving him the clubhouse lead halfway through the round but Lowry's scintillating display likely leaves Willett needing another strong final round to just put himself in contention for a second major victory.

"ASAP Rocky will stay in a Swedish jail for at least another week after prosecutors were granted more time to investigate an alleged assault. The American rapper has been held since being arrested on suspicion of assault on 3 July. A prosecutor now has until 25 July to decide whether to charge him, Stockholm District Court decided. One of ASAP Rocky's alleged victims is also being investigated for abuse, assault and attempted assault. Hearings to decide whether to keep two other men detained - who were arrested with ASAP - are ongoing. The court decided ASAP should stay in custody ""because of the flight risk"", says prosecutor Daniel Suneson. ""This gives us time to complete the investigation.""

ASAP and Kanye first collaborated in 2015 on ASAP's track, Jukebox Joints. On 5 July, the rapper was held for an extra two weeks while the investigation carried on. Now that two weeks is up prosecutors have applied for another extension until 25 July to formally charge him with a crime. ""We have worked intensively with the investigation and need more time, until Thursday next week in order to complete the preliminary investigation,"" Mr Suneson says. Prosecutors say ASAP - real name Rakim Mayers - was involved in a fight in Stockholm on 30 June, where he'd been playing at a festival. A video published online appeared to show him punching another man in the street. But the rapper also put videos of his own up on social media. He says they're from before the fight and they show the man following him. ASAP's bodyguard, who had also been arrested on suspicion of assault, was released earlier in July. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played 'This is glorious stuff' - Lowry lights up Open with eight-birdie 63 The 148th Open Championship - third-round leaderboard -16S Lowry (Ire);-12T Fleetwood (Eng);-10JB Holmes (US);-9B Koepka (US), J Rose (Eng);-8R Fowler (US), L Westwood;-7D Willett (Eng), J Rahm (Spa), T Finau (US), J Spieth (US) Selected others:-2G McDowell (NI), D Johnson (US),-1S Garcia (Spa), E Els (SA);+2P Casey (Eng) Ireland's Shane Lowry produced one of the great major championship rounds with a sensational eight-under-par 63 that sees him take a four-shot lead into Sunday's final round of The Open. Lowry, who called it ""one of the most incredible days of my life,"" carded eight birdies to finish on 16 under overall at Royal Portrush. England's Tommy Fleetwood is Lowry's closest rival on 12 under after a 66. JB Holmes is third on 10 under, one head of Justin Rose and Brooks Koepka. World number one Koepka, who won this year's US PGA Championship and finished runner-up at the Masters and US Open, finished with successive birdies on the 17th and 18th holes to keep himself in contention to win a fifth major in his last 10 appearances. But the day belonged to the 32-year-old Lowry who started the day tied at the top of the leaderboard alongside Holmes and was in sensational form from the first hole until the last, hitting 17 of the 18 greens in regulation as he set a new course record. A partisan crowd at the Northern Irish course cheered his every birdie, the noise being so raucous that Fleetwood and playing partner Lee Westwood, who were in the group in front, had to wait to play their tee shots on the 18th. And there were incredible scenes as Lowry walked down the last. Scenes usually reserved for the final day of the championship, as fans stood to applaud and cheer their man as he completed a memorable round of golf. With adverse weather forecast for Sunday, tee times have been brought forward with the first tee time at 07:32 BST with the leaders beginning their final round at 13:47 BST. This video can not be played Fleetwood, Holmes & Koepka in best shots from day three With home favourite Rory McIlroy - who shot a 61 on this course before two new holes were created on the Dunluce Links for The Open - missing Friday's halfway cut, the fans put their support behind Lowry, and he rose to the occasion. He came agonisingly close to matching Branden Grace's major-championship record of 62, set at The Open two years ago at Birkdale, but his effort for birdie on the 18th missed by an inch. Nevertheless, his 16-under overall total of 197 is the lowest after 54 holes in Open history and he has, so far, shown little signs of faltering in his pursuit of a first major success. This video can not be played The Open 2019: Shane Lowry 'struggling to take in' amazing third round Even as Fleetwood rose up the leaderboard Lowry kept his cool, picking up a shot on the par-five fourth before taking the outright lead with another gain on the 12th before successive birdies on the 15th, 16th and 17th stretched his advantage to four. And amid the chaotic scenes on the 18th as Lowry putted for par, his playing partner Holmes holed a birdie putt to ensure a positive end to a mixed round. The American had kept pace with Lowry through the first 12 holes, sinking three birdies without dropping a shot, but bogeys on the 13th and 14th allowed Lowry to move clear. Holmes finished with a two-under 69 and starts Sunday's round six shots off the pace. However, Lowry knows as well as anyone that there is still a long way to go. Three years ago he went into the final round of the US Open with a four-shot lead only to let that tournament slip from his grasp with a final-round 76. ""I hope I'm going to be able to deal with it better,"" said Lowry. ""I know it's going to be difficult and hard but hopefully I am ready for it. ""I have a tough 24 hours ahead of me, but there's nowhere I would rather be. I have a four-shot lead in an Open in Ireland. Sunday is going to be incredible no matter what happens."" Fleetwood is hoping to become the first English winner of the Open since Nick Faldo (pictured) triumphed 27 years ago Waiting to pounce should Lowry slip up, however, is Fleetwood. The Southport native is aiming to become the first English winner of the Open since Nick Faldo in 1992 and he, like Lowry, made the most of the calm conditions to shoot a low score on the front nine, hitting three birdies to reach the turn in three under. Fleetwood picked up another birdie on the par-five 12th but finished with six straight pars to post a bogey-free 66. ""We'll see what happens, but Sunday is going to be special and very loud,"" Fleetwood told BBC Radio 5 live.

"The man was targeted near a supermarket in Shettleston A pedestrian has been deliberately struck by a car in an apparent murder attempt in Glasgow. Police said the 33-year-old was walking with two male friends in Amulree Street, Shettleston, when he was targeted at about 15:00 on Friday. The white car, possibly a 4x4, chased them into Pettigrew Street where the man was struck by the vehicle. He was not seriously injured but detectives have begun an attempted murder investigation. Det Colin Thapar, of Shettleston CID, said: ""Although the man, who we believe was the intended target of the attack, was not seriously injured and didn't seek hospital treatment, to deliberately drive a large car at someone in the middle of a busy street in the middle of the afternoon is reckless and dangerous and could have involved at lot more people.

The American rapper has been held since being arrested on suspicion of assault on 3 July. A prosecutor now has until 25 July to decide whether to charge him, Stockholm District Court decided. One of ASAP Rocky's alleged victims is also being investigated for abuse, assault and attempted assault. Hearings to decide whether to keep two other men detained - who were arrested with ASAP - are ongoing. The court decided ASAP should stay in custody ""because of the flight risk"", says prosecutor Daniel Suneson. ""This gives us time to complete the investigation.""

"This video can not be played Footage released by Iran's Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency appears to show Stena Impero being seized The foreign secretary has urged Iran to reverse its ""illegal"" seizure of a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf. Jeremy Hunt said it ""raises very serious questions"" about the security of British and international shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. It comes as Iran released new footage of the capture on Friday of the Stena Impero. Tehran said the vessel was ""violating international maritime rules"". Speaking after a phone call with his Iranian counterpart, Mr Hunt said Iran viewed this as a ""tit-for-tat situation"" following the detention of an Iranian tanker in Gibraltar. But he said ""nothing could be further from the truth"". The Stena Impero's owners said they wanted access at the port of Bandar Abbas to the 23 crew members, who they said are in good health. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said it appears the Iranian Revolutionary Guard was ""quite prepared to push this right up to the brink of a conflict, yet probably stopping just short of one"". The Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on Friday in a key shipping route in the Gulf. Footage emerged on Saturday appearing to show the moment the tanker was raided. It was released by Iran's Revolutionary Guard-affiliated Fars news agency. It shows masked forces dropping down ropes onto the ship from a helicopter after it was surrounded by high-speed vessels. A Royal Navy frigate, HMS Montrose, was alerted and raced to intervene, as it did - successfully - with another British-flagged tanker just over a week ago. But this time it was too far away to stop the Stena Impero being seized - the tanker was already in Iranian waters. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was captured after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. But Mr Hunt said it was seized in Omani waters in ""clear contravention of international law"" and then forced to sail into Iran. The Stena Impero's Swedish owners, Stena Bulk, said it had been fully complying with regulations and had been in international waters at the time. It said the crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, were in good health. A second British-owned Liberian-flagged tanker, the MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards on the same day but was released. It came after Royal Marineshelped seize Iranian tanker Grace 1off Gibraltar earlier this month, because of evidence it was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. Iran described the incident as ""piracy"" but Mr Hunt said the Grace 1 was detained legally in Gibraltarian waters ""totally within the law"". This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says Iran views the tanker seizure as a ""tit-for-tat situation"" On Saturday, UK government ministers held an emergency meeting of Cobra and a senior Iranian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office in London. Afterwards, Mr Hunt said MPs would be updated on Monday about what ""further measures"" the government would take, adding the threat level had been raised to the highest level of alert. ""Our priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation,"" he said. A UK government spokeswoman said earlier it had advised UK shipping to stay out of the area. Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted,externalthat the UK ""must cease being an accessory to #EconomicTerrorism of the US"". He said it was Iran that guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? ""Unlike the piracy in the Strait of Gibraltar, our action in the Persian Gulf is to uphold international maritime rules,"" he said. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, spokesman of the state watchdog the Guardian Council,said on Twitter,externalthat ""the law of retaliation is a recognised concept in international law"" shortly after the ship's seizure was announced. The latest developments come amid a deterioration in relations between Iran and the UK and US. Tensions between the US and Iran have risen sharply since April, when the US tightened sanctions it had reimposed on Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal. The US blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the world's key shipping area since May - Tehran denies all the accusations. On Friday,the US claimed to have destroyed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. Unlike the US, the UK government remains committed to the nuclear deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions tensions. However, the UK's decision to helpseize the Iranian tankerGrace 1 off Gibraltar earlier this month infuriated Iran. On Friday, Gibraltar granted a 30-day extension to allow authorities to continue detaining the tanker, which was suspected of carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. In retaliation for this seizure Iranhad threatened to seize a British oil tanker. A week later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the Ministry of Defence.  Iran denied any attempted seizure. A White House National Security Council spokesman said the latest incident on Friday was the second time in just over a week the UK had been ""the target of escalatory violence"" by Iran. And US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. The US military said it wanted to promote maritime stability, ensure safe passage, and de-escalate tensions in international waters throughout the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Oman. The Pentagon has saidUS troops are being deployed to Saudi Arabiato defend American interests in the region from ""emergent credible threats"". France and Germany called on the Iranian authorities to quickly release the Stena Impero. Also calling for the release of the ship, the European Union's foreign affairs office, which represents 28 member states, expressed ""deep concern"" and urged for ""restraint to avoid further tensions"". The BBC's Frank Gardner said the British government was in a ""bit of a bind"" because ministers do not have a great deal of options left. He said: ""What they would like to do is to have a firm, international response, preferably done through allies, possibly with the UN."" The first thing to remember is that this specific row between Tehran and London is only one aspect of an already highly volatile situation in the Gulf. The Trump administration's decision to walk away fromthe international nuclear deal with Iranand to re-apply sanctions is having a hugely damaging impact on the Iranian economy. Iran is pushing back. Given the highly fragile and volatile situation in the Gulf, together with the desperate need to bolster the flagging Iran nuclear deal, was it sensible to detain the vessel carrying Iranian oil off Gibraltar? Read more analysis from Jonathan,external Ships must fly the flag of a nation state, explains Richard Meade, managing editor of maritime intelligence publication Lloyd's List. They must be registered in a country, but that doesn't have to be the same country as its owners, or have any relation to the cargo, he says. But there must be some link to the UK. ""But how you define UK is relative,"" Mr Meade says. The Stena Impero is Swedish-owned and those on board are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino. But it's the UK flag that is important symbolically, he says. ""Historically speaking it means that the UK owes protection to the vessel."" ""The UK has political responsibilities to anything that is flagged. And that's why it's much more serious than if there just happened to be a British captain on board."" He emphasises that while it was a political issue, the impact on trade in the region had so far been minimal. But he warns that if the international community began viewing the Strait of Hormuz as a dangerous place to be, that could create a ""very different"" scenario. The seizing of a British-flagged tanker in Omani waters, empty and inbound to a Saudi port, marks a serious escalation in a whole catalogue of recent incidents in the Gulf. It comes on the back of the mysterious mining of tankers, the downing of both US and Iranian drones and the near capture of another British-flagged tanker only a few days ago. Britain wants its response be two things: Measured and multinational. The government is trying to send a robust message to Iran that this action is unacceptable, not just to the UK but to the rest of the world, but not so robust that it ends up being part of an avoidable US military strike. This has become a highly volatile situation where not everyone believes in diplomacy. There are figures in Washington who have been pushing for an ever-tougher line with Iran. And there are figures in Iran, notably in the Revolutionary Guards Corps and the security apparatus, who are quite prepared to push this right up to the brink of a conflict, yet probably stopping just short of one.

"The man was targeted near a supermarket in Shettleston A pedestrian has been deliberately struck by a car in an apparent murder attempt in Glasgow.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt warns of ""serious consequences"" for Iran Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed his ""extreme disappointment"" in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart following the seizure of a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf. It comes after Mr Hunt warned Iran may be choosing a ""dangerous path"" of ""illegal and destabilising"" behaviour. The Stena Impero's owners have been unable to contact the ship, which was surrounded in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the vessel was ""violating international maritime rules"". In the call, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Mr Hunt the ship must now go through a legal process, according to the Iranian news agency ISNA. A second British-owned Liberian-flagged tanker, the MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards but was released on Friday. The Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on Friday in a key waterway in the Gulf. The tanker was surrounded by four vessels and a helicopter before heading into Iranian waters, Mr Hunt said. ""We are not looking at military options,"" he said. ""We are looking at a diplomatic way to resolve this situation."" A senior Iranian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office in London following the ship's seizure. Mr Hunt confirmed he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart on Saturday afternoon. He said he expressed ""extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate the situation they have behaved in the opposite way."" He also tweeted: ""Yesterday's action in Gulf shows worrying signs Iran may be choosing a dangerous path of illegal and destabilising behaviour after Gibraltar's legal detention of oil bound for Syria."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also demanded the release of the tanker and its crew, urging all sides to ""show restraint"". He added in a tweet: ""Trump tearing up the Iran nuclear deal has fuelled confrontation."" Another emergency Cobra committee meeting is due to be held later. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was seized after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. The vessel's owners said it was fully complying with regulations and was in international waters when it was approached. Stena Bulk said the 23 crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, were in good health. It said it was preparing a formal request to visit those onboard the seized ship. A UK government spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We have advised UK shipping to stay out of the area for an interim period."" Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted,externalthat the UK ""must cease being an accessory to #EconomicTerrorism of the US"". He said it was Iran that guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? ""Unlike the piracy in the Strait of Gibraltar, our action in the Persian Gulf is to uphold international maritime rules,"" he said. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, spokesman of the state watchdog the Guardian Council,said on Twitter,externalthat ""the law of retaliation is a recognised concept in international law"" shortly after the ship's seizure was announced. The latest developments come amid a deterioration in relations between Iran and the UK and US. Tensions between the US and Iran have risen sharply since April, when the US tightened sanctions it had reimposed on Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal. The US blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the world's key shipping area since May. Tehran denies all the accusations. On Friday,the US claimed to have destroyed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. Unlike the US, the UK government remains committed to the landmark nuclear deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions tensions. However, the UK infuriated Iran after its Royal Marineshelped seize an Iranian tankeroff Gibraltar earlier this month. On Friday, Gibraltar granted a 30-day extension to allow authorities to continue detaining the tanker, which was suspected of carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. In retaliation for the seizure of Grace 1, Iranthreatened to seize a British oil tanker. A week later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the Ministry of Defence. Iran denied any attempted seizure. Since then,the threat level to British shippingin Iranian waters in the Gulf has remained at ""critical"". A White House National Security Council spokesman said the latest incident was the second time in just over a week the UK had been ""the target of escalatory violence"" by Iran. US President Donald Trump has responded to the developments by saying he would talk to the UK. And US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. The US military said it wanted to promote maritime stability, ensure safe passage, and de-escalate tensions in international waters throughout the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Oman. France and Germany called on the Iranian authorities to quickly release the Stena Impero. Germany's foreign ministry condemned the ""unjustifiable intrusion"" on shipping through the route, adding that the seizure ""further exacerbates an already strained situation"". The French foreign ministry warned that the ship's seizure ""harms the needed de-escalation of tensions"" in the region. Also calling for the release of the ship, the European Union's foreign affairs office, which represents 28 member states, expressed ""deep concern"" and urged for ""restraint to avoid further tensions"". The first thing to remember is that this specific row between Tehran and London is only one aspect of an already highly volatile situation in the Gulf. The Trump administration's decision to walk away fromthe international nuclear deal with Iranand to re-apply sanctions is having a hugely damaging impact on the Iranian economy. Iran is pushing back. Given the highly fragile and volatile situation in the Gulf, together with the desperate need to bolster the flagging Iran nuclear deal, was it sensible to detain the vessel carrying Iranian oil off Gibraltar? Read more analysis from Jonathan,external Ships must fly the flag of a nation state, explains Richard Meade, managing editor of maritime intelligence publication Lloyd's List. They must be registered in a country, but that doesn't have to be the same country as its owners, or have any relation to the cargo, he says. But there must be some link to the UK. ""But how you define UK is relative,"" Mr Meade says. The Stena Impero is Swedish-owned and those on board are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino. But it's the UK flag that is important symbolically, he says. ""Historically speaking it means that the UK owes protection to the vessel."" ""The UK has political responsibilities to anything that is flagged. And that's why it's much more serious than if there just happened to be a British captain on board."" He emphasises that while it was a political issue, the impact on trade in the region had so far been minimal. But he warns that if the international community began viewing the Strait of Hormuz as a dangerous place to be, that could create a ""very different"" scenario. The defence, intelligence and diplomatic figures attending the government's Cobra crisis meetings over Iran are facing a tricky dilemma. Clearly, British-flagged or owned shipping in the Gulf needs protecting but the Royal Navy does not have enough surface ships to do the job alone. So this would have to be part of a multinational force like the proposed Operation Sentinel being discussed by US Central Command. The US Navy has plenty of ships in the Gulf - its powerful 5th Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain - but here lies the problem. Britain and its EU partners are not on the same page as Washington when it comes to the wider policy of dealing with Iran. The US has pulled out of the nuclear deal, while Europe is trying to keep it alive. So there is a reluctance by some on this side of the Atlantic to be identified too closely with a hawkish US posture towards Iran or take any actions that may be interpreted as escalating an already volatile situation.

"Transport for Wales is investing heavily in new trains to run on tracks in Wales To the east and west of Cardiff, there are cities that are about 45 miles away. So why does it cost Â£3,156 a year to travel to Bristol and Â£1,796 to go in the opposite direction to Swansea? Following theM4 relief road's scrapping, ways are being explored to get cars off the motorway near Newport. However,the end of Severn tollsand higher cost of tickets into England leave little incentive for commuters to get the train. You can even get a first class ticket (Â£2,692 a year) to Swansea cheaper than a standard to Bristol, according to theNational Rail Enquiries,externalwebsite. ""It shows that Wales and England are very much different countries for rail,"" said transport expert Stuart Cole. He pointed to many examples - a year's ticket from Aberdare to Cardiff  - about an hour - costs Â£1,176, while travelling a similar distance into London is about Â£3,000. Prof Cole said devolution of train travel in Wales allowed the Welsh Government to influence fares through its operator Transport for Wales (TfW). Platform shortage travel chaos warning Cardiff parkway station: Work to start in 2020 It has done this partly by having two operators - TfW (formerly Arriva Trains Wales) and Great Western Rail running between Swansea and Cardiff. ""This has incentivised competitive fares for passengers on this route,"" a Welsh Government spokesman said. ""However, the route between Cardiff and Bristol has only been served through regular services by the Great Western franchise, which was last subject to competition by the Department for Transport in 2006."" This video can not be played A '15 year journey' to transform Welsh railway He said requests had been made to the UK government for TfW services to run to Bristol, but it ""turned these down"". However, it was announced on Friday thatGrand Union Trains will become a second operatoron the line from 2021. The Welsh Government supported the proposal as rail travel is a key part of its transport strategy. It has allocated Â£50m for a new park and ride rail scheme at Llanwern in eastern Newport, which would be 30 minutes from both into Cardiff and Bristol. This would help ease congestion on the M4 - especially during major events such as rugby matches and pop concerts at the Principality Stadium. A Cardiff Parkway station could help ease motorway congestion Work is alsoplanned to start in 2020on Cardiff Parkway Station - which the government described as being of ""strategic significance"". As well as linking 32,000 St Mellons residents to the South Wales Metro, the aim is to connect commuters to Swansea and Bristol, keeping them off the M4. Katherine Simpson, a business manager who lives in Cardiff and works in Bristol said: ""The train is not an option really."" She spends about Â£2,000 a year - Â£40 a week - on fuel, considerably less than a Â£3,156 annual or Â£78.90 weekly train ticket. ""I work just outside Bristol and there's only train transportation into central Bristol,"" she said. ""It would mean a train then bus - so the train ticket is just the start of it. The bridge has made a difference as it has made working in Bristol affordable."" Tolls on both the M4 and M48 bridges over the River Severn were scrapped last year Nicholas Allan, a Bristol-based sound editor, makes the journey in the opposite direction to visit family in Cardiff. ""I consider myself quite environmentally aware and believe it to be madness we all drive around in individual metal boxes, so I usually take the public transport option,"" he said. ""But considering the train fare is more than the equivalent fuel cost, it's too often a close-run decision."" He believes train prices andscrapping Severn tollsmakes it easy for people to take the ""environmentally damaging option"". Great Western Rail said the setting of fares goes back to the days of British Rail, which operated most overground train services until 1997. Factors that affected prices included distance, speed and frequency of journey, subsidies, location and demand. Therefore, if fewer people travelled to Swansea at the time, that meant the price was cheaper in order to encourage people to use the trains, along with the other variables listed above. ""We recognise that these historical differences occasionally create fare anomalies and we continually look for cost-effective ways to remove anomalies where possible,"" a TfW spokesman said. These have included public consultations and discussions with wider industry. This piece was inspired by a question from reader J Davies: Why is an annual rail season ticket from Cardiff to Bristol Â£3,156 but to Swansea it's just Â£1,796?

"Bin collections are one of the outsourced council services Labour has targeted Labour wants councils in England to carry out services themselves rather than employ private firms, the shadow chancellor has said. John McDonnell said he wants to limit the outsourcing of services such as bin collections by obliging councils to run them when existing private contracts expire. Cleaning and school dinners could also be taken back in-house under the plans. The government said decisions should be left with local councils. The Confederation of British Industry said Labour's proposal was ""an extreme move devoid of evidence yet dripping in dogma"". In a speech on Saturday, Mr McDonnell said outsourced contracts were costly and lacked accountability as decisions were often made ""behind closed doors"". He added: ""It is the business model of outsourcing which is broken and that is why it needs replacing. ""Remember we've had the experience of Carillion, for example, collapses and you have something like 200 schools who have been affected, large numbers of councils, things not being built, services not being delivered and people being laid off."" Carillion collapse to cost taxpayers Â£148m Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Mr McDonnell said changing the law to ensure services are brought back in-house would be achievable within the first term of a new parliament. He would expect councils to comply with the plan unless there were ""significant"" barriers to doing so. Mr McDonnell added: ""It's the councillors who are demanding this change. ""If you look at example after example, where the council themselves say 'look, we've had enough of being ripped off by private contractors, we've had enough of poor service'. ""They have brought things in-house already and they have saved money and had a more efficient service."" A spokesman for Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said: ""It should be left for local councils and communities to decide which services to outsource, not Mr McDonnell."" Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: ""Rejecting the innovation, investment and cost savings suppliers can bring to vital public services and infrastructure is an extreme move devoid of evidence yet dripping in dogma.

"The chairman of the High Speed 2 rail project has reportedly warned that its cost could rise by Â£30bn. HS2 chairman Allan Cook has written to the Department for Transport to say the high-speed line cannot be delivered within its Â£56bn budget,according to the Financial Times,external. The DfT said a review of HS2's costs is continuing. The line will connect London, the Midlands and northern England using trains capable of travelling at 250mph. ""The chairman of HS2 Ltd is conducting detailed work into of the costs and schedule of the project to ensure it delivers benefits to passengers, the economy and represents value for money for the taxpayer,"" the DfT said in a statement. ""This work is ongoing. We expect Allan Cook to provide his final assessment in due course."" What do we know about HS2? Is the HS2 rail project in trouble? The first segment of the project between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester expected to be completed by 2032-33. An HS2 spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on leaks or speculation. ""We have previously noted that our chair, as you would expect, continues to scrutinise the programme, and regularly reports back to the Department [for Transport]. ""We are determined to deliver a railway that rebalances the economy, creates jobs, boosts economic growth and is value for money for taxpayers."" Mr Cook was appointed to head HS2 in December 2018 after his predecessor, Sir Terry Morgan, resigned as chairman because of delays at the Crossrail project in London which he was also leading. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent There has been no denial that this letter was sent by the chairman of HS2 to the top civil servant at the Department for Transport. And none of my contacts have rubbished the ""potential Â£30bn overspend"" idea outright. Sources at HS2 and at the DfT insist Allan Cook's review is ongoing and that he has not settled on a final figure. That may be true, but there has been a subtle shift of tone in recent months from both HS2 and the government; a creeping acceptance that the project, in its current form, is increasingly unlikely to come in within its Â£56bn budget. And there has already been plenty of evidence suggesting that the project's original estimates of how much it would cost to purchase land and property along the route were significantly below the true values. This leak, which feels at the very least like a case of 'no smoke without fire', comes at a very sensitive time. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who has repeatedly insisted that the project HAS to be delivered within budget, is possibly leaving his post in a matter of days. Boris Johnson - considered the front-runner to be the UK's next prime minister - is by no means a die-hard fan of the scheme. And Mr Johnson has already nominated a former HS2 executive, Douglas Oakervee, to carry out a separate review of the project if he gets the keys to No 10 next week. Â£56bn was already a hefty sum. As a former senior official at the Treasury puts it: ""In terms of value for money it [HS2] scores lower than lots of other projects."" And the government ""is taking quite a big risk"" by putting so much money into high-speed rail, the source told me. That risk looks set to rise.

"The man was targeted near a supermarket in Shettleston A pedestrian has been deliberately struck by a car in an apparent murder attempt in Glasgow. Police said the 33-year-old was walking with two male friends in Amulree Street, Shettleston, when he was targeted at about 15:00 on Friday. The white car, possibly a 4x4, chased them into Pettigrew Street where the man was struck by the vehicle. He was not seriously injured but detectives have begun an attempted murder investigation. Det Colin Thapar, of Shettleston CID, said: ""Although the man, who we believe was the intended target of the attack, was not seriously injured and didn't seek hospital treatment, to deliberately drive a large car at someone in the middle of a busy street in the middle of the afternoon is reckless and dangerous and could have involved at lot more people.

"The tourists were also fined â¬950 (Â£853) Police in Venice have fined two German tourists who were caught making coffee on the steps of the Rialto bridge.

"HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it treats security ""extremely seriously"" Thousands of knives and sharp objects are being confiscated annually at London family courts, with campaigners saying it showed how ""desensitised"" some people were to carrying weapons. Eighty-six knives with blades longer than 3in (8cm) were seized in 2018-19, a big rise from just 18 a year earlier, Ministry of Justice data revealed. Almost 4,000 shorter blades were found in 2018-19, the figures showed. HM Courts and Tribunals Service said it treated security ""extremely seriously"". Family courts mainly deal with private family disputes that involve parents and concern their children, and public work when local authorities take action to remove children from their parents' care. The figures, revealed following a Freedom of Information Act request from the BBC, covered 15 of the courts based in the capital. Mandatory bag searches, metal detectors and surveillance cameras are used to find blades and anything considered an offensive weapon is reported to police. The number of longer-bladed weapons confiscated had fallen before increasing dramatically last year. In the financial year 2015-16, 41 were taken by court staff but that dropped to 11 in 2016-17 and 18 the following year, before soaring back up to 86 in 2018-19. The number of knives with shorter blades increased steadily from 1,814 to 3,893 over the same four-year period. The figures for shorter blades include items of cutlery, razors, pen knives, key rings and scissors which have been confiscated, as well as weapons. Patrick Green, chief executive officer of anti-knife charity The Ben Kinsella Trust, said the increase was likely to be partly down to improved security, but also showed how carrying a knife had become ""normalised behaviour"" for some people, even in places where they knew they would be searched. ""It defies logic to the majority of us but it shows their thinking and association with carrying knives,"" he said. The president of the Family Division of the High Court has expressed a similar view.

"This video can not be played Rory McIlroy turns on the style in remarkable cut chase at the Open An emotional Rory McIlroy said missing the cut at his home Open hurt but the ""love"" from the crowd spurred him on to a remarkable round at Royal Portrush. After an eight-over-par opening round, McIlroy faced a huge task to make the weekend for what is Northern Ireland's first staging of The Open in 68 years. The Northern Irishman, 30, carded seven birdies in a second-round 65 but missed the cut line by one shot. ""I wish I could have been a part of it for two more days,"" he told the BBC. ""But I'll look back at this week with nothing but fondness and positivity and I can't wait to come back here and play in another Open Championship. ""I am so proud of Portrush, this country, Northern Ireland, the R&A for bringing it back here, and everyone involved. It means the world to me."" McIlroy misses cut as Lowry shares Open lead I'm not going to be consistent at my age - Woods Cranky Koepka & timed Tiger - day two snapshots World number three McIlroy shot a course-record 61 on the Dunluce Links when he was 16 years old but a 64 would have done it for the four-time major winner on Friday. He made two birdies on the front nine and, after clawing three strokes back in as many holes after the turn, the support for the home favourite grew louder and the atmosphere more intense with every shot. A bogey at 13 threatened to derail McIlroy, but he hit straight back with another birdie and that seemed to hype up his fans even more. McIlroy pulled another back at the imposing 16th, known as Calamity Corner, and made his way to the 17th tee 'high-fiving' children in the knowledge that one more birdie in the final two holes would do it. ""It was one of the most fun runs of golf I have ever played,"" he said. ""Today I really felt the love from the crowd, so many of them out there willing me on and wanting me to be there for the weekend."" A birdie eluded McIlroy at 17, but a drive to the middle of the fairway on the final hole had fans sprinting and jostling their way along the ropes to try and find a good view of the 18th green. McIlroy's approach drifted left, but the noise cranked up once more and the ferocious roars echoing around the grandstand made it feel like this was the final group on Sunday playing for the Claret Jug rather than a man chasing the cut. The 2014 Open champion had left himself too much work. He made it up and down from the fringes in two strokes for par, but that was one too many. BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter: Rory McIlroy shot a second-round 65 and missed the cut. Just think about that. It just shows us what a class act he is. But the point still remains that yesterday was an absolute golfing disaster. We said all along this would be a very special Open for all sorts of reasons.

Most recently, at the 2015 tournament in Sydney, they lost 50-39 against New Zealand and went on to claim bronze. However, England have beaten the Silver Ferns in their previous three meetings and having also won Commonwealth gold in 2018 are aiming to lift the trophy on home soil. So far, coach Tracey Neville has had two difficult matches to negotiate, but they came through unscathed againstworld number two side Jamaicaand finished the group stage in some style with a 57-48win over South Africa. New Zealand, meanwhile, will have to pick themselves up after losing by a single goal against Australia in their final group match. Of Saturday's opponents, Roses defender Geva Mentor said: ""I highly rate Noeline Taurua as a coach and she'll have done her homework on every single one of our players.

The Diamonds cantered through their first five games of this tournament, and, just like England, were not outscored in a single quarter until they came up against New Zealand in that final group game. Underdogs South Africa beat the higher-ranked Jamaica convincingly in the group stage but were then outplayed for large periods in the loss to England. The Proteas lost their influential captain Bongi Msomi in the first quarter and they will be sweating on her fitness for the Diamonds clash.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt warns of ""serious consequences"" for Iran Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has expressed his ""extreme disappointment"" in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart following the seizure of a British-flagged tanker in the Gulf. It comes after Mr Hunt warned Iran may be choosing a ""dangerous path"" of ""illegal and destabilising"" behaviour. The Stena Impero's owners have been unable to contact the ship, which was surrounded in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said the vessel was ""violating international maritime rules"". In the call, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Mr Hunt the ship must now go through a legal process, according to the Iranian news agency ISNA. A second British-owned Liberian-flagged tanker, the MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards but was released on Friday. The Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on Friday in a key waterway in the Gulf. The tanker was surrounded by four vessels and a helicopter before heading into Iranian waters, Mr Hunt said. ""We are not looking at military options,"" he said. ""We are looking at a diplomatic way to resolve this situation."" A senior Iranian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office in London following the ship's seizure. Mr Hunt confirmed he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart on Saturday afternoon. He said he expressed ""extreme disappointment that having assured me last Saturday Iran wanted to de-escalate the situation they have behaved in the opposite way."" He also tweeted: ""Yesterday's action in Gulf shows worrying signs Iran may be choosing a dangerous path of illegal and destabilising behaviour after Gibraltar's legal detention of oil bound for Syria."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has also demanded the release of the tanker and its crew, urging all sides to ""show restraint"". He added in a tweet: ""Trump tearing up the Iran nuclear deal has fuelled confrontation."" Another emergency Cobra committee meeting is due to be held later. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was seized after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. The vessel's owners said it was fully complying with regulations and was in international waters when it was approached. Stena Bulk said the 23 crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, were in good health. It said it was preparing a formal request to visit those onboard the seized ship. A UK government spokeswoman told the BBC: ""We have advised UK shipping to stay out of the area for an interim period."" Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif tweeted,externalthat the UK ""must cease being an accessory to #EconomicTerrorism of the US"". He said it was Iran that guarantees the security of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? ""Unlike the piracy in the Strait of Gibraltar, our action in the Persian Gulf is to uphold international maritime rules,"" he said. Abbasali Kadkhodaei, spokesman of the state watchdog the Guardian Council,said on Twitter,externalthat ""the law of retaliation is a recognised concept in international law"" shortly after the ship's seizure was announced. The latest developments come amid a deterioration in relations between Iran and the UK and US. Tensions between the US and Iran have risen sharply since April, when the US tightened sanctions it had reimposed on Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal. The US blamed Iran for attacks on tankers in the world's key shipping area since May. Tehran denies all the accusations. On Friday,the US claimed to have destroyed an Iranian drone in the Gulf. Unlike the US, the UK government remains committed to the landmark nuclear deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions tensions. However, the UK infuriated Iran after its Royal Marineshelped seize an Iranian tankeroff Gibraltar earlier this month. On Friday, Gibraltar granted a 30-day extension to allow authorities to continue detaining the tanker, which was suspected of carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. In retaliation for the seizure of Grace 1, Iranthreatened to seize a British oil tanker. A week later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the Ministry of Defence. Iran denied any attempted seizure. Since then,the threat level to British shippingin Iranian waters in the Gulf has remained at ""critical"". A White House National Security Council spokesman said the latest incident was the second time in just over a week the UK had been ""the target of escalatory violence"" by Iran. US President Donald Trump has responded to the developments by saying he would talk to the UK. And US Central Command said it was developing a multinational maritime effort in response to the situation. The US military said it wanted to promote maritime stability, ensure safe passage, and de-escalate tensions in international waters throughout the Arabian Gulf, Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Gulf of Oman. France and Germany called on the Iranian authorities to quickly release the Stena Impero. Germany's foreign ministry condemned the ""unjustifiable intrusion"" on shipping through the route, adding that the seizure ""further exacerbates an already strained situation"". The French foreign ministry warned that the ship's seizure ""harms the needed de-escalation of tensions"" in the region. Also calling for the release of the ship, the European Union's foreign affairs office, which represents 28 member states, expressed ""deep concern"" and urged for ""restraint to avoid further tensions"". The first thing to remember is that this specific row between Tehran and London is only one aspect of an already highly volatile situation in the Gulf. The Trump administration's decision to walk away fromthe international nuclear deal with Iranand to re-apply sanctions is having a hugely damaging impact on the Iranian economy. Iran is pushing back. Given the highly fragile and volatile situation in the Gulf, together with the desperate need to bolster the flagging Iran nuclear deal, was it sensible to detain the vessel carrying Iranian oil off Gibraltar? Read more analysis from Jonathan,external Ships must fly the flag of a nation state, explains Richard Meade, managing editor of maritime intelligence publication Lloyd's List. They must be registered in a country, but that doesn't have to be the same country as its owners, or have any relation to the cargo, he says. But there must be some link to the UK. ""But how you define UK is relative,"" Mr Meade says. The Stena Impero is Swedish-owned and those on board are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino. But it's the UK flag that is important symbolically, he says. ""Historically speaking it means that the UK owes protection to the vessel."" ""The UK has political responsibilities to anything that is flagged. And that's why it's much more serious than if there just happened to be a British captain on board."" He emphasises that while it was a political issue, the impact on trade in the region had so far been minimal. But he warns that if the international community began viewing the Strait of Hormuz as a dangerous place to be, that could create a ""very different"" scenario. The defence, intelligence and diplomatic figures attending the government's Cobra crisis meetings over Iran are facing a tricky dilemma. Clearly, British-flagged or owned shipping in the Gulf needs protecting but the Royal Navy does not have enough surface ships to do the job alone. So this would have to be part of a multinational force like the proposed Operation Sentinel being discussed by US Central Command. The US Navy has plenty of ships in the Gulf - its powerful 5th Fleet is headquartered in Bahrain - but here lies the problem. Britain and its EU partners are not on the same page as Washington when it comes to the wider policy of dealing with Iran. The US has pulled out of the nuclear deal, while Europe is trying to keep it alive. So there is a reluctance by some on this side of the Atlantic to be identified too closely with a hawkish US posture towards Iran or take any actions that may be interpreted as escalating an already volatile situation.

"This video can not be played Rory McIlroy turns on the style in remarkable cut chase at the Open The 148th Open Championship - second-round leaderboard -8JB Holmes (US), S Lowry (Ire);-7L Westwood (Eng), T Fleetwood (Eng);-6C Smith (Aus), J Harding (SA), J Rose (Eng);-5B Koepka (US), J Spieth (US), A Puttnam (US), D Frittelli (SA) Selected others:-4J Rahm (Spa);-3T Hatton (Eng), D Johnson (US), R Fowler (US);-2E Els J Day (SA);-1D Willett (Eng);EF Molinari (Ita);+2R McIlroy (NI)+6T Woods (US);+7I Poulter (Eng);+8P Mickelson (US) Rory McIlroy agonisingly missed the cut at his home Open as Ireland's Shane Lowry produced a four-under-par 67 to take a share of the lead. McIlroy's 79 on Thursday left him eight shots shy of the cut at one over, and he almost achieved his feat but failed to pick up a birdie at the last. Lowry, 32, is on eight under alongside USA's JB Holmes, with England's Tommy Fleetwood and Lee Westwood a shot back. Another Englishman, Justin Rose, is on six under after a 67 at Royal Portrush. World number one Brooks Koepka and 2017 Open champion Jordan Spieth are a shot further back on five under, but former winners Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Darren Clarke all missed the cut. It is the first time both Woods and Mickelson have gone out of the same major after the first two rounds. I felt the crowd's love - emotional McIlroy 'I'm not consistent anymore' - Woods Open leaderboard after second round The crowd following McIlroy around the County Antrim course began to grow in size as he sank birdie after birdie on the inward nine. By the 18th the cheer that greeted the 2014 champion was as if he was going for his second title rather than a mission to make the cut. However, his hopes faded with his approach to the green as the wind took the ball down the bank. The following chip landed wide and ended the 30-year-old's hopes of winning a major on home soil. ""Part of me is very disappointed not to be here for the weekend. I'm emotional but happy with how I played,"" said McIlroy. ""The support I got out there was incredible and you could see on the back nine, I went with it today and that's what I was planning to do all week. ""Yesterday gave me a mountain to climb but I dug in and showed good resilience. ""It's going to hurt for a bit. I've been looking forward to this week for a long time. ""I didn't play my part but everyone in Northern Ireland came out to watch me and played theirs."" Relive live coverage of the Open's second day Full BBC TV and radio coverage times This video can not be played 'Birdie, birdie, birdie!' - Lowryâs lightning start It has been quite an eventful 12 months for Lowry who has risen to from world number 90 to 33 following victory in Abu Dhabi in January and an eighth place at the US PGA. His best performance at a major to date was tied second at the 2016 US Open. However, he is now targeting his first major. ""I'm obviously going to be thinking about it tonight,"" he said when asked about the prospect of winning the Claret Jug. ""There's no point in shying away from it. I'm in a great position but, my goodness, have we got a long way to go. ""As a golfer you have such a long career. I've been 10 years now and it's just a rollercoaster. I think the reason I'm so good mentally now is I know - I think - how to take the downs."" Clarke, who got the 148th Open under way, will also miss the weekend after he finished on three over. However, Graeme McDowell, born a short distance from the course, managed to sneak through on one over as did last year's champion Francesco Molinari, who carded a 69. The Cut podcast: It's all about the cut This video can not be played Spieth surges up leaderboard with three birdies and an eagle Unlike McIlroy, three-time winner and current Masters champion Woods never looked like making the cut, and finished on six over. It is only the third time in 21 attempts the 15-time major winner has not made the weekend at The Open, and only the 10th time in majors he has missed the cut. Seven of those have come in the past 13 tournaments. Fellow American and 2013 champion Mickelson ended his campaign with a 74 for eight over. Former champions Paul Lawrie and Padraig Harrington also missed the cut, as did European Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter. Another former winner, David Duval, ended his sorry campaign on 27 over after he followed Thursday's 91 with a 78. The biggest challenge to a European win might come from world number one Koepka and Spieth, who are both on five under. American Koepka, seeking his fifth major in two years, followed Thursday's 68 with a 69, and compatriot Spieth produced an eagle on the par-five seventh on his way to a 67. Australia's Cameron Smith and Justin Harding are among those in contention, on six under. This video can not be played Fast-finishing Fleetwood fires into contention with a 67 Lowry, along with Westwood, Fleetwood and Rose are Europe's best hopes of stopping a possible American clean-sweep of this year's majors. Fleetwood, last year's US Open runner-up, has gradually improved his final placing at his home major over the past few years. He missed the cut in his first three attempts before a tied 27th in 2017 and tied 12th in 2018. On Friday, the 28-year-old continued his impressive start to this year's campaign with six birdies en route to a 67. ""I felt like I was a lot more stress-free,"" said Fleetwood, whose last win was in Abu Dhabi in January 2018. ""I made two or three good par-saves, but I enjoy the challenge."" This video can not be played The Open 2019: Lee Westwood & Jordan Spieth among best shots from day 2 Westwood, 46, has also yet to win major although he has finished among the top-three places on six occasions, including a second-placed finish at The Open in 2010. This year the Worksop player has been aided in his mission by girlfriend Helen Storey, who been working as his caddie at a major tournament for the first time. ""She's delighted to be caddying at a major because she doesn't have to rake the bunkers and get sand on her trainers,"" said Westwood, who sunk four birdies in an unblemished round of 67. ""Obviously I get on well with Helen. She doesn't know too much about golf but she knows a lot about the way my mind works, so she keeps me in a good frame of mind, and keeps me focused on the right things at the right times."" Last year, Rose finished tied second but only after just making the cut. The 2013 US Open has given himself a better platform from which to challenge for his second major. ""That weekend would be worth everything if you could put it all together when it counts,"" said Rose, who also recorded a 67. ""Obviously last year it almost counted. It was great. But it was important for me to have that weekend because it made me believe I could win this tournament. ""I'm comfortable with how much I expect of myself and that makes it easier tomorrow and the next day."" 2018 European Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn on BBC Two: ""We have to give Rory McIlroy credit for what he did in equalling the best round of the day. He made a great effort but all the damage was done on Thursday. The crowd expect so much of him and at least he delivered in his second round. ""We all want to see the greatest players here at the weekend but there's a new breed of player coming through and you have to play your best at majors. It's disappointing McIlroy and Woods are not here but there's a great leaderboard and so many great players. Just because you have played well in the past doesn't give you the right to be here. ""Shane Lowry's first 10 holes were amazing but the excitement got a little bit to him in the end and he needs to try to relax and lay out a plan. He then has to stick to it because the last few holes here are very difficult. ""Lee Westwood is running out of chances to win the Open and would be a very popular winner. He's one of the best players in the world not to have won a major. He has all the qualities - he's so good tee to green but sometimes his putting lets him down. He's putting well this week and there's no reason why he can't be standing there with the trophy on Sunday if he can keep that form going.""
