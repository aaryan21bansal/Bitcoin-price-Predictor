"Terry Butcher, left, said the life of his son Christopher, right, was ""tragically cut short"" Former England football captain Terry Butcher has said he is ""devastated"" by the death of his son, Christopher. The ex-army captain, who had served in the Royal Artillery and in Afghanistan, died on Monday morning, aged 35. Suffolk Police said his death was not being treated as suspicious. The former Ipswich Town and Rangers defender said his son's life had been ""tragically cut short"" while a family statement described him as a ""formidable leader and soldier"". ""Chris was a larger than life character whose personality, laughter and compassion touched the hearts of all who were fortunate to know him,"" it said. ""He always put others before himself and was a true and trusted brother-in-arms. ""His life has been so tragically cut short, but we will cherish and treasure the memories we all shared, forever."" The family thanked people for the ""overwhelming number of messages"" which they said were ""a testament to how much love and respect surrounded Chris"". Their statement added: ""We are all devastated by his loss and thank you now for allowing us some time to ourselves, to grieve and come to terms with his passing."" Butcher, now 58, won 77 caps for England and appeared at three World Cups during his career. He also played for Ipswich Town where he made more than 250 appearances in the 1970s and 1980s, and has managed several clubs including Sunderland, Motherwell and Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

"This video can not be played Would you eat green satsumas? Tesco has announced it will start selling green satsumas and clementines, as part of plans to cut food waste. The supermarket chain says the green oranges are ""perfectly ripe"" and will be as sweet as orange-coloured ones. Higher early season temperatures in Spain have slowed down the natural process by which the skin of the fruit turns orange. Other UK supermarkets have also branched out to sellless-than-perfect produce. In the past, retailers have been criticised for being too fussy. This has led to farmers throwing away large amounts of perfectly edible fruit and vegetables. Satsumas and clementines actually grow as green fruit to begin with, and the skin only turns to orange as summer wanes and the nights cool. However, in recent years, warmer temperatures during the early growing season for satsumas in September and October have continued to remain high into the autumn, thus delaying the natural process by which the fruit turns orange. Tesco launched the Perfectly Imperfect range in March 2016, which features apples, pears, potatoes, parsnips, cucumbers, courgettes, strawberries and frozen mixed berries. Don't be put off by the colour - Tesco says these satsumas are just as ripe as orange-coloured ones Tesco's aim is that no food safe for human consumption will go to waste from its UK outlets by the end of 2017. ""Key to encouraging consumers to buy these is communicating - for example, prominently at the point of sale - that the satsumas are ripe and shoppers can expect the same taste they are used to, perhaps even by offering tasters,"" Kiti Soininen, Mintel's head of UK food and drink research, told the BBC. ""From international examples, the success stories for initiatives to cut food waste by embracing 'ugly' fruit and vegetables have been the ones helping shoppers understand what to expect from the taste and quality of the food, and reassuring them that 'ugly' doesn't mean that the fruit and vegetables wouldn't still taste great.""

"This video can not be played Speaking in September 2017, claimants told the BBC about the problems they faced People will be able to call the government's universal credit helpline without being charged, within weeks. Prime Minister Theresa May said she had listened to criticism of the charges, which can be up to 55p a minute, and decided it was ""right"" to drop them. But she again rejected calls by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""pause"" the roll-out of the controversial benefit amid fears it is causing hardship. In a symbolic vote, MPs backed a pause after Tory MPs were told to abstain. The opposition won by 299 votes to 0 with one Conservative - Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston - defying her party by siding with Labour. BBC Parliament Live: As debate happened What is Universal Credit - and what's the problem? Unemployment total drops by 52,000 The outcome is not binding on the government although Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ministers must ""act on the clearly expressed will of Parliament"" and halt its roll out. Commons Speaker John Bercow advised ministers to take account of the vote and ""show respect for the institution"" by indicating what they intended to do. Universal credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into a single payment, is designed to make the system simpler and ensure no-one faces a situation where they would be better off claiming benefits than working. But it has faced a backlash from Tory MPs, who fear payment delays risk pushing families into destitution. Explaining her decision to rebel, Dr Wollaston said the length of time people were waiting to be paid - in many cases more than six weeks - was a ""fundamental flaw"" that must be addressed. She told the BBC she wanted to ""see a much stronger commitment"" from government ""that they'll do that immediately"". At Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mr Corbyn said he was glad the PM had ""bowed to Labour pressure"" by scrapping the hotline charges. This video can not be played Speaker: Don't pretend you didn't lose But he added: ""The fundamental problems of universal credit remain - the six week wait, rising indebtedness, rent arrears and evictions. ""Will the prime minister now pause universal credit and fix the problems before pressing ahead with the roll-out?"" Mrs May prompted cheers from Labour MPs as she began her reply with ""yes"", before urging them to ""listen to the whole sentence I was going to make"". She said universal credit was ""a simpler system"", that ""encourages people to get into the workplace - it is a system that is working because more people are getting into work"". The universal credit hotline will become free to use ""over the next month"", the government has said, and that would be followed by all DWP helplines by the end of the year. The government says it makes no money from the 0345 number. It is charged at local rate and is included as a free call in many landline and mobile phone packages but can cost some mobile phone users as much as 55p a minute. 'I don't even have 4p to my name' 'Selling everything' because of system May urged to halt rollout Universal Credit has been introduced in stages to different groups of claimants over the past four years, with about 610,000 people now receiving it. Almost a quarter of all claimants have had to wait more than six weeks to receive their first payment in full because of errors and problems evidencing claims. But the government recently approved a major extension of the programme to a further 45 job centres across the country, with another 50 to be added each month. This video can not be played The PM appears to give a surprising initial answer when asked to pause the national rollout of universal credit. Labour's Frank Field told MPs a food bank in his Birkenhead constituency needed to order five tonnes of extra food to deal with hardship caused by the roll-out of universal credit over Christmas. He asked Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke if his constituents should ignore the food bank's warnings, or give it extra donations as a result of the minister's ""inability to deliver a scheme that works"". Mr Gauke had earlier accused Labour of attempting to wreck the new benefit rather than taking a constructive approach to reforming it. The SNP's Mhairi Black said the offer of advance payments made matters worse for some claimants because they had to be paid back. She accused the government of acting like a ""pious loan shark - except that instead of coming through your front door they are coming after your mental health, your physical well-being, your stability, your sense of security."" The Department for Work and Pensions says its latest data, from last month, indicates 81% of new claimants were paid in full and on time at the end of their first assessment while 89% received some payment. BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said he understood ministers were giving ""serious thought"" to cutting the initial waiting period for payments from six to four weeks around the time of next month's Budget.

"An estimated 4.1 million people are in financial difficulty owing to missed domestic or credit bills, a major study has found. These consumers - most likely to be aged between 25 and 34 - have failed to pay bills in three or more of the last six months. The findings come as part of a survey of 13,000 people by the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It suggests 25.6 million consumers could be vulnerable to financial harm. This means that they display at least one of a series of issues, such as lack of internet access or an overdraft, so their finances would be at an increased risk if something went wrong. The Financial Lives research, the first of its kind by the regulator, revealed a range of concerns among consumers at a time of weak wage growth, but also low-cost credit. It concluded that 15 million people had low levels of resilience to a bill shock, that eight million were struggling with debt, and 100,000 had used an illegal money lender in the last 12 months. One in six (17%) of those with a mortgage or who are paying rent, an estimated five million people, said that they would struggle if monthly payments rose by less than Â£50. A rise in interest rates, heavily hinted by policymakers at the Bank of England, could affect many of these people - especially if the Bank rate rose rapidly. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor Rent, car loans, mortgages, credit cards, pay day loans, unsecured credit, overdrafts - with real wages falling, the amount of debt we are taking on is rising and the pressure we are under is increasing. For many, a savings cash buffer to deal with shocks and rising prices is non-existent. When it comes to the build up of debt, this is a classic story of supply and demand. The digitisation of financial products - making many loans little more than a mobile phone swipe away - has meant that supply has become broader and easier. Historically low interest rates have also made products cheaper, meaning that taking on debt appears to be low cost, in the short term at least. Read Kamal's blog in full In the same week as the BBC NewsMoney Matters series revealed worrying levels of debtamong young adults, the FCA report highlights the issue again for 25 to 34-year-olds. Its findings show that 23% of consumers of this age were ""over-indebted"", the highest proportion of any age group. The report also found that this group were most likely to be in difficulty (13%) or just surviving with their finances. ""This [research] exposes the story around the scale of those who are potentially in difficulty in the younger generation,"" said Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA. He added that there were ""challenges"" faced by every age group and that flexibility was required to ensure that these various issues were tackled. The report revealed: Among 18 to 24-year-olds: 20% had no savings and 55% had debts, primarily student loans. Single parents are most likely to use high-cost loans Among 25 to 34-year-olds: Nearly half (48%) were renting but of them, only a quarter (24%) had contents insurance Among 45 to 54-year-olds: An above-average proportion (15%) had an interest-only mortgage, so had not yet started paying off the capital of their home loan. They also had high overdraft and credit card balances Those aged 55 and over: a third (33%) said that the state pension would be their main source of income - an income which pension experts say would be insufficient Those aged 65 and over: More than a third (35%) do not use the internet and so miss out on cheaper deals, but of those who do, they are least likely to check that a website is secure, leaving them exposed to scams Gareth Shaw, from consumer group Which?, said: ""That such a high number of people in middle-age have not properly considered how they will manage in retirement should be cause for concern. ""The current complex pensions system is leading to disengagement, leaving consumers vulnerable through the real lack of information, support and tools needed to empower consumers to make informed decisions about their financial futures. ""Today's figures should spur on the FCA to take action to deliver a consumer-friendly pensions system that everyone can engage with."" The FCA said that the survey would provide a ""wealth of information"" that would be used when deciding how to protect vulnerable consumers in the future. A Treasury spokesman said the government had tightened rules ""to ensure that money can only be lent to people who can afford to repay"". ""We have also cracked down on pay day loans, saving borrowers over Â£150m a year, and are introducing an energy cap to help people with household bills,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Congresswoman Frederica Wilson: ""How insensitive can you be?"" The mother of a US soldier who was killed in action has backed a congresswoman's claim that President Donald Trump showed insensitivity during a phone call to her son's widow. Representative Frederica Wilson said he had told Myeshia Johnson: ""He knew what he was signing up for, but I guess it hurts anyway."" Mr Trump said Ms Wilson's account was ""totally fabricated"". Sgt La David Johnson waskilled in Nigerby Islamist militants this month. He was one of four US special forces soldiers who died in an ambush. Mr Trump had already been criticised for not contacting the families of the dead servicemen right after the fatal ambush on 4 October.

""And I think to try and create something from that... is frankly appalling and disgusting."" By Anthony Zurcher, senior North America reporter, BBC News In US politics, nothing is off-limits any more. After (inaccurately) swiping at his predecessors for not calling the family members of US soldiers killed in combat, Mr Trump is on the defensive over allegations he mishandled a call with a grieving widow. The accuser is a partisan Democratic congresswoman and the president, not surprisingly, is pushing back hard. This controversy is spiralling towards the gutter. Mr Trump made this bed, however. He was quick to cite the slain son of chief of staff John Kelly to justify his contention that Barack Obama didn't always make phone calls. Then there were the disparaging comments candidate Mr Trump made last summer about the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq. The more this story drags on - and it will drag on - the more damage it could do to a president who wraps himself in the symbols of patriotism and the military, but is in danger of being viewed by the public as lacking empathy when it counts most. An important presidential role is consoler-in-chief during times of tragedy. Successful politicians learn early that they need a human touch. It's a job Mr Trump, the anti-politician, has little experience doing - and it shows. Five reasons Trump's widow story stings Mr Trump has been on the defensive over the deaths in Niger since a reporter asked him at the White House on Monday why he had still not called the families. He provoked fury by falsely claiming that his predecessor, Barack Obama, and other former US presidents had not called the relatives of dead service members. This video can not be played Trump denigrates Obama over false fallen soldier claim Mr Trump also said he had written letters to the families of the four servicemen killed in Niger and planned to call them soon. The White House later said the president had spoken to the families but it did not say when. On Tuesday, Mr Trump ratcheted up the row by suggestingthat President Obama had not called the family of Mr Trump's chief of staff, Gen John Kelly, when his son was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. TheAssociated Press says,externalthat like presidents before him, Mr Trump has made personal contact with some families of dead soldiers - but not all. ""What's different is that Trump, alone among them, has picked a political fight over who's done better to honour the war dead and their families,"" the American news agency reports. ""He placed himself at the top of this pantheon, boasting Tuesday that 'I think I've called every family of someone who's died' while past presidents didn't place such calls'."" Politico magazine is carryinga report,externalsaying that a statement about the Niger ambush victims was prepared - but never released. This is not the first time Mr Trump has found himself in an imbroglio over US veterans. As presidential candidate, he mocked Senator John McCain for having been captured and held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam after his aircraft was shot down. Mr McCain has been praised for the bravery he showed during torture by his VietCong captors, and for his leadership of other American prisoners. Mr Trump also engaged in a feud with the parents of decorated army captain Humayun Khan, a Muslim-American who was killed in Iraq in 2004.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: I want 'urgency' on citizens' deal EU leaders have urged Theresa May to do more to break the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations as they gather at a crunch Brussels summit. Dutch PM Mark Rutte said ""a lot more clarity"" on the UK's financial offer was needed before talks could progress.

Reality Check: How are the Brexit talks actually going? Goldman chief hints at Frankfurt move No deal? The view from the Europeans Tell EU you'll walk away, Eurosceptics tell May Mrs May, who has called for ""urgency"" in reaching agreement on the issue of citizens' rights, will address EU leaders at the summit later. At a meeting on Friday, at which the UK will not be present, the 27 leaders are expected to conclude officially that ""insufficient progress"" has been made on the first topics for discussion to move onto the second phase of trade discussions. These topics are citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the border in Northern Ireland.

But he said she needed to make ""absolutely clear"" what she was offering to do in relationship to the UK's financial obligations towards the EU. ""Maybe it's not possible now to name a number but at least to come up with a methodology, a system, a complete proposal to solve this issue,"" he said. ""As long as that is not happening I don't see how we can move forward."" Theresa May chatted to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron at the EU summit Analysis by Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly The October summit was always the first date in the EU calendar on which a gathering of the 27 heads of government could declare themselves satisfied with the Brexit divorce negotiations and agree to start talking about trade. It's been clear for weeks that they won't do that - but they will offer the UK some encouragement by starting internal discussions about future trade with the UK - ready for any breakthrough at the next summit in December. Theresa May isn't expected to make any big new proposal in her after-dinner remarks but to underline the quality of the financial offer made in her speech in Florence - worth around Â£20bn. The EU side wants more though - more money as well as further movement on citizens rights and the Irish border. There are almost as many predictions about what happens next as there are diplomats in Brussels; one has suggested that the prospects of a December breakthrough are no better than fifty-fifty but an official close to the talks said the signal on Brexit from this summit would be fundamentally positive. Kuenssberg: Whiff of foreboding about Brexit talks Before leaving for Brussels, Mrs May used aFacebook,externalpost to offer further assurances to the three million or so nationals of other EU countries living in the UK and uncertain about their future after Brexit. In the open letter, which was also mailed to 100,000 EU nationals, she said those who already had permanent residence would be able to ""swap this"" for settled status in as hassle-free a way as possible. The process of applying for permanent residency, for which EU nationals are eligible after five years, has long been criticised as cumbersome and overly bureaucratic. At one point, it involved filling out an 85-page form. Theresa May says the future of British and EU nationals has always been her ""first priority"" In simplifying it, Mrs May said she was committed to putting ""people first"" in the negotiations and expected British nationals living on the continent to be treated in the same way. ""I know both sides will consider each other's proposals with an open mind and with flexibility and creativity on both sides, I am confident we can conclude discussions on citizens' rights in the coming weeks,"" she said. Nicolas Hatton, of the 3million pressure group formed to fight for the rights of EU nationals in the UK, described the PM's statement as ""very positive"", but said its timing was ""a bit more dubious"". ""We should have received that letter maybe 12 months ago so we would not have felt so anxious about our future"" he said, adding: ""I think the letter was actually addressed to EU leaders.""

In the event of no progress at Thursday's meeting, the letter, organised by the Leave Means Leave campaign, says Mrs May should formally declare the UK is working on the assumption it will be reverting to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules on 30 March 2019. Creative sector warns of Brexit threat Brexit: All you need to know 'More delays' to key Brexit bill Mr Paterson told the Today programme the UK should not be ""terrified"" of leaving the EU without a deal in place, saying this appeared ""inevitable at the moment"" due to the EU's ""complete obsession with money"" - the so-called Brexit divorce bill. But Labour's Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, said it would be ""irresponsible"" to threaten to walk away with the talks only at ""phase one"". He added that Labour was not ""duty bound"" to support any deal the PM secures with Brussels. Sir Keir and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are also in Brussels for their own talks with EU officials.

"Let me be the first to make the bad joke, to use the predictable metaphor. There will be a sour mood over the EU summit in the next couple of days, and that's not just because of the problem with the drains that sent toxic fumes into the atmosphere at the summit building forcing the talks back to the old premises next door. (Sorry) It will also be the sense of frustration in the air, maybe even of exasperation, and likely too a whiff of foreboding about the whole situation. On both sides there will be spin. On both sides there is already expectation management. PM offers more assurances to EU citizens Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? Here are a few things, however, that are currently true and will probably still be true by Friday lunchtime, with the slim but real chance of course that it could all get turned upside down. First, the UK-EU talks are significantly behind. The UK hoped that by autumn we'd be able to move onto trade talks properly. That's not going to happen, underlining the change since those heady days when Brexiteers promised it could be straightforward. Second, there is not likely to be any answer to the main bind on Friday. The UK does not want to put any more cash on the table, beyond the 20bn euros implied byMrs May's Florence speech. The strongest voices in the EU, although not every country agrees, think the UK ought to have to wait for the next phase of talks unless it is willing to offer hypothetical extra cash. Whatever else is said or briefed privately, this is the fundamental issue. And until the PM feels she is in a political situation where it's possible and desirable to budge it's hard to see how they will move on as certainly, there is no appetite on the EU side for a shift. Third, something will have gone very badly wrong, however, if there is not a nudge towards moving on. Sources say foreign ministers agreed the draft version of the conclusions of the summit yesterday that are not likely to change much. They don't exactly give a green light to the next phase, but they do at least give a bit of a push in that direction - although not quite as clearly as the UK had hoped. Fourth, the EU is still concerned that the UK government is yet to present a clear picture of what it really wants the long-term relationship to be. And it's still the case, sources tell me, that the full cabinet is yet to have a proper discussion that tries to find that answer. Sounds extraordinary but given how divided the party is, arguably the lack of discussion is what keeps things even vaguely calm. With guns drawn in the Tory party there is no temptation for Theresa May to fire a shot. And there's nothing in the next couple of days, or even the next couple of months, that's likely to change that or to answer that much more fundamental question.

"People with dyslexia have difficulty learning to read, write or spell French scientists say they may have found a potential cause of dyslexia which could be treatable, hidden in tiny cells in the human eye. In a small study they found that most dyslexics had dominant round spots in both eyes - rather than in just one - leading to blurring and confusion. UK experts said the research was ""very exciting"" and highlighted the link between vision and dyslexia. But they said not all dyslexics were likely to have the same problem. People with dyslexia have difficulties learning to read, spell or write despite normal intelligence. Often letters appear to move around and get in the wrong order and dyslexic people can have problems distinguishing left from right. Human beings have a dominant eye in the same way that people have a dominant left or right hand. In the University of Rennes study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, scientists looked into the eyes of 30 non-dyslexics and 30 dyslexics. They discovered differences in the shape of spots deep in the eye where red, green and blue cones - responsible for colour - are located. In non-dyslexics, they found that the blue cone-free spot in one eye was round and in the other eye it was oblong or unevenly shaped, making the round one more dominant. But in dyslexic people, both eyes had the same round-shaped spot, which meant neither eye was dominant. This would result in the brain being confused by two slightly different images from the eyes. Researchers Guy Ropars and Albert le Floch said this lack of asymmetry ""might be the biological and anatomical basis of reading and spelling disabilities"". They added: ""For dyslexic students, their two eyes are equivalent and their brain has to successively rely on the two slightly different versions of a given visual scene."" Prof John Stein, dyslexia expert and emeritus professor in neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said having a dominant spot in one eye meant there were better connections between the two sides of the brain and therefore clearer vision. He said the study was ""really interesting"" because it stressed the importance of eye dominance in reading. But he said the research gave no indication of why these differences occurred in some people's eyes. He said the French test appeared to be more objective than current tests, but was unlikely to explain everyone's dyslexia. Dyslexia is usually an inherited condition which affects 10% of the population, but environmental factors are also thought to play a role. ""No one problem is necessary to get dyslexia and no one problem is behind it,"" Prof Stein said.

"This video can not be played Video shown in court to display how accused man could have tampered with wife's parachute Jurors in the trial of a man accused of tampering with his wife's parachute have been shown videos of how the alleged sabotage could have taken place in a toilet in just over five minutes. Victoria Cilliers, 40, suffered multiple injuries in a 4,000ft fall at Netheravon Airfield, Wiltshire in 2015. Emile Cilliers, 37, denies attempting to murder his former Army officer wife. Two videos of a parachute expert showing how the sabotage could be done were played at Winchester Crown Court. Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers, of the Royal Army Physical Training Corps in Aldershot, twisted the lines of his wife's main parachute and removed two slinks - which attach lines to the harness from a reserve chute - on the day before her jump. The army fitness instructor is also accused of a third charge of damaging a gas valve at their home a few days earlier, in the second allegation that he attempted to kill his wife. He denies all three charges. The army fitness instructor denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers in April 2015 The court has heard that Mr Cilliers allegedly took his wife's packed parachute into the hangar's toilets where he is accused of tampering with it. The jury asked if they could be shown a demonstration of how this might have been done in the tight space of the toilet cubicle. Mark Bayada, the chief instructor at Netheravon and expert witness for the prosecution, carried out the filmed demonstration using two different parachutes. Mr Cilliers allegedly took his wife's packed parachute into the hangar's toilets where he is accused of tampering with it He used one which was the same size as that used by Mrs Cilliers on the day of her near-fatal jump and another slightly larger parachute. The court heard both sabotage demonstrations were completed in just over five minutes. Mr Bayada said the tampering carried out would not be noticed in a pre-jump flight line visual check.

"John was devastated when his son Archie was taken into care When John's son was placed into care at birth he was distraught - his drug abuse had been the cause. But with the help of a family court focused on reuniting children with their parents, his life began to change. ""Not only was I using heroin, I was using crack, I was using prescription drugs, I was using alcohol - and I was homeless."" John, who is 49, is candid when it comes to talking about his past addictions. He started experimenting around the age of 14, and continued the habit during the birth of his two children - both with women who were also addicts. It meant he didn't see his first child Daniella for long periods of time - at one stage as much as two years. He says he and the mother ""really tried to do normal life, but it didn't really work. ""It was a combination of the drugs and the lifestyle that went with that. Trying to be a parent, hold down a job - it wasn't doable,"" he explains. Archie was taken into foster care from birth When Daniella was 10, John found himself preparing for the birth of another child - his son, Archie, with another addict who had already had several children put into care. He began looking for a place to live - having been homeless at the time - but failed to tackle the underlying drug problem. After Archie was born, he was monitored in hospital to see if he had grown dependent on the heroin substitute his mother had taken during pregnancy. Then, he was immediately placed into foster care. As John recalls this devastating period, he asks for a moment to compose himself, leaving his chair as he wipes away the tears. Once he's ready to continue, he says it was seeing his son enter the care system that made him realise how out of hand his own life had become. ""That's when I knew this is serious, really serious."" Judge Crichton founded FDAC in 2008 John was assigned to a type of family court specifically designed to help parents keep their children, known as the Family Drug and Alcohol Court (FDAC). Its aim is to place parents at the centre of the process - speaking to them directly rather than through lawyers, and having regular two-week sessions with the same judge. Social workers and psychiatrists, as well as experts in substance misuse, domestic violence, finance and housing, are also available. Watch Catrin Nye's full filmabout the Family Drug and Alcohol Court on the Victoria Derbyshire website. It was founded in 2008 by Judge Nicholas Crichton after years of seeing families being broken up by court rulings. ""I often think it must be terrifying for a parent to have to come to [a traditional] court knowing at the end of the proceedings they may well lose their children,"" he says. FDAC's task can, however, be substantial. ""I have seen mothers who have been heroin addicted from the age of 10, children who sleep on urine-sodden beds, where no-one has bothered to bath them or feed them properly,"" Judge Crichton explains, running through some of the cases he has seen. Dr Mike Shaw says the effect FDAC can have by reuniting families justifies the cost of the service For John, this approach made ""total sense"" - helping him to tackle ""the problem that was right at the front"". FDAC helped him to arrange detox classes to combat his addiction, followed by a day programme. The court is now receiving a further Â£6.2m of government money over seven years, through a complex financing structure - something called a ""social impact bond"" or ""pay-for-success financing"". Private investors will pay the upfront costs and if the process works they make a profit - being paid back by the local authority and the government. If it fails, they will not receive that money. Dr Mike Shaw, a child psychiatrist and co-director of FDAC National Unit, concedes that it makes the process more complex, but says it will ensure the service strives for the best outcome. But its work does come at an inflated price. Each intervention costs around Â£13,000 a year, he suggests, compared to Â£5,000 for standard care proceedings. He says, however, that the overall cost of care proceedings might in some cases be as much as Â£100,000. Minister for Sport and Civil Society, Tracey Crouch, says the additional FDAC funding will ""benefit some of the most vulnerable people in society"" and ""achieve real results in communities across the country"". At one stage, John went as long as two years without seeing his daughter Daniella John's intervention lasted around 16 months - at which point he estimates he had been clean for a year. His son Archie, now aged eight, lives with him permanently, and he says he's rebuilding his relationship with Daniella - who's now 18. A 2016 study,externalby the University of Lancaster, commissioned by the Department for Education, suggested that others have successful outcomes from FDAC too. It found 37% of families were reunited or continued to live together at the end of proceedings - compared to 25% of those who go through ordinary family courts. However, the sample group was relatively small - 240 families in all. Archie now lives with John permanently John says he is now ""trying to make up for lost time"" with Daniella, who smiles as he says it. He is grateful for the opportunity. ""I've got two children, I work, I pay my bills, I do lots of fun stuff,"" he says. ""The way I live my life today is totally different from who I was nearly eight years ago.""

"There are many more possible moves in a Go game than a chess match Google's DeepMind says it has made another big advance in artificial intelligence by getting a machine to master the Chinese game of Go without help from human players. The AlphaGo program, devised by the tech giant's AI division, has already beaten two of the world's best players. It had started by learning from thousands of games played by humans. But the new AlphaGo Zero began with a blank Go board and no data apart from the rules, and then played itself. Within 72 hours it was good enough to beat the original program by 100 games to zero. DeepMind's chief executive, Demis Hassabis, said the system could now have more general applications in scientific research. Demis Hassabis worked on video games before co-founding Deep Mind ""We're quite excited because we think this is now good enough to make some real progress on some real problems even though we're obviously a long way from full AI,"" he told the BBC and other journalists. The London-based artificial intelligence company's software defeated leading South Korean Go player Lee Se-dol by four games to one last year. In a game where there are more possible legal board positions than there are atoms in the universe, it was a triumph for machine over man and one that came much earlier than many in the AI world had expected. AlphaGo followed this with the defeat of the world's number one Go player, China's Ke Jie, in May. As with many advances in this field, the achievements required the combination of vast amounts of data - in this case records of thousands of games - and a lot of computer-processing power. David Silver also began his career in video games David Silver, who led that effort, says the team took a very different approach with AlphaGo Zero. ""The new version starts from a neural network that knows nothing at all about the game of Go,"" he explained. ""The only knowledge it has is the rules of the game. Apart from that, it figures everything out just by playing games against itself."" This video can not be played A brief guide to Go Go is thought to date back to ancient China, several thousand years ago. Using black and white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents' pieces with their own. The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves at most points in the game, compared with about 20 in chess. It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct. This has turned out to be far more efficient way of addressing the problem. Whereas AlphaGo took months to get to the point where it could take on a professional, AlphaGo Zero got there in just three days, using a fraction of the processing  power. ""It shows it's the novel algorithms that count, not the compute power or the data,"" says Mr Silver. He enthuses about an idea some may find rather scary - that in just a few days a machine has surpassed the knowledge of this game acquired by humanity over thousands of years. ""We've actually removed the constraints of human knowledge and it's able, therefore, to create knowledge itself from first principles, from a blank slate,"" he said. Google DeepMind's defeat of champion Go player Lee Se-dol has been made into a documentary Whereas earlier versions quickly learned from and improved upon human strategies, AlphaGo Zero developed techniques which the professional player who advised DeepMind said he had never seen before. Many of the team have now moved on to new projects where they are trying to take this technique to new areas. Demis Hassabis mentions drug design and the discovery of new materials as areas of interest. Whereas some see a threat from AI, he looks ahead with optimism. ""I hope these kind of algorithms will be routinely working with us as scientific experts medical experts on advancing the frontiers of science and medicine - that's what I hope,"" he says. But he and his colleagues are cautious about how rapidly we will see the wider application of these AI techniques - a game with clear rules and no element of luck is one thing, the messy, random, unpredictable real world quite another. I wrote earlier this week aboutthe tidal wave of AI hypepouring into my email inbox. AlphaGo Zero is at the other end of the spectrum - proper peer-reviewed science with a real advance in computer intelligence. We need to keep a close eye on the ethical dilemmas involved in developing a machine that, by some definitions, can think for itself - especially when it is controlled by a giant like Google. But for now, there are few signs that AlphaGo Zero and its ilk will either steal our jobs or threaten to make humanity obsolete.

"Mr Neistat suggests YouTube's community of creators acts as a defence against online competitors One of YouTube's most influential vloggers has chastised the service's leaders, claiming they are failing many of their most popular video creators. Specifically,Casey Neistat criticised the way the platform,externalhad made it impossible for some videos to generate advertising revenue, without clearly explaining the rules to its community. One of his own videos - an interview with Indonesia's president - was temporarily ""demonetised"" last week. YouTube has said it is listening. ""We watched Casey's video and appreciate him and the wider community voicing their concerns,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We know this has been a difficult few months, and we're working hard to improve our systems. We're making progress, but we know there is a lot more to do."" Mr Neistat has more than eight million subscribers on YouTube, who have signed up to be alerted when he posts. He has also struck a multi-million-dollar deal to create content for CNN on the platform. He is normally viewed as being one of the leading champions of the site. But in a video posted on Tuesday, he said he felt compelled to speak out because the level of upset among creators posed an ""existential threat to YouTube's entire business"". Mr Neistat's vlog from Indonesia was demonetised until he appealed against the decision The Google division began stripping some videos of adverts earlier in the year after several major brands suspended YouTube campaigns because their marketing clips had been attached to extremist content. To address the problem, YouTube introduced an algorithm that determines which clips are ""family friendly"" and thus allowed to continue making money for their creators. But Mr Neistat said the decision-making process had been badly communicated. ""There are no answers anywhere, and there's no-one telling you what's going on,"" he said. ""The thing that was most troubling for me... was the lack of communication, the lack of transparency on the part of YouTube."" ""People are... putting the same amount of work, the same amount of energy and the same amount of expense into the content they're creating, but now they're getting paid only a fraction of what they did."" A recent decision to demonetise creators' videos about the Las Vegas shootings had caused particular ire, Mr Neistat said, since a video featuring the chat-show host Jimmy Kimmel discussing the same incident had been allowed to continue featuring ads. ""It sort of reeks of hypocrisy, and again the community felt like a second-class citizen,"" he said. As a rule, YouTube prevents adverts from running on videos about tragedies. But this does not apply to clips posted by select partners - including Mr Kimmel's employer, ABC - who are allowed to sell ads themselves rather than relying on Google to do so. A recent clip of Jimmy Kimmel discussing a mass shooting in Las Vegas was allowed to show adverts ""In the specific case of tragedies, like the one in Las Vegas, we are working to not allow such partners to sell against such content,"" a YouTube spokeswoman said last week. ""We have not completed this work yet, but will soon."" Mr Neistat suggested a better alternative would be to give creators more control over whose adverts appeared alongside their clips. The video-maker is far from being the first YouTuber to complain about the issue. But one industry-watcher said his intervention carried weight. ""People look to Casey to be not just an inspiration but also a voice for the community - he's very well respected and people do listen to what he says and follow his lead,"" said Alex Brinnand, editor of TenEighty magazine. ""The fact that he has put out this video... will help ensure his audience is aware of the issue and becomes as equally unhappy as he is."" This video can not be played WATCH: Other YouTubers told the BBC about their frustrations last month Mr Neistat highlighted that Twitter's rival video-based social network, Vine, had collapsed after its managers had disappointed several of its leading clip creators and suggested YouTube could face a similar exodus. ""When you think about Netflix or Amazon or Hulu or any of these other digital distribution platforms right now, they've all got money, they're all willing to spend money, and they're trying to figure out how to diversify their audience,"" he said. He added that Amazon's Twitch service - which currently focuses on video-games-related live feeds - had already tempted some. Twitch began allowing users to upload pre-recorded videos a year ago and may unveil new features at its annual TwitchCon event, which begins on Friday. Amazon paid $970m (Â£736m) to buy Twitch in 2014 However, Mr Brinnand questioned whether the service had done enough to lure away YouTube's biggest names yet. ""For creators like Casey, I don't think at the moment that Twitch is a viable option,"" he said. ""It's a lot more geared to live or as-live content, so doesn't cater to the same audience the vloggers have with their more packaged, produced videos. ""But Twitch has laid the foundations for the future - it already offers very appealing revenue streams - and could be a contender if it develops a stronger platform for standard video.""

"In November, the man who holds the UK's purse-strings will announce how the nation's money will be spent in the year ahead. And rumours have begun flying about potential cuts and giveaways in the pipeline. Among these, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond is rumoured to be planning a reduced rate of National Insurance for young people, while cutting older people's pension relief. The plans to redistribute wealth across the generations were mooted by Whitehall sources,according to The Telegraph,external. Pension relief is a system in which the more you pay into a pension, the more money you can get back as a tax relief from government. We don't know exactly how this policy - were it to be announced - would work, or which ages would benefit. But at BBC Reality Check, we wanted to know - can you make someone pay more tax just because they're older? The short answer is yes - there are lots of instances of people paying more or less tax, based on their age. It may be discrimination, but it's not illegal. Until last year, people over the age of 65 were allowed to keep more money tax-free, and it's still the case that UK workers reaching state pension age no longer have to make National Insurance contributions. You can also be paid a lower minimum wage if you are younger. There are four different minimum wages depending on your age, from Â£4.05 an hour for under-18s, increasing to Â£7.50 for over-25s. These variations don't count as age discrimination in law, and are allowed in the UK system of tax and earnings. It wouldn't be too difficult to implement either. But does it make sense to do so? There is very little economic justification for allowing young people to pay a reduced National Insurance rate according to a spokesman for independent think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). The IFS says government usually has one of two main aims when reducing taxes for a particular group: to change their behaviour to distribute money more fairly If the aim is to change behaviour - in the case of National Insurance contributions, probably to encourage people to enter or stay in the workplace - certain groups are more ""responsive"" to tax cuts than others. Tax cuts for people nearing retirement age, or mothers with school-age children, are more likely to get them to stay in work, according to the IFS. But young people without dependants are less likely to work more because they are being taxed less. If changing how the wealth of the country is distributed is the aim, this is a very blunt tool, the IFS says. It would be better to address the root problems facing young people like the housing market or student debts, according to Julian Jessop at the Institute for Economic Affairs. He says this system could mean young City workers on six-figure salaries could pay less tax than NHS workers in their 50s. It could also create an unfair system whereby women who take career breaks when they are younger in order to have children don't benefit from tax breaks in their 20s, but end up paying more tax later in life. Instead of putting more money in young people's pockets via tax cuts, government could introduce a new form of pension tax relief favouring the young, according to Tom McPhail, head of policy at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdowne. This could mean the government ""tops up"" young people's pensions by a larger amount than older people's pensions. But this may not have the same political capital as a giveaway for young people that they can feel immediately in their pay packets.

" There aren’t many 21st Century leaders who lived in a cave and laboured as a farmer before clawing their way to power. Five decades ago, as the chaos of the Cultural Revolution engulfed Beijing, the 15-year-old Xi Jinping embarked on a harsh rural life amid the yellow canyons and mountains of inland China. The region where Xi farmed was a bastion of the Communists during the civil war. Yan’an came to call itself “the holy land of the Chinese revolution”. Now President Xi Jinping’s second five-year term as leader will be confirmed at the Chinese Communist Party Congress. He leads a confident, rising superpower, but one which jealously polices what is said about its leaders. Xi’s own story has been sanitised and while much of rural China has seenbreakneck urbanisation, the village where he grew up is now a pilgrimage destination for the Communist Party faithful. In 1968 Mao had decreed that millions of young people should move from the cities to the countryside to learn from the hard life of the peasants. Xi says he did learn, and that the ideas and qualities which define him today were formed in his early cave life. “I’m forever a son of the yellow earth,” he likes to say. “I left my heart in Liangjiahe. Liangjiahe made me. “When I arrived at 15, I was anxious and confused. When I left at 22, my life goals were firm and I was filled with confidence.” df Back then everyone studied Chairman Mao’s famous little red book. Now the thoughts of Chairman Xi are posted on huge red hoardings and there is a museum in his honour. It extols the good deeds he did for his fellow villagers but all trace of true personality has been expunged in a story so saintly it is hard to work out what is real. In his first five years in office, Xi Jinping has built a personality cult. At its core is the image of a man of the people. He has toured back-alley homes, ducking through washing lines. He has talked in earthy prose, telling students that life is like a shirt with buttons where you have to get the first few right or all the rest will be wrong. He has queued in a downmarket steamed-bun shop and paid for his own lunch. But it is his early exile from home and family, a political outcast in a cave, that is the heart of Xi’s creation myth. “People who have little experience with power… tend to regard it as mysterious and novel. But I look past the superficial things - the power and the flowers and the glory and the applause. I see the detention houses, the fickleness of human relationships. I understand politics on a deeper level.” The young Xi had already lived two lives by the time he arrived in the cave. During his early childhood, his father was a hero of the communist revolution and Xi enjoyed a privileged and cloistered upbringing as a “red princeling”. The young Xi Jinping (left) with his younger brother and their father A 2009 American diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks - and based on a briefing from a close friend of Xi’s - said the first 10 years of his life were the most formative. “The most permanent influences shaping Xi's worldview were his ‘princeling’ pedigree and time growing up with families of first-generation Communist Party revolutionaries in Beijing's exclusive residential compounds.” But all of that was shattered in the maelstrom that an increasingly paranoid and vengeful Chairman Mao inflicted on the party elite in the 1960s. Xi’s father was first purged and then jailed, and his family humiliated. One of his sisters died, possibly driven to suicide. By the time he was 13, Xi’s formal schooling ended as classes across Beijing were suspended so that students could criticise, beat and even murder their teachers. 1966: Chinese Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution Without parents or friends to protect him from the Red Guards dispensing the summary justice of the Cultural Revolution on the streets, the teenage Xi lived his second Beijing life, dodging death threats and detention. Much later, he recalled an encounter in a conversation with a reporter. “I was only 14. The Red Guards asked, ‘How serious do you yourself think your crimes are?’ “I said, ‘You can estimate it yourselves. Is it enough to execute me?’ “‘We can execute you a hundred times,’ they replied. “To my mind there was no difference between being executed a hundred times or once.” Many of Xi’s generation agree that when their schooling stopped and they learned to survive on their wits, they developed emotional toughness and independence of thought. Xi later reflected on his ability to listen to other points of view without necessarily bowing to them. “I had to learn to enjoy having my errors pointed out to me, but not to be swayed too much by that. Just because so-and-so says something, I’m not going to start weighing every cost and benefit. I’m not going to lose my appetite over it.” [The young Xi] read the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, famous quotes from Mao, and the newspaper. There wasn’t anything else.” Village life in 1960s China was tough. There was no electricity, no motorised transport, no mechanical tools. The teenage Xi learned to carry manure, build dams and repair roads. He shared the flea-ridden brick bed in his cave with three others. One of them was farmer Lü Housheng, who told me in 2015: “All we had to eat at that time was porridge, herbs and steamed buns. If you’re hungry you don’t care what you’re eating.” At night Xi would retreat to his cave to read by the light of a kerosene lamp. Lü remembers him as a voracious reader and heavy smoker. The cave where Xi lived is now a tourist attraction “While he read I would roll the cigarettes. He read the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, famous quotes from Mao, and the newspaper. There wasn’t anything else.” Xi had no sense of humour according to Lü. He didn’t play poker, hang out with other young people or look for a girlfriend. Instead by 18, Xi was ready to embark on his political career. He joined the Communist Youth League, and at 21, despite multiple rejections due to his father’s imprisonment and his family’s disgrace, he finally succeeded in joining the Party itself. Supremely pragmatic, a realist, with his ""eyes on the prize"" from early adulthood. This was how Xi’s friend described him in the 2009 diplomatic cable. Unlike many youths who ""made up for lost time by having fun"", Xi was exceptionally ambitious and focused. After the Cultural Revolution, he ""chose to survive by becoming redder than the red”. Xi, pictured in 1979 By the time Xi was 25, his father had been politically rehabilitated and sent to run Guangdong, the vast province next door to Hong Kong, which would become the powerhouse of China’s economic rise. The elder Xi advanced his son’s career through his patronage network, and according to his friend, Xi quickly learned to build his own. “He carefully laid out a career plan that would maximise his opportunities to rise to the top levels of the Party hierarchy, first becoming a PLA [army] officer in the late 1970s and then serving in a variety of provincial leadership positions, progressively rising through the ranks. He had promotion... in mind from day one."" No-one in their right mind would ever think that guy who stayed in my house would become the president. I don’t care what country you’re talking about.” Xi took the traumas of his early life and the solitude of the cave with him. His friend said his reserve, a certain distant quality, contributed to the failure of his first marriage to the daughter of a senior diplomat. But it clearly contributed to the success of his political career. Until he reached the very top, his defining achievement was to have risen with barely a trace. The only time he drew attention to himself was when he married his current wife, a celebrity singer. For many years the public joked: ""Who is Xi Jinping? He is Peng Liyuan's husband.” Peng Liyuan with her husband, Xi One reporter for state media whose task was to cover Xi as a mid-career provincial leader told me he was “always very boring and forgettable. He didn’t want to get any kind of bad record.” Having watched as his outspoken father was victimised by Mao, Xi deferred to power and was careful to avoid making enemies. Even in his 40s and 50s as a very senior Party leader, he was always competent, never showy. The young Xi: “Boring and forgettable” One astute insider described him as “a needle concealed in silk floss”. Eleanor Dvorchak hosted him on an agricultural research trip to Muscatine, Iowa, in 1985. He slept in her son’s room with Star Trek posters on the wall. “He was humble,”she told reporterswhen he went back to Iowa in 2012 just before becoming China’s top leader. “No-one in their right mind would ever think that guy who stayed in my house would become the president. I don’t care what country you’re talking about.” Everyone was taken in. When he became Communist Party leader in 2012, Xi Jinping was the compromise choice. Few inside or outside China guessed at what was coming next - five years of political shock and awe. 2012: Xi is appointed head of the Chinese Communist Party On 11 June 2015, a white-haired old man stood in the dock of a criminal court in northern China, flanked by officers who had once answered to his command. For years he’d been the most feared man in China, controlling police, paramilitaries, prisons and intelligence operations. But in the year-and-a-half between vanishing from public life and reappearing in court, this 72-year-old had lost his jet black hair and become stooped and haggard. Now he was the target of the Orwellian security system he himself had built. And he knew better than to resist. “I accept the sentence. I will not appeal. I realise the crimes I’ve committed and what I’ve cost the Party.” When Xi Jinping came to power, he had promised the public a campaign which would “brandish the sword against corruption”, caging tigers as well as trapping flies. Here was one of the biggest tigers of all. Zhou Yongkang was the most senior Party official ever to stand trial for corruption in the history of communist China. A commentary on state TV news proclaimed: “No-one is above the law. This case shows that our country is practising the rule of law and our Party is determined to eradicate corruption.” The downfall of another tiger – Bo Xilai –is now notorious. He and Zhou were accused of plotting together and, with two top military figures and another senior politician, of “wrecking Party unity”. Zhou’s trial came halfway through Xi’s first term. The campaign of shock and awe was well under way with a barrage of high-profile trials and a drumbeat of righteous propaganda. To supplement the image of a newly disciplined and frugal political culture, Xi tried to avoid banquets and sometimes travelled in a van with colleagues instead of a fleet of limousines. Since the communists fought their way to power, they had called themselves the “vanguard of the people”, an elite class whose mandate to rule came from “serving the people”. Without living by this higher code the Party had no claim to legitimacy. For the past five years, Xi’s blunt message has been: “Don’t join the Party if you want to make money.” But his problem was, and still is, that this is precisely why some of the Party’s nearly 90 million members did join up. With an envelope of banknotes here, and a nod there, patronage is how Communist Party politics has often worked. Cleaning it up means removing not just individuals but whole networks of influence and a culture. “He who rules by virtue is like the North Star,” Xi said, quoting the ancient philosopher Confucius. “It maintains its place, and the multitude of stars pay homage.” He issued edicts on the appropriate number of dishes for lunching public officials and even decreed office measurements for each rank in the hierarchy. Xi returned to his roots in the cave village to rub shoulders with ordinary farmers and make an unspoken point about the contrast between his own life story and a corrupt elite. But Xi, now 64, has always belonged to the elite. In the years before he took power, some of his relatives had become enormously wealthy, though there is no evidence that he sought to promote the business interests of his family. According to his friend’s account, in the American diplomatic cable published by Wikileaks: “Xi knows how very corrupt China is and is repulsed by the all-encompassing commercialisation of Chinese society, with its attendant nouveau riche, official corruption, loss of values, dignity, and self-respect, and such ‘moral evils’ as drugs and prostitution.” Zhou Yongkang had been a Party member for half a century. Where Xi started life as one of the cloistered red elite in Beijing, Zhou’s family were hard-pressed beet farmers who fished for eels to supplement their income. Their eldest son had brought the family honour by going to university and becoming an oil engineer. Zhou Yongkang, before his fall He’d risen to run China’s biggest oil company and then a province of 80 million people. He’d crowned his career with a seat at the Party’s top table and control of the security system. Together it made for a formidable patronage network. By the time Zhou appeared in court, Xi had painstakingly torn that network apart - his investigators interrogating everyone from office staff to drivers and cooks. Only months before Zhou’s court appearance, one of his business cronies had been executed for running a mafia which resorted to intimidation and murder. But the Party rarely executes its own. Zhou was sentenced to life in prison. In his home village of Xiqiantou many share the surname Zhou.  Set amid lush fields and fruit trees, Xiqiantou presents a tranquil scene of whitewashed houses with curved eaves and ducks dabbling on the village pond. On the day I visited, one angler hooking bait in the afternoon sun complained: “It’s winner-takes-all in politics here. Zhou Yongkang worked his way up the hard way. He’s made a big contribution to the Party. Xi Jinping’s just pinning these allegations on him.” Winner-takes-all is a dangerous game. Zhou was not just corrupt - he belonged to a rival Party faction whose power challenged Xi’s own. Everyone now sees that in the Xi era, if you lose, you lose everything. A fractured elite is a threat to an authoritarian regime and in pre-communist times, China’s imperial dynasties often fell victim to faction fights at court. By caging hundreds of powerful tigers at the top of the Party and army, Xi has torn up the rulebook which kept a fragile peace between the red elite after the death of Chairman Mao. Any of them might be making a speech in the Great Hall of the People one minute and dragged off to a cell the next. No wonder China is alert to sudden disappearances. In January 2017 a 45-year-old billionaire with connections to many top families vanished from his luxury Hong Kong apartment, accompanied by several unidentified men. Xiao Jianhua has not been seen since but is believed to be in custody in mainland China - a warning to others that money, connections and a Canadian passport are not enough to protect you from the long arm of Xi. Xiao Jianhua disappeared from the Four Seasons Hotel in Hong Kong Six months later came the purge of a politician the billionaire knew well, a man many had tipped to rise to the very top leadership in the coming Congress reshuffle. Bribes, abuse of power, exchange of money for sex, leaking Party secrets - the charge sheet against Sun Zhengcai was familiar. But five years into Xi’s rule, it reinforces the impression that the Party’s corruption problem is systemic and enduring. Former politburo member Sun Zhengcai was expelled from the Communist Party On the other side of the world another well-connected billionaire had already said exactly that. In recent months, from the safety of a Manhattan penthouse, Guo Wengui has made regular YouTube broadcasts alleging that the anti-corruption chief Wang Qishan – effectively Xi’s right-hand man - is himself corrupt. The only person Guo has been careful not to target is Xi himself. Xi's anti-corruption chief, Wang Qishan Beijing has denied his allegations and Guo himself is now the target of multiple lawsuits. But many Chinese are gripped by his sensational account of the links between politics and business. Some  of his allegations seem far-fetched, but the picture he paints is one of pervasive moral bankruptcy. In the absence of transparency, it has tarnished Xi’s narrative of a Party which has rediscovered its moral compass. Guo Wengui, photographed in New York All the senior corruption investigations of the past five years have been conducted in secret. The Chinese Communist Party remains an opaque organisation, and while pledging to clean up wrongdoing, Xi has shown no inclination to allow the whole truth to emerge in court or any other public domain. Again and again, the Party has discovered that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. But Xi is determined that he alone will command the clean-up of comrades and the caging of tigers. The trouble started when wags on Chinese social media spotted a similarity between a photo of Xi Jinping strolling with Barack Obama and a classic image of Winnie the Pooh and Tigger. From then on, China’s internet censors have waged war on the bear. There was the meme of Pooh gripping the hoof of his friend Eeyore alongside a photo of Xi grimly shaking hands with the Japanese prime minister. Then a picture of Winnie the Pooh in a toy truck appeared online just after Xi had inspected troops from an open-top car. Former US President Bill Clinton once joked that China’s bid to censor the internet was like “nailing Jell-o to the wall”. But for Xi as for the Communist Party, ridicule feels dangerous. In April this year there was no sense of humour when a man was sentenced to two years in jail for “picking quarrels and stirring up trouble” after an online reference to Steamed Bun Xi, a popular epithet for the Chinese leader after his famous lunch in the steamed-bun restaurant. “The internet has grown into an ideological battlefield, and whoever controls the tool will win the war,” warn Party-controlled media. China has more than 750 million internet users, more than the US and Europe combined. Xi is keen that China should be a cyber-superpower when it comes to innovation and commerce, but not at the expense of political discipline. Xi has waged two wars at home, one for control of his Party comrades and the other for control of the internet. In a recent speech he warned that the internet must not become a “double-edged sword”, allowing “hidden negative energy” to harm good governance and social stability. He has enormously strengthened the so-called Great Firewall of China, the combination of legislation and technologies, supported by legions of professional and volunteer censors, which together enable the Party to control Chinese cyberspace. Cybersecurity is now central to Xi’s definition of national security. Internet service providers and social media sites are forced to censor users, while users are encouraged to censor each other. All are denied online anonymity and those who overstep red lines are jailed. It is reminiscent of the Mao era, when the Party expected citizens to spy on each other, and kept detailed files on them to instil fear. But Xi’s surveillance network may already be more powerful. China has no meaningful privacy protection and every mobile phone is now a potential listening device and censorship tool. China’s leaders have always prioritised the control of sensitive information. But until Xi, the underlying assumption of many communists during the reform era was that a complex and dynamic modern economy would need decentralised decision making and that this would ultimately mean more internet freedoms. Xi has a different vision - of a China, rich, united and strong under a disciplined one-party narrative. Wherever ideas are formed and transmitted, he has worked to recapture control. When he toured the Beijing headquarters of state TV, a giant screen behind him flashed the message “absolute loyalty” and ""our surname is the Party"". On university campuses, Party leadership is being “enhanced” and academic textbooks scoured of Western influence. Private companies are eagerly announcing internal Communist Party cells, with even Shanghai’s Disney Resort enthusing that “some really good ideas come from the Party committee”. Cyberspace has seen an even fiercer clampdown. Xi took office in 2012, a year after the internet had played a key role in sparking the Arab Spring. He resolved it would never be allowed to spread protest in China, fearing a repeat of 1989, when the Party sent troops into Tiananmen Square to crush a student democracy movement. Even when travelling abroad, many Chinese citizens now remain behind the Great Firewall as their service providers enforce Party censorship. Until now the firewall has had small cracks, with those determined to access alternative sources of information able to do so via a virtual private network (VPN), a tunnelling device to the world beyond the reach of China’s censors. There on Western social media they can find a very different perspective on China. In his second term, Xi intends to take full control of the VPN tools that allow “negative energy” to evade his censors. Relying on mobile phone data and facial recognition, all enhanced by a massive investment in artificial intelligence and big data management, Xi hopes to command an internal security system unimaginable to his revolutionary or imperial forebears. His fight for control of China’s story does not stop at the country’s borders. Just a fortnight before the sensitive 19th Communist Party Congress in Beijing, a think tank on the other side of the world was targeted in a cyber-attack which appeared to originate from Shanghai. And weeks earlier, a law firm had suffered a similar attack. What connected the two was Guo Wengui, the flamboyant tycoon behind the YouTube diatribes against what he says is the greed, scheming and savagery of some of his former cronies. Guo Wengui broadcasting on YouTube The law firm targeted, Clark Hill, had filed Guo’s asylum claim in the US. And the think tank that was hit, the Hudson Institute, was due to host Guo’s first public speaking engagement in the US. The event was cancelled, and the institute acknowledged that it had faced pressure from the Chinese embassy. But it said the problem was logistics not politics. “The notion that we would be intimidated by the Chinese government is plain wrong.” However, many are intimidated. In 2014 the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told the visiting Xi Jinping it was a “joy to have friends come from afar”. But the day before he had privately told the German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Australia’s China policy was driven by “fear and greed”. Xi with former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott Both fear and greed are powerful motivators in the context of a rising China, and Xi has been bold in exploiting them, globalising a control strategy of carrots and sticks that works well at home. 2015: Xi in Seattle with tech company heads including Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (front row, far left) and Jeff Bezos of Amazon (front row, far right) “Tell China’s story well,” he urges people with Chinese roots, wherever they are in the world. He insists that they should “identify with China’s interests” whether or not they are Chinese nationals. Beijing’s embassies encourage the growing Chinese student bodies on campuses in the West to silence competing narratives. And money talks. When Xi visited Seattle in 2015, America’s technology giants allowed themselves to be summoned. The bosses of Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, IBM and Amazon all stood alongside Xi in the front row of a group photograph. All have since embarked on multiple partnerships with China despite its commitment to perfecting internet censorship. 2015: Xi in Seattle with tech company leaders, including Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Tim Cook (Apple) and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) Also prominent in that photo was Mark Zuckerberg, but despite a charm offensive which included inviting the Chinese Communist leader to suggest a name for his baby, and praising Xi’s book on governance, Facebook is still barred from China. Google’s founders were not even invited to be in Xi’s photo. Xi has ambitious plans for control of the internet and that means leverage over foreign companies. Facebook’s messaging tool Whatsapp is increasingly blocked in China and Apple has now removed from its China App Store the VPNs which once gave Chinese users access to social media tools in the West, including the YouTube channel which gave the gleeful Guo Wengui such a devastating platform to discredit Xi’s rule.

To fully control China’s cyberspace, Xi has had to take action against the world’s. “Freedom, justice, and love, these are our core values which guide us in action.” Xu Zhiyong The defendant in this trial was no ruthless Communist Party tiger but a mild-mannered lawyer. His convictions sounded close to the core socialist values endorsed by Xi Jinping, but he was about to go to jail for the audacity of acting on them without Party approval. The 40-year-old Xu Zhiyong had begun his career as a scholar but turned to representing the losers in China’s economic miracle, including migrant workers and homeless people. Just as Xi came to power, the lawyer was helping to establish the New Citizens' Movement whose aim was to unite people “through their common civic identity”. The charge against him was gathering a crowd to disrupt public order. In a closing statement to the court, he pointed out that China’s constitution promised citizens freedom of speech. “By trying to suppress the New Citizens' Movement, you are obstructing China on its path to becoming a constitutional democracy through peaceful change.” The judge cut him short, saying his statement was “irrelevant to the case”. Despite working for causes closest to Xi Jinping’s heart - probity in public life and a better deal for the poor - Xu Zhiyong was to spend the first term of the Xi era in jail. His sentence was passed on 26 January 2014. Only a few weeks earlier the Communist Party leader had made the short journey from the high-walled elite compound in central Beijing to the mausoleum of Chairman Mao in Tiananmen Square. There he joined other senior Party figures in bowing three times before the glass sarcophagus in which Mao’s body lay, a mark of respect on the 120th anniversary of his birth. Mao's embalmed body on display in his mausoleum It apparently doesn’t matter that Mao’s policies led to famine and the deaths of more than 30 million Chinese, or that Xi’s own family had been persecuted in the lost decade of the Cultural Revolution. Under Xi Jinping, dwelling on inconvenient facts of history or insulting revolutionary heroes and martyrs is now a punishable offence called “historical nihilism”. Mao’s mausoleum is in Tiananmen Square opposite the outer gate of the Forbidden City from which he had celebrated victory in the Communist revolution of 1949, declaring: “The Chinese people have stood up.” His portrait still gazes down on the square. And as the son of one of Mao’s revolutionary comrades, Xi places himself in a direct line of succession. He has promised the public that China will be rich and strong. He believes unity and discipline under one-party rule are crucial in achieving that. Xi’s elite early education, followed by the terrors of the Cultural Revolution, taught him to fear a politicised citizenry. Another formative chapter for Xi came with the collapse of communism in the Soviet bloc. His assessment was that Moscow had lost its sense of purpose when it renounced its revolutionary history. In a speech to his own Party comrades shortly after taking office, he warned: “Proportionally, the Soviet Communist Party had more members than we do, but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.” Xi’s resistance to the seductive power of liberal values has been ferocious. He has  reached back beyond Marxism to China’s deepest sense of self, quoting an 11th Century Chinese statesman Su Shi: ""The most dangerous situation for a country is when apparently everything seems fine, but hidden danger lurks. If one only sits back to watch, the situation will worsen to the point of no return.” 11th Century Chinese philosopher Su Shi “If our people cannot uphold the moral values that have been formed and developed on our own soil, and instead indiscriminately and blindly parrot Western moral values, then it will be necessary to genuinely question whether we will lose our independent ethos as a country and a people,” said Xi. A nation of active citizens is Xi’s nightmare. Christians, Muslims, labour activists, bloggers, reporters, feminists, and lawyers have been jailed for speaking or acting on their convictions. In some cases, they have also been paraded in televised confessions, recanting their beliefs and echoing the Party line that they allowed themselves to become pawns of China’s enemies in the West. Rebranding some expressions of conscience as a threat to national security is central to Xi’s politics. Just as Xu Zhiyong, the champion of citizens’ rights, was about to be arrested, the Party circulated an internal document which became known as the “seven don’t speaks”, outlawing discussion of universal values, press freedom, civil rights and independent courts. “Shoes don’t have to be identical but just to fit the wearer,” Xi told one audience. “The gene of traditional Chinese culture is deeply planted in the mentality of modern Chinese.” He wants his citizens to identify with “the motherland, the Chinese nation or race, Chinese culture, and the Chinese socialist road”. He calls these the “four identifications” and has distilled them into two key slogans - the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese dream. From banners hung above roads and stations, to TV documentaries, online animations and mobile apps, these slogans are everywhere. For centuries China’s emperors strived to balance the principles of hard and soft power - they called it force and virtue - exercising absolute authority over subjects, while acknowledging a duty of care. In celebrating China’s communist history, Xi has been careful to balance reverence for Chairman Mao with equal deference to the economic reformer who succeeded him, Deng Xiaoping. Xi talks about Marxism and he talks about markets. But the essence of his “Chinese dream” slogan is clear - “the dream of a strong nation”. A Beijing billboard advertises the 2017 Communist Party Congress Different dreams - like Xu Zhiyong’s vision of shared civic identity - are dangerous. The activist was released in July after completing his four-year sentence. He has not been contactable since. “It is not possible to pretend that this is just another big player. This is the biggest player in the history of the world.” So said the late Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew of China’s rise. On becoming leader in 2012, Xi set China’s eyes on the prize. By the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party - 2021 - China would become “moderately prosperous”. By the 100th anniversary of the communists coming to power - 2049 - it would be a “fully developed, rich, and powerful” nation. China is on course to become the world's dominant economy China’s economy may soon be 40% larger than that of the US, measured in “purchasing power parity”. By 2049, it may be three times as large. The past four decades have been an extraordinary journey not just for China but for the man who leads it. Xi was still a teenage cave-dweller reading by the light of a kerosene lamp when a US president met Chairman Mao in 1972. Richard Nixon had argued: “Taking the long view, we simply cannot afford to leave China forever outside the family of nations, there to nurture its fantasies, cherish its hates and threaten its neighbours.” Mao meets US President Richard Nixon in 1972 When the door to the West inched open a decade later, some princelings of Xi’s generation took the opportunity to leave. But Xi had already set a different course, and according to the account by his friend in the Wikileaks cable, he knew he would “not be special” outside. Xi is self-assured in encounters with foreigners. He once observed of those who lecture China on human rights: ""There are some bored foreigners, with full stomachs, who have nothing better to do than point fingers at us. “First, China doesn't export revolution; second, China doesn't export hunger and poverty; third, China doesn't come and cause you headaches. What more is there to be said?” The China Xi inherited was ready for a more assertive vision of itself and he has provided it. Fromisland buildingin the contested South China Sea to new multilateral banks and the infrastructure blueprint of theBelt and Road, he has cast off the old maxim that China should hide its strength and bide its time. Xi has also nimbly exploited President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from a major trade agreement and the Paris climate accord to present himself as the statesman of the hour and increase China’s influence in the world. A “whirlwind of charisma” is how a recent TV documentary series described his foreign policy, and to mark his first five years in power, a parallel series charted his campaign against corruption. But if Xi is to achieve his centennial goals, the real challenge still lies ahead. Surface strength hides deep economic problems. Overall growth is slowing and debt mounting. Many economists warn that time is running out for the reforms which might fix China’s problems without a crisis. And behind the firewall’s façade of ideological unity are many competing ideas about China’s future. But the Party has survived many crises in Xi’s lifetime, from Mao’s great famine, to the Cultural Revolution, and the crushing of the 1989 democracy movement. He once said: “A sword is made on a grinding stone and a man is forged in hardship.” Xi’s China has so far married great wealth with great repression. If he continues to cage his tigers, clean up his comrades and silence discordant voices, the existential questions may be for others. Not since Chairman Mao has China’s dream of greatness rested so heavily on one man. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.17811249
"This video can not be played How the wines of Canadian winemaker Norman Hardie are winning fans around the world. With winter temperatures regularly dipping below -25C at his vineyard, winemaker Norman Hardie definitely didn't choose an easy place to grow his grapes. ""Minus 25 is the absolute death knell for vitis vinifera [the common grape vine], we actually have to bury our vines in the winter [to protect them]. It's a huge job,"" says the 51-year-old. ""And then we can get snap spring frosts that can quickly ruin a crop. We lost more than 80% in 2015."" While most of us associate winemaking with warm countries, Mr Hardie has since 2004 been making wine inâ¦ Canada. Norman Hardie Winery is currently continuing with its 2017 harvest Based in picturesque Prince Edward County, Ontario, a two-hour drive east of Toronto alongside Lake Ontario, the summers are more often glorious. The winters, on the other hand, are harsh, which means that the team at Norman Hardie Winery face a race against the cold weather every November. ""I have 80,000 plants today, so that is almost a quarter of a million canes [the vine's branches] that we have to tie down by hand, and then cover with a mound of earth,"" says Norman. ""Before we then carefully open up and untie in the spring."" If that wasn't labour intensive enough, come April and May Norman and his team have to light fires and position wind turbines to try to drive away late frosts. But sometimes, such as in 2015, they just aren't that successful. Norman Hardie says that Canada's cool weather helps him to make excellent wine Up against such challenges, you might question why Norman ever chose to plant vineyards and build a winery in Ontario. He says that despite the challenges, the combination of cool weather and the clay and limestone soil of Prince Edward County allow him to make world class wines. ""The great wines are always made on the edge, and we're certainly on the edge,"" says South African-born Norman, who prior to going into winemaking had been a sommelier (wine waiter) in Toronto. ""I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the world because the flavours we get out of these soils are unique."" While many wine regions around the world have cold winters, they aren't as cold as Canada's Primarily making white wines from chardonnay and red wines from pinot noir, Norman Hardie's wines now have a cult following in Canada, and are even said to be the favourite tipples of Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. But from day one, Norman - who studied winemaking in Burgundy, Oregon, California, South Africa, and New Zealand prior to establishing his own winery - wanted his wines to be sold internationally. This brought his next big challenge - how to persuade a sceptical world to take Canadian wine seriously, when even Norman admits that 30 years ago the country made ""terrible wine"". Canadian wine production remains a drop in the global ocean Norman's solution was to turn himself into a travelling salesman, and build up his wine's global reputation ""one top sommelier one top buyer, and one top wine journalist, at a timeâ¦ flying around the world, pounding the pavement, speaking to people, changing people's ideas about Canada"". So attending wine fairs, visiting wine importers, and knocking on the doors of Michelin-star restaurants, he started to slowly build up export orders. This is the first feature of a new 20-week series called Connected Commerce, which highlights companies around the world that are successfully exporting, and trading beyond their home market. Focusing particularly on the UK and New York, Norman says his personal, face-to-face approach enabled him to let some of the most influential people in the global wine world ""understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, and how we are doing it"". He adds: ""You can only do that with face time, and once you have them they are your evangelists."" From selling 6,000 bottles in 2004, Norman Hardy Winery produced 240,000 in 2016. From that 6,804 bottles were exported across eight countries - China, Denmark, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Taiwan, the UK, and the US. And he still is regularly overseas promoting his wines, including spending five to six days every year in the UK. Back at the winery, there are now six year-round employees, rising to 50 in the busy summer months and at harvest time in late September and October. The business now has annual revenues of 4.1m Canadian dollars ($3.3m; Â£2.5m). John Downes, a London-based wine expert, who has the top master of wine qualification, says that Norman was right to recognise the fact that as Canada is such a little known wine region he had to do a lot of marketing work to ""stand out"" on the global stage. Prince Edward County is now home to 40 wineries Mr Downes adds: ""A lot of people in wine don't tell stories, they say 'here's my wine what do you think about it?'. ""But they don't tell the story behind the wine, and that gives the picture of the wine to the consumer. Norman does that very well."" While exporting wine is not without its challenges, such as the need to produce different labels for each country, Norman says that building up a vibrant export business has also boosted his sales in Canada. Now preparing to bury the vines for another winter, Norman says: ""That credibility, that international credibility, says you're doing something right.""

"Christian Cole was depicted in cartoons during his time at Oxford In a salute to a ""remarkable"" man, the University of Oxford has paid tribute to its first black student. But who was Christian Cole and what was life like for him at a time when being black at the university wasn't merely unusual, but remarkable? Cole was always likely to turn heads when he arrived in Oxford to read classics. It was 1873 and he was a 21-year-old black man from Waterloo, Sierra Leone, studying alongside young men from the elite families of Victorian England (His arrival pre-dated the institution of the university's first women's college by six years.). The city must have appeared a daunting place for Cole, said Dr Robin Darwall-Smith, an archivist at University College Oxford. ""For a lot of people he would have been the first black African they had ever encountered,"" he said. A new plaque honouring Christian Cole can be seen in Logic Lane at University College Even understanding his colleagues might have initially been a challenge for a man used to hearing English in a Sierra Leonean dialect, according to cultural historian Pamela Roberts. The author ofBlack Oxford: The Untold Stories of Oxford University's Black Scholars, she said he could have expected no special treatment. ""This was not a time of affirmative action or quotas,"" she said. Little is known about Cole's early life in Africa, but Ms Roberts suggests a good education and his impressive intellect would have stood him in good stead. Cole was the grandson of a slave and the adopted son of a Church of England minister in Sierra Leone. He had studied at Fourah Bay College in the country's capital, Freetown. It was established by Christian missionaries in 1827 and was known as the ""Athens of West Africa"" because of its academic reputation. Oxford University is working with Target Oxbridge to increase the number of black students Cole was a non-collegiate student at Oxford - to help poorer students who might not be able to afford college fees, it was possible to study without being part of a college at the time. He received an allowance from his uncle to support him, which he supplemented by tutoring and giving music lessons. These extra commitments did not prevent Cole from making an impression on Oxford life, said Dr Darwall-Smith. He spoke at the university's debating society, the Oxford Union, and seems to have been a well-known figure. Cameron attacks race bias in courts and universities Why 14 black male Cambridge students posed for this photo Avoiding eye contact 'everyday racism' When he attended Encaenia, Oxford's honorary degree-giving ceremony and a great social occasion, his presence did not go unnoticed. The Oxford Chronicle recorded there were ""three cheers for Christian Cole"" before the event. ""There would have been these visitors saying, 'gosh, who is that?' 'That is Christian Cole, he's from Sierra Leone.' 'Wow, gosh, how exotic',"" Dr Darwall-Smith said. ""Cole would have known this... but he went along. I admire him for that,"" he added. His presence in Oxford was also documented in cartoons and he is mentioned in the diary of Anna Florence Ward, who describes spotting him on a visit to her brother, who was at Magdalen College, in June 1876. She wrote: ""Saw Christian Cole (Coal?) also"" and then used the N-word in brackets. After leaving Oxford, Cole wrote a pamphlet on the Zulu War Although to modern eyes the diary entry is clearly racist, Dr Darwall-Smith said he felt Cole's contemporaries were ""looking out for him"". He cites as an example an appeal started by students to help Cole financially after his uncle died. It was supported by the master of University College George Bradley and fellow student Herbert Gladstone, the son of four-time prime minister William Ewart Gladstone. Bradley went on to award  Cole membership of University College after he left with his Oxford degree in 1876, and paid his college membership fee for two years. Cole graduated with a fourth-class honours degree in classics, although Dr Darwall-Smith stressed that this was no failure. Teaching for non-collegiate students was not as comprehensive and very few students who did not belong to a college achieved honours degrees in this period. The plaque was commissioned after historian Pamela Roberts suggested the idea as part of a project called Black Oxford Classics was also considered to be the toughest subject at the time. After leaving Oxford, Cole returned to Sierra Leone before coming back to England to join theInner Temple,externalin London, prior to becoming the first black African to practise law in an English court, in 1883. He also published a poem attacking British policy in the Zulu War under the name of a ""A Negro, B.A., of University College"", in 1879. The text was addressed to WE Gladstone MP, who he describes as his ""Master and Father in politics"". Despite his achievements and his status as the university's first black student, Cole's name is not widely known - although that could be something that will one day change. The university has said it is a ""priority"" to broaden the range of people represented by pictures, paintings and plaques around its buildings. Oxford's African Caribbean Society runs an annual conference to encourage state school pupils considering Oxford, which has been supported by grime artist Stormzy It is part of a wider recognition the public perception of Oxford University is that it is a place for wealthy, mostly white, students, something that can deter black and ethnic minority candidates from applying. It is a problem Tobi Thomas recognises. She was the only black undergraduate in her year at Trinity College when she arrived last September. ""There are films like The Riot Club [a depiction of a hedonistic, all-male Oxford University dining society]... I remember talking to friends who said why are you applying?"" she said. Naomi Kellman runs Target Oxbridge, a programme set up to support black students applying to Oxford and Cambridge. She said these narratives can have a ""really big impact"", which is why they introduce potential applicants to black students at Oxford in order to have those ""myths busted"". But how did the story end for the pioneering Christian Cole? Sadly, it appears he struggled to find enough work after becoming a barrister and he moved on to East Africa. Information about his life there is ""very, very patchy"", said Ms Roberts. Cole died in 1885 in Zanzibar of smallpox aged 33. At a plaque unveiling held on Saturday, and timed to coincide with Black History Month, the master of University College Sir Ivor Crewe paid tribute to Cole's ""remarkable achievements"", and said he hoped the plaque would be ""a symbol of our continued commitment to recognising and supporting the brightest students whatever their backgrounds"".

"Let me be the first to make the bad joke, to use the predictable metaphor. There will be a sour mood over the EU summit in the next couple of days, and that's not just because of the problem with the drains that sent toxic fumes into the atmosphere at the summit building forcing the talks back to the old premises next door. (Sorry) It will also be the sense of frustration in the air, maybe even of exasperation, and likely too a whiff of foreboding about the whole situation. On both sides there will be spin. On both sides there is already expectation management. PM offers more assurances to EU citizens Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? Here are a few things, however, that are currently true and will probably still be true by Friday lunchtime, with the slim but real chance of course that it could all get turned upside down. First, the UK-EU talks are significantly behind. The UK hoped that by autumn we'd be able to move onto trade talks properly. That's not going to happen, underlining the change since those heady days when Brexiteers promised it could be straightforward. Second, there is not likely to be any answer to the main bind on Friday. The UK does not want to put any more cash on the table, beyond the 20bn euros implied byMrs May's Florence speech. The strongest voices in the EU, although not every country agrees, think the UK ought to have to wait for the next phase of talks unless it is willing to offer hypothetical extra cash. Whatever else is said or briefed privately, this is the fundamental issue. And until the PM feels she is in a political situation where it's possible and desirable to budge it's hard to see how they will move on as certainly, there is no appetite on the EU side for a shift. Third, something will have gone very badly wrong, however, if there is not a nudge towards moving on. Sources say foreign ministers agreed the draft version of the conclusions of the summit yesterday that are not likely to change much. They don't exactly give a green light to the next phase, but they do at least give a bit of a push in that direction - although not quite as clearly as the UK had hoped. Fourth, the EU is still concerned that the UK government is yet to present a clear picture of what it really wants the long-term relationship to be. And it's still the case, sources tell me, that the full cabinet is yet to have a proper discussion that tries to find that answer. Sounds extraordinary but given how divided the party is, arguably the lack of discussion is what keeps things even vaguely calm. With guns drawn in the Tory party there is no temptation for Theresa May to fire a shot. And there's nothing in the next couple of days, or even the next couple of months, that's likely to change that or to answer that much more fundamental question.

"Jennifer Lawrence speaking at Elle's Women in Hollywood event in Los Angeles Jennifer Lawrence has said she was made to stand in a nude line-up and told to lose weight by film producers at the start of her career. Speaking at Elle's Women in Hollywood event, the 27-year-old said she felt she didn't have any power in the situation as an unknown actress. She said she found that fame protected her from assault as her career went on. ""I will lend my voice to any boy, girl, man or woman who doesn't feel like they can protect themselves"", she added. The actress, who won an Oscar in 2013 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, told the audience about auditioning for a film and being asked by a female producer to stand in a nude line-up. She described the experience as ""degrading and humiliating"", as she was put next to girls she says were thinner than her. Jennifer Lawrence speaking to Laura Dem at the Elle celebration ""When I was much younger and starting out, I was told by producers of a film to lose 15 pounds in two weeks. ""One girl before me had already been fired for not losing the weight fast enough,"" she told an audience including Kristen Stewart, Margot Robbie and Ashley Greene. ""During this time a female producer had me do a nude line-up with about five women who were much, much, thinner than me. We all stood side by side with only tape on covering our privates.""

Lawrence said the producer then told her she should ""use the naked photos"" of herself as ""inspiration"" for her diet. She then went to complain to another producer about being called out over her weight. ""He said he didn't know why everyone thought I was so fat,"" Lawrence told the crowd, adding that he had commented that he thought she was attractive enough to sleep with. The actress said she felt ""trapped"" by the experience and allowed the harassment to happen because she ""didn't want to be a whistleblower"" and thought it was what she had to do to further her career in Hollywood. She told the audience: ""In a dream world, everyone is treated with the exact same level of respect. ""But, until we reach that goal, I will lend my ear. I will lend my voice to any boy, girl, man, or woman who does not feel like they can protect themselves."" Jennifer Lawrence with Harvey Weinstein at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2013 Lawrence's speech comes after the sexual harassment and assault accusations against film producer Harvey Weinstein, which has lead to a growing narrative on the mistreatment of women in the film industry and Hollywood in particular. Lawrence worked with Weinstein on Silver Linings Playbook. She released a statement last week in response, which said: ""This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting. How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Game of Thrones star accuses Weinstein Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories ""I worked with Harvey five years ago and I did not experience any form of harassment personally, nor did I know about any of these allegations."" Lawrence said in her speech it was time for people in Hollywood to ""stop normalising these horrific situations.""

"The number of divorces last year in England and Wales was the highest since 2009, official figures show. There were 106,959 divorces of opposite-sex couples in 2016,external- an increase of 5.8% from 2015. It was the biggest year-on-year rise since 1985, when there was a jump of 10.9%. Of 112 divorces of same-sex couples in 2016, 78% involved female couples. Charity Relate said rising levels of household debt and stagnating wages could be putting a strain on marriages. For those in opposite-sex marriages, the divorce rate was highest for women in their 30s and men aged between 45 and 49. Overall, there were 8.9 divorces per 1,000 married men and women. ONS spokeswoman Nicola Haines said: ""Although the number of divorces of opposite-sex couples in England and Wales increased by 5.8% in 2016 compared with 2015, the number remains 30% lower than the most recent peak in 2003; divorce rates for men and women have seen similar changes."" 2016 was only the second year that same-sex divorces have been possible. Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after? Divorce rate up 'because of recession' The most common reason for divorce was ""unreasonable behaviour"", with 51% of women and 36% of men citing it in their divorce petitions. Unreasonable behaviour can include having a sexual relationship with someone else. Overall, women initiated proceedings in 61% of opposite-sex divorces. Commenting on the figures, Chris Sherwood, chief executive of the relationship support charity Relate, said: ""It is unclear as to why there was a slight increase in divorces in 2016 and as to whether this rise will continue or not. ""We know that money worries are one of the top strains on relationships and it may be that rising levels of household debt and stagnating pay growth could be contributing factors."" However, he stressed that the overall trend over the past few years had been downward. He added: ""Divorce is not something that people tend to take lightly but our research suggests that many people could have saved their marriage and avoided divorce with the right support. ""That is why we would encourage anybody experiencing relationship issues to access support such as counselling at the earliest possible stage."" Reality Check: Are we living happily ever after?

"Mr Neistat suggests YouTube's community of creators acts as a defence against online competitors One of YouTube's most influential vloggers has chastised the service's leaders, claiming they are failing many of their most popular video creators. Specifically,Casey Neistat criticised the way the platform,externalhad made it impossible for some videos to generate advertising revenue, without clearly explaining the rules to its community. One of his own videos - an interview with Indonesia's president - was temporarily ""demonetised"" last week. YouTube has said it is listening. ""We watched Casey's video and appreciate him and the wider community voicing their concerns,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We know this has been a difficult few months, and we're working hard to improve our systems. We're making progress, but we know there is a lot more to do."" Mr Neistat has more than eight million subscribers on YouTube, who have signed up to be alerted when he posts. He has also struck a multi-million-dollar deal to create content for CNN on the platform. He is normally viewed as being one of the leading champions of the site. But in a video posted on Tuesday, he said he felt compelled to speak out because the level of upset among creators posed an ""existential threat to YouTube's entire business"". Mr Neistat's vlog from Indonesia was demonetised until he appealed against the decision The Google division began stripping some videos of adverts earlier in the year after several major brands suspended YouTube campaigns because their marketing clips had been attached to extremist content. To address the problem, YouTube introduced an algorithm that determines which clips are ""family friendly"" and thus allowed to continue making money for their creators. But Mr Neistat said the decision-making process had been badly communicated. ""There are no answers anywhere, and there's no-one telling you what's going on,"" he said. ""The thing that was most troubling for me... was the lack of communication, the lack of transparency on the part of YouTube."" ""People are... putting the same amount of work, the same amount of energy and the same amount of expense into the content they're creating, but now they're getting paid only a fraction of what they did."" A recent decision to demonetise creators' videos about the Las Vegas shootings had caused particular ire, Mr Neistat said, since a video featuring the chat-show host Jimmy Kimmel discussing the same incident had been allowed to continue featuring ads. ""It sort of reeks of hypocrisy, and again the community felt like a second-class citizen,"" he said. As a rule, YouTube prevents adverts from running on videos about tragedies. But this does not apply to clips posted by select partners - including Mr Kimmel's employer, ABC - who are allowed to sell ads themselves rather than relying on Google to do so. A recent clip of Jimmy Kimmel discussing a mass shooting in Las Vegas was allowed to show adverts ""In the specific case of tragedies, like the one in Las Vegas, we are working to not allow such partners to sell against such content,"" a YouTube spokeswoman said last week. ""We have not completed this work yet, but will soon."" Mr Neistat suggested a better alternative would be to give creators more control over whose adverts appeared alongside their clips. The video-maker is far from being the first YouTuber to complain about the issue. But one industry-watcher said his intervention carried weight. ""People look to Casey to be not just an inspiration but also a voice for the community - he's very well respected and people do listen to what he says and follow his lead,"" said Alex Brinnand, editor of TenEighty magazine. ""The fact that he has put out this video... will help ensure his audience is aware of the issue and becomes as equally unhappy as he is."" This video can not be played WATCH: Other YouTubers told the BBC about their frustrations last month Mr Neistat highlighted that Twitter's rival video-based social network, Vine, had collapsed after its managers had disappointed several of its leading clip creators and suggested YouTube could face a similar exodus. ""When you think about Netflix or Amazon or Hulu or any of these other digital distribution platforms right now, they've all got money, they're all willing to spend money, and they're trying to figure out how to diversify their audience,"" he said. He added that Amazon's Twitch service - which currently focuses on video-games-related live feeds - had already tempted some. Twitch began allowing users to upload pre-recorded videos a year ago and may unveil new features at its annual TwitchCon event, which begins on Friday. Amazon paid $970m (Â£736m) to buy Twitch in 2014 However, Mr Brinnand questioned whether the service had done enough to lure away YouTube's biggest names yet. ""For creators like Casey, I don't think at the moment that Twitch is a viable option,"" he said. ""It's a lot more geared to live or as-live content, so doesn't cater to the same audience the vloggers have with their more packaged, produced videos. ""But Twitch has laid the foundations for the future - it already offers very appealing revenue streams - and could be a contender if it develops a stronger platform for standard video.""

"Catherine struggled with depression in the second year of her degree in drama and English literature ""I lost all concept of the future. I felt I was losing control of my mind. 'It was my second year at Manchester University, and early on I began feeling very tired. ""Blood tests showed I was anaemic. ""Towards Christmas, I began feeling very anxious and getting quite stressed over my academic work because I couldn't concentrate in the way I was used to being able to. ""I just thought I had low iron and was a bit stressed. I had never thought about mental illness before. ""At home over Christmas, I had more blood tests, which showed I was physically healthy, but I just felt worse. It was more than just low iron. ""I wasn't just feeling tired. It was feelings of worthlessness. I felt there was no point in anything. I just didn't have any hope at all. ""There were points when I was crying or experiencing a numb feeling, just not feeling anything, which was quite scary because I am quite an emotional person."" ""The thought of doing anything was overwhelming. ""Even showering, brushing my teeth or cooking felt like a mammoth task. ""Some days getting out of bed was really difficult. Some days I stayed in my room all day. I definitely missed some lectures. ""My attendance dropped, but I didn't completely disappear. I never got chucked off the course. I was still just about functioning. ""But I was panicking and crying, everything was too much. I just didn't know what to do. ""I spoke to a friend about that feeling of hopelessness and just wanting to run away from it all. ""I had never had that feeling before. It was quite scary. ""She pushed me to get treatment."" ""I started a journey that was quite difficult. ""Drugs work differently on different people and the first drug made me worse, mainly mentally. ""I felt I was going downhill. ""It was around that point that I wasn't sure if I could finish my degree."" ""Mornings were particularly difficult. I felt I couldn't move. ""The drug was exacerbating what was already there. ""My GP moved me to a different antidepressant, which slowly started to work. ""I was also accessing the university counselling service, which was very helpful. ""And once my academic tutor was aware I was ill, I could go and see her ""I had more relaxed deadlines and access to a study coach, which got set up towards the end of my second year. ""It was a process of getting things in place to make things more manageable."" ""There is a timeliness for different remedies. ""It was the first therapeutic support that was really driving to get you to think about your thoughts and challenge your thoughts. Not all your thoughts are facts."" ""If I think about my mind at the time when depression was invading, it was about feeling worthless, and you can challenge those beliefs. ""I think that it's difficult to pin down exactly why or how, but the medication settled and I began to get better. ""I got through the year and gradually became more myself over the summer. ""The third year was all about rebuilding myself. ""When I wasn't feeling good, the future was quite a difficult thing to visualise. ""So the process of applying for a graduate programme was part of starting to believe in myself again and to feel more confident."" ""I knew mental health social work was challenging, stimulating and varied and I really wanted to do it. ""I think that contributed to my motivation to work hard in my third year at finding what would help me stay well myself. ""I just knew I needed to develop the resilience and coping strategies that would help me stay well and do the programme and become a mental-health social worker. ""It's been really good. It's very intense, as I expected, and I am learning a lot very quickly. It's a lot to take in. ""There's so much variety in what we are doing. I really enjoy it. ""It's really pushing me and challenging me, but there's a lot of support which has really helped me make the most of it and cope with the challenge and pressure of it. ""I always say that I can't regret what happened. ""It totally changed my plan, and I  wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now without that experience. ""I knew I wanted to work with people and had thought about social work generally. ""The experience I had gave me a tiny glimpse into what it means to be mentally distressed. ""It unlocked a level of empathy that I didn't have access to before. ""For me, the thought that I could play a part in someone else's journey is really important to me. It's very rewarding. ""It's connecting and wanting to be part of enabling someone to help themselves and feel well again. ""I am just starting to get my own caseload. Until now, it's been a process of shadowing.

"Kate Cotton (right) and Louise Ferguson (left) pitching to the Dragons in 2013 A self-tanning product launched with the help of investment from the Dragons' Den panel has been found to mislead customers. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found claims by Skinny Tan that its product could ""tone"" or give ""less visible cellulite"" could not be proven. Claims that the product was 100% natural were also found to be misleading. The ASA says the company's adverts must not appear again in their current form. Skinny Tan launched in the UK in 2013, after company founders Louise Ferguson and Kate Cotton appeared on Dragons' Den, winning Â£60,000 of financial backing from panellists Piers Linney and Kelly Hoppen. Dragons Kelly Hoppen (second left) and Piers Linney (second right) invested in the brand The Essex-born entrepreneurs had all five Dragons vying to invest in their business, which claimed it was the first self-tanner made of natural ingredients and could reduce the appearance of cellulite. However beauty rivals PZ Cussons complained to the ASA about adverts appearing on Skinny Tan's website and their Facebook page. The Dragons' Den-backed company had made a number of claims, including that it was the number one self-tanning product in the UK and could ""tone"" women. Despite saying the natural guarana in the product would ""help make cellulite look visibly smoother and less obvious"". the product was not found to have any physiological effects which would achieve this. Skinny Tan, which was bought by beauty giant InnovaDerma in 2015, defended its cellulite-reduction claims, saying it was ""commonly believed that tanning could make you look thinner"". The company said its claims were only in regard to the ""cosmetic effect of the tan"" and not any physiological effects of the product. In addition, Skinny Tan was found to give the misleading impression that it did not contain any of the agent DHA - the main colouring agent in tanning lotions which has a distinctive smell. Skinny Tan claimed without the chemical DHA, their product smelt better than other self-tanning products. But it was found that Skinny Tan contains the same DHA as other brands and smells no different. The claims to be all-natural and the UK's number one self-tanning brand were also found to be misleading by the ASA. InnovaDermaacknowledged,externalthe ASA's ruling, adding: ""This relates to online advertising in 2016 that was subsequently removed and the company is working with the ASA to ensure all online presence is ASA compliant.""

"This video can not be played Congresswoman Frederica Wilson: ""How insensitive can you be?"" US President Donald Trump says a claim that he made insensitive remarks to the recently bereaved widow of a soldier is ""totally fabricated"". Congresswoman Frederica Wilson said he had told Myeshia Johnson: ""He knew what he was signing up for, but I guess it hurts anyway."" The Democratic lawmaker said she was shocked by the alleged comments. Sgt La David Johnson was amongfour US special service soldiers killed in Nigerby Islamist militants this month. Mr Trump had already been criticised for not contacting the families of the dead servicemen right after the fatal ambush on 4 October. Mr Trump has been criticised for the alleged remarks By Anthony Zurcher, senior North America reporter, BBC News In US politics, nothing is off-limits any more. After (inaccurately) swiping at his predecessors for not calling the family members of US soldiers killed in combat, Mr Trump is on the defensive over allegations he mishandled a call with a grieving widow. The accuser is a partisan Democratic congresswoman and the president, not surprisingly, is pushing back hard. This controversy is spiralling towards the gutter. Mr Trump made this bed, however. He was quick to cite the slain son of chief of staff John Kelly to justify his contention that Barack Obama didn't always make phone calls. Then there were the disparaging comments candidate Mr Trump made last summer about the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq. The more this story drags on - and it will drag on - the more damage it could do to a president who wraps himself in the symbols of patriotism and the military, but is in danger of being viewed by the public as lacking empathy when it counts most. An important presidential role is consoler-in-chief during times of tragedy. Successful politicians learn early that they need a human touch. It's a job Mr Trump, the anti-politician, has little experience doing - and it shows. The president tweeted on Wednesday morning: ""Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!"" Allow Twitter content?

Ms Wilson told WPLG,external, a Miami TV station, she had heard the president's ""so insensitive"" remarks to the widow on speakerphone in a limousine. ""Yeah, he [President Trump] said that,"" Ms Wilson said. ""To me, that is something that you can say in a conversation, but you shouldn't say that to a grieving widow. ""And everyone knows when you go to war, you could possibly not come back alive. But you don't remind a grieving widow of that."" Ms Wilson told the Washington Post that Ms Johnson, who is expecting the couple's third child, had broken down in tears after the conversation. ""He made her cry,"" Ms Wilson said. The congresswoman told the newspaper that she had wanted to grab the phone and ""curse him out"", but an army sergeant who was holding the handset would not let her speak to the president. She later responded to Mr Trump's denial bytweeting,external: ""I stand my account of the call with @realDonaldTrump and was not the only one who heard and was dismayed by his insensitive remarks."" And Sgt Johnson's mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson,told the Washington Post newspaper,externalthat President Trump ""did disrespect my son"". She said she was present during the call from the White House on Tuesday, and stood by Ms Wilson's account of the call. Mr Trump has been on the defensive over the deaths in Niger since a reporter asked him at the White House on Monday why he had still not called the families. He provoked fury by falsely claiming that his predecessor, Barack Obama, and other former US presidents had not called the relatives of dead service members. This video can not be played Trump denigrates Obama over false fallen soldier claim Mr Trump also said he had written letters to the families of the four killed in Niger and planned to call them soon. The White House later said the president had spoken to the families but it did not say when. On Tuesday, Mr Trump ratcheted up the row by suggestingthat President Obama had not called the family of Mr Trump's chief of staff, Gen John Kelly, when his son was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. TheAssociated Press says,externalthat like presidents before him, Mr Trump has made personal contact with some families of dead soldiers - but not all. ""What's different is that Trump, alone among them, has picked a political fight over who's done better to honour the war dead and their families,"" the news agency reports. ""He placed himself at the top of this pantheon, boasting Tuesday that 'I think I've called every family of someone who's died' while past presidents didn't place such calls."" This is not the first time Mr Trump has found himself in an imbroglio over US veterans. As presidential candidate, he mocked Senator John McCain for having been captured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.

"The other day I went up to Birmingham to gauge how teenagers are getting their news and, more importantly, whether they can distinguish fact from fiction. It is always dangerous to extrapolate from the specific experience or anecdote to a general view, and smart policy should be based on solid data. Nevertheless, I was alarmed by what we found out, and persuaded that whatever form it might take, news literacy is an area educators will need to think hard about. This video can not be played How hard is it to spot fake news? Amol Rajan meets pupils in Birmingham to find out Fake news is a deceptive problem. For one thing, it spikes around high-profile news events like the election of Donald Trump, and the evidence of its infiltration into British culture is contested. For another, there is a sense in which inflating the threat of fake news is convenient for those who have a stake in its defeat. Ambitious politicians can use the issue of fake news to raise their profile, and show themselves attuned to digital technology. Technology firms can point to their (sometimes unimpressive) response to fake news to display a social conscience. And journalists in established and traditional media can make their own trade, which is under tremendous financial pressure, look noble when juxtaposed with the threat from misinformation online. But there is such a thing as fake news nevertheless, and young people are beginning to wise up to it. The teenagers at Cardinal Wiseman school in Kingstanding, Birmingham, were hugely bright. It is an impressive school, with inspirational teachers and some wonderful pupils. They knew the phrase fake news well, though they didn't associate it particularly with Donald Trump. And they were profoundly sceptical about the news they get from what they didn't quite refer to as the mainstream media. Pupils and staff at Cardinal Wiseman School in Birmingham reveal their concerns to Amol Rajan and cameraman Rob Pettit about fake news and the internet But the most searing takeaway, which all parents of teenagers will relate to, is the sheer volume of information they are deluged with every day. These kids spend hours and hours, and hours and hours, online from morning to night. Leave aside what this does to the wiring of their brains, which is beyond my expertise; it creates such an avalanche of facts, opinions, images and conflicting messages that it is a challenge even for a discerning reporter or a judicious philosopher to know what can and can't be trusted online. We set them a small test, in which they would look at three stories of varying veracity, say whether they were true, false or in between - and why. Watching their brains whirr was thrilling. And in each case they mostly gave wrong answers, ultimately, but for interesting reasons. All the questions that an adult might reasonably have on seeing a news article went through these young minds. Does the headline seem plausible? Do I know the publisher? Is there anything about the presentation of this article that looks suspicious? And so on. The pupils asked all the right questions, but came to all the wrong conclusions, seeing lies where truth resided, and truth where lies ran rampant. I don't for a minute say that young people today are less bright than in yesteryear. But the amount of news and information they are downloading every day is immeasurably higher than a generation ago; and the fact that the internet does contain lots of fake news and other deceptive information - for instance, mash-ups in which voiceover is laid on top of video footage to give a false impression of what someone has said - makes me wonder if teaching news literacy may be worthwhile. Of course, pupils who are good at logic and reasoning, perhaps because they have studied philosophy, will naturally be better at deciphering credible information. But it may be that the viral spread of unreliable sources online, combined with the ultra-addictive nature of smartphones and the amount of time young people are spending online, bolsters the case for a more concerted, nationwide effort to tackle fake news in education. Even if, as I said above, we should be sceptical about fake news itself.

"This video can not be played Justin Trudeau: ""We lost one of the very best of us"" Canadian rock band Tragically Hip's frontman Gord Downie has died following a battle with brain cancer. He was 53. The gifted lyricist - who was dubbed the country's unofficial poet laureate - had been diagnosed with an incurable glioblastoma in May 2016. His family said in a statement he passed away quietly surrounded by friends and relatives. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau led the national mourning for the star with a tearful public statement. The most Canadian band in the world Canada mourns Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie ""He loved every hidden corner, every story, every aspect of this country that he celebrated his whole life,"" Mr Trudeau said, his voice breaking, on Wednesday. ""We are less as a country without Gord Downie in it. We all knew it was coming, but we hoped it was not."" Gord Downie revealed his cancer diagnoses in May 2016 Despite his diagnosis, Downie continued to tour with Tragically Hip and produce music in the last years of his life. He recorded a solo double-album called Introduce Yerself in January 2017, which will be released on 27 October. The band said in a written statement: ""Gord knew this day was coming  - his response was to spend this time as he always had - making music, making memories and expressing deep gratitude to his family and friends for a life well lived, often sealing it with a kiss... on the lips.""

Downie's lyrics often referenced Canadian culture and mythology, which endeared the band to fans who were used to seeing Canadian musicians ""Americanise"" their music to appeal to an international audience. The Tragically Hip's first full-length album, Up to Here, was full of the kinds of blues-tinged party songs like New Orleans is Sinking that helped make the band one of Canada's most in-demand live acts across the country. But it was the band's subsequent albums, infused with obscure references to Canadian history and hockey and experimental song structures like Fireworks and Bobcaygeon that truly defined the sound of the Tragically Hip. The band never made it big in the US - a fact that didn't seemed to bother Downie or his band too much. At home, they regularly sold out stadiums, but south of the border, they could often be found playing small-town bars, mostly filled with Canadian fans who had made the trek just to see them. Far from a sign of failure, their lack of international fame only helped seal their reputation at home as a national treasure. Nine out of the band's 13 studio albums went to number one on Canada's music charts, and all of them cracked the top 10. When news of Downie's death broke, Canadians went online to share their own personal stories about times they had met the singer, or how his music had touched their lives. Allow Twitter content?

Shortly after Downie announced his cancer diagnosis last year, the band went on a sold-out nationwide summer tour, which helped raise C$1m ($800,000; Â£600,000) for brain cancer research. The tour culminated in a final show in Kingston, Ontario, the band's hometown, that was broadcast live across the country. Hundreds of public screenings of the broadcast were held, serving as a kind of living memorial for Downie. In addition to music, Downie was a renowned activist for environmental and indigenous causes. In the final year of his life, he released a solo album and graphic novel titled The Secret Path, inspired by the true story of an indigenous boy who died while trying to escape a residential school. For his work on reconciliation, Downie was awarded an Order of Canada by Mr Trudeau. He was also bestowed an eagle feather by the Assembly of First Nations and an aboriginal name, Wicapi Omani. In Lakota it means ""man who walks among the stars"".

"Moderate drinking by parents can have a negative impact on children, causing anxiety and disrupting bedtime routines, a study says. TheInstitute of Alcohol Studies,externalsaid parents do not have to regularly drink large amounts around children for them to notice changes in adults' behaviour. Three in 10 parents said they have been drunk in front of their children and five in 10 ""tipsy"", its survey found. The institute said it was hoped the study will help inform parents. ""All parents strive to do what's best for their children, so it's important to share this research about the effects drinking can have on parenting, and what steps parents can take to protect their children,"" the institute's chief executive Katherine Brown said. The report, ""Like sugar for adults"", uses a survey of almost 1,000 parents and their children, focus groups and experts. It found that: 29% of parents reported having been drunk in front of their child 51% of parents reported having been tipsy in front of their child 29% of parents thought it was ok to get drunk in front their child as long as it did not happen regularly In the survey, as a result of their parents drinking, 18% of children said they had felt embarrassed, 11% had felt worried and 15% said their bedtime routine had been disrupted. Also, 7% said their parents had argued with them more than usual after drinking and 15% had asked their parents to drink less. The children surveyed who had seen their parent tipsy or drunk were also less likely to consider the way their parent drinks alcohol as providing a positive role model for them. Risk of few drinks in pregnancy reviewed Will alcohol advice help us beat the demon drink? Guide to alcohol drinking limits When mum or dad is an alcoholic The report was launched by MP Caroline Flint, who said: ""We too quickly dismiss parental drinking as harmless fun and relaxation, but this report shows that parents do not need to be regularly drinking large amounts for their children to see a change in their behaviour and experience problems. ""I'd like to see a more open conversation about this, among parents and professionals."" Viv Evans, of the Alcohol and Families Alliance, said: ""We recognise that parenting is difficult and we live in a culture which is remarkably accepting of alcohol. ""We hope that this study goes some way to supporting parents in a difficult job, and alerting us all to the importance of preventing problems with alcohol before they arise."" Alison Douglas, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, called for ""effective action to protect children and families from alcohol that is too cheap, readily available and constantly promoted.""

"This video can not be played How do you avoid holiday traffic jams? The worst traffic jams in the UK left drivers facing up to 15 hours of disruption and tailbacks. A fuel spill, broken down vehicles and an emergency viaduct repair were behind the most severe delays. Traffic analysts Inrix said drivers and businesses lost millions of pounds in wasted fuel and time. They looked at disruption on motorways and A roads between September 2016 and August 2017 and found there were about 3,700 jams a day. The M5 in Somerset saw the longest disruption and biggest tailbacks while three of the top five were on the M6. On 4 August 2017, drivers faced up to 15 hours of traffic jams after two lorries collided and there was a fuel spill, which resulted in the carriageway of the M5 needing to be resurfaced. Inrix said it caused problems for drivers up to 36 miles away. It estimated the cost to the economy of this Somerset disruption as nearly Â£2.4m based on average fuel consumption, the number of people typically in cars and ""assumptions"" about the purpose of people's trips. At the time travel company First Bus said it faced""unprecedented delays""to services in North Somerset. While the worst traffic jams were caused by accidents and other unexpected problems, some roads often get snarled up. According to another Inrix study, drivers lost 73 hours in 2016 to delays along the A406 Northbound from Chiswick Roundabout to Hanger Lane in Ealing, London. The UK's top 10 most congested roads, and the number of hours lost to them, were: A406 Northbound - Chiswick Roundabout to Hanger Lane, London - 73 hours A2 Eastbound - New Cross Gate to Prince Charles Road, London - 62 hours A3211 Eastbound - Westminster Bridge to London Bridge, London - 57 hours A102 Northbound - A2/Kidbrooke to Blackwall Tunnel, London - 51 hours A4200 Southbound - Russell Square to Aldwych, London - 50 hours A1 Southbound - College Gardens to Wallace Park, Belfast - 49 hours A308 Eastbound - Putney Bridge Approach to Sloane Square, London - 46 hours A431 Westbound - Bryants Hill to Lawrence Hill, Bristol - 45 hours A24 Northbound - Ormeau Road to Ann Street, Belfast - 45 hours A6 Northbound - Macclesfield Road to Heaton Lane, Manchester - 44 hours While the M5 saw the worst individual incident, it was the M6 motorway in Cheshire and Lancashire that featured most in the top five. The second worst traffic jam of the year was on the M6 near Warrington on 7 April 2017. Emergency work to repair Thelwall Viadict caused disruption and delays from junction 21 back to junction 16 of the M6. Later in the year, the August bank holiday getaway saw drivers caught in long delays, again on the M6. However, this time it was between Sandbach in Cheshire and Haydock after a ""number of vehicles"" including a lorry broke down. In November 2016, lane closures on the A406W North Circular Road near Wembley in London, led to more than 14 miles of disruption; while alorry fire near Preston,externalin December that same year closed three lanes of the M6 overnight 12/13 December. Even when the fire was out there were still delays because the road needed to be re-surfaced. No-one was injured but there was 10 hours of disruption following a lorry fire on the M6 Graham Cookson, chief economist at Inrix, said: ""While queuing is considered a national pastime for many Brits, nothing is more frustrating than sitting in traffic and it's a costly activity. ""Jams can be caused by all kinds of incidents but fuel spillages, emergency repairs and broken down lorries contributed to the biggest pile-ups this year."" Highways England, which is responsible for motorways and major trunk roads, said 85% of incidents were cleared within an hour. ""We will continue to ensure roads are reopened safely, but as quickly as possible,"" customer service director Mel Clarke said. The list was compiled by taking the duration of the jam and multiplying it by the length of the queue. Delays caused by scheduled roadworks were excluded.

"This video can not be played Congresswoman Frederica Wilson: ""How insensitive can you be?"" US President Donald Trump says a claim that he made insensitive remarks to the recently bereaved widow of a soldier is ""totally fabricated"". Congresswoman Frederica Wilson said he had told Myeshia Johnson: ""He knew what he was signing up for, but I guess it hurts anyway."" The Democratic lawmaker said she was shocked by the alleged comments. Sgt La David Johnson was amongfour US special service soldiers killed in Nigerby Islamist militants this month. Mr Trump had already been criticised for not contacting the families of the dead servicemen right after the fatal ambush on 4 October. Mr Trump has been criticised for the alleged remarks By Anthony Zurcher, senior North America reporter, BBC News In US politics, nothing is off-limits any more. After (inaccurately) swiping at his predecessors for not calling the family members of US soldiers killed in combat, Mr Trump is on the defensive over allegations he mishandled a call with a grieving widow. The accuser is a partisan Democratic congresswoman and the president, not surprisingly, is pushing back hard. This controversy is spiralling towards the gutter. Mr Trump made this bed, however. He was quick to cite the slain son of chief of staff John Kelly to justify his contention that Barack Obama didn't always make phone calls. Then there were the disparaging comments candidate Mr Trump made last summer about the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq. The more this story drags on - and it will drag on - the more damage it could do to a president who wraps himself in the symbols of patriotism and the military, but is in danger of being viewed by the public as lacking empathy when it counts most. An important presidential role is consoler-in-chief during times of tragedy. Successful politicians learn early that they need a human touch. It's a job Mr Trump, the anti-politician, has little experience doing - and it shows. The president tweeted on Wednesday morning: ""Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!"" Allow Twitter content?

""And everyone knows when you go to war, you could possibly not come back alive. But you don't remind a grieving widow of that."" Ms Wilson told the Washington Post that Ms Johnson, who is expecting the couple's third child, had broken down in tears after the conversation. ""He made her cry,"" Ms Wilson said. The congresswoman told the newspaper that she had wanted to grab the phone and ""curse him out"", but an army sergeant who was holding the handset would not let her speak to the president. She later responded to Mr Trump's denial bytweeting,external: ""I stand my account of the call with @realDonaldTrump and was not the only one who heard and was dismayed by his insensitive remarks."" And Sgt Johnson's mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson,told the Washington Post newspaper,externalthat President Trump ""did disrespect my son"". She said she was present during the call from the White House on Tuesday, and stood by Ms Wilson's account of the call. Mr Trump has been on the defensive over the deaths in Niger since a reporter asked him at the White House on Monday why he had still not called the families. He provoked fury by falsely claiming that his predecessor, Barack Obama, and other former US presidents had not called the relatives of dead service members. This video can not be played Trump denigrates Obama over false fallen soldier claim Mr Trump also said he had written letters to the families of the four killed in Niger and planned to call them soon.

"Carrie Fisher hand delivered the ""gift"" to the producer Carrie Fisher once gave a Hollywood producer a cow's tongue after learning he had assaulted her friend. Heather Ross, who works in the film industry, told Fisher about how the unnamed producer sexually assaulted her in his car. Fisher reacted by personally delivering the cow tongue in a Tiffany box wrapped in a bow to his office in Los Angeles. Ross revealed the story onUS radio station, 94.9 MixFM,externalin light of the recent Harvey Weinstein allegations. Ross spoke about how she contacted the producer - who is not Weinstein - to try and be a part of his new project. After meeting up, she says the producer forced himself on her in his car after making an excuse to pull over, then reached over and climbed on top of her. Ross told the radio show she managed to push the producer off her, but as she fled, he said: ""You'll never make a movie in my town and get the F out of my car."" When she told Fisher about what had happened, the late Star Wars actress took matters into her own hands. ""About two weeks later, she sent me a message online and said, 'I just saw [blank] at Sony Studios. I knew he would probably be there, so I went to his office and personally delivered a Tiffany box wrapped with a white bow.'"" Ross continued: ""I asked her what was inside and she said, 'It was a cow tongue from Jerry's Famous Deli in Westwood with a note that said, if you ever touch my darling Heather or any other woman again, the next delivery will be something of yours in a much smaller box!'"" Ross added that knowing the Star Wars actress had her back had left a lasting impression on her. ""It felt validating to know, OK, first of all, this woman who I love as a friend was not just a fake Hollywood friend. That's who Carrie Fisher was. She spoke out and she put things out there in your face,"" she said. Fisher, best known for playing Princess Leia in the Star Wars films,died at the age of 60 in December.

"This video can not be played BBC China editor Carrie Gracie has a look at the Communist Party messages all over Beijing China has entered a ""new era"" where it should ""take centre stage in the world"", President Xi Jinping says. The country's rapid progress under ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"" shows there is ""a new choice for other countries"", he told the Communist Party congress. The closed-door summit determines who rules China and the country's direction for the next term. Mr Xi has been consolidating power and is expected to remain as party chief. A speech that spells power How China's Communist Party picks leaders The rising stars of China's Communist Party The congress, which takes place once every five years, will finish on Tuesday. More than 2,000 delegates are attending the event, which is taking place under tight security. Shortly after the congress ends, the party is expected to unveil the new members of China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, who will steer the country. Mr Xi addressed the delegates at the start of the week-long meeting Listing China's recent achievements in his three-hour speech, Mr Xi said that ""socialism with Chinese characteristics in this new era"" meant China had now ""become a great power in the world"", and had played ""an important role in the history of humankind"". The Chinese model of growth under Communist rule was ""flourishing"", he said, and had given ""a new choice"" to other developing countries. ""It is time for us to take centre stage in the world and to make a greater contribution to humankind,"" he added. Since Mr Xi took power in 2012, China's economy has continued to grow rapidly. But correspondents say the country has also become more authoritarian, with increasing censorship and arrests of lawyers and activists. The human cost of China's economic reforms How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts Analysis by Carrie Gracie, BBC China editor Xi Jinping is a much more assertive leader than his recent predecessors. In a long and confident speech, he looked back on his first five years in office, saying the party had achieved miracles and China's international standing had grown. But the most striking thing in his mission statement was ideological confidence. Recently Party media have talked of crisis and chaos in western democracies compared to strength and unity in China. Today Xi Jinping said he would not copy foreign political systems and that the Communist Party must oppose anything that would undermine its leadership of China. In his speech, Mr Xi also: Described a two-stage plan for China's ""socialist modernisation"" by 2050, which would see it become more ""prosperous and beautiful"" through environmental and economic reforms Warned against separatism - in an apparent reference to movements in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong - and reiterated the government's principle that Taiwan is part of China Said China ""would not close its doors to the world"" and promised to lower barriers for foreign investors He also introduced measures to increase party discipline, and touched on his wide-reaching corruption crackdown that has punished more than a million officials, report BBC correspondents in Beijing.

Beijing is decked out in welcome banners and festive displays for the congress. However, the capital is also on high alert. Long queues were seen earlier this week at railway stations due to additional checks at transport hubs. The congress has also affected businesses, with some restaurants, gyms, nightclubs and karaoke bars reportedly shutting down due to tightened security rules. This video can not be played No hot air balloons, drones, or Airbnb bookings Carrie Gracie: Essays from China The Chinese family in five charts China's military shifts signal bigger changes An austerity drive, instituted by Mr Xi, has meant a more pared down congress, with reports this week of delegates' hotels cutting back on frills such as decorations, free fruit in rooms and lavish meals. Meanwhile, state media have said the Party is expected to rewrite its constitution to include Mr Xi's ""work report"" or political thoughts, which would elevate him to the status of previous Party giants Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. The BBC's profile of Xi Jinping Some see Mr Xi as accruing more power than any leader since Mao, and the congress will be watched closely for clues on how much control now rests in the hands of just one man, says the BBC's John Sudworth. Mr Xi has tightened control within the Party and also in Chinese society, but continues to enjoy widespread support among ordinary citizens.

"This video can not be played Speaking in September 2017, claimants told the BBC about the problems they faced People will be able to call the government's universal credit helpline without being charged, within weeks. Prime Minister Theresa May said she had listened to criticism of the charges, which can be up to 55p a minute, and decided it was ""right"" to drop them. But she again rejected calls by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""pause"" the roll-out of the controversial benefit amid fears it is causing hardship. In a symbolic vote, MPs backed a pause after Tory MPs were told to abstain. The opposition won by 299 votes to 0 with one Conservative - Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston - defying her party by siding with Labour. BBC Parliament Live: As debate happened What is Universal Credit - and what's the problem? Unemployment total drops by 52,000 The outcome is not binding on the government although Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ministers must ""act on the clearly expressed will of Parliament"" and halt its roll out. Commons Speaker John Bercow advised ministers to take account of the vote and ""show respect for the institution"" by indicating what they intended to do. Universal credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into a single payment, is designed to make the system simpler and ensure no-one faces a situation where they would be better off claiming benefits than working. But it has faced a backlash from Tory MPs, who fear payment delays risk pushing families into destitution. Explaining her decision to rebel, Dr Wollaston said the length of time people were waiting to be paid - in many cases more than six weeks - was a ""fundamental flaw"" that must be addressed. She told the BBC she wanted to ""see a much stronger commitment"" from government ""that they'll do that immediately"". At Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mr Corbyn said he was glad the PM had ""bowed to Labour pressure"" by scrapping the hotline charges. This video can not be played Speaker: Don't pretend you didn't lose But he added: ""The fundamental problems of universal credit remain - the six week wait, rising indebtedness, rent arrears and evictions. ""Will the prime minister now pause universal credit and fix the problems before pressing ahead with the roll-out?"" Mrs May prompted cheers from Labour MPs as she began her reply with ""yes"", before urging them to ""listen to the whole sentence I was going to make"". She said universal credit was ""a simpler system"", that ""encourages people to get into the workplace - it is a system that is working because more people are getting into work"". The universal credit hotline will become free to use ""over the next month"", the government has said, and that would be followed by all DWP helplines by the end of the year. The government says it makes no money from the 0345 number. It is charged at local rate and is included as a free call in many landline and mobile phone packages but can cost some mobile phone users as much as 55p a minute. 'I don't even have 4p to my name' 'Selling everything' because of system May urged to halt rollout Universal Credit has been introduced in stages to different groups of claimants over the past four years, with about 610,000 people now receiving it. Almost a quarter of all claimants have had to wait more than six weeks to receive their first payment in full because of errors and problems evidencing claims. But the government recently approved a major extension of the programme to a further 45 job centres across the country, with another 50 to be added each month. This video can not be played The PM appears to give a surprising initial answer when asked to pause the national rollout of universal credit. Labour's Frank Field told MPs a food bank in his Birkenhead constituency needed to order five tonnes of extra food to deal with hardship caused by the roll-out of universal credit over Christmas. He asked Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke if his constituents should ignore the food bank's warnings, or give it extra donations as a result of the minister's ""inability to deliver a scheme that works"". Mr Gauke had earlier accused Labour of attempting to wreck the new benefit rather than taking a constructive approach to reforming it. The SNP's Mhairi Black said the offer of advance payments made matters worse for some claimants because they had to be paid back. She accused the government of acting like a ""pious loan shark - except that instead of coming through your front door they are coming after your mental health, your physical well-being, your stability, your sense of security."" The Department for Work and Pensions says its latest data, from last month, indicates 81% of new claimants were paid in full and on time at the end of their first assessment while 89% received some payment. BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said he understood ministers were giving ""serious thought"" to cutting the initial waiting period for payments from six to four weeks around the time of next month's Budget.

"This video can not be played Congresswoman Frederica Wilson: ""How insensitive can you be?"" US President Donald Trump says a claim that he made insensitive remarks to the recently bereaved widow of a soldier is ""totally fabricated"". Congresswoman Frederica Wilson said he had told Myeshia Johnson: ""He knew what he was signing up for, but I guess it hurts anyway."" The Democratic lawmaker said she was shocked by the alleged comments. Sgt La David Johnson was amongfour US special service soldiers killed in Nigerby Islamist militants this month. Mr Trump had already been criticised for not contacting the families of the dead servicemen right after the fatal ambush on 4 October. Mr Trump has been criticised for the alleged remarks By Anthony Zurcher, senior North America reporter, BBC News In US politics, nothing is off-limits any more. After (inaccurately) swiping at his predecessors for not calling the family members of US soldiers killed in combat, Mr Trump is on the defensive over allegations he mishandled a call with a grieving widow. The accuser is a partisan Democratic congresswoman and the president, not surprisingly, is pushing back hard. This controversy is spiralling towards the gutter. Mr Trump made this bed, however. He was quick to cite the slain son of chief of staff John Kelly to justify his contention that Barack Obama didn't always make phone calls. Then there were the disparaging comments candidate Mr Trump made last summer about the parents of a Muslim-American soldier killed in Iraq. The more this story drags on - and it will drag on - the more damage it could do to a president who wraps himself in the symbols of patriotism and the military, but is in danger of being viewed by the public as lacking empathy when it counts most. An important presidential role is consoler-in-chief during times of tragedy. Successful politicians learn early that they need a human touch. It's a job Mr Trump, the anti-politician, has little experience doing - and it shows. The president tweeted on Wednesday morning: ""Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!"" Allow Twitter content?

"Moderate drinking by parents can have a negative impact on children, causing anxiety and disrupting bedtime routines, a study says. TheInstitute of Alcohol Studies,externalsaid parents do not have to regularly drink large amounts around children for them to notice changes in adults' behaviour. Three in 10 parents said they have been drunk in front of their children and five in 10 ""tipsy"", its survey found. The institute said it was hoped the study will help inform parents. ""All parents strive to do what's best for their children, so it's important to share this research about the effects drinking can have on parenting, and what steps parents can take to protect their children,"" the institute's chief executive Katherine Brown said. The report, ""Like sugar for adults"", uses a survey of almost 1,000 parents and their children, focus groups and experts. It found that: 29% of parents reported having been drunk in front of their child 51% of parents reported having been tipsy in front of their child 29% of parents thought it was ok to get drunk in front their child as long as it did not happen regularly In the survey, as a result of their parents drinking, 18% of children said they had felt embarrassed, 11% had felt worried and 15% said their bedtime routine had been disrupted. Also, 7% said their parents had argued with them more than usual after drinking and 15% had asked their parents to drink less. The children surveyed who had seen their parent tipsy or drunk were also less likely to consider the way their parent drinks alcohol as providing a positive role model for them.

Guide to alcohol drinking limits When mum or dad is an alcoholic The report was launched by MP Caroline Flint, who said: ""We too quickly dismiss parental drinking as harmless fun and relaxation, but this report shows that parents do not need to be regularly drinking large amounts for their children to see a change in their behaviour and experience problems. ""I'd like to see a more open conversation about this, among parents and professionals."" Viv Evans, of the Alcohol and Families Alliance, said: ""We recognise that parenting is difficult and we live in a culture which is remarkably accepting of alcohol. ""We hope that this study goes some way to supporting parents in a difficult job, and alerting us all to the importance of preventing problems with alcohol before they arise.""

"Mr Kelly's son was a Marine who died in Afghanistan in 2010 US President Donald Trump has suggested that President Barack Obama did not call his chief of staff's family when their son was killed in Afghanistan. Mr Trump alluded to General John Kelly's son while defending his claim that his predecessor neglected to call the loved ones of fallen soldiers. Gen Kelly's son, Robert, 29, was a first lieutenant in the Marines when he stepped on a landmine and died in 2010. The president's claim has sparked outrage among Mr Obama's former aides. ""You could ask Gen Kelly, did he get a call from Obama?"" Mr Trump said in an interview with Fox News Radio's Brian Kilmeade on Tuesday. ""I don't know what Obama's policy was. I write letters and I also call,"" he contended, adding that he has called ""virtually everybody"" during his time in office. Gen Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general, has avoided speaking publicly about his son's death, according to US media reports. However, White House visitor logs show Gen Kelly attended a breakfast Mr Obama had hosted for families of those killed in action six months after his son died, theAssociated Press news agency reported.,external The president's remarks came a day after he falsely said that Mr Obama and other presidents did not call the families of soldiers who were killed in action. This video can not be played Trump denigrates Obama over false fallen soldier claim Mr Trump made the claim as he was asked by a reporter at the White House on Monday why he had not yet contacted the families of four US soldiers who were killed in Niger on 4 October.

""I was told that he didn't often, and a lot of presidents don't. They write letters. I do, I do a combination of both."" He said he had written letters to the families and planned to call them soon. Later on Tuesday, the White House said he had spoken to the families, but did not say when. President Trump ""offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their families' extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten,"" said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.

"Paul Stephenson working on his recreation of Warhol's Chairman Mao portrait Is it possible to create new paintings by Andy Warhol, 30 years after his death? Warhol got other people to do most of the work first time around - and now a British artist has recreated some of his most famous works using exactly the same methods and materials. There was a reason Andy Warhol called his legendary 1960s New York studio The Factory. It housed something resembling an assembly line of assistants working on his famous screenprint paintings of icons like Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe and Jackie Kennedy. On occasion, his assistant and his mother even signed the paintings on his behalf. ""I think somebody should be able to do all my paintings for me,""Warhol told interviewer Gene Swenson,externalin 1963. ""I think it would be so great if more people took up silk screens so that no-one would know whether my picture was mine or somebody else's."" Warhol wanted to remove any trace of the artist's hand in his art More than 50 years on, Paul Stephenson has done that - and ignited a debate about what can be done after an artist's death. Stephenson has made new versions of Warhol works by posthumously tracking down the pop artist's original acetates, paints and printer, and recreating the entire process as precisely as possible. Stephenson's project began when he bought 10 original Warhol acetates - the enlarged photographic negatives of those icons that Warhol used to create his screenprints. While Warhol's assistants did many parts of the physical work, the artist, who died in 1987, was the only one who worked directly on these acetates, touching up parts of the portraits to prepare them for printing. Stephenson took the acetates to one of Warhol's original screenprinters in New York, Alexander Heinrici, who offered to help use them to make new paintings. The real deal - this 1973 Warhol of Mao sold for $11m in April Those paintings - of Chairman Mao, Jackie Kennedy, an electric chair and a self-portrait of Warhol himself - are going on show at the Buy Art Fair in Manchester at the end of October. He's titled the series After Warhol. ""I'm not saying they're Warhols,"" Stephenson says. ""It's a forced collaboration because the original author doesn't know anything about it."" He may not claim the new paintings should be considered posthumous Warhols, but Rainer Crone, one of the leading Warhol authorities and the first to catalogue the artist's work, said they could be. Crone died in 2016 but he saw Stephenson's recreations and sent him an email saying ""paintings made with these film positives under described circumstances and executed posthumously by professionals (scholars as well as printers) are authentic Andy Warhol paintings"". Stephenson's paintings are not identical to Warhol's originals, but are near enough. Stephenson has recreated portraits of Jackie Kennedy, Mao and Warhol himself Stephenson says he's simply asking a question: ""If the world-leading Warhol scholar says it's a Warhol, and you do everything in the mechanical process that the original artist did, and the original artist said 'I want other people to make my paintings', which he did - what is it? ""I don't know the answer to that question."" There are other examples of works being made in an artist's name after their death. The estates of Degas and Rodin have made bronze sculptures using their original designs. They are sold as posthumous works, with lower prices to match. The fact the price tags for Paul Stephenson's recreations are missing a few zeroes - they will be on sale for Â£4,000 and Â£10,000 - is proof that he's not expecting anyone to regard them as authentic Warhols. Warhol expert Richard Polsky, who offers a service authenticating Warhol works, says Stephenson's paintings shouldn't be regarded as posthumous Warhols. ""I like the fact that he's honest - he's not claiming Andy made these, he's claiming he made them,"" Polsky says. ""I also notice he's priced them very modestly. All that's good. ""It sounds like he's trying to extend Warhol's career, so to speak, even though he's dead. There's a charm to that, but it just seems so shallow."" There's a key difference between someone else making a Warhol painting in his Factory during his lifetime and someone else making one now, according to Jessica Beck, curator at the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. ""He was always involved in that final product in some way,"" she says, explaining that the artist oversaw everything at the Factory and did get involved in other ways after the inception. ""This idea of taking his screens and recreating new Warhols without being in dialogue with him - obviously, because he's now dead - that's problematic."" But Stephenson's works may still appeal to people who want to impress their friends by appearing to have a Warhol on their wall, but without spending millions. Buy Art Fair runs from 27-29 October in Manchester. A documentary titled Business of Making Art, featuring Paul Stephenson, will be screened at the fair on 28 October.

"UK unemployment fell by 52,000 in the three months to August to 1.4 million, leaving the jobless rate unchanged at 4.3% from the previous quarter. However, pay still failed to keep pace with inflation, with the real value of earnings down 0.3% over the past year. Total earnings, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.1% from June to August, said theOffice for National Statistics.,external The news will increase expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates on 2 November. However, Kathleen Brooks of traders City Index said the Bank faced a tricky decision next month. ""The prospect of raising interest rates when real wages are in negative territory will make this potential hike a tricky one for the Bank to justify,"" she said. The unemployment rate is still at the joint lowest level since 1975, although the claimant count increased by 1,700 to 804,100 last month. The UK's key inflation raterose to 3% in September. There were 32.1 million people in work in the UK in the June to August period, 94,000 more than between March and May and 317,000 more than in the same period in 2016. The employment rate was 75.1%, up from 74.5% a year earlier, while the total number of unemployed people was 215,000 fewer than at the same time last year. Employment Minister Damian Hinds said: ""Our economy is helping to create full-time, permanent jobs which are giving people across the UK the chance of securing a reliable income. ""We've boosted the income for people on the lowest pay by increasing the national living wage and delivered the fastest pay rise for the lowest earners in 20 years."" The female unemployment rate is at a joint record low of 4.2%, while job vacancies have gone up by 3,000 to a 783,000. The number of people classed as economically inactive, including those looking after a sick relative, on long-term sick leave, early retirement or who are not looking for a job, fell by 17,000 to 8.8 million. Commenting on those figures, senior ONS statistician Matt Hughes said: ""Many labour market measures continue to strengthen. Employment growth in the latest three-month period was driven mainly by women, with a corresponding drop in inactivity. Vacancies remain robust, at a near-record level."" Unemployment drops! A record low rate! Earnings shrinking against inflation! Once upon a time, these were all big headlines. But we've become so used to them now, they barely cause a ripple - and that has its own implications for interest rates. The latest numbers reinforce what the new deputy governor of the Bank of England, Dave Ramsden, said on Tuesday: there's little sign of wages picking up in response to higher inflation. Nevertheless, the City remains convinced the official rate will have to rise from its record low of 0.25%. The pattern of trading in interest-rate derivatives - investments that effectively bet on when interest rates will rise or fall - suggests there is an 82% chance that rates will go up to 0.5%. If so, it would be the first rate rise in more than 10 years. We won't have to wait long to find out who's right. Margaret Greenwood, shadow employment minister, expressed her fears at the continuing fall in the real value of wages. She said: ""With a record number of working people living in poverty, the news that real wages have fallen yet again is deeply concerning. ""While the overall increase in employment is welcome, it's also clear from today's figures that too many people are struggling to find employment because of their age, ethnicity, disability, or where they live."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady commented: ""Britain desperately needs a pay rise. Working people are earning less today (in real terms) than a decade ago. ""The chancellor must help struggling families when he gives his Budget next month. This means ditching the artificial pay restrictions on nurses, midwives and other public sector workers. And investing in jobs that people can live on."" Enter your details below. Source: Office for National Statistics. UK inflation at highest since April 2012 How does 3% inflation affect me?

"The performance of hospitals across the UK has slumped with targets for cancer, A&E and planned operations now being missed en masse, BBC research shows. Nationally England, Wales and Northern Ireland have not hit one of their three key targets for 18 months. Only Scotland has had any success in the past 12 months - hitting its A&E target three times. Ministers accepted growing demand had left the NHS struggling to keep up as doctors warned patients were suffering. The findings are being revealed as the BBC launches its online NHS Tracker project, which allows people to see how their local service is performing on three key waiting time targets: Four-hour A&E waits 62-day cancer care Planned operations and treatment  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The BBC has looked at performance nationally as well as locally across the 135 hospital trusts in England and 26 health boards in the rest of the UK. Locally there is just one service in the whole of the UK - run by Luton and Dunstable NHS Trust - which has managed to hit all three targets each time over the past 12 months. Hospital staff the BBC has talked to have described how shortages of doctors and nurses, a lack of money and inadequate room in A&E departments in particular was making it difficult, sometimes impossible, to see patients quickly enough. Does it matter if targets are missed? 'I spent my savings rather than wait' The tale of two hospitals Northern Ireland surgery waits 'can last years' While overall the vast majority of people are still being seen in time, the BBC investigation shows how declining performance is affecting patients. For example, the chances of not being seen in four hours in A&E has actually more than doubled in the past four years, with one in nine patients now waiting longer than that. The BBC research has found: Wales has consistently failed to hit its targets. In 2012-13 it did not hit any of its monthly key hospital targets and in 2016-17 it was the same. The last time a target was achieved nationally was 2010. England has seen the biggest deterioration. In 2012-13 it hit its key hospital targets 86% of the time, but in the last year it has missed every monthly target. Scotland is the only part of the UK to hit its targets during the last 12 months, but has only managed to hit do that three times over the summer in A&E when pressures tend to be at their lowest. Northern Ireland is failing to hit its targets despite making it easier to hit the goal for planned operations and care. Since March 2015 it has gradually reduced the target from 80% to 55% but has still not hit it. The north-east is the top performing region in England. Services have hit their key hospital targets 71% of the time in the past year. Twelve out of 135 English hospital trusts, four out of five Northern Irish health trusts and five out of seven Welsh trusts have failed to hit any target in the past 12 months. Cancer doctor Prof Madhusudan suggests there are not enough staff to see the patients quickly enough Prof Srinivasan Madhusudan, head of cancer at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, which has not hit the cancer target since April 2014, suggested there was simply not enough staff to cope. ""When I get to work I want to treat my patients as soon as I can. So do my colleagues."" But he added there was a limit to what could be done, pointing out there are 5,000 new cases a year at his hospital trust. ""There are only so many patients that you can treat. ""We have a team of 22 fantastic oncologists who are working very hard to do the best they can under what is quite a stressful situation."" Meanwhile, Ali Refson, an A&E consultant at London's Northwick Park hospital, said demand was ""incredibly high"" which meant it was very hard to hit the four-hour target. ""We sometimes feel we can't give the best care. We are working the hardest we can, but we are only human."" Ministers across the UK have been quick to point out that most people are still being seen in time. But the numbers waiting longer for care have been rising. In A&E patients are now twice as likely to wait more than four hours than they were four years ago - 11% compared to 5%. The proportion of people waiting over 62 days for cancer treatment has risen by a third in the past four years. Nearly one in five patients now wait longer. The chances of delays before you have a planned operation or treatment, such as a hip replacement, has increased by nearly three-quarters in four years. Currently 12% of patients wait longer than they should. It means there are now over 500,000 people on hospital waiting lists in England, Wales and Northern Ireland that have waited too long. That compares to nearly 230,000 four years ago. British Medical Association chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said the situation highlighted by the BBC was ""unacceptable"". He said while for some patients the delays were simply an ""inconvenience"", for many more they would have a ""real impact on their treatment and outcome"". Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said record levels of investment were being put into the health service in Scotland. She said efforts were being made to ""shift the balance of care away from hospitals"" and into the community that should make it easier to hit the targets. And she added a ministerial working group had been established to improve cancer care. A spokesman for the Department of Health in England said more money was being spent on services, and said despite the longer waiting times the majority of hospitals were still providing good or outstanding care, according to inspectors. And he pointed out that because of the ageing population ""health systems worldwide face similar pressures"". A Welsh government spokesman acknowledged some people were waiting ""too long"", but pointed to the rising demand being faced. The number of A&E visits made each year across the UK has risen by a fifth in four years to top 30 million, while the number of cancer cases has risen by more than a quarter to top 170,000. Nonetheless, Labour's shadow health secretary in England, John Ashworth, called the decline in performance ""staggering"". Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, said it was time to consider whether these targets were still achievable unless more money was provided. ""It's time for an honest debate about what we can realistically expect the health service to deliver in such difficult circumstances.""

"A drug to dramatically cut the risk of HIV infection during sex would save the UK around Â£1bn over the next 80 years, say scientists. The team at University College London says Prep, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a ""no-brainer"" for the NHS. The study predicts that giving Prep to men who have sex with men would prevent one in four HIV cases. NHS England is currently funding a trial of Prep in 10,000 patients, but does not offer the treatment routinely. Prep is alreadyavailable in Scotland. The health service in Englandfought against paying for Prep in the courts, but agreed to trialling it in selected clinics. This video can not be played How taking pre-exposure drugs revolutionised one gay man's relationship with sex Prep disables HIV before it gets a stranglehold in the body and trials show it can cut the risk of being infectedby up to 86%.,external The financial analysis,published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases,external, looked at the cost-effectiveness of a national roll-out of Prep, focusing on the highest risk group - men who have sex with men. It showed offering Prep would cost the NHS money initially as it paid for both Prep and lifelong care for people already infected with HIV. It could take up to 40 years to become cost-effective, when savings from the falling number of new HIV cases equal the cost of Prep. Eventually, after 80 years, the pills would deliver a saving of Â£1bn, say the researchers. Dr Alison Rodger, part of the UCL team, told the BBC: ""Not only is it a highly effective treatment, it will save money. It's a no-brainer so it's a good thing to do."" The researchers' mathematical model predicted: In the first year Prep was available, 4,000 men would start taking it, rising to 40,000 within 15 years Men would take Prep for 4.5 years on average Men would take two pills before sex, followed by one-a-day until they had gone two days without condom-less sex Men would average five pills a week It is still cost-effective with a daily Prep pill, but it takes longer to become cost-effective. Both options are being investigated as part of the NHS England trial. The other major unknown is the long-term cost of the drugs, which may fall as cheaper alternatives become available. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""It is important that all who need Prep can access it, and evidence like this reinforces the need for Prep to be fully commissioned and given a long-term, sustainable home on the NHS in England."" Dr Paul Revill, from the centre of health economics at the University of York, said the NHS needed to be ""far sighted [and] invest now and reap long-term gains"". He added: ""With a combination of frequent HIV testing, immediate treatment, and Prep availability, there is now the prospect of bending the curve of new HIV infections downwards in a way that did not seem feasible just a few years ago."" A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""The Lancet study makes an important contribution to the growing evidence for cost effectiveness of Prep, highlighting the factors which will determine this, such as price and duration on Prep.""

"Catherine struggled with depression in the second year of her degree in drama and English literature ""I lost all concept of the future. I felt I was losing control of my mind.

"A woman (middle) travelling from Jordan on a Yemeni passport arrives in Los Angeles, California US President Donald Trump's latest bid to impose travel restrictions on citizens from eight countries entering the US has suffered a court defeat. A federal judge slapped a temporary restraining order on the open-ended ban before it could take effect this week. The policy targets Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea, as well as some Venezuelan officials. Previous iterations of the ban targeted six Muslim-majority countries, and were widely referred to as a ""Muslim ban"". The state of Hawaii sued in Honolulu to block Mr Trump's third version, which was set to go into effect early on Wednesday. Hawaii argued in court documents that the revised policy was fulfilling Mr Trump's campaign promise for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States"", despite the addition of North Korea and Venezuela. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' It also argued the president did not have the powers under federal immigration law to impose such restrictions. US District Judge Derrick Watson, who blocked Mr Trump's last travel ban in March, issued the new restraining order. The president's controversial travel bans have each been frustrated by the courts to some degree: In January, the president signed an order banning people from seven Muslim-majority countries and suspending all refugee entry. The measure prompted protests and legal challenges across dozens of states A revised version exempted green card holders and dual citizens. By June, the Supreme Court allowed most of it to go into effect - butgranted a wide exemption for thosewith a ""bona fide connection"" to the US That was replaced by Mr Trump's latest order,announced in late September, which changed the criteria and added non-Muslim-majority nations North Korea and Venezuela. In Hawaii, Judge Watson decided that the new policy ""suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor"". He said ""it lacks sufficient findings that the entry of more than 150 million nationals from six [of the] specified countries would be 'detrimental to the interests of the United States'"". His decision temporarily blocks the ban on all targeted countries except North Korea and Venezuela. The ban is also facing court challenges from Maryland, Washington state, Massachusetts, California, Oregon and New York. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement the latest court order was ""dangerously flawed"" and ""undercuts"" efforts to keep Americans safe. ""These restrictions are vital to ensuring that foreign nations comply with the minimum security standards required for the integrity of our immigration system and the security of our nation,"" she said. She said the White House was confident the president's ""lawful and necessary action"" would eventually be upheld by the courts. As it stands, the Supreme Court has delayed its consideration of the case from October, asking all parties to resubmit briefs to the court accounting for the changes made between the second and third versions of the order.

"A drug to dramatically cut the risk of HIV infection during sex would save the UK around Â£1bn over the next 80 years, say scientists. The team at University College London says Prep, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a ""no-brainer"" for the NHS. The study predicts that giving Prep to men who have sex with men would prevent one in four HIV cases. NHS England is currently funding a trial of Prep in 10,000 patients, but does not offer the treatment routinely. Prep is alreadyavailable in Scotland. The health service in Englandfought against paying for Prep in the courts, but agreed to trialling it in selected clinics. This video can not be played How taking pre-exposure drugs revolutionised one gay man's relationship with sex Prep disables HIV before it gets a stranglehold in the body and trials show it can cut the risk of being infectedby up to 86%.,external The financial analysis,published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases,external, looked at the cost-effectiveness of a national roll-out of Prep, focusing on the highest risk group - men who have sex with men. It showed offering Prep would cost the NHS money initially as it paid for both Prep and lifelong care for people already infected with HIV. It could take up to 40 years to become cost-effective, when savings from the falling number of new HIV cases equal the cost of Prep. Eventually, after 80 years, the pills would deliver a saving of Â£1bn, say the researchers. Dr Alison Rodger, part of the UCL team, told the BBC: ""Not only is it a highly effective treatment, it will save money. It's a no-brainer so it's a good thing to do."" The researchers' mathematical model predicted: In the first year Prep was available, 4,000 men would start taking it, rising to 40,000 within 15 years Men would take Prep for 4.5 years on average Men would take two pills before sex, followed by one-a-day until they had gone two days without condom-less sex Men would average five pills a week It is still cost-effective with a daily Prep pill, but it takes longer to become cost-effective. Both options are being investigated as part of the NHS England trial. The other major unknown is the long-term cost of the drugs, which may fall as cheaper alternatives become available. Dr Michael Brady, medical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ""It is important that all who need Prep can access it, and evidence like this reinforces the need for Prep to be fully commissioned and given a long-term, sustainable home on the NHS in England."" Dr Paul Revill, from the centre of health economics at the University of York, said the NHS needed to be ""far sighted [and] invest now and reap long-term gains"". He added: ""With a combination of frequent HIV testing, immediate treatment, and Prep availability, there is now the prospect of bending the curve of new HIV infections downwards in a way that did not seem feasible just a few years ago."" A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""The Lancet study makes an important contribution to the growing evidence for cost effectiveness of Prep, highlighting the factors which will determine this, such as price and duration on Prep.""

"This video can not be played Speaking in September 2017, claimants told the BBC about the problems they faced People will be able to call the government's universal credit helpline without being charged, within weeks. Prime Minister Theresa May said she had listened to criticism of the charges, which can be up to 55p a minute, and decided it was ""right"" to drop them. But she again rejected calls by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to ""pause"" the roll-out of the controversial benefit amid fears it is causing hardship. In a symbolic vote, MPs backed a pause after Tory MPs were told to abstain. The opposition won by 299 votes to 0 with one Conservative - Totnes MP Sarah Wollaston - defying her party by siding with Labour. BBC Parliament Live: As debate happened What is Universal Credit - and what's the problem? Unemployment total drops by 52,000 The outcome is not binding on the government although Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said ministers must ""act on the clearly expressed will of Parliament"" and halt its roll out. Commons Speaker John Bercow advised ministers to take account of the vote and ""show respect for the institution"" by indicating what they intended to do. Universal credit, which rolls six working-age benefits into a single payment, is designed to make the system simpler and ensure no-one faces a situation where they would be better off claiming benefits than working. But it has faced a backlash from Tory MPs, who fear payment delays risk pushing families into destitution. Explaining her decision to rebel, Dr Wollaston said the length of time people were waiting to be paid - in many cases more than six weeks - was a ""fundamental flaw"" that must be addressed. She told the BBC she wanted to ""see a much stronger commitment"" from government ""that they'll do that immediately"". At Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mr Corbyn said he was glad the PM had ""bowed to Labour pressure"" by scrapping the hotline charges. This video can not be played Speaker: Don't pretend you didn't lose But he added: ""The fundamental problems of universal credit remain - the six week wait, rising indebtedness, rent arrears and evictions. ""Will the prime minister now pause universal credit and fix the problems before pressing ahead with the roll-out?"" Mrs May prompted cheers from Labour MPs as she began her reply with ""yes"", before urging them to ""listen to the whole sentence I was going to make"". She said universal credit was ""a simpler system"", that ""encourages people to get into the workplace - it is a system that is working because more people are getting into work"". The universal credit hotline will become free to use ""over the next month"", the government has said, and that would be followed by all DWP helplines by the end of the year. The government says it makes no money from the 0345 number. It is charged at local rate and is included as a free call in many landline and mobile phone packages but can cost some mobile phone users as much as 55p a minute. 'I don't even have 4p to my name' 'Selling everything' because of system May urged to halt rollout Universal Credit has been introduced in stages to different groups of claimants over the past four years, with about 610,000 people now receiving it. Almost a quarter of all claimants have had to wait more than six weeks to receive their first payment in full because of errors and problems evidencing claims. But the government recently approved a major extension of the programme to a further 45 job centres across the country, with another 50 to be added each month. This video can not be played The PM appears to give a surprising initial answer when asked to pause the national rollout of universal credit. Labour's Frank Field told MPs a food bank in his Birkenhead constituency needed to order five tonnes of extra food to deal with hardship caused by the roll-out of universal credit over Christmas. He asked Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke if his constituents should ignore the food bank's warnings, or give it extra donations as a result of the minister's ""inability to deliver a scheme that works"". Mr Gauke had earlier accused Labour of attempting to wreck the new benefit rather than taking a constructive approach to reforming it. The SNP's Mhairi Black said the offer of advance payments made matters worse for some claimants because they had to be paid back. She accused the government of acting like a ""pious loan shark - except that instead of coming through your front door they are coming after your mental health, your physical well-being, your stability, your sense of security."" The Department for Work and Pensions says its latest data, from last month, indicates 81% of new claimants were paid in full and on time at the end of their first assessment while 89% received some payment. BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said he understood ministers were giving ""serious thought"" to cutting the initial waiting period for payments from six to four weeks around the time of next month's Budget.

"This video can not be played BBC China editor Carrie Gracie has a look at the Communist Party messages all over Beijing China has entered a ""new era"" where it should ""take centre stage in the world"", President Xi Jinping says. The country's rapid progress under ""socialism with Chinese characteristics"" shows there is ""a new choice for other countries"", he told the Communist Party congress. The closed-door summit determines who rules China and the country's direction for the next term. Mr Xi has been consolidating power and is expected to remain as party chief. A speech that spells power How China's Communist Party picks leaders The rising stars of China's Communist Party The congress, which takes place once every five years, will finish on Tuesday. More than 2,000 delegates are attending the event, which is taking place under tight security. Shortly after the congress ends, the party is expected to unveil the new members of China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee, who will steer the country. Mr Xi addressed the delegates at the start of the week-long meeting Listing China's recent achievements in his three-hour speech, Mr Xi said that ""socialism with Chinese characteristics in this new era"" meant China had now ""become a great power in the world"", and had played ""an important role in the history of humankind"". The Chinese model of growth under Communist rule was ""flourishing"", he said, and had given ""a new choice"" to other developing countries. ""It is time for us to take centre stage in the world and to make a greater contribution to humankind,"" he added. Since Mr Xi took power in 2012, China's economy has continued to grow rapidly. But correspondents say the country has also become more authoritarian, with increasing censorship and arrests of lawyers and activists. The human cost of China's economic reforms How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts Analysis by Carrie Gracie, BBC China editor Xi Jinping is a much more assertive leader than his recent predecessors. In a long and confident speech, he looked back on his first five years in office, saying the party had achieved miracles and China's international standing had grown. But the most striking thing in his mission statement was ideological confidence. Recently Party media have talked of crisis and chaos in western democracies compared to strength and unity in China. Today Xi Jinping said he would not copy foreign political systems and that the Communist Party must oppose anything that would undermine its leadership of China. In his speech, Mr Xi also: Described a two-stage plan for China's ""socialist modernisation"" by 2050, which would see it become more ""prosperous and beautiful"" through environmental and economic reforms Warned against separatism - in an apparent reference to movements in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong - and reiterated the government's principle that Taiwan is part of China Said China ""would not close its doors to the world"" and promised to lower barriers for foreign investors He also introduced measures to increase party discipline, and touched on his wide-reaching corruption crackdown that has punished more than a million officials, report BBC correspondents in Beijing.

Beijing is decked out in welcome banners and festive displays for the congress. However, the capital is also on high alert. Long queues were seen earlier this week at railway stations due to additional checks at transport hubs. The congress has also affected businesses, with some restaurants, gyms, nightclubs and karaoke bars reportedly shutting down due to tightened security rules. This video can not be played No hot air balloons, drones, or Airbnb bookings Carrie Gracie: Essays from China The Chinese family in five charts China's military shifts signal bigger changes An austerity drive, instituted by Mr Xi, has meant a more pared down congress, with reports this week of delegates' hotels cutting back on frills such as decorations, free fruit in rooms and lavish meals. Meanwhile, state media have said the Party is expected to rewrite its constitution to include Mr Xi's ""work report"" or political thoughts, which would elevate him to the status of previous Party giants Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. The BBC's profile of Xi Jinping Some see Mr Xi as accruing more power than any leader since Mao, and the congress will be watched closely for clues on how much control now rests in the hands of just one man, says the BBC's John Sudworth. Mr Xi has tightened control within the Party and also in Chinese society, but continues to enjoy widespread support among ordinary citizens.

"Actress Marie Trintignant pictured on the set of French TV series Colette, less than a month before she was killed A leading French music magazine has responded to criticism for making a rock star who killed his girlfriend its cover star. Les Inrockuptibles placed Bertrand Cantat, who beat actress Marie Trintignant to death in 2003, on its front page last week. In a statement, it said its choice was ""debatable"", and expressed ""sincere regrets"" to ""those who felt hurt"". France's Elle magazine responded with an editorial tribute to Ms Trintignant. Under the headline ""In the name of Marie"", it said its words were for ""all women victims of violence"" carried out by men. Cantat, who was released from prison in 2007, is trying to relaunch his music career with a new solo album. Les Inrockuptibles said it had been covering Cantat since the 1980s and its history was built on his old band, Noir Desir. It justified its coverage by saying the article tackled controversial issues, such as ""Did Cantat have the right to a public life after having killed Marie Trintignant with his fists?"" French killer Bertrand Cantat's controversial comeback France plans law on street harassment The magazine said it had received many complaints.

The controversy coincided with the Harvey Weinstein scandal, which has seen the US producer accused of multiple assaults against women and which has also provoked a big reaction in France. On Monday, Gender Equality Minister MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa set out plans for new laws to crack down on sexual violence. She said a taskforce of politicians would work with police and magistrates to establish what sort of behaviour constituted sexual harassment. Cantat, who was convicted of beating Marie Trintignant to death in 2003, returned to music in 2013 ""The idea is that society as a whole redefines what it is acceptable or not,"" she told La Croix newspaper. French Twitter users have also been using #balancetonporc, meaning ""rat on your dirty old man"", to encourage women to name and shame their attackers. First Lady Brigitte Macron has praised women for ""breaking the silence"".
