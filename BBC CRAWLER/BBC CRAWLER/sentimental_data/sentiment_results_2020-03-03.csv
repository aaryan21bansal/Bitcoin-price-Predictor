"Facebook is reportedly rethinking its plans for its own digital currency after resistance from regulators. It is now considering a system with digital versions of established currencies, including the dollar and the Euro, according to Bloomberg and tech site The Information. The Libra Association, which Facebook founded to create the currency, will continue its work, the reports said. The plan will include Libra, the company said in response. The social network's digital wallet is now expected to launch this autumn, several months later than initially planned, according to the reports. Of earlier reports that it might drop Libra itself, the firm said: ""Facebook remains fully committed to the project."" Facebook announced in June last year that it would launch the Libra digital currency, with a goal of making payments easier and cheaper. Its partners in the Libra Association include Lyft, Spotify, Shopify, but several other high-profile members such as Visa left after the idea was criticised by authorities. Dante Disparte, head of Policy and Communications at the Libra Association said: ""The Libra Association has not altered its goal of building a regulatory compliant global payment network, and the basic design principles that support that goal have not been changed nor has the potential for this network to foster future innovation."" In October, the world's biggest economies warned cryptocurrencies such as Libra pose a risk to the global financial system. France has said it threatens the ""monetary sovereignty""of governments; others have warned it could be abused for money laundering and other nefarious purposes.

"This video can not be played The flaring was clearly visible from Cowdenbeath More unplanned flaring is being carried out at the Mossmorran petrochemical plant in Fife after a problem with a major compressor at the site. The environmental watchdog Sepa was alerted by site operator ExxonMobil just before 15:00. Residents, who have repeatedly complained about flaring incidents, said flames were visible from Edinburgh and as far away as Dundee. Production at the plant only resumed on 21 Februaryafter a temporary shutdown. The site was closed for five months from last August after it suffered two boiler explosions. ExxonMobil said it was ""progressing with the steps required to re-start the machine"" but could not say when that would happen. A company statement said: ""To keep the rest of the plant running and reduce total duration of flaring, we safely manage this process through the use of our elevated flare. ""We are taking actions to reduce the size of the flare during this work, including maximising the use of ground flares. ""We apologise for any inconvenience to our local communities."" Exxonmobil's ethylene plant at Mossmorran was shut down for five months last August Local campaigners said ExxonMobil's response to the latest incident ""explained nothing"". Linda Holt, of the Mossmorran Action Group said, ""Once again ExxonMobil is forced to resort to emergency flaring because something has gone badly wrong. ""As the ground shakes, and a huge bright flame amid clouds of black smoke looms over communities, they are expected to suffer in ignorance. ""Reassurances that the plant is 'safe' do not wash."" Sepa said initial reports suggested elevated flaring may continue overnight. Walkout at chemical plant over working conditions Pollution monitors fail around chemical plant Production resumes at flare row chemical plant Chris Dailly, Sepa's head of environmental performance, said: ""Having been clear that flaring must become the exception rather than routine, we're disappointed that (it) has occurred again so soon after the restart. ""We expect the company to provide timely updates to the community."" ExxonMobil shares the Mossmorran site with Shell's Fife Natural Gas Liquids plant. In February, about 200 workers at the sitestaged an unofficial walkoutover safety, working conditions and pay.

"Results roll in for Super Tuesday, the biggest day yet in the race for the White House Democrats in 14 states chose candidates to run against Trump in November's election Joe Biden wins eight states to become front-runner Early leader Bernie Sanders wins three states, still doing well Contests still close in biggest states California and Texas Mike Bloomberg performs poorly - but could do well in California Max Matza, Roland Hughes, Ritu Prasad, Helier Cheung and Holly Honderich This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're wrapping our live coverage of Super Tuesday, now it is Wednesday on the US east coast. It's been a fascinating few hours in the race to decide which Democrat will take on Donald Trump in November's election. Here are the main takeaways:  You can follow the latest with our up-to-date news storyhere, and you can read who the winners and losers werehere- thanks for following. It's almost 01:30 here in Washington, and the picture is starting to become a little clearer. But here are a few things wedon'tknow after Super Tuesday: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden came into Super Tuesday hoping his momentum from a
surprisingly big South Carolina win would translate into success in some of the
state and allow him to keep within sight of Bernie Sanders in the delegate
count. By that metric, his evening succeeded beyond his best expectations. Bidenâs support among black voters, which was on display in South Carolina,
was replicated across the south, in states like North Carolina, Virginia and
Alabama, where he consistently won about 60%. It also helped offset Bernie
Sanders's strength with Hispanic voters in Texas. Tuesday night was a celebration for Biden. Now the hard work begins. He is in for a state-by-state slog against Sanders that could stretch all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July. Heâll have to fundraise furiously and organise rapidly to make up for the Vermont senatorâs advantages. Meanwhile, Republicans are going to start training their fire on him - again. If he ends up winning the nomination, after being left for dead just a few weeks ago, he will have earned it. The state with the most at stake for the candidates is also the one that's most uncertain right now. California has a cool 415 delegates to dole out, but its size also means counting millions of votes could take quite a while - possibly weeks. About 30% of precincts have reported their results, and there are still thousands of mail-in votes to look at. In addition, local media report people are still waiting in long lines to cast their ballots even though polls closed nearly two hours ago. But the Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders. The New York Times has forecasted it's ""pretty likely"" Sanders who will take home the California haul. Bloomberg has also been doing well in California, overtaking Biden for the second-place spot. A reminder: you need 1,991 delegates total to win the Democratic nomination. Winning most delegates here will help, a lot, but it still won't make you the candidate. Here are where things stand right now when it comes to the all-important delegates that candidates have won. (These are assigned according to how well candidates have performed): Some caveats: we don't have the results from the two biggest states Texas (where Joe Biden is building up a lead) or California (where Sanders is leading Bloomberg). This picture could change quite a lot over the coming hours, and Sanders could pull closer to the former vice-president. Michael Bloomberg has said he will be re-evaluating his campaign following tonight's results. His only win was the US territory of American Samoa, but early polls in California and Texas have shown him in second and third place, respectively. Good results in these two states could get him closer to the front-runners. The BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says the former New York mayor could have an impact on this race depending on what he decides to do with his campaign machine. ""Whether Michael Bloomberg decides to use this machine he's built up and turn it to say, support Joe Biden going forward, or whoever the Democratic nominee is in November, that's an open question,"" he says. ""I think Joe Biden and his supporters have a very real interest in what Michael Bloomberg does from here on out...even if he doesn't have quite the same amount of support he did just a few days ago."" If Bloomberg pours money into states like Michigan and Florida, for example, he could be drawing votes away from Biden. Comedy actor Keegan-Michael Key, who once portrayed former President Obama's ""anger translator"" in a sketch, is once again pretending to be Biden's old boss. Allow Twitter content?

You can take our own celebrity endorsement quiz to see if you can match the A-lister to the candidatehere. There's a lot at stake in the country's second-most populous state. Before Tuesday, it looked like Bernie Sanders would win there fairly comfortably, thanks partly to his support among Latino voters. That hasn't proven to be the case. With 61% of results in, Joe Biden has now edged into the lead. It's still very close though. There are 228 delegates available here - they may end up being shared fairly evenly between Sanders and Biden. The BBC's Katty Kay points out, Biden's many wins could be thanks to issues of tone and civility. ""It's not just this concept of civility, it's actually the words people use about each other,"" she says. ""And Joe Biden, I think, appeals to people who might be looking for that in this country."" Perhaps in particular to women, she adds, who are looking for the political landscape to be ""less aggressive, less combative"". It's no longer Super Tuesday here on the east coast of the US, it's now less-super Wednesday. As we continue to await results from California, Texas and Maine, here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's big vote. 1) A new front-runner? Former vice-president Joe Biden's campaign was drying up until he won South Carolina on Saturday. That momentum has continued, with projected wins in eight states on Super Tuesday so far. 2) Biden's Southern base comes out African-American voters were a big part of Biden's wins in the South. He won the majority of black voters in these states, proving his campaign's claim that he has a strong base among southern Democrats. 3) But Bernie's still in Biden may have taken up his front-runner position once more, but Sanders could still unseat him. Sanders has been winning big among young voters and Latino voters. Latino voters, in particular, are a key demographic in the big-win states of California and Texas that are still up for grabs (it's stillincrediblyclose between Sanders and Biden in Texas). 4) A bad night for Bloomberg and Warren It has been a poor showing for both Michael Bloomberg (who has spent over $400m on his campaign) and Elizabeth Warren - who lost her home state (Massachusetts) and birth state (Oklahoma). In Massachusetts, women opted for Biden over her by a big margin. Katty KayWorld News America presenter One voter and dog line up to vote in Oklahoma City on Tuesday When it comes to Democrats and American politics, Oklahoma
isnât the first state you think of. Solidly Republican, the heartland state
doesnât feature in the Democratic story in presidential elections. But tonight,
true-red Oklahoma is telling an interesting tale about the state of the
Democratic race. In the 2016 Democratic primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders
beat Hillary Clinton to win Oklahoma by 10 percentage points. Four years ago
Sanders was seen as the anti-Clinton vote. He was the person Democrats
rallied around if they didnât want to hand the nomination to the establishment
candidate. Tonight Oklahoma tells a different story. Joe Biden has beaten Bernie Sanders. In 2020, Joe Biden has
become the anti-Sanders vote. For all those Democrats who donât
want a nominee from the left of the party, Biden is the guy. Not only is he the
anti-Sanders candidate, heâs also the anti-Trump candidate. For Democratic
voters for whom beating Trump is the number one goal, Biden, not Sanders looks
like the most viable candidate. As rumours fly that Michael Bloomberg may drop out on Wednesday, let's take a look at what his nearly half billion dollars of personal campaign contributions could have bought. The billionaire ex-New York City mayor is the ninth richest man in the world, and has spent $464m on his campaign so far, according to federal campaign filings. For that money he could have: Democrats aren't the only ones hosting primaries on Super Tuesday - Republicans have had their say too. Technically, the president isn't running uncontested for the Republican nomination. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld is also on the ballot, but his candidacy is a long-shot, as a brief scroll through Trump's Twitter feed shows. Without calling each other out by name, both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have criticised each other. Watch as they trade political blows - over the Iraq War and general election electability - in their speeches tonight. This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're still waiting for projections for three states: massive Texas and California, as well as tiny Maine. And we're still awaiting the full results in almost every state. Remember, the aim for all candidates is to win1,991 delegates, a different amount of which are awarded in each state, and according to how well each candidate has performed. With that target in mind, this is how many delegates each candidate has so far:  We are a long, long way away from this being resolved. Voters line up outside a library in Burbank, California The Bernie Sanders campaign is asking a judge to grant an emergency injunction to keep polling stations open in Los Angeles county due what they describe as long queues of waiting voters. Voters, their suit claims, have waited for up to four hours to vote at ""multiple"" voting locations. California has made strides to make voting as accessible as possible, according to the BBC's Sophie Long in Los Angeles. Some polling stations, which have been open since last week, allow for 24-hour voting. And across the city, public transit has been made free to allow voters to more easily get to their polling station. Biden is projected to win Massachusetts, which has 91 delegates. It's an embarrassing loss for Elizabeth Warren, one of the state's current US senators. Sanders was expected to do well, and he is projected to take second place, leaving Warren in a dismal third on home turf. It's been a bad night for the former mayor of New York. Michael Bloomberg has spent more than half a billion dollars of his own fortune and so far has only a win in American Samoa to show for it. Talking to supporters in Florida, however, he insisted he was still the candidate who could beat Donald Trump. And instead of despair in the face of defeat, he turned to humour (possibly with help from a teleprompter). We'll let you decide if Bloomberg did better with jokes than votes. This video can not be played Watch Bloomberg joke about Trump's golf and brainpower. California is the prize tonight's Democratic presidential hopefuls all want to take home. The state has a massive 415 delegates up for grabs. Sanders currently has an edge in the state - as expected, given his success with Latino voters, who are a key California voter demographic. Early polls also show Sanders with a major lead over his rivals among young voters. The Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders, though polls closed just minutes ago. Marianna BradyBBC News Over the day, we've been introducing you to young Democrats voting in 2020. The fourth isPaige Thielke, 17, from California. Although she was too young to vote in todayâs primary, she will take part in Novemberâs general election. Whatâs at stake in this election? A lot, not just because it could bring about a change in government, but because the world is at a crossroads. Far-right, nationalistic political movements have been gaining popularity all around the world, and the climate crisis is only getting worse. Whoever becomes the president will have to deal with those issues, and after almost four years of Trump, itâs pretty clear how he would address those issues. Do you know who you are voting for? If not, what will decide your vote? While I understand the appeal of Bernie Sanders, who is by far the favorite candidate among many of my friends and fellow high school students, his reputation as being disliked by his fellow senators and the drastic nature of his policy proposals doesnât make me feel like he could work across the aisle to get stuff done during his presidency. Because of that, my support tends to lean more towards moderates, even though the majority of them in the race arenât ideal options. What should someone outside the US know about your state that makes it unique? California has the unique quality of being generally known across the world. But 40 million people live here (a bigger population than Canada), and there is no typical âCalifornianâ. While the entertainment industry is certainly big, the Central Valley also produces 13% of all agricultural products in the US. Itâs the most diverse state in the country, and is diverse not only in terms of race, but socioeconomic status, cultural experience, etc. So while the majority of voters do lean liberal, there are plenty of conservative areas as well.

The state has a massive 415 delegates up for grabs. Sanders currently has an edge in the state - as expected, given his success with Latino voters, who are a key California voter demographic. Early polls also show Sanders with a major lead over his rivals among young voters. The Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders, though polls closed just minutes ago. Marianna BradyBBC News Over the day, we've been introducing you to young Democrats voting in 2020. The fourth isPaige Thielke, 17, from California. Although she was too young to vote in todayâs primary, she will take part in Novemberâs general election. Whatâs at stake in this election? A lot, not just because it could bring about a change in government, but because the world is at a crossroads. Far-right, nationalistic political movements have been gaining popularity all around the world, and the climate crisis is only getting worse. Whoever becomes the president will have to deal with those issues, and after almost four years of Trump, itâs pretty clear how he would address those issues. Do you know who you are voting for? If not, what will decide your vote? While I understand the appeal of Bernie Sanders, who is by far the favorite candidate among many of my friends and fellow high school students, his reputation as being disliked by his fellow senators and the drastic nature of his policy proposals doesnât make me feel like he could work across the aisle to get stuff done during his presidency. Because of that, my support tends to lean more towards moderates, even though the majority of them in the race arenât ideal options. What should someone outside the US know about your state that makes it unique? California has the unique quality of being generally known across the world. But 40 million people live here (a bigger population than Canada), and there is no typical âCalifornianâ. While the entertainment industry is certainly big, the Central Valley also produces 13% of all agricultural products in the US. Itâs the most diverse state in the country, and is diverse not only in terms of race, but socioeconomic status, cultural experience, etc. So while the majority of voters do lean liberal, there are plenty of conservative areas as well.

"Migrants in Greek custody at the border with Turkey on Tuesday The head of the European Commission has sent a strong message of support to Greece in its attempts to stop migrants crossing its border from Turkey. ""Our first priority is to ensure order is maintained at the Greek external border, which is also a European border,"" Ursula von der Leyen said. She promised Greece, which she called a ""European aspida [shield]"", â¬700m (Â£608m; $780m) in financial aid. Turkey lifted controls on migrants exiting for the EU on Friday. It took the decision after suffering a heavy military loss in north-west Syria, where it says it has been trying to create a safe area to resettle millions of Syrian refugees it took in during the ongoing civil war. At least 24,000 people have been stopped from crossing the border from Turkey since Saturday, according to Greek government figures. Austrian Prime Minister Sebastian Kurz has accused Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of using the migrants as pawns. He also announced that his government had strengthened Austria's borders to make sure the mass influx of refugees and migrants of 2015 was not repeated. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is due to visit Ankara to discuss Turkey's decision to drop restrictions on migrants, abandoning a deal struck in 2016. It was proposed as a solution to the migrant crisis in which almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in the EU in 2015 and thousands died in mass drownings On 20 March 2016 the EU and Turkey made a deal that saw Syrian refugees who arrived on Greek islands sent back to Turkey. In returnTurkey received â¬6bn (Â£5.2bn; $6.7bn) in EU aid,externalfor migrants and refugees For every Syrian person removed from Greece to Turkey, another would be resettled from Turkey to the EU The EU agreed to work towards lifting visa requirements for Turkish citizens by the end of June 2016 After the deal was agreed, the number of migrants arriving in Greece declined sharply Mrs von der Leyen inspected the land border on Tuesday along with European Council chief Charles Michel and European Parliament speaker David Sassoli, accompanied by Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. Mrs von der Leyen flew over the border in a helicopter with her colleagues The support she announced for Greece included: â¬700m in aid for migration management A Frontex force comprising seven vessels, two helicopters, one plane, three thermal-vision vehicles and 100 extra border guards Civil protection aid including medical equipment and teams, and shelters ""The Greek worries are our worries,"" she told reporters at the Kastanies border crossing. ""This border is not only a Greek border but it is also a European border and I stand here today as a European at your side... We have come here today to send a very clear statement of European solidarity and support to Greece... ""I am fully committed to mobilising all the necessary operational support to the Greek authorities."" Refugees and migrants gathered again on Tuesday at Turkey's Pazarkule border crossing She added that she wanted to express her ""compassion for the migrants that have been lured through false promises into this desperate situation"". Charles Michel said it was very important as to protect Europe's borders but also to show respect for international law. He called on Turkey to keep to the 2016 agreement. Defending his tough line on maintaining the border, Prime Minister Mitsotakis said Greece could not and would not be ""blackmailed"". ""This is no longer a refugee problem,"" he said. ""This is a blatant attempt by Turkey to use desperate people to promote its geopolitical agenda and to divert attention from the horrible situation in Syria."" He tweeted photos of himself meeting Greek security forces. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""There were only a few attempts today [by migrants to cross the border],"" he said. ""Let's hope they get the message."" Others waited on the Turkish coast at Ayvacik in the hope of reaching Greece by sea Some migrants including women and children could be seen in custody after being detained on the Greek side of the land border. On the Turkish side, migrants who had been waiting around the border city of Edirne were again moving towards the frontier.

"This video can not be played The flaring was clearly visible from Cowdenbeath More unplanned flaring is being carried out at the Mossmorran petrochemical plant in Fife after a problem with a major compressor at the site. The environmental watchdog Sepa was alerted by site operator ExxonMobil just before 15:00. Residents, who have repeatedly complained about flaring incidents, said flames were visible from Edinburgh and as far away as Dundee. Production at the plant only resumed on 21 Februaryafter a temporary shutdown. The site was closed for five months from last August after it suffered two boiler explosions. ExxonMobil said it was ""progressing with the steps required to re-start the machine"" but could not say when that would happen. A company statement said: ""To keep the rest of the plant running and reduce total duration of flaring, we safely manage this process through the use of our elevated flare. ""We are taking actions to reduce the size of the flare during this work, including maximising the use of ground flares. ""We apologise for any inconvenience to our local communities."" Exxonmobil's ethylene plant at Mossmorran was shut down for five months last August Local campaigners said ExxonMobil's response to the latest incident ""explained nothing"". Linda Holt, of the Mossmorran Action Group said, ""Once again ExxonMobil is forced to resort to emergency flaring because something has gone badly wrong. ""As the ground shakes, and a huge bright flame amid clouds of black smoke looms over communities, they are expected to suffer in ignorance. ""Reassurances that the plant is 'safe' do not wash.""

Jonathan Mok, 23, said he was walking down Oxford Street last Monday when he heard shouts of ""coronavirus"". When he confronted the four men, he said, they launched a surprise attack that left him badly hurt. The Met Police said it was treating the attack as ""racially aggravated"".

Mr Mok said his face was ""exploding with blood"" from the attack, which left him in ""daze and shock"".

"The charity described the case as ""bizarre and heartbreaking"" Twenty hamsters have been found stuffed in takeaway food containers and dumped in a hedge. The 18 Syrian and two dwarf hamsters were spotted by a dog walker in Park Crescent, in Darlington, on Sunday. Volunteers for the National Animal Sanctuaries Support League (NASSL), in Newton Aycliffe, said the animals were ""traumatised"" but in good health and needed to be re-homed. Spokeswoman Pauline Wilson said it was ""bizarre and heartbreaking."" The charity says the hamsters were ""traumatised but otherwise in good shape"" Ms Wilson said the public response to the animals' dilemma was fantastic and all but four had been found new homes.

"Greggs said its vegan sausage roll had helped boost sales Greggs boss Roger Whiteside has said his firm would pay staff who have to self-isolate because of coronavirus. ""Our default position is that we pay contract hours. We don't have any zero contract hours,"" he told BBC's Today. The firm's policy is in contrast to some other firms, which say they will only pay the legal minimum. He said Greggs' policy could be reviewed if coronavirus became a ""big problem"". The comments came as Greggs posted a 13.5% rise in 2019 sales to Â£1.168bn. The sandwich chain's success was helped by the popularity of its new vegan range, but the baker saw a significant slowdown last month as storms kept customers away. And Greggs also cautioned there is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of coronavirus. Pre-tax profits rose to Â£108.3m from Â£82.6m in 2018,the company said.,external Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Greggs' policy for staff who are ordered to stay at home if they been in contact with an infected person is in contrast to some other companies. Last week Wetherspoons, one of the UK's biggest employers, saidstaff would be subject to regular statutory sick pay rulesif they had to self-isolate. Under statutory sick pay rules, an employee is not paid for the first three days of absence, and then only if they earn at least Â£118 a week. Should I self-isolate and how do I do it? Boris Johnson urged to let Greggs workers keep bonus Greggs picks Just Eat for home deliveries Greggs: How its vegan sausage roll stormed social media Health Secretary Matt Hancock has sent guidance to UK employers telling them thatstaff who have been asked to self-isolate are entitled to take the time as sick leave. Michele Piertney, of the independent arbitration service Acas, said people would not get sick leave as a matter of course if a medical expert put them into quarantine. Many casual or agency workers may be entitled to sick pay, but self-employed people are not.Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick payand should ask their employer. Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, has written to Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey asking her to change the rules around sick pay. He was speaking after fears that zero-hours workers would go into work, even if they were supposed to be self-isolating, to ensure they got paid. ""The government must bring in emergency measures so these low-paid workers are protected financially, particularly those caring for the most vulnerable in society,"" said Mr Prentis. ""It should be made compulsory for employers to give them sick pay, even if they're not officially eligible."" The startling success of Greggs - rising sales for six years in a row, a rapid expansion in geographical coverage and a share price that has doubled in three years - is one of the enduring puzzles of British business. General retailers have been in retreat across the board, and general bakers have been squeezed by tough competition from supermarkets and booming coffee chains like Pret a Manger and Costa. If the formula is not quite right, disaster awaits, as the dramatic failure of Patisserie Valerie proved. Despite all this Greggs has prospered. Why? Part of the answer is that Greggs has the formula right - it has constantly tweaked what it sells to get the price and range right, and has not been afraid to follow trends. It has also been cute with its marketing, using social media to give the chain an image that belies its traditional roots. The magic ingredient though, has been its attitude to staff and customers. Chief executive Roger Whiteside says the company's ""default position"" when staff are off work is to pay. It has fixed hours contracts, not zero hours, and when its stores were closed by floods recently, it continued to pay staff who could not come to work. It has paid out big bonuses when the times are good - 10% of profits, so Â£13m this year - and has just reworked its internal culture statement after an extensive consultation with staff. For customers there is the ""Greggs Pledge"", which promises the company will be run for their good as well. But this does not mean the company operates in some feelgood happy zone. There is also a pragmatic edge, with the warning that while it intended to pay workers who self-isolate because of coronavirus, that largesse could not continue indefinitely. Justin Tomlinson, a work and pensions minister, said the current advice for workers with no sick pay who had to self-isolate was to claim universal credit,the Guardian reports.,external The impact of coronavirus could hit Greggs' figures in 2020. ""We made a very strong start to 2020 in January, but in February saw a significant slowdown in sales growth as a result of the storms that have affected the UK,"" said Mr Whiteside. ""There is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of coronavirus. This aside, we expect to make year-on-year progress and will do so from a strong financial position."" What are the social distancing rules?

"Results roll in for Super Tuesday, the biggest day yet in the race for the White House Democrats in 14 states chose candidates to run against Trump in November's election Joe Biden wins eight states to become front-runner Early leader Bernie Sanders wins three states, still doing well Contests still close in biggest states California and Texas Mike Bloomberg performs poorly - but could do well in California Max Matza, Roland Hughes, Ritu Prasad, Helier Cheung and Holly Honderich This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're wrapping our live coverage of Super Tuesday, now it is Wednesday on the US east coast. It's been a fascinating few hours in the race to decide which Democrat will take on Donald Trump in November's election. Here are the main takeaways:  You can follow the latest with our up-to-date news storyhere, and you can read who the winners and losers werehere- thanks for following. It's almost 01:30 here in Washington, and the picture is starting to become a little clearer. But here are a few things wedon'tknow after Super Tuesday: Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Joe Biden came into Super Tuesday hoping his momentum from a
surprisingly big South Carolina win would translate into success in some of the
state and allow him to keep within sight of Bernie Sanders in the delegate
count. By that metric, his evening succeeded beyond his best expectations. Bidenâs support among black voters, which was on display in South Carolina,
was replicated across the south, in states like North Carolina, Virginia and
Alabama, where he consistently won about 60%. It also helped offset Bernie
Sanders's strength with Hispanic voters in Texas. Tuesday night was a celebration for Biden. Now the hard work begins. He is in for a state-by-state slog against Sanders that could stretch all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July. Heâll have to fundraise furiously and organise rapidly to make up for the Vermont senatorâs advantages. Meanwhile, Republicans are going to start training their fire on him - again. If he ends up winning the nomination, after being left for dead just a few weeks ago, he will have earned it. The state with the most at stake for the candidates is also the one that's most uncertain right now. California has a cool 415 delegates to dole out, but its size also means counting millions of votes could take quite a while - possibly weeks. About 30% of precincts have reported their results, and there are still thousands of mail-in votes to look at. In addition, local media report people are still waiting in long lines to cast their ballots even though polls closed nearly two hours ago. But the Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders. The New York Times has forecasted it's ""pretty likely"" Sanders who will take home the California haul. Bloomberg has also been doing well in California, overtaking Biden for the second-place spot. A reminder: you need 1,991 delegates total to win the Democratic nomination. Winning most delegates here will help, a lot, but it still won't make you the candidate. Here are where things stand right now when it comes to the all-important delegates that candidates have won. (These are assigned according to how well candidates have performed): Some caveats: we don't have the results from the two biggest states Texas (where Joe Biden is building up a lead) or California (where Sanders is leading Bloomberg). This picture could change quite a lot over the coming hours, and Sanders could pull closer to the former vice-president. Michael Bloomberg has said he will be re-evaluating his campaign following tonight's results. His only win was the US territory of American Samoa, but early polls in California and Texas have shown him in second and third place, respectively. Good results in these two states could get him closer to the front-runners. The BBC's North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says the former New York mayor could have an impact on this race depending on what he decides to do with his campaign machine. ""Whether Michael Bloomberg decides to use this machine he's built up and turn it to say, support Joe Biden going forward, or whoever the Democratic nominee is in November, that's an open question,"" he says. ""I think Joe Biden and his supporters have a very real interest in what Michael Bloomberg does from here on out...even if he doesn't have quite the same amount of support he did just a few days ago."" If Bloomberg pours money into states like Michigan and Florida, for example, he could be drawing votes away from Biden. Comedy actor Keegan-Michael Key, who once portrayed former President Obama's ""anger translator"" in a sketch, is once again pretending to be Biden's old boss. Allow Twitter content?

You can take our own celebrity endorsement quiz to see if you can match the A-lister to the candidatehere. There's a lot at stake in the country's second-most populous state. Before Tuesday, it looked like Bernie Sanders would win there fairly comfortably, thanks partly to his support among Latino voters. That hasn't proven to be the case. With 61% of results in, Joe Biden has now edged into the lead. It's still very close though. There are 228 delegates available here - they may end up being shared fairly evenly between Sanders and Biden. The BBC's Katty Kay points out, Biden's many wins could be thanks to issues of tone and civility. ""It's not just this concept of civility, it's actually the words people use about each other,"" she says. ""And Joe Biden, I think, appeals to people who might be looking for that in this country."" Perhaps in particular to women, she adds, who are looking for the political landscape to be ""less aggressive, less combative"". It's no longer Super Tuesday here on the east coast of the US, it's now less-super Wednesday. As we continue to await results from California, Texas and Maine, here are some key takeaways from Tuesday's big vote. 1) A new front-runner? Former vice-president Joe Biden's campaign was drying up until he won South Carolina on Saturday. That momentum has continued, with projected wins in eight states on Super Tuesday so far. 2) Biden's Southern base comes out African-American voters were a big part of Biden's wins in the South. He won the majority of black voters in these states, proving his campaign's claim that he has a strong base among southern Democrats. 3) But Bernie's still in Biden may have taken up his front-runner position once more, but Sanders could still unseat him. Sanders has been winning big among young voters and Latino voters. Latino voters, in particular, are a key demographic in the big-win states of California and Texas that are still up for grabs (it's stillincrediblyclose between Sanders and Biden in Texas). 4) A bad night for Bloomberg and Warren It has been a poor showing for both Michael Bloomberg (who has spent over $400m on his campaign) and Elizabeth Warren - who lost her home state (Massachusetts) and birth state (Oklahoma). In Massachusetts, women opted for Biden over her by a big margin. Katty KayWorld News America presenter One voter and dog line up to vote in Oklahoma City on Tuesday When it comes to Democrats and American politics, Oklahoma
isnât the first state you think of. Solidly Republican, the heartland state
doesnât feature in the Democratic story in presidential elections. But tonight,
true-red Oklahoma is telling an interesting tale about the state of the
Democratic race. In the 2016 Democratic primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders
beat Hillary Clinton to win Oklahoma by 10 percentage points. Four years ago
Sanders was seen as the anti-Clinton vote. He was the person Democrats
rallied around if they didnât want to hand the nomination to the establishment
candidate. Tonight Oklahoma tells a different story. Joe Biden has beaten Bernie Sanders. In 2020, Joe Biden has
become the anti-Sanders vote. For all those Democrats who donât
want a nominee from the left of the party, Biden is the guy. Not only is he the
anti-Sanders candidate, heâs also the anti-Trump candidate. For Democratic
voters for whom beating Trump is the number one goal, Biden, not Sanders looks
like the most viable candidate. As rumours fly that Michael Bloomberg may drop out on Wednesday, let's take a look at what his nearly half billion dollars of personal campaign contributions could have bought. The billionaire ex-New York City mayor is the ninth richest man in the world, and has spent $464m on his campaign so far, according to federal campaign filings. For that money he could have: Democrats aren't the only ones hosting primaries on Super Tuesday - Republicans have had their say too. Technically, the president isn't running uncontested for the Republican nomination. Former Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld is also on the ballot, but his candidacy is a long-shot, as a brief scroll through Trump's Twitter feed shows. Without calling each other out by name, both Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden have criticised each other. Watch as they trade political blows - over the Iraq War and general election electability - in their speeches tonight. This video can not be played Super Tuesday: Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden trade punches We're still waiting for projections for three states: massive Texas and California, as well as tiny Maine. And we're still awaiting the full results in almost every state. Remember, the aim for all candidates is to win1,991 delegates, a different amount of which are awarded in each state, and according to how well each candidate has performed. With that target in mind, this is how many delegates each candidate has so far:  We are a long, long way away from this being resolved. Voters line up outside a library in Burbank, California The Bernie Sanders campaign is asking a judge to grant an emergency injunction to keep polling stations open in Los Angeles county due what they describe as long queues of waiting voters. Voters, their suit claims, have waited for up to four hours to vote at ""multiple"" voting locations. California has made strides to make voting as accessible as possible, according to the BBC's Sophie Long in Los Angeles. Some polling stations, which have been open since last week, allow for 24-hour voting. And across the city, public transit has been made free to allow voters to more easily get to their polling station. Biden is projected to win Massachusetts, which has 91 delegates. It's an embarrassing loss for Elizabeth Warren, one of the state's current US senators. Sanders was expected to do well, and he is projected to take second place, leaving Warren in a dismal third on home turf. It's been a bad night for the former mayor of New York. Michael Bloomberg has spent more than half a billion dollars of his own fortune and so far has only a win in American Samoa to show for it. Talking to supporters in Florida, however, he insisted he was still the candidate who could beat Donald Trump. And instead of despair in the face of defeat, he turned to humour (possibly with help from a teleprompter). We'll let you decide if Bloomberg did better with jokes than votes. This video can not be played Watch Bloomberg joke about Trump's golf and brainpower. California is the prize tonight's Democratic presidential hopefuls all want to take home. The state has a massive 415 delegates up for grabs. Sanders currently has an edge in the state - as expected, given his success with Latino voters, who are a key California voter demographic. Early polls also show Sanders with a major lead over his rivals among young voters. The Associated Press has already called the state for Sanders, though polls closed just minutes ago. Marianna BradyBBC News Over the day, we've been introducing you to young Democrats voting in 2020. The fourth isPaige Thielke, 17, from California. Although she was too young to vote in todayâs primary, she will take part in Novemberâs general election. Whatâs at stake in this election? A lot, not just because it could bring about a change in government, but because the world is at a crossroads. Far-right, nationalistic political movements have been gaining popularity all around the world, and the climate crisis is only getting worse. Whoever becomes the president will have to deal with those issues, and after almost four years of Trump, itâs pretty clear how he would address those issues. Do you know who you are voting for? If not, what will decide your vote? While I understand the appeal of Bernie Sanders, who is by far the favorite candidate among many of my friends and fellow high school students, his reputation as being disliked by his fellow senators and the drastic nature of his policy proposals doesnât make me feel like he could work across the aisle to get stuff done during his presidency. Because of that, my support tends to lean more towards moderates, even though the majority of them in the race arenât ideal options. What should someone outside the US know about your state that makes it unique? California has the unique quality of being generally known across the world. But 40 million people live here (a bigger population than Canada), and there is no typical âCalifornianâ. While the entertainment industry is certainly big, the Central Valley also produces 13% of all agricultural products in the US. Itâs the most diverse state in the country, and is diverse not only in terms of race, but socioeconomic status, cultural experience, etc. So while the majority of voters do lean liberal, there are plenty of conservative areas as well.

"Some stores have run out of hand sanitisers as people prepare for the virus spreading Hand sanitiser sales are being limited at pharmacy chains as fears over the coronavirus have boosted demand. Boots and LloydsPharmacy both said they are restricting the products - which can help to prevent the spread of the virus when hand-washing is not possible - to two per person. The decision comes as some hand sanitisers are being sold online at inflated prices. Pharmacies said they are working to increase the supply of the products. The NHS says that washing your hands is a key part of preventing the spread of viruses, but hand sanitiser gel can be used when soap and water are not available. Asthe UK warns that widespread infection is ""highly likely"", chemist chains said they had to ration the products, with market research data from Kantar Worldpanel showing sales more than tripled in February. Fifth of workers 'could be off sick at virus peak' Coronavirus is 'serious situation' for Scotland Student hurt in 'racist' coronavirus attack Meanwhile, one pharmacy in Coventry told BBC News they have struggled to restock hand sanitisers amid increased demand for the product - including from local businesses such as taxi companies and hairdressers. Ali Shiraz, of Hillfields Pharmacy, said: ""We can't get any hand sanitisers at all. The demand has been really, really high. ""We're looking at maybe 50 to 60 people a day have been asking for particular hand sanitisers."" A spokesman for LloydsPharmacy, which has 1,500 branches across the UK, said: ""We know that having access to products like hand gels is extremely important to our customers, so we are doing everything we can to ensure availability, despite increasing demand and supply challenges."" This video can not be played Steps the NHS says you should take to protect yourself from Covid-19 Boots said it was limiting sales but still had stock in warehouses for online sales and high street stores. But Well Pharmacy, which has 700 branches, said it was not limiting sales despite a surge in demand which could see some products become temporarily unavailable. ""We certainly have no intention of profiteering over the current situation by increasing prices,"" a spokesman added. Amazon Marketplace and other online sales platforms have hand sanitisers available at inflated prices. A 100ml bottle of Cuticura Total - which kills viruses as well as bacteria - is sold for Â£1.55 by Boots. But some Amazon sellers are offering 40ml of the brand's anti-bacterial gel for Â£24.99.

"Coronavirus is spreading in the UK and the government is seeking ways to minimise its spread. Without drastic measures - which could be in place for weeks, or even months - it is feared that more than 250,000 people could die. All members of the public should reduce the time they spend with others: Everyone should stop non-essential contact with others. This is particularly important for people over 70, those with underlying health conditions and pregnant women People should work from home if they can Cafes, pubs and restaurants are being closed from Friday night - except for take-away food - to tackle coronavirus People should stop all unnecessary travel Those most at risk - about 1.5 million who've had organ transplants, have severe respiratory conditions or some cancers - should not go out for 12 weeks, and will be given essential supplies if they don't have a support system of their own Everyone should continue to regularly wash their hands and avoid contacting the NHS unless it's essential. The strongest warnings are in place for those who are ill and the people close to them: Anyone with a fever or persistent cough should stay at home for seven days Anyone who lives with someone displaying coronavirus symptoms should also stay at home for 14 days.People who have to isolate themselvesshould ask others for help The government's thinking has changed quickly. It started off trying to contain coronavirus by isolating people who tested positive and asking anyone who had close contact with them to self-isolate too. Ministers then introduced policies to delay and reduce the peak, when the most cases are expected. The idea was that by pushing it back to the summer it would allow the NHS to cope. But modelling from Imperial College London prompted a change in approach. It warned the policy of a managed spread could lead to more than 250,000 deaths, with hospital intensive care units getting overwhelmed. Ministers are now seeking to suppress the spread completely. They hope this will keep deaths below 20,000. We are in uncharted territory - so it is impossible to tell. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested that""we can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks"". But the problem with trying to suppress the virus is that as soon as you lift those measures the fear is it could quickly return. One option from experts advising the government is to go through a cycle of lifting and reapplying restrictions, using demand on intensive care as a guide. There will be close attention paid to China, which is now looking at how it lifts restrictions. It is not realistic to think that if you temporarily break the spread of coronavirus it will go away. Then you have to consider the social and economic factors at play. Businesses are going to struggle and people are going to lose their jobs. And how long are the public going to put up with being told they cannot go out, need to work from home and can no longer watch sport or go to festivals? It leaves the government with some very difficult decisions to take. EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash The whole of the NHS has been put on an emergency footing. From mid-April all routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements, are being cancelled for three months. Hospitals have plans to keep coronavirus patients separate and supply staff with protective masks and suits. All hospital patients with flu-like symptoms are being tested. Patients with mild symptoms - a high temperature or new and persistent cough - are being asked to self-isolate at home. Community teams will keep an eye on them if need be. But people are being advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. Currently there is no treatment or cure, so hospitals are trying to relieve the symptoms. Specialist ECMO breathing equipment is at five units for patients whose lungs fail. There are between 4,000 and 5,000 intensive care beds. But NHS officials said they can effectively increase that to between 11,000 and 12,000 by using ventilators reserved for planned surgery and those available in the private sector, Ministry of Defence, new ones being made and old stocks that are no longer used. Ministers are also working with private companies to ramp up production. A third of patients who need hospital care require intensive care support, evidence from China and Italy suggests. Doctors warn that some difficult decisions may need to be made about which patients get treatment. What questions do you have about the UK's coronavirus plans?

"This video can not be played Amy Klobuchar endorses Joe Biden as she drops out of the race US Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has picked up three endorsements from former rivals on the eve of the most important day in the 2020 White House race so far. Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke all campaigned with the former US vice-president in Dallas, Texas. On Super Tuesday, voters in 14 states will pick their preferred Democratic candidate for November's election. The Democratic frontrunner remains the left-wing senator, Bernie Sanders. Democratic centrists have been calling on party figures to urgently unite to try and stop Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, from becoming the party's nominee to take on President Donald Trump, a Republican. Mr Sanders, meanwhile, has been steadily picking up endorsements from left-leaning Democrats, activist groups and high-profile celebrities. What to expect on Super Tuesday What are primaries and how do they work? The other candidates still in the race are Elizabeth Warren, Michael Bloomberg and Tulsi Gabbard. With the exception of Ms Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman, all of the Democratic hopefuls are septuagenarians. Ms Klobuchar, a Minnesota senator, suspended her campaign and endorsed Mr Biden on Monday. Appearing alongside Mr Biden on Monday night, she said: ""If we spend the next four months dividing our party and going at each other, we will spend the next four year watching Donald Trump tear apart our country."" Mr Buttigieg, a former mayor from Indiana who dropped out of the race on Sunday, said at another event with Mr Biden: ""I'm looking for a leader, I'm looking for a president, who will draw out what's best in each of us."" Mr Biden, 77, told reporters that Mr Buttigieg, 38, ""reminds me of my son Beau"", who died in 2015. Former US congressman Mr O'Rourke, who dropped out of the race last November, also appeared on stage with Mr Biden. Ms Klobuchar and Mr Buttigieg had both been competing with Mr Biden for the same pool of centrist Democratic voters. Both stepped aside following Mr Biden's overwhelming victory in South Carolina at the weekend, which came after he struggled in the first three Democratic leadership contests this year. Earlier on Monday, Mr Biden also picked up endorsements from former Obama National Security Adviser Susan Rice, former Senate leader Harry Reid and several members of Congress. Choose your candidate and filter by category Five charts that explain the Democratic race Five contenders remain out of a Democratic field that once featured more than two dozen. Among them is New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who is also pitching to moderate Democratic voters. The former mayor of New York City - who will appear on a 2020 ballot for the first time on Tuesday - has invested more than a half billion dollars in his presidential bid. Mr Bloomberg told a Fox News town hall on Monday that the nominee could ultimately be chosen through ""horse-trading"" at the Democratic convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July. Also still in the race are Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and US congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Campaigning in Minnesota on Monday night, Mr Sanders invited his rivals' supporters to join his campaign. ""To all of Amy and Pete's millions of supporters, the door is open. Come on in,"" Mr Sanders said. Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believes His campaign suggested the party's big money donors wanted to stop the Vermont senator. This video can not be played Why Alexis and Amira could help decide the US election ""The establishment is nervous, not because we can't beat Trump, but because we will,"" said Sanders' campaign manager, Faiz Shakir. Mr Sanders is promising to target US income inequality with a multi-trillion dollar policy blueprint on everything from healthcare to taxation and education. While centrists are now rallying behind Mr Biden, Mr Sanders has been endorsed by a number of progressive Democrats - including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, known for being part of ""the squad"" of left-wing congresswomen. The Sunrise Movement - a coalition of young climate activists in the US - has also endorsed Mr Sanders, as have activist groups People's Action and the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). Businessmen Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, co-founders of the ice cream company Ben & Jerry's, have also voiced their support for Mr Sanders. The socialist candidate has also amassed an extremely long list of celebrity supporters. Actors including Danny Devito, Susan Sarandon and Jack Nicholson have thrown their weight behind him, as has model Emily Ratajkowski, and pop stars Cardi B, Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus. At a campaign rally in North Carolina on Monday night, Mr Trump sought to raise doubts about Biden's mental acuity by highlighting the former vice-president's gaffes. This video can not be played The biggest myth about the 'black vote' He mentioned that Mr Biden had referred to Super Tuesday as ""Super Thursday"" and asserted in a TV debate that 150 million people had been killed by guns since 2007. Mr Trump said that if Mr Biden wins the White House, ""they're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country, and they're going to be super-left radical crazies"". After the first four primary contests, Mr Sanders is in the lead with 60 of the delegates needed to win the Democratic White House nomination. Mr Biden has 54 and Ms Warren eight. On Super Tuesday, 1,344 delegates will be up for grabs. California, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Vermont, Colorado, Utah, North Carolina and Maine - as well as American Samoa, cast ballots on Tuesday.

"Greggs said its vegan sausage roll had helped boost sales Greggs boss Roger Whiteside has said his firm would pay staff who have to self-isolate because of coronavirus. ""Our default position is that we pay contract hours. We don't have any zero contract hours,"" he told BBC's Today. The firm's policy is in contrast to some other firms, which say they will only pay the legal minimum. He said Greggs' policy could be reviewed if coronavirus became a ""big problem"". The comments came as Greggs posted a 13.5% rise in 2019 sales to Â£1.168bn. The sandwich chain's success was helped by the popularity of its new vegan range, but the baker saw a significant slowdown last month as storms kept customers away. And Greggs also cautioned there is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of coronavirus. Pre-tax profits rose to Â£108.3m from Â£82.6m in 2018,the company said.,external Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Greggs' policy for staff who are ordered to stay at home if they been in contact with an infected person is in contrast to some other companies. Last week Wetherspoons, one of the UK's biggest employers, saidstaff would be subject to regular statutory sick pay rulesif they had to self-isolate. Under statutory sick pay rules, an employee is not paid for the first three days of absence, and then only if they earn at least Â£118 a week. Should I self-isolate and how do I do it? Boris Johnson urged to let Greggs workers keep bonus Greggs picks Just Eat for home deliveries Greggs: How its vegan sausage roll stormed social media Health Secretary Matt Hancock has sent guidance to UK employers telling them thatstaff who have been asked to self-isolate are entitled to take the time as sick leave. Michele Piertney, of the independent arbitration service Acas, said people would not get sick leave as a matter of course if a medical expert put them into quarantine. Many casual or agency workers may be entitled to sick pay, but self-employed people are not.Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick payand should ask their employer. Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, has written to Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey asking her to change the rules around sick pay. He was speaking after fears that zero-hours workers would go into work, even if they were supposed to be self-isolating, to ensure they got paid. ""The government must bring in emergency measures so these low-paid workers are protected financially, particularly those caring for the most vulnerable in society,"" said Mr Prentis. ""It should be made compulsory for employers to give them sick pay, even if they're not officially eligible."" The startling success of Greggs - rising sales for six years in a row, a rapid expansion in geographical coverage and a share price that has doubled in three years - is one of the enduring puzzles of British business. General retailers have been in retreat across the board, and general bakers have been squeezed by tough competition from supermarkets and booming coffee chains like Pret a Manger and Costa. If the formula is not quite right, disaster awaits, as the dramatic failure of Patisserie Valerie proved. Despite all this Greggs has prospered. Why? Part of the answer is that Greggs has the formula right - it has constantly tweaked what it sells to get the price and range right, and has not been afraid to follow trends. It has also been cute with its marketing, using social media to give the chain an image that belies its traditional roots. The magic ingredient though, has been its attitude to staff and customers. Chief executive Roger Whiteside says the company's ""default position"" when staff are off work is to pay. It has fixed hours contracts, not zero hours, and when its stores were closed by floods recently, it continued to pay staff who could not come to work. It has paid out big bonuses when the times are good - 10% of profits, so Â£13m this year - and has just reworked its internal culture statement after an extensive consultation with staff. For customers there is the ""Greggs Pledge"", which promises the company will be run for their good as well. But this does not mean the company operates in some feelgood happy zone. There is also a pragmatic edge, with the warning that while it intended to pay workers who self-isolate because of coronavirus, that largesse could not continue indefinitely. Justin Tomlinson, a work and pensions minister, said the current advice for workers with no sick pay who had to self-isolate was to claim universal credit,the Guardian reports.,external The impact of coronavirus could hit Greggs' figures in 2020. ""We made a very strong start to 2020 in January, but in February saw a significant slowdown in sales growth as a result of the storms that have affected the UK,"" said Mr Whiteside. ""There is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of coronavirus. This aside, we expect to make year-on-year progress and will do so from a strong financial position."" What are the social distancing rules?

Health experts believe the evidence from China suggests that Covid-19 is not generally transmitted by people who have no symptoms (flu can be), and that in general the virus does not transmit as efficiently as flu. The WHO has asked countries to test samples of their populations for the antibodies to Covid-19, which will give a more accurate picture of just how many people have been infected, and clarify whether many people have had very mild illness, or not even realised they were ill. First results from these studies should be available in the next few weeks. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says about 3.4% of those confirmed to have been infected with the new coronavirus have died - which would suggest a much higher fatality rate than seasonal flu, at less than 1%. However, the figure is based on the number of deaths recorded
worldwide so far, relative to total confirmed cases - and there are likely to be thousands of coronavirus cases that have not been recorded. Death rates may vary from country to country, too, as some are better at spotting the milder, harder to count cases than others. For more information on the difficulties of working out the death rate, seeour helpful guide.  The number of people who have died in Italy's coronavirus outbreak has risen to 79 from 52, the country's civil protection agency says. The total number of people who have tested positive for the virus is now 2,502, up from Monday's figure of 2,036. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that
protective gear such as masks and goggles used by health workers fighting
coronavirus are running out. WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that âsupplies
are rapidly depleting"". He added that disruption to supplies had been caused by rising demand, hoarding and misuse. He said that manufacturers need to increase personal
protective gear supplies by 40% to meet the needs of the medical community. WHO estimates that, per month, 89m medical masks will be required
for the Covid-19 response, as well as 76m examination gloves and 1.6m goggles. German football club Borussia Dortmund has cancelled plans to tour Asia this summer due to concerns over the coronavirus. The club's managing director Carsten Cramer told the Sport Bild magazine: ""We are very sorry because we know how much the people over there were hoping we would come over to them."" He said a new tour destination would be chosen that ""would be 100% risk free for the participants"".  The University of London ispostponing the graduation ceremony for students,externalparticipating in its ""distance and flexible learning programmes"". ""Our international student community, along with friends and family, scheduled to attend the ceremony consists of some 4,000 attendees from over 100 countries,"" the university said in a statement. ""We have taken the difficult decision to postpone the event due to the ongoing coronavirus issue... we felt it important to minimise the risk to our students and their guests."" The ceremony had been due to take place at the Barbican Centre in London on Tuesday. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is talking to reporters after the surprise Fed rate cut. He says: ""The virus outbreak is something that will require a muti-faceted response"" - from many actors, including healthcare providers and public and private sector bodies. ""It won't reduce infection, it won't fix a broken supply chain - we get that,"" he says. But it will help to support confidence, he adds. Authorities in Brazil have opened an investigation into an
evangelical church - known as the Global Cathedral of the Holy Spirit - in the city of Porto Alegre. The church had promoted one of its gatherings as a way of ""immunising"" its followers against coronavirus, Efe news agency reports.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei also wore gloves at a tree-planting ceremony in the capital Tehran on Tuesday. The 80-year-old appears to be mindful of the risk the virus poses, especially to people in his age group.

Iran is one of the worst-affected countries, with 77 coronavirus deaths reported so far - the highest number outside China. On Tuesday, Iranian health authorities said 2,336

from the Ottoman Turks in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878. Despite no reported coronavirus cases in Bulgaria, the public gathering at the Shipka Peak monument was deemed
too risky. President Rumen Radev is still expected to lay flowers there and make a speech, while ceremonies are scheduled to take place elsewhere in the capital, Sofia.  Samira HussainNew York business correspondent The US Federal Reserve has made an
emergency cut to interest rates by 50 basis points, as fears of the economic
impact of the coronavirus continue to mount. It is a rare move by America's
central bank, done outside of regular meetings. In a statement on Tuesday, the Federal
Reserve said the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity and it
is cutting interest rates by half a percentage point. These kinds of emergency
moves by America's central bank are rare. The last time the Federal Reserve
took this kind of action was during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, when
America's housing market collapsed and the US fell in to its worst recession
since the great depression. Before that, it was after the 11 September terrorist attacks when the central bank made this kind of emergency cut.

"Domestic violence offenders in England and Wales could face compulsory lie-detector tests when released from prison under proposed new laws. Those deemed at high risk of re-offending will be given regular polygraph tests to find out if they have breached release conditions. The long-awaited Domestic Violence Bill will also specify that controlling a victim's finances can count as abuse. Alleged abusers will also be banned from cross-examining victims in court. Lie-detector tests - which work by measuring changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and sweat - are not 100% accurate. Why campaigners want 'rough sex' murder defence ban Majority of control abuse cases dropped Lost laws: What bills were dropped at prorogation? But the Home Office said it was already using the tests to monitor high-risk sex offenders andhad found them to be 89% accurate,external. The government also plans to use lie-detector tests on convicted terrorists freed under licence. How widely are lie detectors used? If the Domestic Abuse Bill passes, a three-year pilot will be carried out on domestic abusers which are deemed at high-risk of causing serious harm. If successful, the scheme will be rolled out nationwide. Around 300 offenders will take a lie detector test three months after their release and every six months after that, according to the Home Office. Those who fail the test will not be returned to prison - but they may be jailed if they refuse to take the test or attempt to ""trick"" it, the Home Office added. They can also be returned to prison if the tests show ""their risk has escalated to level whereby they can no longer be safely managed in the community"". Information gathered from failed lie-detector tests is routinely shared with the police who use it to carry out further investigations. Campaigners say action to help the nearly two million victims of domestic abuse in the UK each year, two thirds of whom are women, is long overdue. The Conservatives first proposed tougher measures in their 2017 election manifesto but legislative progress has been slow. The Domestic Abuse Bill was among several proposed laws which fell by the wayside last autumn after Boris Johnson suspended Parliament and MPs subsequently voted for an early general election. The government is now bringing back the legislation, saying MPs will be presented with an ""enhanced"" package of measures that will ""protect victims and punish perpetrators"" of this ""horrendous"" crime. There will also be a ban on perpetrators cross-examining their victims during family court proceedings and a legal duty on councils to find safe accommodation for domestic abuse victims and their children. Charity Women's Aid said this could be a ""life-saving"" move, but only if it was accompanied by guaranteed funding for specialist women's services - including for ""marginalised"" groups in society, which it estimates will cost about Â£173m a year. While welcoming many of the initiatives, children's charities warned that some families with children risked ""falling through the cracks in support"". ""The bill risks dividing victims into 'haves and have nots',"" said Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan. ""Children are the hidden victims of domestic abuse, suffering trauma that can last a lifetime. ""I'm disappointed that while the Domestic Abuse Bill may improve access to refuges, it will not help the majority of victims and children who remain in the family home."" Campaigners say refuges need to be properly funded The NSPCC's senior policy officer Emily Hilton said it was ""extremely disappointing that the bill in its current form fails to protect children from the devastating impact of living with domestic abuse, leaving thousands at continued risk because the help they deserve is not in place"". The Home Office said the UK's new domestic abuse commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, would consider what support the government can provide children who have been affected by domestic abuse. The legislation will also enshrine a new definition of domestic abuse in law that recognises economic abuse - when a perpetrator controls a victim's finances - as a specific type of the crime. Court protection orders banning perpetrators from contacting a victim or forcing them to take part in alcohol or drug treatment programmes may also be introduced. Support for migrant domestic abuse victims will also be reviewed, while ministers will consider what more can be done to stop the so-called ""rough sex"" defence being used by perpetrators in court. The majority of the measures in the Domestic Abuse Bill will apply only to England and Wales, but it will create a specific new criminal offence in Northern Ireland of controlling or coercive behaviour, already on the statute book in the rest of the UK. Certain provisions in the bill also apply to court proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland.

"The founders of two of the most popular James Bond fan sites are asking the studios behind the next Bond film to delay its release due to coronavirus. No Time to Die is due for release on 3 April but fans have asked for it to be held back to the summer ""when experts expect the epidemic to have peaked"". The open letter,externalis from the founders of MI6 Confidential and The James Bond Dossier, James Page and David Leigh. ""It is time to put public health above marketing release schedules."" Coronovirus maps and charts: A visual guide to the outbreak No Time To Die: First trailer for new James Bond film debuts The letter, titled No Time for Indecision, continued: ""With a month to go before No Time to Die opens worldwide, community spread of the virus is likely to be peaking in the United States. ""There is a significant chance that cinemas will be closed, or their attendance severely reduced, by early April. Even if there are no legal restrictions on cinemas being open, to quote M in Skyfall, 'How safe do you feel?'"" Their request came as Disney cancelled plans for a red carpet gala to launch its streaming service, Disney+, in the UK. The event, which was due to take place on Thursday 5 March, was called off ""due to a number of media attendee cancellations and increasing concerns at the prospect of travelling internationally,"" the company explained. Acknowledging that the decision had been made out of an ""abundance of caution"", it said alternative plans, including webcasts, would be put in place for interviews with actors and Disney executives. No Time To Die marks Daniel Craig's swansong as James Bond A similar level of caution prompted Page and Leigh's open letter to the Bond producers. They cited particular concern over the UK premiere set for 31 March, suggesting that with numbers gathering at London's Royal Albert Hall expected to top 5,000, ""just one person, who may not even show symptoms, could infect the rest of the audience"". ""This is not the type of publicity that anyone wants."" The pair wrote that delaying the release until the summer wouldn't be a huge hardship for the companies involved. ""It's just a movie. The health and wellbeing of fans around the world, and their families, is more important. We have all waited over four years for this film. Another few months will not damage the quality of the film and only help the box office for Daniel Craig's final hurrah."" The letter was addressed to producers EON, and the film companies MGM and Universal. The BBC has approached the various parties for comment.

"Smart cameras and baby monitors can be watched by criminals over the internet by default, security chiefs warn. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is advising people to tweak the settings after buying them. Easy-to-guess default passwords might let a hacker secretly observe a home through connected devices, it said. The NCSC's technical director, Dr Ian Levy, warned while the devices were ""fantastic innovations"", they were vulnerable to cyber-attackers. There are many examples of devices being accessed without permission. In one,the attacker spoke to a young girl, pretending to be Father Christmas. In another, a couple from Leeds had been watched thousands of times online without their knowledge. And security researcherseasily breached an adult toy that had a camera attached, in 2017. The new guidance for owners of smart cameras suggests three steps: changing the default password, which is often an obvious word like ""admin"" or ""00000"" to an unguessable, unique one keeping the camera's software, sometimes called firmware, updated switching off features that let you check the cameras remotely, if you don't need or use it This video can not be played How a couple were spied on by thousands This warning suggests growing concern about the potential dangers posed by the ""internet of things"". As connected devices move into people's homes and everyday lives, cyber-security risks are becoming intensely personal, with challenges in protecting people's data and privacy. Cameras that provide details of what is going on inside your house are a prime example. One of the problems is the companies making these devices often try to make them cheap and fast to capture the new market - and security is often an afterthought, if it is thought about at all. The problem is leading towards not just more warnings such as this one but also new laws to mandate security standards. Consumer group Which?, which hashighlighted security flaws in the past in children's toysand other smart devices, backed the new advice. It says ""mandatory security requirements and strong enforcement"" are needed. In January,the government announced plans to bring in a new law,externalto require all manufacturers selling smart devices in the UK to obey new rules. But while such regulations are ""a positive step"", some experts believe they could go further. Additional steps could include mandatory two-factor authentication, according to Blake Kozak, a smart home analyst with Omdia. ""More detailed legislation will be needed to enforce best practices by brands, from the components in the devices to the security of data centres,"" he said. The NCSC's latest guidance also recommends disabling UPnP (universal plug and play) and ""port forwarding"" in the settings of your internet router â technologies often used by legitimate services such as online gaming.

"Laura is ineligible for support payments as she was not married to her partner of nine years, Nigel, when he died. They have a son, Noah, together The government must act quickly to ensure unmarried parents can receive bereavement support payments, 18 groups have said in an open letter. Means-tested payments of up to Â£10,000 are made to parents whose husband, wife or civil partner has died. Last month, alandmark legal casefound denying these to co-habiting partners was against human-rights law. The government said losing a loved one was devastating and it was ""carefully considering"" the court judgments. The prime minister has previously vowed to seek to ""remedy"" an ""injustice"". Every year about 2,000 families with children lose out on the payments, according to analysis of Office for National Statistics data by the Childhood Bereavement Network charity, which is behind the open letter. ""We respectfully ask that this be done quickly, as another five families with children fall foul of the current criteria each day,"" the letter says. Laura Rudd's partner, Nigel Glanville, died from a heart attack while out running in February. They had been together nine years and had a two-year-old son, Noah. Nigel - pictured with Laura and Noah - died while out running But because they were not married, Ms Rudd does not qualify for the bereavement support payment. ""Many couples mistakenly believe they have the same legal and financial rights and protections as married couples,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""But when they are struck by tragedy, they are treated like second-class citizens."" The couple had recently bought a house together and Ms Rudd now faces paying the mortgage alone while juggling childcare for her son. She must also find about Â£3,000 to pay for Nigel's funeral, which she says she does not have. She describes the current law as ""heartless discrimination, adding to an already painful process"" - and has beguna petition,externalcalling for change, which has received more than 90,000 signatures. Laura said she had had to register Nigel as ""single"" On the paperwork registering Nigel's death, Ms Rudd said she had been recorded as the ""person organising a funeral"", rather than his partner or the mother of his child. ""According to the law, I don't count,"" she said. ""I even had to register Nigel as 'single'. ""It was a spit in the face for nearly a decade spent together."" In August 2018, the current system was declared incompatible with human rights legislation by the Supreme Court - after hearing the case of unmarried mother-of-four Siobhan McLaughlin. However, the government has taken no action to amend the relevant legislation - which Ms McLaughlin told the BBC showed ""complete disregard for the highest court in land"". She added: ""The government should hang their heads in shame"". A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: ""Losing a loved one is devastating and we are carefully considering the court judgments on cohabiting couples with children.""

"The founders of two of the most popular James Bond fan sites are asking the studios behind the next Bond film to delay its release due to coronavirus. No Time to Die is due for release on 3 April but fans have asked for it to be held back to the summer ""when experts expect the epidemic to have peaked"". The open letter,externalis from the founders of MI6 Confidential and The James Bond Dossier, James Page and David Leigh. ""It is time to put public health above marketing release schedules."" Coronovirus maps and charts: A visual guide to the outbreak No Time To Die: First trailer for new James Bond film debuts The letter, titled No Time for Indecision, continued: ""With a month to go before No Time to Die opens worldwide, community spread of the virus is likely to be peaking in the United States. ""There is a significant chance that cinemas will be closed, or their attendance severely reduced, by early April. Even if there are no legal restrictions on cinemas being open, to quote M in Skyfall, 'How safe do you feel?'"" Their request came as Disney cancelled plans for a red carpet gala to launch its streaming service, Disney+, in the UK. The event, which was due to take place on Thursday 5 March, was called off ""due to a number of media attendee cancellations and increasing concerns at the prospect of travelling internationally,"" the company explained. Acknowledging that the decision had been made out of an ""abundance of caution"", it said alternative plans, including webcasts, would be put in place for interviews with actors and Disney executives. No Time To Die marks Daniel Craig's swansong as James Bond A similar level of caution prompted Page and Leigh's open letter to the Bond producers. They cited particular concern over the UK premiere set for 31 March, suggesting that with numbers gathering at London's Royal Albert Hall expected to top 5,000, ""just one person, who may not even show symptoms, could infect the rest of the audience"". ""This is not the type of publicity that anyone wants."" The pair wrote that delaying the release until the summer wouldn't be a huge hardship for the companies involved. ""It's just a movie. The health and wellbeing of fans around the world, and their families, is more important. We have all waited over four years for this film. Another few months will not damage the quality of the film and only help the box office for Daniel Craig's final hurrah."" The letter was addressed to producers EON, and the film companies MGM and Universal. The BBC has approached the various parties for comment. Some film analysts have suggestedthe coronavirus could wipe $5bn off the global box office,external, with many of China's cinemas already closed and revenues hit in South Korea and Italy.

"Domestic violence offenders in England and Wales could face compulsory lie-detector tests when released from prison under proposed new laws. Those deemed at high risk of re-offending will be given regular polygraph tests to find out if they have breached release conditions. The long-awaited Domestic Violence Bill will also specify that controlling a victim's finances can count as abuse. Alleged abusers will also be banned from cross-examining victims in court. Lie-detector tests - which work by measuring changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and sweat - are not 100% accurate. Why campaigners want 'rough sex' murder defence ban Majority of control abuse cases dropped Lost laws: What bills were dropped at prorogation? But the Home Office said it was already using the tests to monitor high-risk sex offenders andhad found them to be 89% accurate,external. The government also plans to use lie-detector tests on convicted terrorists freed under licence. How widely are lie detectors used? If the Domestic Abuse Bill passes, a three-year pilot will be carried out on domestic abusers which are deemed at high-risk of causing serious harm. If successful, the scheme will be rolled out nationwide. Around 300 offenders will take a lie detector test three months after their release and every six months after that, according to the Home Office. Those who fail the test will not be returned to prison - but they may be jailed if they refuse to take the test or attempt to ""trick"" it, the Home Office added. They can also be returned to prison if the tests show ""their risk has escalated to level whereby they can no longer be safely managed in the community"". Information gathered from failed lie-detector tests is routinely shared with the police who use it to carry out further investigations. Campaigners say action to help the nearly two million victims of domestic abuse in the UK each year, two thirds of whom are women, is long overdue. The Conservatives first proposed tougher measures in their 2017 election manifesto but legislative progress has been slow. The Domestic Abuse Bill was among several proposed laws which fell by the wayside last autumn after Boris Johnson suspended Parliament and MPs subsequently voted for an early general election. The government is now bringing back the legislation, saying MPs will be presented with an ""enhanced"" package of measures that will ""protect victims and punish perpetrators"" of this ""horrendous"" crime. There will also be a ban on perpetrators cross-examining their victims during family court proceedings and a legal duty on councils to find safe accommodation for domestic abuse victims and their children. Charity Women's Aid said this could be a ""life-saving"" move, but only if it was accompanied by guaranteed funding for specialist women's services - including for ""marginalised"" groups in society, which it estimates will cost about Â£173m a year. While welcoming many of the initiatives, children's charities warned that some families with children risked ""falling through the cracks in support"". ""The bill risks dividing victims into 'haves and have nots',"" said Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan. ""Children are the hidden victims of domestic abuse, suffering trauma that can last a lifetime. ""I'm disappointed that while the Domestic Abuse Bill may improve access to refuges, it will not help the majority of victims and children who remain in the family home."" Campaigners say refuges need to be properly funded The NSPCC's senior policy officer Emily Hilton said it was ""extremely disappointing that the bill in its current form fails to protect children from the devastating impact of living with domestic abuse, leaving thousands at continued risk because the help they deserve is not in place"". The Home Office said the UK's new domestic abuse commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, would consider what support the government can provide children who have been affected by domestic abuse. The legislation will also enshrine a new definition of domestic abuse in law that recognises economic abuse - when a perpetrator controls a victim's finances - as a specific type of the crime. Court protection orders banning perpetrators from contacting a victim or forcing them to take part in alcohol or drug treatment programmes may also be introduced. Support for migrant domestic abuse victims will also be reviewed, while ministers will consider what more can be done to stop the so-called ""rough sex"" defence being used by perpetrators in court. The majority of the measures in the Domestic Abuse Bill will apply only to England and Wales, but it will create a specific new criminal offence in Northern Ireland of controlling or coercive behaviour, already on the statute book in the rest of the UK. Certain provisions in the bill also apply to court proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland.

"Twitter has told its employees to work from home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. In a blog post, the social media giant said it was mandatory for staff in Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea to work remotely. The company also said it was ""strongly encouraging"" all of its 5,000 employees around the world to not come into work. It comes a day after the firm banned all non-essential business travel and events for its workers. The company had already announced that it was pulling out of this month's South by Southwest media conference in Austin, Texas. Twitter's head of human resources Jennifer Christie said: ""Our goal is to lower the probability of the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus for us - and the world around us."" Markets rebound after last week's dive BA and Ryanair cut flights as bookings drop Global growth âcould halveâ because of coronavirus The post also highlighted that Twitter has been developing ways to work from home for some time: ""While this is a big change for us, we have already been moving towards a more distributed workforce that's increasingly remote. We're a global service and we're committed to enabling anyone, anywhere to work at Twitter."" Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey has long-supported remote working and in November announced plans to live in Africa for up to six months of this year. The move is similar to measures put in place by many companies in Asia as the virus sweeps the region, but goes further than most big American businesses as they respond to the outbreak. Other leading technology companies, including Facebook and Google, have postponed or cancelled conferences in the US. Facebook has also joined Twitter by pulling out of South by Southwest. Staff at Google's European headquarters in Dublin will work from home on Tuesday as the company tests its preparedness for a potential outbreak in Ireland, but most of the 8,000 workers are expected to return to their desks on Wednesday. At the same time companies, including telecoms operator A&T and banking giant Citigroup, have restricted international travel, especially to Asia. The announcement comes as deaths due to the coronavirus around the world have passed 3,000 as the outbreak spreads from Asia to the US, Europe and the Middle East.

"G7 finance ministers including UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak will take part in a conference call on the economic impact of coronavirus on Tuesday at 12:00 GMT. Central bankers could also be involved in the call, and I understand the current plan is to produce a joint statement acknowledging the potential impact on growth and agreeing to work together. This has raised expectations of a round of global interest rate cuts, to help bring confidence back to the world economy, reeling from the real and feared impact of the growing coronavirus epidemic. Already the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) anticipates that global growth could fall to its slowest growth rate since the financial crisis. Chinese measures of manufacturing activity have collapsed to record lows in February. There are some concerns that world central bankers may not have enough ammunition to help in such concerted action. Indeed there is a fundamental issue that a feared global pandemic can not be solved by looser monetary policy. US Stock Markets surged by over 5% after early news of the meeting.

"US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin led a conference call with finance chiefs from other major economies Finance ministers from the G7 group of nations have said they will use ""all appropriate policy tools"" to tackle the economic impact of coronavirus. The group of major economies said in a joint statement they were monitoring the outbreak and ready to deploy ""fiscal measures"". It follows warnings the economic impact could tip countries into recession. On Tuesday, Bank of England boss Mark Carney said the virus could produce a ""large"" but temporary hit to UK growth. Central bankers and finance ministers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US held a conference call on Tuesday, led by US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and US Federal Reserve boss Jerome Powell. ""Given the potential impacts of Covid-19 on global growth, we reaffirm our commitment to use all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth and safeguard against downside risks,"" they said. ""Alongside strengthening efforts to expand health services, G7 finance ministers are ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate, to aid in the response to the virus and support the economy during this phase.

""G7 central banks will continue to fulfill their mandates, thus supporting price stability and economic growth while maintaining the resilience of the financial system."" On Monday, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned the global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year because of the virus. The influential think tank forecast growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% in November, but it said a longer ""more intensive"" outbreak could tip many countries into recession. There were also sharp falls on global stock markets last week as factory activity in China contracted. Mark Carney expects 'disruption not destruction' Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Carney told MPs that the virus was ""beyond the containment phase"", before adding the economic effects in the UK could last up to six months. But he said he expected to see ""disruption not destruction"" and added that the Bank was ready to help businesses and households adjust. Mr Carney hands over his role to Andrew Bailey on 16 March, and said the two had been in constant contact in order to have a smooth transition. Stock markets have rebounded this week amid signs that governments and major central banks will work together to tackle the economic hit of coronavirus. The US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have said they are ready to help stabilise markets, after the recent volatility. And both Australia and Malaysia cut interest rates on Tuesday as a result of the outbreak. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates to a record low of 0.5% because of the ""significant effect"" of the outbreak on the country's economy. Malaysia's central bank - Bank Negara Malaysia - cut its rates to 2.5%, saying: ""The ongoing Covid-19 outbreak has disrupted production and travel activity, especially within the region.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Keeping the country safe is the government's overriding priority"" Up to a fifth of the workforce may be off sick during the peak of a coronavirus epidemic in the UK, the government says inits latest plans.,external Police may need to focus on only the most serious crimes and maintaining public order if the virus spreads. The military could also provide support to emergency services if needed. The government's response is in its first stage - containing the outbreak - with the number of UK cases rising from 39 to 51 on Tuesday. Out of the positive cases, 12 people have since recovered. Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy It is ""highly likely"" the UK will see further infection, the prime minister has warned, and the next phase of government contingency planning will be to do with delaying the spread of the virus. If the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, becomes widespread, some non-urgent hospital care may be delayed to focus on treating those who are infected, while recently retired doctors and nurses may be called back to work. Other possible measures include school closures, reducing large-scale gatherings and working from home. HOW IS THE UK PLANNING FOR AN OUTBREAK:How prepared are we? WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide HOW TO SELF-ISOLATE:What you need to know WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that widespread transmission of the virus across the UK was becoming ""more likely"" and urged people to ""act on official medical advice"". Meanwhile, 12 new cases of coronavirus have been announced in England, eight of whom had travelled from Italy, and one each from Germany, Singapore, Japan and Iran. The patients are from London, Hampshire, Northamptonshire, Bury, Wirral, Greater Manchester and Hull. Consultancy firm Deloitte said one of its employees had tested positive for the virus after returning from Asia. A spokesman said one of the floors in its UK offices was affected. A British woman has also been diagnosed with the virus at a hotel in Tenerife that was hit by an outbreak of the virus last week. About 90,000 people have been infected globally since the outbreak of Covid-19, with cases in more than 50 countries and more than 3,000 deaths. A British man who was infectedon the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japanbecame the first UK citizen to die from the virus last week. The Queen wore gloves as she awarded the CBE to actress Wendy Craig The Queen was seen wearing white gloves when she carried out an investiture at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The palace would not confirm if the decision was linked to the coronavirus outbreak. It's a finely balanced judgement - not wanting to scare the public but being straight with them about what might happen and how intervention to limit the spread of the virus might affect their everyday lives. The government has chosen to make no secret of its assumption that things could well get significantly worse - after all the coronavirus plan published today is entitled ""a guide to what you can expect across the UK"". If medical experts are assuming widespread transmission of the virus ministers can hardly hide that from the public. Preparing secret contingency plans for school closures and then risking an uncontrolled leak might worry people more. The plan, though, contains few details of how new powers might be used and how the NHS might find the beds and staff to cope with an increased number of very sick patients. In the weeks ahead there will be increasing questions about the measures which have been flagged up with the launch of the plan. While the vast majority of patients in the UK will have a mild to moderate illness, similar to seasonal flu, a minority will require hospital care and a small proportion could die, the government's plans warn. There are no estimates given in the plans but they do warn of an increase in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with existing health conditions. Young children can become infected and ""suffer severe illness"", but overall the illness is less common in the under-20s. It is possible an outbreak could come in multiple waves, the government said. Wales' chief medical officer has suggested cases of coronaviruscould increase from April with a peak in May or June.

There arefour stages to the government's response, which also includes mitigating the impact of the virus once it becomes established and a research programme to improve diagnostics and treatment for the disease. Boris Johnson reiterated on Tuesday that the ""single most important thing"" people could do was wash their hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. He added: ""I want to stress that for the vast majority of the people of this country, we should be going about our business as usual."" This video can not be played Do face masks work? And other coronavirus questions answered Mr Johnson said schools should stay open ""if possible"" and follow advice from Public Health England. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ordered Treasury officials to work up plans to support the public health response, businesses and the economy in his Budget on 11 March. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said Labour would seek to work ""constructively"" with the government. However, he has called for emergency legislation to ensure those working in the gig economy are guaranteed sick pay, and for the government to provide emergency funding to support the NHS through the outbreak. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has warnedthe NHS was already at 94% bed occupancybefore coronavirus hit. Mr Hancock told MPs that people who needed to self-isolate to protect others were entitled to sick pay. He added that resources had been increased to the NHS, but did not rule out the government taking future action if needed. In other developments: European markets have climbed for a second dayafter fears over coronavirus affected shares, and Bank of England governor Mark Carney said policymakers stand ready to support the British economy Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said there were currently no plans to postpone the London Marathon nor to restrict public transport England's Six Nations game against Waleson Saturday and Scotland's against France on Sunday will go ahead, however England prop Mako Vunipola has gone into self-isolation as a coronavirus precaution and will not join the squad UK supermarkets have said they have ""well-rehearsed contingency plans"" to deal with the outbreak and ensure continued availability in stores. G7 finance ministers have saidthey will use ""all appropriate policy tools""to tackle the economic impact of the virus TheTokyo 2020 Olympic Games could be postponedto the end of the year, according to the country's Olympic minister As of Tuesday morning, the Department of Health said 13,911 people had been tested in the UK, of which 13,860 were negative. The outbreak originated in China's Hubei province in December before spreading globally. The battle plan stops short of predicting how many people would be infected in an epidemic in the UK. Worst case scenario modelling suggests 80% of people can become infected when there is a new virus like this. But officials believe it will not be this high. The evidence suggests just over half of people infected develop symptoms and 1% of those infected could die. The elderly and those with existing health conditions are the most at risk. If there is a widespread transmission - which seems highly likely at this stage - it could take two or three months to peak. The peak would last two or three weeks and about 50% of people who become infected could become infected in those peak weeks. There would then be a period of two or three months of declining cases, although the battle plan acknowledges there could be multiple waves. The government is likely to use its most drastic measures at its disposal just ahead of the peak in an attempt to flatten it. What questions do you have about the UK's preparations?

"Greggs said its vegan sausage roll had helped boost sales Greggs boss Roger Whiteside has said his firm would pay staff who have to self-isolate because of coronavirus. ""Our default position is that we pay contract hours. We don't have any zero contract hours,"" he told BBC's Today. The firm's policy is in contrast to some other firms, which say they will only pay the legal minimum. He said Greggs' policy could be reviewed if coronavirus became a ""big problem"". The comments came as Greggs posted a 13.5% rise in 2019 sales to Â£1.168bn. The sandwich chain's success was helped by the popularity of its new vegan range, but the baker saw a significant slowdown last month as storms kept customers away. And Greggs also cautioned there is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of coronavirus. Pre-tax profits rose to Â£108.3m from Â£82.6m in 2018,the company said.,external Eight charts on how coronavirus has hit the global economy Greggs' policy for staff who are ordered to stay at home if they been in contact with an infected person is in contrast to some other companies. Last week Wetherspoons, one of the UK's biggest employers, saidstaff would be subject to regular statutory sick pay rulesif they had to self-isolate. Under statutory sick pay rules, an employee is not paid for the first three days of absence, and then only if they earn at least Â£118 a week. Should I self-isolate and how do I do it? Boris Johnson urged to let Greggs workers keep bonus Greggs picks Just Eat for home deliveries Greggs: How its vegan sausage roll stormed social media Health Secretary Matt Hancock has sent guidance to UK employers telling them thatstaff who have been asked to self-isolate are entitled to take the time as sick leave. Michele Piertney, of the independent arbitration service Acas, said people would not get sick leave as a matter of course if a medical expert put them into quarantine. Many casual or agency workers may be entitled to sick pay, but self-employed people are not.Citizens Advice says people on zero-hours contracts can still get sick payand should ask their employer. Dave Prentis, general secretary of the Unison union, has written to Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey asking her to change the rules around sick pay. He was speaking after fears that zero-hours workers would go into work, even if they were supposed to be self-isolating, to ensure they got paid. ""The government must bring in emergency measures so these low-paid workers are protected financially, particularly those caring for the most vulnerable in society,"" said Mr Prentis. ""It should be made compulsory for employers to give them sick pay, even if they're not officially eligible."" The startling success of Greggs - rising sales for six years in a row, a rapid expansion in geographical coverage and a share price that has doubled in three years - is one of the enduring puzzles of British business. General retailers have been in retreat across the board, and general bakers have been squeezed by tough competition from supermarkets and booming coffee chains like Pret a Manger and Costa. If the formula is not quite right, disaster awaits, as the dramatic failure of Patisserie Valerie proved. Despite all this Greggs has prospered. Why? Part of the answer is that Greggs has the formula right - it has constantly tweaked what it sells to get the price and range right, and has not been afraid to follow trends. It has also been cute with its marketing, using social media to give the chain an image that belies its traditional roots. The magic ingredient though, has been its attitude to staff and customers. Chief executive Roger Whiteside says the company's ""default position"" when staff are off work is to pay. It has fixed hours contracts, not zero hours, and when its stores were closed by floods recently, it continued to pay staff who could not come to work. It has paid out big bonuses when the times are good - 10% of profits, so Â£13m this year - and has just reworked its internal culture statement after an extensive consultation with staff. For customers there is the ""Greggs Pledge"", which promises the company will be run for their good as well. But this does not mean the company operates in some feelgood happy zone. There is also a pragmatic edge, with the warning that while it intended to pay workers who self-isolate because of coronavirus, that largesse could not continue indefinitely. Justin Tomlinson, a work and pensions minister, said the current advice for workers with no sick pay who had to self-isolate was to claim universal credit,the Guardian reports.,external The impact of coronavirus could hit Greggs' figures in 2020. ""We made a very strong start to 2020 in January, but in February saw a significant slowdown in sales growth as a result of the storms that have affected the UK,"" said Mr Whiteside. ""There is some uncertainty in the outlook, particularly given the potential impact of coronavirus. This aside, we expect to make year-on-year progress and will do so from a strong financial position."" What are the social distancing rules?

"Rainfall from Storm Ciara left the village of Mytholmroyd in Yorkshire's Calder Valley devastated for the second time in five years Last month was the wettest February in the UK since records began in 1862, according to the Met Office. The UK received an average of 209.1mm of rainfall, 237% above the average for the month between 1981 and 2010. Elsewhere, a survey suggested that almost a quarter of people felt that climate change was the ""most pressing issue facing the UK"". The representative sample of 1,401 people also suggested that ""climate concern"" had doubled since 2016. During February, storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge all delivered a vast volume of rainfall over parts of the UK. UK Floods: Learning lessons from the past Protecting your home from flooding Eye-in-sky offers UK floods insight Storm Dennis also delivered the second highest UK average daily total in a dataset that dates back to 1891. Ciara and Jorge also dropped enough rain to feature in the top 0.5% of days for UK average rainfall. ""Having three such widespread extreme rainfall events in the same calendar month is exceptionally rare,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the National Climate information Centre. ""Met Office ground-breaking research has contributed to a growing body of evidence that [suggests] extreme rainfall is a significant risk factor for the UK, and that climate change has increased the likelihood of extreme rainfall events."" Astudy by Cardiff University's Understanding Risk Group,external, based on 1,401 nationally representative respondents, suggested that the issue and impacts of climate change was of growing concern among members of the public. Twenty-three percent of those questioned said climate change was the most pressing issue facing the UK in the next two decades, second only to Brexit (25%). Concern about climate change had also soared, with 40% - twice as many as in 2016 - of the respondents saying they were ""very or extremely worried"" about the issue. It also found in its sample group that climate scepticism was low, with 64% of respondents feeling that Britain was already feeling the effects of change, compared with 41% in the 2010 survey. People in the UK are getting more concerned about heatwaves and warming, the survey shows Prof Nick Pidgeon, one of the study's authors, said that the increased activism and media coverage of the issue meant that he was not surprised about the growing concern about climate change among people. However, he was ""really surprised"" about people's attitude towards climate risks, such as heatwaves and warming, which had ""radically changed"" since it was last featured in a survey back in 2013. ""In the last [survey], it was pretty clear that the 'heat reference' was not something people saw as part of climate change for the UK,"" he told BBC News. ""That has now changed, and to us, that's very important to the policy and climate adaptation message."" Although the survey was carried out in October 2019, before the global spread of the coronavirus, Prof Pidgeon said concern about climate change was becoming established in people's minds, and a paradigm shift towards greater environmental awareness was occurring in society. Prof Pidgeon said the findings of the study, funded by UK research councils, would be used by the UK Climate Change Committee, which advises the government on the matter. Dr Kate Lonsdale, co-champion of the UK Climate Resilience Programme, observed: ""The scientific consensus is increasingly clear that climate risks are increasing in likelihood and severity. ""Now we have evidence that people in Britain see these risks are relevant to their lives today rather than something that will happen to people in the future and in other places. The arrival of the three named storms during February meant that a number of river systems were unable to cope, resulting in thousands of homes in Yorkshire, Wales and the West Midlands being flooded. John Curtin, executive director for the Environment Agency's Flood and Coastal Risk Management, said the record rainfall and river levels had tested the nation's flood defences, and had been able to protect more than 80,000 homes. However, he added: ""Every flooded home is a personal tragedy, and with a changing climate we will need to become more resilient to flooding.""

"Domestic violence offenders in England and Wales could face compulsory lie-detector tests when released from prison under proposed new laws. Those deemed at high risk of re-offending will be given regular polygraph tests to find out if they have breached release conditions. The long-awaited Domestic Violence Bill will also specify that controlling a victim's finances can count as abuse. Alleged abusers will also be banned from cross-examining victims in court. Lie-detector tests - which work by measuring changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and sweat - are not 100% accurate. Why campaigners want 'rough sex' murder defence ban Majority of control abuse cases dropped Lost laws: What bills were dropped at prorogation? But the Home Office said it was already using the tests to monitor high-risk sex offenders andhad found them to be 89% accurate,external. The government also plans to use lie-detector tests on convicted terrorists freed under licence. How widely are lie detectors used? If the Domestic Abuse Bill passes, a three-year pilot will be carried out on domestic abusers which are deemed at high-risk of causing serious harm. If successful, the scheme will be rolled out nationwide. Around 300 offenders will take a lie detector test three months after their release and every six months after that, according to the Home Office. Those who fail the test will not be returned to prison - but they may be jailed if they refuse to take the test or attempt to ""trick"" it, the Home Office added. They can also be returned to prison if the tests show ""their risk has escalated to level whereby they can no longer be safely managed in the community"". Information gathered from failed lie-detector tests is routinely shared with the police who use it to carry out further investigations. Campaigners say action to help the nearly two million victims of domestic abuse in the UK each year, two thirds of whom are women, is long overdue. The Conservatives first proposed tougher measures in their 2017 election manifesto but legislative progress has been slow. The Domestic Abuse Bill was among several proposed laws which fell by the wayside last autumn after Boris Johnson suspended Parliament and MPs subsequently voted for an early general election. The government is now bringing back the legislation, saying MPs will be presented with an ""enhanced"" package of measures that will ""protect victims and punish perpetrators"" of this ""horrendous"" crime. There will also be a ban on perpetrators cross-examining their victims during family court proceedings and a legal duty on councils to find safe accommodation for domestic abuse victims and their children. Charity Women's Aid said this could be a ""life-saving"" move, but only if it was accompanied by guaranteed funding for specialist women's services - including for ""marginalised"" groups in society, which it estimates will cost about Â£173m a year. While welcoming many of the initiatives, children's charities warned that some families with children risked ""falling through the cracks in support"". ""The bill risks dividing victims into 'haves and have nots',"" said Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan. ""Children are the hidden victims of domestic abuse, suffering trauma that can last a lifetime. ""I'm disappointed that while the Domestic Abuse Bill may improve access to refuges, it will not help the majority of victims and children who remain in the family home."" Campaigners say refuges need to be properly funded The NSPCC's senior policy officer Emily Hilton said it was ""extremely disappointing that the bill in its current form fails to protect children from the devastating impact of living with domestic abuse, leaving thousands at continued risk because the help they deserve is not in place"". The Home Office said the UK's new domestic abuse commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, would consider what support the government can provide children who have been affected by domestic abuse. The legislation will also enshrine a new definition of domestic abuse in law that recognises economic abuse - when a perpetrator controls a victim's finances - as a specific type of the crime. Court protection orders banning perpetrators from contacting a victim or forcing them to take part in alcohol or drug treatment programmes may also be introduced. Support for migrant domestic abuse victims will also be reviewed, while ministers will consider what more can be done to stop the so-called ""rough sex"" defence being used by perpetrators in court. The majority of the measures in the Domestic Abuse Bill will apply only to England and Wales, but it will create a specific new criminal offence in Northern Ireland of controlling or coercive behaviour, already on the statute book in the rest of the UK. Certain provisions in the bill also apply to court proceedings in Northern Ireland and Scotland.

"Smart cameras and baby monitors can be watched by criminals over the internet by default, security chiefs warn. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is advising people to tweak the settings after buying them. Easy-to-guess default passwords might let a hacker secretly observe a home through connected devices, it said. The NCSC's technical director, Dr Ian Levy, warned while the devices were ""fantastic innovations"", they were vulnerable to cyber-attackers. There are many examples of devices being accessed without permission. In one,the attacker spoke to a young girl, pretending to be Father Christmas. In another, a couple from Leeds had been watched thousands of times online without their knowledge. And security researcherseasily breached an adult toy that had a camera attached, in 2017. The new guidance for owners of smart cameras suggests three steps: changing the default password, which is often an obvious word like ""admin"" or ""00000"" to an unguessable, unique one keeping the camera's software, sometimes called firmware, updated switching off features that let you check the cameras remotely, if you don't need or use it This video can not be played How a couple were spied on by thousands This warning suggests growing concern about the potential dangers posed by the ""internet of things"". As connected devices move into people's homes and everyday lives, cyber-security risks are becoming intensely personal, with challenges in protecting people's data and privacy. Cameras that provide details of what is going on inside your house are a prime example. One of the problems is the companies making these devices often try to make them cheap and fast to capture the new market - and security is often an afterthought, if it is thought about at all. The problem is leading towards not just more warnings such as this one but also new laws to mandate security standards. Consumer group Which?, which hashighlighted security flaws in the past in children's toysand other smart devices, backed the new advice. It says ""mandatory security requirements and strong enforcement"" are needed. In January,the government announced plans to bring in a new law,externalto require all manufacturers selling smart devices in the UK to obey new rules. But while such regulations are ""a positive step"", some experts believe they could go further. Additional steps could include mandatory two-factor authentication, according to Blake Kozak, a smart home analyst with Omdia. ""More detailed legislation will be needed to enforce best practices by brands, from the components in the devices to the security of data centres,"" he said. The NCSC's latest guidance also recommends disabling UPnP (universal plug and play) and ""port forwarding"" in the settings of your internet router â technologies often used by legitimate services such as online gaming.

"Voters across America are preparing to take part in the biggest day of the 2020 election so far. More than a year after the first Democratic candidates joined the race to take on Donald Trump, we've now reached Super Tuesday. Fourteen states will vote on which Democrat they want to run in November's election. Bernie Sanders is in the lead after the early contests. By Wednesday, we could have a clearer picture of who the nominee will be. Democrats across the US have been taking part in a series of caucuses (essentially party meetings, where you vote publicly at the end) or primaries (secret ballots) to pick their preferred candidate. Bernie Sanders's success has come as a bit of a surprise. The Vermont senator lost out to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race, buthe isn't a typical Democrat by any means(in fact, he sits as an Independent in the Senate). He's a staunch left-winger, so may struggle to convince the party's moderates if he becomes the candidate. He's also 78, and suffered a heart attack in the autumn. But he's proven extremely popular in the primaries so far across many age groups and ethnicities, and all the momentum is on his side. The handful of moderate Democrats running have split the vote, so it's made it hard for any of them to break out (and this has helped Sanders build up a lead). One of them, former vice-president and early favouriteJoe Biden, underwhelmed before winning convincingly in South Carolina on Saturday. However, he has since seen a swell in momentum after centrist rivalsPete Buttigieg, andAmy Klobucharquit the race to endorse him. Sanders does not have the left lane to himself either -Elizabeth Warren, the experienced Massachusetts senator, shares several of his policy objectives but has not lived up to expectations. So might any of these candidates win the election in November? Honestly, it's too close to call, and there are so many unknown factors. It's all about the delegates. Let's say Candidate A gets the most support in one state. Candidate B does OK, but not as well. Candidate A is then awarded the most delegates, and Candidate B fewer. The number of delegates available differs in each state. Later in the summer, those delegates will then vote for their candidate to become the Democratic nominee. The target for any candidate is to reach an unbeatable majority of1,990 delegates. This is where Super Tuesday comes in. This video can not be played Why Alexis and Amira could help decide the US election Up to now,only 155 delegateshave been awarded in four states. On Super Tuesday, a massive1,357 delegateswill be distributed, and 14 states are voting. The two most populous, California and Texas, will take part - the former for the first time on Super Tuesday. Here's what is at stake in each state - the smallest to the largest - with some bonus nuggets of trivia thrown in. Who will do best?A no-brainer: Bernie Sanders. He is one of the state's senators, after all. Who could do well?Honestly? There's a chance no-one except Sanders will cross the 15% threshold of votes and get any delegates. He is extremely popular in his home state and won the 2016 primary here with 86% of the vote (though he eventually lost the nomination to Hillary Clinton). We could see the first results from here at about 19:00 local time (midnight GMT). One piece of contextIn a poll by Vermont Public Radio in February,almost a third of people said the economy, jobs and cost of living were among the main issues,externalon their minds - although Vermont has the joint-lowest unemployment rate in the country, at 2.3%. State bird?Hermit thrush Who will do best?We're going to start sounding repetitive, but polls point to Bernie Sanders. In 2016, he won more than double the number of delegates claimed by Hillary Clinton here. Who could do well?There are more contenders than in 2016 which means Sanders' lead won't be as large. But billionaire Michael Bloomberg and Joe Biden are polling far behind. One piece of contextThis isn't the only thing on the ballot on Super Tuesday in Maine. There's also a referendum on whether to reject a law that would block religious and philosophical objections to vaccinations. State animal?Moose Who will do best?Clue: his name is an anagram of Desire Banners. Sanders won here convincingly in 2016. Who could do well?It's unlikely anyone will challenge Sanders. The most recent poll put Bloomberg in a distant second and former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg in third, before he dropped out. Could Bloomberg win votes that might have gone to Buttigieg, and tighten the gap on Sanders? One piece of contextUtah has not voted for a Democrat in the presidential election since 1964, when it picked Lyndon B Johnson. So whoever comes out on top here may not take the state in November. State gem?Topaz A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses Five charts that explain the Democratic race Who will do best?A recent poll by Hendrix College in Arkansas suggested Bloomberg's plan of concentrating on Super Tuesday states could pay off here. Who could do well?Biden and Sanders possibly, although it's a close-run thing. Forecasting site FiveThirtyEight gives Biden a stronger chance - the vote could be split fairly evenly. One piece of contextIt might not matter who Democrats pick: Arkansas has opted for a Democrat in a presidential election only twice in 40 years (and even then, it was local boy Bill Clinton, twice). State dinosaur?Arkansaurus fridayi Who will do best?It's tough to say. Biden, maybe just. Who could do well?Bloomberg and Sanders, according to Oklahoma polling group Sooner last week. One piece of contextFracking is a big issue here, and Sanders and Warren (who was born in Oklahoma City) have both proposed measures to ban it. The underground disposal of waste water used in fracking has led to a rise in earthquakes in this part of the US. State beverage?Milk Who will do best?We're in safe Biden territory. He has the support of plenty of senior Democrats in Alabama, and is widely liked among African Americans there. Who could do well?Biden's lead in the polls looks fairly comfortable, but Bloomberg and Sanders appear most likely to challenge him. One piece of contextRepublicans are also deciding who will run in November's Senate race, where they are very hopeful of ousting Democrat Doug Jones (and making it harder for Democrats to win the Senate later this year). The favourite right now is Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump's former attorney general. State amphibian?Red Hills Salamander The candidates hoping to unseat Trump Which celebrity has endorsed whom? Who will do best?It's close. FiveThirtyEight suggests Biden's chances here have improved a lot over the past few days. Who could do well?There has been very little polling here, but it could well be Sanders, who was a distant second to Hillary Clinton here in 2016. One piece of contextIn Tennessee, who votes may be a bigger issue than who wins - it has one of the worst voter turnout rates in the US. In the last presidential election, just over half of registered voters turned out, 10 points below the national average. State wild animal?Raccoon Who will do best?FiveThirtyEight gives Sanders a seven in eight chance of winning most votes here. You may notice that a picture is starting to form. Who could do well?The site puts Biden in a distant second, with Elizabeth Warren just behind him. One piece of contextOnce a Republican stronghold, out-of-state migration and population growth has turned Colorado increasingly ""blue"" - a Democratic tilt that extends down the ballot. In its latest predictions, election forecaster Sabato's Crystal Ball changed its rating of the state's US Senate race from ""toss up"" to ""leans Democratic"". State cactus?Claret Cup Cactus How Bernie Sanders always beats the odds Who will do best?It was all set to be Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar until she withdrew on Monday. She has now endorsed Biden, so... maybe Biden? Who could do well?Sanders had been close behind Klobuchar in second, and is likely to pick up a decent amount of delegates here. One piece of contextThis part of the US was badly hit by Donald Trump's trade war with China - advocacy group Tariffs Hurt The Heartland said businesses in Minnesota had to pay $797m (Â£604m) more in tariffs as a result. Will that translate into more support for Democrats in this election? State mushroom?Morel Who will do best?Sanders, maybe. But it will be close. Who could do well?Elizabeth Warren, but it might be embarrassing if she doesn't win, given she is the senior senator for the state. Buttigieg's withdrawal may help her. One piece of contextA massive 40% of the candidates left in the race (two people) live in Massachusetts - as well as Warren, the other is Michael Bloomberg, who lives in Medford. Despite actor Michael Douglas campaigning for him there, he is not expected to do especially well here. State fish?Cod Who will do best?This will be a really interesting one to follow. The vote could be split fairly evenly between Sanders, Bloomberg and Biden. Who could do well?See above. One piece of contextWatch the results in the Washington DC suburbs. This suburban vote will be crucial across the country in November's election (as it was in the 2018 mid-terms). How will the nationwide favourite, Bernie Sanders, perform there? Will moderates in the suburbs warm to him? State dog?American foxhound Who will do best?It's quite a similar picture to neighbouring Virginia, and will also be worth following - it's close between Sanders and Biden. Who could do well?Bloomberg was polling well here at one point, but is drifting behind a little by now. One piece of contextThis will also be a battleground state in November. As with Virginia, watch the crucially important suburbs of cities like Charlotte and Raleigh. But watch who they vote for, and whether that person ends up becoming the nominee. The way the votes go here in Novembermighthelp decide the election. State fruit?Scuppernong grape Who will do best?We're into the big league now. It's very close between Sanders and Biden here. Either way, it looks likely Sanders will claim a large amount of delegates and by the time the results come in from Texas, his lead could be big. Who could do well?It is likely to be a good night for Biden here too. Elizabeth Warren is third or fourth in most polls. One piece of contextThere's reason to think that the so-called sleeping giant of the Texas Hispanic vote - now almost two million voters - is about to wake up. In the 2018 midterms, 46.9% of registered Hispanic voters turned out, a leap from 24.4% in 2014. State crustacean?Texas Gulf Shrimp Who will do best?If Sanders really does have an eight in nine chance of winning most votes here, as FiveThirtyEight predicts, you might as well call him the nominee. This is where Sanders' appeal to his ""multiracial coalition"" pays off - he looks like he could do well with African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans here. Who could do well?Right now, Biden looks like being a distant second. One piece of contextThis will be a Super Tuesday debut for California. Lawmakers moved the state's primary up a month from its traditional spot in June in an effort to increase California's impact. The shift could matter: the country's most populous state will award 30% of the delegates on Super Tuesday.

"The WHO insists containment measures can still ""push this virus back"" The world is in ""uncharted territory"" on the coronavirus outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. Its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was ""unique"" but could be contained with the right measures. Deaths globally have passed 3,000. Most are in China but over the past day there were nine times more new infections outside China than inside. Dr Tedros insisted: ""We can push this virus back"". He also said stigma was more dangerous than the disease itself. The WHO chief said the development of the Covid-19 disease globally was not a ""one-way street"" and could be combated if countries acted quickly and effectively - starting with containment measures. ""There is no choice but to act now,"" he said. One of the countries worst affected outside China - Italy - on Monday saw a jump in its death toll from 34 to 52. WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS?A simple guide WAYS TO PREVENT CATCHING IT:How to wash your hands WHERE ARE WE WITH A VACCINE?Progress so far A VISUAL GUIDE TO THE OUTBREAK:Virus maps and charts Dr Tedros's main advice was that each country had to look at their own situation as there was no one-way-fits-all means of tackling the outbreak. ""Each country must have its own approach but it must start with containment,"" he said. This was a ""unique virus with unique features"" and the WHO would have expected wide contagion by now, but containment measures had appeared to work, the doctor said. Of the 62 countries reporting cases of infection, 38 of them had 10 or fewer, he added. Israel set up a dedicated polling station where people under quarantine could vote in Monday's general election ""Around eight countries have not reported new cases for two weeks and have been able to contain the outbreak,"" he said. China had also shown containment was possible even in countries with a large number of cases. The WHO would continue to monitor whether the outbreak should be called a global pandemic, Dr Tedros said. South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan remain the greatest concern. A WHO staff member has tested positive in Iran, although the symptoms are mild, Dr Tedros said. He also added: ""Stigma, to be honest, is more dangerous than the virus itself. Let's really underline that. Stigma is the most dangerous enemy."" There are now almost 90,000 cases worldwide in about 70 countries, although the vast majority - just under 90% - remain in China, and most of those are in Hubei province, where the virus originated late last year. Of the nearly 8,800 cases outside China, 81% are in four countries - Iran, South Korea, Italy and Japan. Italy raised its death toll by 18 on Monday, with 1,835 confirmed cases, most of them in the Lombardy and Veneto areas of the north. Iran reported another 12 deaths, taking the total there to 66. They included Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a high-ranking adviser to the country's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, Iranian media reported. Health officials in the US state of Washington said on Monday that four more people had died, bringing the total there to six. They are the only deaths in the US so far. This video can not be played Empty shelves as coronavirus ""panic-buying"" hits Australia President Donald Trump said he had told pharmaceutical companies to accelerate work on a vaccine, while New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, warned it was ""inevitable"" more people would test positive in the city. In the UK,where there are 39 confirmed cases, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the virus was ""likely to become more significant in the days and weeks ahead"", after holding a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee. How is the UK planning for an outbreak? Kuenssberg: Now it's serious for No 10 Portugal, Iceland, Jordan, Tunisia, Armenia, Latvia, Senegal and Andorra also reported their first confirmed cases on Monday. In other developments: The European Centre for Disease Controlconfirmed the risk level in the EU had increased from ""moderate"" to ""moderate to high"",external The global economy could grow at its slowest rate since 2009 this year due to the outbreak, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned. Markets had a rollercoaster ride in Europe that was initially mirrored in New York,although the Dow Jones later ended a significant 5.1% higher. Concerns about the outbreak last week wiped more than $5tn (Â£3.9tn) from global stocks France confirmed another 61 more cases on Monday - 191 overall. One more death brought the nation's total to three Qatar, Ecuador, Luxembourg, the Czech Republic and Ireland were among countries that confirmed their first cases over the weekend The nation on Monday reported two more deaths, taking the total to 28. About 60% of the country's more than 4,000 confirmed cases are members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus religious sect. Members are believed to have infected one another and then travelled around the country, apparently undetected This video can not be played The leader of Shincheonji Church apologised for its role in the spread of coronavirus The sect's leader, Lee Man-hee, got on his knees and bowed at a news conference to apologise. ""Although it was not intentional, many people have been infected,"" said the 88-year-old leader. ""We put our utmost efforts, but were unable to prevent it all."" Prosecutors in South Korea have been asked to investigate Mr Lee on possible charges of gross negligence. China reported 42 more deaths, all in Hubei. The province has registered more than 90% of the global fatalities. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan China pollution clears amid coronavirus slowdown How deadly is the coronavirus? Only eight of the newly reported cases of infection were outside Hubei, suggesting containment was working. The 206 new cases reported nationwide on Sunday represented the lowest number of daily cases since 22 January. A spokesman from China's National Health Commission said the next stop would be to ""focus on the risks brought by the resumption of work"". The WHO says the virus appears to particularly affect those over 60, and people already ill. In the first large analysis of more than 44,000 cases from China, the death rate was 10 times higher in the very elderly compared to the middle-aged. But most patients have only mild symptoms and the death rate appears to be between 2% and 5%, the WHO said. By comparison, seasonal flu has an average mortality rate of about 0.1%, but is highly infectious - with up to 400,000 people dying from it each year. Other strains of coronavirus, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), have much higher death rates than Covid-19.

"Rainfall from Storm Ciara left the village of Mytholmroyd in Yorkshire's Calder Valley devastated for the second time in five years Last month was the wettest February in the UK since records began in 1862, according to the Met Office. The UK received an average of 209.1mm of rainfall, 237% above the average for the month between 1981 and 2010. Elsewhere, a survey suggested that almost a quarter of people felt that climate change was the ""most pressing issue facing the UK"". The representative sample of 1,401 people also suggested that ""climate concern"" had doubled since 2016. During February, storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge all delivered a vast volume of rainfall over parts of the UK. UK Floods: Learning lessons from the past Protecting your home from flooding Eye-in-sky offers UK floods insight Storm Dennis also delivered the second highest UK average daily total in a dataset that dates back to 1891. Ciara and Jorge also dropped enough rain to feature in the top 0.5% of days for UK average rainfall. ""Having three such widespread extreme rainfall events in the same calendar month is exceptionally rare,"" said Dr Mark McCarthy, head of the National Climate information Centre. ""Met Office ground-breaking research has contributed to a growing body of evidence that [suggests] extreme rainfall is a significant risk factor for the UK, and that climate change has increased the likelihood of extreme rainfall events."" Astudy by Cardiff University's Understanding Risk Group,external, based on 1,401 nationally representative respondents, suggested that the issue and impacts of climate change was of growing concern among members of the public. Twenty-three percent of those questioned said climate change was the most pressing issue facing the UK in the next two decades, second only to Brexit (25%). Concern about climate change had also soared, with 40% - twice as many as in 2016 - of the respondents saying they were ""very or extremely worried"" about the issue. It also found in its sample group that climate scepticism was low, with 64% of respondents feeling that Britain was already feeling the effects of change, compared with 41% in the 2010 survey. People in the UK are getting more concerned about heatwaves and warming, the survey shows Prof Nick Pidgeon, one of the study's authors, said that the increased activism and media coverage of the issue meant that he was not surprised about the growing concern about climate change among people. However, he was ""really surprised"" about people's attitude towards climate risks, such as heatwaves and warming, which had ""radically changed"" since it was last featured in a survey back in 2013. ""In the last [survey], it was pretty clear that the 'heat reference' was not something people saw as part of climate change for the UK,"" he told BBC News. ""That has now changed, and to us, that's very important to the policy and climate adaptation message."" Although the survey was carried out in October 2019, before the global spread of the coronavirus, Prof Pidgeon said concern about climate change was becoming established in people's minds, and a paradigm shift towards greater environmental awareness was occurring in society. Prof Pidgeon said the findings of the study, funded by UK research councils, would be used by the UK Climate Change Committee, which advises the government on the matter. Dr Kate Lonsdale, co-champion of the UK Climate Resilience Programme, observed: ""The scientific consensus is increasingly clear that climate risks are increasing in likelihood and severity. ""Now we have evidence that people in Britain see these risks are relevant to their lives today rather than something that will happen to people in the future and in other places. The arrival of the three named storms during February meant that a number of river systems were unable to cope, resulting in thousands of homes in Yorkshire, Wales and the West Midlands being flooded. John Curtin, executive director for the Environment Agency's Flood and Coastal Risk Management, said the record rainfall and river levels had tested the nation's flood defences, and had been able to protect more than 80,000 homes. However, he added: ""Every flooded home is a personal tragedy, and with a changing climate we will need to become more resilient to flooding.""

"Tesco is issuing new cards to 600,000 Clubcard account holders after unearthing a security issue. The supermarket giant said it believed a database of stolen usernames and passwords from other platforms had been tried out on its websites, and may have worked in some cases. No financial data was accessed and its systems have not been hacked, it added. It said this was a precautionary measure and apologised for the inconvenience. ""We are aware of some fraudulent activity around the redemption of a small proportion of our customers' Clubcard vouchers,"" a Tesco spokesperson said. ""Our internal systems picked this up quickly and we immediately took steps to protect our customers and restrict access to their accounts."" The supermarket said it had emailed everybody potentially affected, that nobody would lose their points and new vouchers would also be issued. How do companies use my reward card data? Tesco Clubcard changes anger customers One of those who received an email was Josh, who works in IT. ""The email was very ambiguous,"" he said. ""I thought it was because I'd just used a new bank card.  I didn't realise it was actually my account details that could have been compromised. ""It worried me - I feel better now it's been clarified."" Others responded in good humour on social media, questioning how much their points would actually be worth to a hacker.

Jake Moore, cyber-security specialist at the firm Eset, told the BBC plenty of people still use simple passwords or similar log-ins for many different platforms. ""Cyber-criminals can do a lot of damage with a large breached list simply containing names and emails or other trivial data,"" he said. ""The big risk is via brute force attacking the accounts where criminals use leaked common password combinations against the emails to try to break into other personal accounts."" Mr Moore suggested using password managers to generate and store uniquely different passwords, and two factor authentication where possible - in which a text message or email code is required as well as the password.
