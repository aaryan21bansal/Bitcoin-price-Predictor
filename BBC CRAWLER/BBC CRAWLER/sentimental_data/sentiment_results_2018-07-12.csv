""I have a wonderful memory of the goal Beckham scored -the free kick he made in the last minute,external- it's one of the most beautiful memories I have."" Ahmad's childhood passion for England - both as a football team and a country - led him to read English Literature at the University of Aleppo. ""I studied a lot about England,"" he said. ""The literature and the culture, and football's a big part of it."" The 28-year-old become one of the millions of refugees who migrated to Europe following the turmoil in Syria.

"Imagine being so certain of England's footballing greatness you decided to get a permanent tattoo celebrating the Three Lions winning the World Cup. So confident were you, you scorned the idea of tattooing the visage of an admired player or a patriotic trio of lions. No, you decided to have the date added, along with the proclamation: ""World Cup Winners"". And then it all went wrong. What now? The left thigh of Teddy Allen currently sports a drawing of Harry Kane's delighted and slightly-shocked face. Crowned with the words ""Sir Harry"", it is cradled in the sentence: ""World Cup Winners 2018"". The 30-year-old, whose wrist also bears the slogan ""Its [sic] coming home"", decided to get the tattoo after watching England beat Sweden in the quarter finals. Is he planning to get rid of it now his heroes fell against Croatia? No. Teddy Allen said his partner thought he was a ""bit daft"" for having the Harry Kane tattoo His wrist tattoo is less specific about when England will win the World Cup ""It is staying for good,"" Mr Allen, from Biddulph, Staffordshire, said. ""England have done us proud and if you can't see that then you're not worthy of the Three Lions."" Another confident supporter was Jamie Richardson from Leeds. He had a 8in (20cm) design of the World Cup and the legend ""England 2018 World Cup winners"" tattooed on his tummy while watching England's 6-1 win against Panama. He was so sure of England's eventual success he decided at half time to get a tattoo to commemorate their winning the trophy. ""I rang about 10 tattoo shops trying to find someone to do it so early in the competition and eventually one in Castleford agreed,"" he says. ""For me it was like a premonition, as if someone said 'get that tattoo Jamie lad and they'll bring that cup home'. ""I had no doubts whatsoever."" This video can not be played Jamie Richardson says he does not regret his tattoo And now? Mr Richardson is a man with no regrets. ""Of course I'm going to keep it. When I'm 70 years old and retired and in the working men's club with my old mates and we're skint and ordering half-a-lagers they'll say 'Jamie - remember when you got that tattoo all them years ago?' ""They'll say 'let's have one more look' and I'll remember it for the rest of my life. Mr Richardson said he would ""never, ever, ever"" get the tattoo removed ""I have had the best two weeks of my life. I have been so proud to be English and nothing will change that. ""I will never, ever, ever get this tattoo removed."" Although Messrs Allen and Richardson are unlikely to change their minds, astudy published by the British Association of Dermatology,externalindicated about a third of people with a tattoo regretted having it. But tattoo removal can be painful, expensive and time consuming. A laser is used to break down the ink into tiny fragments, which are eventually absorbed into the bloodstream and safely passed out of the body. In the UK, private clinics charge about Â£150 a session to remove a small tattoo and up to Â£800 for a larger one - and the costs mount up. According to the NHS, it can take 10 or more sessions to remove the image and many tattoos cannot be entirely removed. Three out of 100 people will be left with a permanent scar. People can minimise the risk of getting a tattoo they will later rue by going to a reputable studio that is registered with theBritish Tattoo Artists Federation,externalor is endorsed by the Tattooing and Piercing Industry Union, Public Health England or the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health. Most tattoo studios will also insist on identity documents and refuse to work on somebody they believe to be drunk or under the influence of drugs. Maisie Llewellyn, of Cookies Custom Tattooing Studio in Worcester, says they also consider their clients' futures. ""We get a lot of young people coming in wanting tattoos on their hands or fingers. We won't do a tattoo on the hands, fingers or neck unless the client already has tattoos there, just because they're so visible and could have a bad impact on job prospects etc. ""We also refuse to do anything offensive - some people still come in wanting Nazi symbols, that sort of thing, and we won't do that."" What about people who are over-optimistic? ""So long as the client is happy with the design, and it's not offensive, then yes. ""If they are that sure they want 'England: 2018 World Cup Winners', that's absolutely fine."" England fans get player face tattoos England fan gets 'World Cup winners' tattoo.

"Will Croatian fans have Russia's support in the final? As Croatian football fans get ready for the World Cup final at the weekend, some are wondering whether they have been boosted by bringing up the conflict in Ukraine. National pride,the Russian spy poisoning case, andthe Ukraine crisisall had a role in fans' feelings asCroatia defeated England in Wednesday night's semi-final. Meanwhile, some Ukrainians who have been boycotting the World Cup in Russia, are now torn on whether to watch Sunday's game. World Cup 2018: Croatia fans ecstatic after ousting England Shortly after Croatiadefeated Russia on penalties in the quarter finals, defender Domagoj Vida and coach Ognjen Vukojevic - who have each played for FC Dynamo Kiev - dedicated their win to Ukraine on YouTube from their changing room. The clip has been viewed more than 3.5 million times since it was posted on 7 July. A hashtag - #GloryToUkraine - followed, bringing mixed reaction on social media. Ukrainian TV executive Oleksandr Tkachenkopraised the players on Facebook,external, saying it was ""nice they stopped the hosts of this strange World Cup"". Fifa reviewed the video and issued a warning to the players. Ognjen Vukojevic was fined $15,000 (Â£11,360) andsent home by Croatia. Then Vidaappeared to do the same thing again. He has since apologised in a live interview with Rossiya 24 state television after the semi-final.

"Croatia will meet France in the World Cup final after sending England out of the competition Croatia is jubilant. Right before the end of the game, a young man in a red and white Croatia football shirt rushed up to me at the fan zone in central Zagreb. ""If we win, I'm going to jump into that fountain,"" he said. Seconds later, as huge victory cheers filled the square, he plunged in, followed by dozens of others, shouting and splashing with joy. People set off fireworks and flares. ""England is going home - and we are going to the final!"" shouted a girl with red and white checks painted on her face. ""We are such a small country, but we can play football!"" Ecstatic Croatia fans cool their passions in a fountain in central Zagreb Huge crowds watched the game on a big screen in Zagreb's main square ""Nobody expected us to win,"" Marko cried. ""The English media all week were making fun of us, saying that we don't have a chance, but it showed in the field that quality reigned supreme. ""In every single game, they play with 100% of their hearts. It's everything to us."" This is Croatia's moment. It's a country of just over 4 million people, that has produced a team of brilliant players. Croatia's President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic (left) offered a Croatia football shirt to British PM Theresa May at the Nato summit in Brussels As he drank beer, Daniel told me it was very significant for his country. ""Croatians are very proud. The last time we got to the semi-finals in a World Cup was in 1998, just after the war and independence. We show we can win. It's more important for a small country."" Croatia beat England 2-1 to reach World Cup final England fans: 'You gave us something to believe in' England players came of age - Southgate Another fan was more philosophical. ""It's an escape for people,"" he said. ""There are no jobs, no money. The politicians are lining their pockets. But tonight people are happy. It makes them forget their problems for a short time."" One fan, Daniel, told the BBC the victory felt ""more important for a small country"" The players have been feted as national heroes. When the team qualified for the quarter-finals, the Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic paid them a visit in their dressing room, stepping over their kit, to hug several of the players in various states of undress. She later released video footage of her, resplendent in a football shirt, jumping up and down with the players. Croatia's president celebrates quarter final success in the team dressing room Croatia's performance in the World Cup has helped shift the spotlight from the dark cloud of corruption scandals surrounding football in this country and murky management within the Croatian football federation. Croatia has been repeatedly punished by Fifa and Uefa over unruly fans known for throwing flares at matches and chanting fascist slogans. And in March, Croatia's captain,Luka Modric, was charged with perjury. Prosecutors say the Real Madrid midfielder gave false testimony during the trial of one of the most powerful figures in Croatian football, the former head of Dinamo Zagreb, Zdravko Mamic, in a multi-million-euro corruption case. Mamic, who was sentenced to six and a half years in prison, is currently in hiding in Bosnia. Croatian football's Mr Big given jail term How hooligans exposed the ugly rift in Croatian football Modric's lawyer told the BBC that he had done nothing wrong and hoped he would not face trial for perjury after the World Cup. Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren is also being investigated but has not been charged. Croatia midfielder Luka Modric (centre) was charged with perjury in June The more the team wins, the more the fans are likely to forgive - but the problems remain. Back at the beer tent, Daniel told me his country would have to deal with the corruption issues, ""but not today."" ""After this, we must speak about the problems, but today it is more important to talk about Croatia."" ""It's incredible,"" one of the fans shouted. ""I really can't believe it. We're in the finals.

"Mira Sorvino has said a casting director gagged her with a condom when she was aged 16. The actress was auditioning for a horror movie scene, and said in order to scare her, she was tied to a chair and her arm was bruised. ""I was 16 years old, and then he gagged me,"" she said during a podcast for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. ""At the end he takes the gag out of my mouth and he said 'sorry for the prophylactic'."" She added: ""So he had gagged me with a condom. It was so inappropriate and what the heck was a casting director doing with a condom in his pocket in an audition?"" Exploring the casting couch culture of LA Susan Sarandon: Casting couch won't go away Actress speaks out against 'casting couch culture' Oscar-winning Sorvino, 50, did not name the casting director. She said that audition was one of her first introductions into how the acting system works and explained that ""when you're young, you don't question"". Sorvino has been vocal in the past about assault and rape culture in Hollywood ""When you're young, you're like 'Oh, OK I've got to be tough, I've got to be down to really perform.

She also recalled another sexual harassment encounter with an unnamed director. Sorvino said it was one of many instances where she was harassed whilst auditioning, having been told by friends ""you're going to absolutely have to have sex with all kinds of people to advance your career."" When asked about the effect of the #MeToo movement, the Mighty Aphrodite actress believes it's made the public realise how widespread the issue of harassment in the entertainment industry is, and believes it will affect the law.

""Nobody should be made to feel ashamed for mistakes they make when they are young."" Mr O'Mara claimed ""the Labour Party no longer shares my commitment to the true definition of equality and compassion"".

"The discovery was made at the IceCube detector in Antarctica Ghost-like particles known as neutrinos have been puzzling scientists for decades. Part of the family of fundamental particles that make up all known matter, neutrinos hurtle unimpeded through the Universe, interacting with almost nothing. The majority shoot right through the Earth as though it isn't even there, making them exceptionally difficult to detect and study. Despite this, researchers have worked out that many are created by the Sun and even in our own atmosphere. But the source of one high energy group, known as cosmic neutrinos, has remained particularly elusive. Now, in the first discovery of its kind, it turns out that a distant galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole may be shooting a beam of these cosmic neutrinos straight towards Earth. It all starts with IceCube, a highly sensitive detector buried about two kilometres beneath the Antarctic ice, near the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. ""In order to get a measurable signal from the tiny fraction of neutrinos that do interact, neutrino physicists need to build extremely large detectors,"" explains Dr Susan Cartwright, a particle physicist at the University of Sheffield. Measuring cosmic neutrinos against those created closer to home is, she told BBC News, ""like trying to count fireflies in the middle of a firework display"". IceCube is located near the Amundsen Scott base at the South Pole But on 22 September 2017, one of these neutrinos showed up near IceCube's cubic kilometre array and decided to interact with the surrounding material, creating another particle called a muon. Lacking the neutrino's stealth mode, this muon crashed through the ice in the same direction as its progenitor, sparking against other atoms along the way and creating a visible trail that IceCube could capture. ""[IceCube] measures this trail of light,"" explains Prof Albrecht Karle from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was involved in the discovery. ""We can do that quite precisely, so that we can measure the direction of [the neutrino's] track."" Using this, IceCube was able to work out the approximate region of sky that the particle had been travelling from. Within 43 seconds, an alert was dispatched for telescopes to join in the hunt. The Very Large Array listened in to the neutrino's source Two years previously, the IceCube team had decided that rather than hoard their potential findings for publication, they would send out these ""astronomy telegrams"", inviting other researchers to participate in the chase as soon as an event was detected. ""Traditionally in astronomy we looked at images of the sky, like it was static, but in reality it's a movie. All the time there are flashes and things moving and happening. So instead of publishing a paper and having astronomers look three years later at something we report, we went into real time mode,"" says Prof Karle. Eight other observatories trained their eyes and ears on the neutrino's point of origin. The tricky part, explains Prof Karle, is that even though IceCube can work this out to within half a degree of sky, that is still about the size of the Moon as we see it from the Earth's surface. Such a region can encompass a lot of galaxies and other objects. However this time, there was good news. Artwork: a galaxy with a massive black hole at its centre A galaxy with a ""monster"" black hole about 100 million times the size of our Sun, was sitting in exactly the right spot. About four billion light years from Earth, just off the left shoulder of the constellation Orion, this galaxy has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central black hole. As matter falls in to the black hole, vast jets of charged particles emerge at right angles, making them massive particle accelerators. Artwork: The constellation of Orion ""They can extend to almost a million light years, just the jet. Which is of course bigger than the Large Hadron Collider at Cern,"" laughs Prof Karle. It is perhaps unsurprising that the neutrino detected by IceCube arrived with 40 times more energy than particles accelerated at Cern, despite its long journey. This particular galaxy type is known as a blazar, because one of the jets is trained directly towards Earth. ""So we are really in the line of fire. We are staring in to the eye of the monster so to speak,"" adds Prof Karle. Although not originally high on the list of potential cosmic neutrino sources, this makes for strong evidence that blazars do generate the elusive particles. ""This is extremely exciting news,"" says Dr Cartwright, who was not involved in the study. ""We can hope that this observation will be followed by the identification of further neutrinos from flaring blazars."" The findings are published in Science,external 'Superheroes' of the particle world Has US physics lab found a new particle? After their initial detection, the IceCube team went back through previous records of neutrino interactions and found that several more had come from the direction of the same galaxy. ""The chance of this excess of neutrinos arising by chance is less than 0.03%,"" Dr Cartwright adds. Confirming the discovery via the work of other observatories like the Eso's Very Large Telescope in Chile makes it the latest success for multi-messenger astronomy - detections combining electromagnetic information like visual and radio data with signals like gravitational waves and neutrinos.

"Around 300 officers from forces across the country have been brought in for the president's visit A police chief has apologised after it was revealed some officers deployed to work on the US president's visit had to sleep in conditions described as ""an absolute disgrace"". Pictures posted on social media showed rows of camp beds in a gymnasium, to be used for officers after 12-hour shifts policing Donald Trump's visit. Essex Police's Assistant Chief Constable Pippa Mills has said sorry. Alternative accommodation has been found for the officers, she added. The Police Federation had said prisoners in cells would be sleeping in better conditions than its officers when the images came to light, describing the situation as ""not acceptable"". Trump's UK visit begins What is going to happen on Trump's trip? Protests and praise Latest updates on Trump's UK visit Ms Mills apologised to the officers who have come from across the UK to join the operation, estimated to cost up to Â£10m.

Simon Kempton, the organisation's deputy treasurer in England and Wales, said earlier: ""These officers have been asked to leave their families to travel to another part of the country to help protect the public and the president and all they expect in return is to be treated with some dignity and respect."" Labour MP Louise Haigh had raised the issue in the House of Commons, said 100 female officers had just four toilets between them and 300 male officers had just five toilets. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the venue in question was thought to be Colchester Garrison, where about 300 officers had been based.

"Mr Spicer visited wax figures of Mr Trump and the First Lady at Madame Tussauds in New York last April Ex-Trump spokesman Sean Spicer has described his former boss as ""a unicorn, riding a unicorn over a rainbow"" in his forthcoming memoir. The first spokesman of the Trump White House writes glowingly of the president but also contradicts his assessment of former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. ""I don't think we will ever again see a candidate like Donald Trump,"" he says. The Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President is due to be released 24 July and has been praised by Mr Trump. ""His high-wire act is one that few could ever follow,"" Mr Spicer writes,according to preview excerpts obtained by the Guardian,external. ""He is a unicorn, riding a unicorn over a rainbow... His ability to pivot from a seemingly career-ending moment to a furious assault on his opponents is a talent few politicians can muster."" The book contradicts Mr Spicer's previous comments about Mr Manafort, who resigned in August 2016 amid allegations he had not declared payments originating in former Soviet countries where he had worked as a political lobbyist. Mr Manafort was jailed last month and is charged with money laundering, tax fraud, failing to register as a foreign agent, and obstruction of justice. Mr Spicer had said during a White House press conference that Mr Manafort ""played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time"", echoing Mr Trump's claim that his former campaign chairman had only been with the campaign ""for a short period of time"". Sparks fly in FBI agent's Trump testimony Manafort: Trump's former campaign chair ""Paul brought a much-needed maturity to the Trump campaign,"" Mr Spicer says, adding that before he joined ""there was no semblance of a campaign structure, just a few, distraught, overworked people constantly barking into their phones."" ""Paul immediately set up and staffed the political and communications operations necessary to take on the Clinton machine."" Mr Spicer also writes that the US Department of Homeland Security met with the campaign in October 2016 to assure them ""that there was no way to infiltrate or manipulate the outcome of a national election"",according to the Daily Mail,external. However, US intelligence has concluded that Russian hackers targeted Democratic email servers, and committed other cyber-attacks in an effort to aid Mr Trump's campaign. ""Seeming to believe that Clinton would win, they implored us to publicly express confidence in the integrity of the voting process, system, and outcome,"" writes Mr Spicer.

"A giant balloon depicting Donald Trump as a baby will not be allowed to fly over his Turnberry golf course, police have said. The Trump Baby balloon has already been given permission to fly over central London during the US president's visit to the UK. But Police Scotland refused a request for the 6m (20ft) high balloon to also take to the skies over the golf course. Mr Trump is expected to play at Turnberry on Saturday. Police said the blimp would not be allowed at the course as an air exclusion zone was in place during the president's visit. But they said they would be happy to discuss other options for the balloon - leaving open the possibility that it could be flown at one of the other protests against Mr Trump's visit which are being held elsewhere in Scotland. Live coverage as Trump arrives in the UK What is going to happen on Trump's trip? Trump 'fine' with UK protests ahead of visit UK protests to greet Trump's 'state visit on the sly' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said: ""Clearly there is a significant protection operation in place for the president and this includes restrictions to the airspace in the Turnberry area. ""We need to ensure there is a balance between protection and public safety and the public's right to peacefully protest. ""With that in mind and on this occasion we are unable to grant permission for the balloon to fly in that area, however we are in discussion with the applicants about possible alternatives."" Donald Trump and his wife Melania arrived at Stansted Airport for the start of their UK visit on Thursday afternoon London mayor Sadiq Khan gave permission for the Trump Baby, which depicts the president as an angry infant wearing a nappy, to fly above Parliament Square after campaigners raised Â£16,000 to pay for it. Thousands of people signed a petition urging police and Scottish ministers to grant similar permission for Turnberry. Protestors said they will still transport the balloon to Scotland overnight, and will fly it elsewhere on Saturday. Matthew Butcher, an anti-Trump campaigner and one of the ""babysitters"" of the balloon, said: ""I think that the thing that the Trump balloon does is that it brings an element of fun to the protests, but it also gets under Donald Trump's very thin skin."" He said the stunt aims to ""hold up a mirror"" to Mr Trump's ""toddler-like politics"". Trump's mother: From a Scottish island to New York's elite Trump golf course 'destroyed' dunes The US president arrived at London Stansted Airport shortly before 14:00 on Thursday, and is due to meet Prime Minister Theresa May and the Queen over the next two days. Mr Trump - whose mother was from the Isle of Lewis - is due to touch down in Scotland on Friday night before spending the weekend at the famous South Ayrshire course, which he bought in 2014. The president will begreeted by Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who has insisted the president's visit will be a chance for the country to ""strengthen vital links"" with one of its most important allies. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has in the past been an outspoken critic of Mr Trump, with a Scottish government spokesman saying there are no official meetings planned between the two leaders. The Marine One helicopter carried Mr and Mrs Trump from the airport to the London residence of US ambassador Woody Johnson Mr Trump said earlier this week that the UK is in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Mrs May stays as prime minister after Boris Johnson and David Davis quit the cabinet over her Brexit policy. Speaking ahead of his trip, the president described Turnberry as ""magical"" and ""one of my favourite places"", adding: ""My mother was born in Scotland and I have great friendships over there"". He went on to say: ""There might be protests, but I believe that the people in the UK, Scotland, Ireland, I think those people, they like me a lot. ""And they agree with me on immigration - that's why you have Brexit in the first place, because of immigration."" Eric Trump said he was hopeful his father would be able to make a last minute trip to his Menie course in Aberdeenshire Mr Trump's son, Eric, arrived in Aberdeen earlier on Thursday to play at the nearby Menie golf course, which is also owned by the family. The president is not currently scheduled to visit Aberdeenshire, but Eric Trump hinted that a trip to Menie could still be added to his father's itinerary at the last minute. He said: ""It's still to be decided. I'm certainly going to Turnberry and I'll see him there. I know he loves the east coast, he loves this property more than maybe anywhere else in the world, so I certainly hope he can get out here."" BBC Scotland revealed earlier on Thursday that the Menie course has ""partially destroyed"" the specially protected site it was built on, according to a report by Scottish Natural Heritage. The first of a series of protests over the president's visit was held outside Trump Turnberry on Wednesday, with a small group of activists from Stand Up to Racism Scotland (SUTR) brandishing banners with the slogans ""Trump not welcome"" and ""No to racism, no to Trump"". A large protest against the president will be held in Glasgow's George Square on Friday, with a rally also being held outside the president's Balmedie course in Aberdeenshire on Saturday. Further demonstrations are also expected at Turnberry. A national demonstration planned at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh on Saturday has been given final approval by the city council, and a ""Carnival of Resistance"" will also be held in the Meadows area of the capital.

Protests are also planned in Scotland when he travels to play golf at his Trump Turnberry course. But Drew Liquerman, an American student who lives here in the UK, won't be among the demonstrators. As a member of the political group Republicans Overseas, he's a supporter of the President. Drew says that Donald Trump's visit is a gesture of goodwill to the US as he could just as easily hold more rallies in America ""I'm excited to welcome the President of the United States,"" says Drew, who's 21. He believes Mr Trump's visit shows his respect for the UK, as his political career would get more of a boost from staying at home and campaigning in America. ""It's the office of the President that's coming to the UK. He's not coming here for himself. ""Donald Trump could do perfectly fine doing rallies in the US."" He says his loyalty is to the position of president, not the person doing the job. ""I would be happy to see Hillary Clinton if she was president visit the UK. I was happywhen Obama did it."" Evi Steyer, who's 26, is also an American living in the UK. She's planning to attend anti-Trump protests. She works for an asset management company and is a member of the Democratic Party. Evi voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Evi believes that inviting Donald Trump to visit the country suggests the UK government supports his more controversial policies Evi believes that ""by hosting this president, the UK government is condoning his policies."" ""There comes a time when citizens and governments around the world have to draw a line in the sand,"" she says. For Evi, problems on the US borders - such as young childrenbeing separated from their families- is one of her key concerns about the US administration. She says they have ""turned a blind eye"" to the situation. Evi is also excited to see the planned ""Trump baby"" blimp which is due to fly over Londonand Scotlandwhen he visits. ""I think it's funny. If a balloon flying over London makes people laugh, I think that's absolutely worth it,"" she says.

"The US is a major trade and investment partner for the UK - by some measures the biggest of all. One issue on President Trump's agenda while he is in Britain will be whether - and how - to deepen that relationship. So just how intertwined are the two economies? As a single country the US is the largest export market for the UK. It is, however, well behind the EU when the bloc is viewed as a single market. There is some logic to viewing the EU in that way, as it has a single external trade policy and most of its members share the same currency. As a supplier of goods and services to the UK, the US comes in second, behind Germany. Viewed from the other side, from President Trump's perspective, the UK is an important trade partner to the US. For both imports and exports it comes behind the immediate neighbours, Canada and Mexico, with which the US has a trade deal: the North American Free Trade Agreement. The US also does more trade with China (at least it does before the full effects of new tariffs are felt). As a source of imports, the Germany and Japan are also ahead of the UK. Bilateral UK/US trade has grown in the past few years, after period of relative stagnation in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The chart below uses data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which suggest the UK exports more to the US than it imports. The US figures suggest the reverse. In principle they cannot both be true. The ONS says there aremany reasons why the figures might diverge,externaland they are working on it. The goods traded cover a wide range, but there a few types that stand out: aircraft coming (or flying) into the UK, as well as scientific instruments. Going the other way to the US: cars and works of art. There is a substantial trade in both directions in medicines and power generation equipment. There is also an important trans-Atlantic trade in services, including finance, business services and tourism. The interconnections are also apparent in the data on foreign direct investment (FDI). This means either establishing a business operation, or taking a controlling interest in one already up and running - usually defined as holding of 10% or more. For Britain,the US is the largest source of FDI,external, as a single country. However, depending on exactly what is being measured, the EU as a whole can come out ahead. The US is also the largest destination for FDI abroad by British firms. Looked at from the US end, the UK is an important investment partner. The UK came second, behind the Netherlands, as a place that American companies invest, accounting for 13% of the total. And they seem to like operating here. TheUS State department says,externalthe UK ""hosts more than half of the European, Middle Eastern and African corporate headquarters of American-owned firms"". The UK is the largest source of FDI in the US, accounting for 15%. Why is Donald Trump visiting the UK?

"The Rock shopping centre in Bury, Greater Manchester, said queues were building at 10:45 BST A cheap teddy offer which left shoppers with young children queuing for up to eight hours amid chaotic scenes has been abandoned over ""safety concerns"". Build-A-Bear Workshop was offering UK customers a chance to buy any bear, which can cost up to Â£52, for the price of their child's age. At Leeds' White Rose Shopping Centre police were called when queues of ""about a mile long"" formed. The company said the response had been ""overwhelming and unprecedented"". There have also been reports of long queues in US shopping centres, where the American company was also putting on the same promotion on Thursday. Birmingham's Bullring shop was among those that shut early Police were called to the White Rose Centre in Leeds due to the popularity of the ""pay your age"" event Many of the company's stores - including Sheffield's Meadowhall shopping centre, Birmingham's Bullring, Telford and Basingstoke - had to shut for the rest of the day following demand. Leeds shopper Paul Shaw said: ""Crazy scenes at the White Rose - Build-A-Bear is in chaos. ""Queuing from the store, all the way outside, approximately five-hour queue.

The queue was already enormous by the time I got there on my day off with my son. Someone told us that people had been queuing there since 06:30 BST and one woman told us she had travelled for more than an hour to get there because it was her closest store. We waited an hour-and-a-half but it was too much for my little boy and I thought there would be no bears left so we took a Â£12 voucher that could be redeemed another time.

The US brand was established in 1997 and has made more than 160 million teddy bears to date. Build-A-Bear stores offer children a chance to design, stuff and dress their own teddy bear. Customers can even add sounds and scents to their toy. Basic bears cost between Â£12 and Â£27 with limited edition toys costing more than Â£50. Clothing for teddies also ranges from Â£4.50 to Â£15. Amanda Bailey, 42, from Mickleover, Derbyshire, started queuing outside the Derby shop with her two daughters, aged two and five, at 09:10 and did not get inside until 12:40. ""I thought I would give the queue an hour and then you get sucked in,"" she said. ""Once inside it took a further two hours to get her bears because of the ""stuffing counter queues"". She said although she saved quite a bit on the cost of the Â£21.50 she bought for both children, she added: ""When I look back I will probably think, 'what have I done that for?', especially with what I will end up paying for parking."" Amanda Bailey queued for hours at the Derby store with daughters Paige (pictured) and Amelia Jolene Quarrell, 34, of Swadlincote, said she and her friend spent about the same length of time queuing both outside and inside the Derby store.

Some customers praised the efforts of staff working at stores around the country who remained calm during the situation and offered vouchers to those who could not get in for the event. Customers in the Derby shop said it took them another two hours to buy bears once in the store because of extra queues Gemma Butler, marketing director at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, said: ""This was an ill thought-out and unprofessional promotional execution, one that not only risks their own brand reputation, but has the potential to bring the wider marketing sector into disrepute.""

"The police cordon on Thursday evening was near Zizzi restaurant in Castle Street The policing minister should help with the ""extraordinary level of demand"" facing officers following major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, Wiltshire's police commissioner said. Angus Macpherson said he had spoken to policing minister Nick Hurd to ensure the ""increased pressure"" was addressed. The comments were made shortly before police cordoned off a road in Salisbury after a man was reported to be ill. Officers later said there was ""no concern"" for the man's health. On Friday, police said the 33-year-old was cautioned after being arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. A test for the nerve agent Novichok was carried out on the man at Salisbury District Hospital, but proved negative. Police added there was also no ""wider risk to the public"". Mr Macpherson said the resources of forces across the country were also being stretched by the US presidential visit, the Royal International Air Tattoo and large summer events. He said Mr Hurd had reassured him ""the current approach to policing cordons, in relation to the ongoing major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, is under review to help me ensure that policing services more widely across Wiltshire and Swindon remain unaffected"". Police cordoned off the street after a man fell ill Mr Macpherson added: ""Wiltshire Police has received great support from almost every police force across the county since the first major incident was declared in March. ""Alongside the chief constable I couldn't be more grateful for the help and support of those forces, however, with more and more rest days being cancelled and annual leave requests being put on hold, we must now explore a different approach."" Police cordoned off Castle Street in Salisbury at about 18:20 BST on Thursday after a man in his 30s was reported to be ill, near the Zizzi restaurant where ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia dined before they fell ill. It was reopened just after 21:00 BST. On Twitter, Salisbury Police said the man had been taken to Salisbury District Hospital and was ""fully assessed by medical staff"". ""We understand that our initial response to the incident may have looked alarming, but we hope you appreciate why we needed to take this highly precautionary measure,"" they added.

"This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner We all know what it's like - having to play nice with the person you don't have very much in common with, because it's the right thing to do. Knowing that lots of people you DO like would be upset if you don't put on a show. Well, how about this: having to ""play nice"" publicly with a person you don't have very much in common with, when they have said that the way you are trying to do your job doesn't really work. Add in the embarrassment if they happen to be the leader of the free world. LIVE: Latest updates on Donald Trump's UK visit From the moment of his election, Donald Trump was an awkward friend for Theresa May. He runs towards a fight. She does everything in public to avoid one. Well, just before they were due to appear alongside each other on UK soil he publicly, and at length, gave a ""both barrels"" verdict on her most important policy. Her approach to Brexit has been to slowly, gently, incrementally, carry the Ming vase across one side of the room to another on a slippery floor. To talk about being pragmatic, to smooth over the contradictions, to do whatever it takes to get to the other side, without smashing that vase (her party and the country) to bits. In walks President Trump, to call out one of the claims that No 10 has been making of late - in essence, smashing the vase to bits. Inan interview with The Sun,external, he shoots down the chances of a trade deal with the US if she sticks to her carefully crafted compromise Brexit plan. The black tie event was held on the first day of President Trump's visit That matters because the government has been clinging to the idea of trade deals with countries outside the EU as one of the benefits of Brexit, and claiming that the choice in the Chequers deal to stay close to the EU doesn't exclude those opportunities. This isn't about what side anyone was on in the referendum. In fact, Remainers and Leavers unite in saying the Chequers deal can't live up to all it claims. For former Remainers, it's nuts to think that trade deals with non-EU countries can ever make up for what might be lost. For some Leavers, it's nuts to claim we can make the most of the world outside if we are still sticking to EU rules. And President Trump drives a bulldozer through the government's central claims about its compromise - that the UK would be able to get decent trade deals with the wider world, while sticking to the EU rules. A lot of this visit has been carefully choreographed, as the prime minister and the president dance around each other. But if the president really wanted to help her build support for her controversial compromise, this isn't the way to do it.

"This video can not be played Trump baby blimp ready to take first steps As the son of immigrants, Donald Trump has his own special relationship with the United Kingdom. His mother, Mary MacLeod, was born and raised in the village of Tong, on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis, on Scotland's wild and beautiful north-western fringe. A less Trumpian upbringing is hard to imagine. Mary's pebble-dashed home was modest to say the least, the traditions of the island strictly and austerely Presbyterian. Lewis is not a place of multiple marriages and glittering golden towers. It owes more to Calvin than to Mammon, more to Wittenberg than to Vegas. On Sundays not so many years ago, swings in the island's play parks were chained up. Ferries could not dock, flights were not allowed to land. Mr Trump is not scheduled to visit Lewis this Sabbath or any other day. He talks rarely and in scant detail about his British mother, who emigrated to New York as a ""domestic"" in the 1930s, preferring to stress the influence of his hard-driving German father, Fred Trump. Instead the president and his wife Melania Trump will travel to Trump Turnberry, down the water from Glasgow on the Ayrshire coast, one of his two Scottish golf resorts, where the first couple will stay from Friday until Sunday when they depart for a high-stakes summit in Helsinki. White House aides won't comment on whether Mr Trump will play golf during his visit, saying only that he will use the time to prepare for the meeting in Finland with Russia's President Vladimir Putin. But the weather forecast is good - Scotland is enjoying its best summer in living memory - and the links at the newly refurbished complex will surely prove inviting. Before he can pick up his clubs, though, duty calls in the form of queen and prime minister. For Mr Trump, the route to the ultimate British clubhouse - in this case Windsor Castle - was strewn with obstacles. As soon as the property tycoon became president, Theresa May - still prime minister at the time of writing, despite bitter divisions in her Conservative party over the UK's plans to leave the European Union - was off to Washington like a shot. Mrs May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House, a week after the inauguration in January 2017, and was mocked at home for holding hands with the president and for her obvious eagerness - critics called it desperation - to secure a trade deal with the United States after Brexit. Nonetheless she persisted with the flattery, playing to Mr Trump's ego and taste for pomp by carrying with her an invitation from Queen Elizabeth for a full state visit to the UK, an honour granted to only two other US presidents, Barack Obama and George W Bush. Trump and Merkel in new war of words Trump wants Nato to double spending target Is this the US president most like Trump? Immediately the invitation was controversial. That very day Mr Trump stunned the world - including, it seemed, Mrs May - by announcing a plan to halt all immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations. The new president's supporters were delighted. Hostility to immigration had been a central plank of Mr Trump's campaign and had arguably played a critical role in his victory. His approach attracted some sympathy in the UK, not least with those who saw Brexit as an opportunity to regain control of Britain's borders, but Mr Trump's opponents were louder and they spoke with their pens. In just a few days a petition demanding the withdrawal of the Queen's invitation (such invitations formally bear the monarch's name, but in practice they are extended by the government) gained more than a million signatures. A month later that number had reached 1.86 million and parliament held a (purely symbolic) debate about whether the visit should be cancelled. The pressure intensified after Mr Trump broke with diplomatic tradition by intervening in British politics - repeatedly, directly and publicly. His predecessor Mr Obama did so too, making statements about Scottish independence and Brexit. But while those comments were controversial, they were in line with the UK government's own views on both subjects at the time. Mr Trump's were not. First, the president outraged many Londoners with his response to a terror attack on the British capital in June 2017. With seven (later eight) people dead and dozens injured on London Bridge, Mr Trump criticised the response of the city's Mayor Sadiq Khan as ""pathetic"" because Mr Khan, who is a Muslim, had told people they had nothing to fear from increased police activity in the hours after the attack. This video can not be played Donald Trump challenged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ test Although privately appalled, Mrs May continued to resist calls for the state visit to be postponed. Then, last November, the president went even further, retweeting three propaganda videos disseminated by Britain First, a small fascist party on the far right fringes of British politics. Criticised by the prime minister, Mr Trump hit back, telling her ""don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom"". The leader of the opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, described the retweets as ""abhorrent"" and ""dangerous"". In the uproar that followed Mr Trump was reported to have told Mrs May that he no longer wanted to accept the Queen's invitation. In the end - after a great deal more marching up hills only to march down again, including a cancelled trip to open the new American Embassy in London - there will be a visit but it will not be a formal state visit, there will be no open carriage ride with the Queen through the streets of the capital. That would have been a security and public relations nightmare given the promise of mass protest. Instead the British government is trying to deliver a state visit on the sly. Officially this is a ""working visit"" but it will include dinner at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, the ancestral home of Winston Churchill; tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle in Berkshire; and a meeting with the prime minister at her country residence, Chequers in Buckinghamshire. All three venues are easily accessible from, but comfortably outside, London. There will also be military ceremonies, pipes and drums, and a demonstration of joint US-UK defence capabilities. Mr Trump will not, though, be given the honour of addressing the British parliament, the speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow having strongly objected to the idea because, he said, ""opposition to racism and sexism"" were ""hugely important considerations"". Still, British officials are keen to stress what they say is an ""extremely strong"" security and intelligence relationship between the two nations and to point out that the UK is one of the few Nato countries already meeting a commitment to spend two per cent of GDP on defence. The US ambassador to the UK, Robert ""Woody"" Johnson, said he expected Mr Trump and Mrs May to discuss a range of issues including Russian election meddling, which Moscow has denied despite evidence to the contrary, and the attempted murder of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury by means of a nerve agent which has now claimed the life of Dawn Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother-of-three. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Trump protestors urged to be 'peaceful' Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip 'Trump Baby' balloon sparks online row Items also likely to be on the agenda, according to a briefing from a senior source in the British government, include the Middle East, North Korea and relations with China. But Downing Street will be looking for one thing above all else: tangible progress on a post-Brexit trade deal between the world's largest and fifth largest economies. While the EU accounts for about half of the UK's external trade, the US is by far Britain's biggest single trading partner. The desire for a deal is complicated by the president's mercantilist hostility to free trade and the tariffs which he has imposed on the European Union and others. ""We'd like to get started on the negotiation issue,"" says the British government source, cautioning ""we leave the EU on 21 March 2019â¦ we can negotiate but we can't implement"". While Brexit Britain and Trump's America have in common a desire to return to a supposed golden era of independence, to regain control of their own affairs, to restrict immigration, and to reassert their freedom from the constraints of international institutions, they also have significant disagreements: on climate change and Iran to name two glaring examples. The shambolic collapse of the recent G7 meeting in Canada was just the latest illustration of the dysfunction operating at diplomacy's highest levels. Some observers think the UK is in a weak position on this grand stage. ""The irony is that by leaving the EU, the United Kingdom will be less useful to Washington as an ally but it will also need the United States much more,"" said Jeffrey Stacey, a former State Department official under President Obama. ""So May has been thrown into the arms of the most unpredictable US president in living memory,"" he added. Not without protest. Tens of thousands of people have signed up to demonstrate against President Trump's visit to the UK. Events are planned at Blenheim Palace; in central London; at Chequers; in Ayrshire, Edinburgh and elsewhere. Strikingly, the mayor of London, Mr Khan, has given permission for a large balloon depicting President Trump as a snarling, orange baby to be flown over Westminster. The 20ft (6m) high inflatable will rise above the city for two hours. Leo Murray, who is behind the idea that he calls anti-fascist satire, said ""we want to make sure he knows that all of Britain is looking down on him and laughing at him"". British supporters of Mr Trump said the idea was an embarrassment not to the president but to the protesters. But Mr Murray appeared unconcerned, saying: ""Trump Baby will fly!""

"This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner Theresa May has welcomed Donald Trump to the UK with a lavish black-tie dinner - during which she made a case for a new trade deal with the US. The US president and the first lady were given a red carpet reception at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire. It is Mr Trump's first visit to the UK since he won the 2016 election. Protesters gathered outside the US ambassador's residence in London, where the Trumps are staying tonight, and near Blenheim Palace. Police estimated there were about 1,000 people demonstrating near the palace, the birthplace of wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Trump: Nato states to up defence funding What is going to happen during Trump's trip? His visit comes as the governmentpublished its plans for the UK's relations with the EUafter Brexit. Earlier this weekMr Trump saidit was ""up to the people"" whether the prime minister stayed on after two cabinet ministers resigned over her Brexit policy. There was a large police presence outside the gates to Blenheim Palace Mrs May noted that more than one million Americans work for UK-owned firms, telling Mr Trump: ""As we prepare to leave the European Union, we have an unprecedented opportunity to do more. ""It's an opportunity to reach a free trade agreement that creates jobs and growth here in the UK and right across the United States. ""It's also an opportunity to tear down the bureaucratic barriers that frustrate business leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. ""And it's an opportunity to shape the future of the world through co-operation in advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence."" UK protests greet Trump's 'state visit on the sly' Police beds for Trump visit 'a disgrace' Trump raises questions over Brexit plans But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called Mr Trump ""dangerous and inhumane"", saying his policies were putting millions of lives at risk. Criticising Mrs May for her warm welcome, he said: ""Theresa May has invited President Trump to our country at a time when his dangerous and inhumane policies are putting the lives and wellbeing of millions of people at risk. ""We are committed to dialogue, including of course with those we strongly disagree with, and in government we would find a way to work with his administration while also standing up for our values. ""But instead the Tories are rewarding President Trump with a red carpet welcome. ""We must show Trump and the Tories that we can and we will defeat the politics of division."" Mrs May greeted Donald Trump as he left his car The Trumps landed at Stansted Airport, Essex, at 13:50 BST before a helicopter took them to Winfield House in Regent's Park, where they are staying as guests of the US ambassador. They stayed there for several hours before travelling to the 18th Century palace near Woodstock for the evening's events. They were booed and jeered as their helicopter left Regent's Park, with protesters who had gathered to demonstrate against the president's visit shouting ""shame on you"" and banging pots and pans, in the hope he would hear them from behind the fence erected around the perimeter of Winfield House. John Rees of the Stop the War group addressed the protesters, saying of Trump: ""He's a wrecking ball for race relations, he's a wrecking ball for prosperity, he's a wrecking ball for women's rights, he's a wrecking ball for any peace and justice in this world and we have to stop him."" This video can not be played US President Donald Trump arrived at Stansted Airport for a two-day working visit Mrs May and her husband Philip, joined by around 150 guests, waited outside Blenheim Palace in the sunshine for the president and first lady.

The president briefly held Mrs May's hand as they walked up the stairs to the palace, in a repeat of her visit to the White House whenthey held hands for a short time. Business leaders from sectors including finance, travel, food and defence were among the guests at dinner. Cabinet ministers including the newly-appointed Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Chancellor Philip Hammond were also present. They were entertained by The Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, playing British and American hits of the 20th Century during dinner. Only one person, the digital entrepreneur and philanthropist Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, has publicly refused the invitation. Protesters near Blenheim Palace making their feelings known Protests were also held outside the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park They were given a best-of-British dinner, featuring Scottish salmon, Hereford beef fillet and strawberries with clotted cream ice-cream. During the dinner, Mrs May said: ""Mr President, Sir Winston Churchill once said that 'to have the United States at our side was, to me, the greatest joy'. ""The spirit of friendship and co-operation between our countries, our leaders and our people, that most special of relationships, has a long and proud history. ""Now, for the benefit of all our people, let us work together to build a more prosperous future."" She stressed that the US and UK are ""not just the closest of allies, but the dearest of friends"". Perhaps in a reference to Mr Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin on Monday, she said that Britain and the US work closely together in the interests of their shared security, ""whether through targeting Daesh [Islamic State group] terrorists or standing up to Russian aggression"".

"Mr Trump's interview comes as protesters - both anti and pro-Trump - prepare to march on Friday Theresa May and Donald Trump are holding talks at her country retreat Chequers, following his controversial comments on thePM's Brexit plan. In aninterview with the Sun,,externalMr Trump said the PM's plan would ""probably kill"" any trade deal with the US. But on Friday, he said he and Mrs May had ""probably never developed a better relationship"" than during this trip - his first to the UK as president. Meanwhile, a giant blimp of Mr Trump as a baby is floating in central London. It is part of a demonstration in Parliament Square, one of many due to take place across the UK on Friday. Live: Latest on Trump's visit to the UK Kuenssberg: Trump gives May's plan both barrels How the papers are covering Trump's visit Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan In his interview with the Sun, Mr Trump also said that former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - who disagrees with the PM on Brexit and resigned this week - would make a ""great prime minister"", adding ""I think he's got what it takes"". He also renewed his criticism of London Mayor Sadiq Khan over last year's terror attacks in London, saying he had done ""a terrible job"". Downing Street has not yet reacted to Mr Trump's remarks, but Chancellor Philip Hammond said the talks will be ""very positive"". Theresa Mayhas been making the casefor a US free trade deal, and says Brexit is an ""unprecedented opportunity"" to create jobs in the UK and US. The US president and his wife, Melania, were given a red carpet reception at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire on Thursday evening. This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner They were at a black-tie dinner with Mrs May as news broke of his interview with the newspaper, which said it was conducted while he was in Brussels. After it was published, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the president ""likes and respects Prime Minister May very much"", adding that he had ""never said anything bad about her"". Protesters near Blenheim Palace making their feelings known on Thursday Mr Trump - who has been a long-time supporter of Brexit - told The Sun that the UK's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"". He saidthe Brexit proposalsMrs May and her cabinet thrashed out at the PM's country house Chequers last week ""would probably end a major trade relationship with the United States."" ""We have enough difficulty with the European Union,"" he said, saying the EU has ""not treated the United States fairly on trading"". He also said Mrs May had not listened to his advice on how to do a Brexit deal, saying: ""I would have done it much differently. ""I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn't agree, she didn't listen to me. She wanted to go a different route,"" he said. Tom Newton Dunn, the Sun journalist who interviewed Mr Trump, said the US president seemed ""sensitive"" and knew about the ""Trump baby"" inflatable. ""He's really quite stung by the criticism he's been getting,"" said Mr Newton Dunn. ""He knew all about the baby blimp. I think it hurt him."" This video can not be played The Sun journalist who interviewed Donald Trump says the president ""really cares"" what people in Britain think of him. The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said Mr Trump's interview had ""driven a bulldozer"" through Mrs May's claim that the UK would be able to get decent trade deals with the wider world, while sticking to the EU rules. But Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said things had ""moved on"" since Mr Trump's interview - which was carried out before he arrived in the UK - and the mood at Thursday night's dinner was ""fantastically positive and did focus a lot on trade"". The government does not see Mr Trump's behaviour as ""rude"", said Sir Alan, adding: ""Donald Trump is a controversialist. That's his style."" Trump raises questions over Brexit plans How we're welcoming Donald Trump to the UK Queen and US presidents through history Mayor of London Sadiq Khan defended his decision to allow the giant Trump baby inflatable to fly over London, saying: ""The idea that we limit the right to protest because it might cause offence to a foreign leader is a slippery slope."" And, responding to Mr Trump's criticism of his response to terrorism, Mr Khan said it was ""interesting"" that he ""is not criticising the mayors of other cities"" which have also experienced terror attacks.

"Workers at a Fiat Chrysler plant in Italy are to strike after its main investor decided to pay â¬112m (Â£99.2m) to sign footballer Cristiano Ronaldo for Juventus. Both the football club and the carmaker are controlled by the Agnelli family through their holding company. For the USB union, the decision means Fiat is missing out on investment. It said the firm needed to guarantee the future of thousands of people, ""rather than enriching only one"". The union added that it was ""unacceptable"" that while Fiat Chrysler workers were making ""huge economic sacrifices"", millions of euros were being spent on the purchase of a player. The four-year deal to woo Ronaldo from Real Madrid was announced on Tuesday amid concern that Juventus might have overpaid for the 33-year-old forward. Is Â£99m Ronaldo good value for Juventus? However, football finance expert Rob Wilson, of Sheffield Hallam University, said Juventus should earn more than enough money from Ronaldo to cover the transfer fee and his wages. He added: ""The marketing leverage that Juventus will be able to create will be significant. Added to that the likelihood that he will strengthen the team, it seems plausible that they will be more successful domestically and qualify routinely for the Champions League. That means more sponsors, more TV money and more prize money."" Ronaldo shirts are already on sale in Juventus's home city Born on the Portuguese island of Madeira, where the airport is named after him, Ronaldo has had a successful career at Real Madrid, scoring 450 goals in 438 games for the club. As captain of the Portuguese team in the 2018 World Cup, he scored four goals, including a hat-trick against Spain. Portugal made the last 16 of the tournament, in stark contrast to Italy, who failed to qualify for the first time since 1958. Although Juventus and Fiat Chrysler are run as entirely separate businesses, they are both controlled by Exor, the investment holding of the Agnelli family. The USB union has called for a strike at the Melfi plant in southern Italy, which makes cars including the Fiat Punto and the 500X. Its members will walk out at 22:00 local time on Sunday and remain on strike until 18:00 on the following Tuesday. However, the impact of the stoppage is likely to be limited. The factory is just one of seven Fiat Chrysler plants in Italy and the USB does not represent many workers there. Ronaldo completes Juventus move Is Â£99m Ronaldo good value for Juventus?

"The discovery was made at the IceCube detector in Antarctica Ghost-like particles known as neutrinos have been puzzling scientists for decades. Part of the family of fundamental particles that make up all known matter, neutrinos hurtle unimpeded through the Universe, interacting with almost nothing. The majority shoot right through the Earth as though it isn't even there, making them exceptionally difficult to detect and study. Despite this, researchers have worked out that many are created by the Sun and even in our own atmosphere. But the source of one high energy group, known as cosmic neutrinos, has remained particularly elusive. Now, in the first discovery of its kind, it turns out that a distant galaxy powered by a supermassive black hole may be shooting a beam of these cosmic neutrinos straight towards Earth. It all starts with IceCube, a highly sensitive detector buried about two kilometres beneath the Antarctic ice, near the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. ""In order to get a measurable signal from the tiny fraction of neutrinos that do interact, neutrino physicists need to build extremely large detectors,"" explains Dr Susan Cartwright, a particle physicist at the University of Sheffield. Measuring cosmic neutrinos against those created closer to home is, she told BBC News, ""like trying to count fireflies in the middle of a firework display"". IceCube is located near the Amundsen Scott base at the South Pole But on 22 September 2017, one of these neutrinos showed up near IceCube's cubic kilometre array and decided to interact with the surrounding material, creating another particle called a muon. Lacking the neutrino's stealth mode, this muon crashed through the ice in the same direction as its progenitor, sparking against other atoms along the way and creating a visible trail that IceCube could capture. ""[IceCube] measures this trail of light,"" explains Prof Albrecht Karle from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was involved in the discovery. ""We can do that quite precisely, so that we can measure the direction of [the neutrino's] track."" Using this, IceCube was able to work out the approximate region of sky that the particle had been travelling from. Within 43 seconds, an alert was dispatched for telescopes to join in the hunt. The Very Large Array listened in to the neutrino's source Two years previously, the IceCube team had decided that rather than hoard their potential findings for publication, they would send out these ""astronomy telegrams"", inviting other researchers to participate in the chase as soon as an event was detected. ""Traditionally in astronomy we looked at images of the sky, like it was static, but in reality it's a movie. All the time there are flashes and things moving and happening. So instead of publishing a paper and having astronomers look three years later at something we report, we went into real time mode,"" says Prof Karle. Eight other observatories trained their eyes and ears on the neutrino's point of origin. The tricky part, explains Prof Karle, is that even though IceCube can work this out to within half a degree of sky, that is still about the size of the Moon as we see it from the Earth's surface. Such a region can encompass a lot of galaxies and other objects. However this time, there was good news. Artwork: a galaxy with a massive black hole at its centre A galaxy with a ""monster"" black hole about 100 million times the size of our Sun, was sitting in exactly the right spot. About four billion light years from Earth, just off the left shoulder of the constellation Orion, this galaxy has an intensely bright core caused by the energy of its central black hole. As matter falls in to the black hole, vast jets of charged particles emerge at right angles, making them massive particle accelerators. Artwork: The constellation of Orion ""They can extend to almost a million light years, just the jet. Which is of course bigger than the Large Hadron Collider at Cern,"" laughs Prof Karle. It is perhaps unsurprising that the neutrino detected by IceCube arrived with 40 times more energy than particles accelerated at Cern, despite its long journey. This particular galaxy type is known as a blazar, because one of the jets is trained directly towards Earth. ""So we are really in the line of fire. We are staring in to the eye of the monster so to speak,"" adds Prof Karle. Although not originally high on the list of potential cosmic neutrino sources, this makes for strong evidence that blazars do generate the elusive particles. ""This is extremely exciting news,"" says Dr Cartwright, who was not involved in the study. ""We can hope that this observation will be followed by the identification of further neutrinos from flaring blazars."" The findings are published in Science,external 'Superheroes' of the particle world Has US physics lab found a new particle? After their initial detection, the IceCube team went back through previous records of neutrino interactions and found that several more had come from the direction of the same galaxy. ""The chance of this excess of neutrinos arising by chance is less than 0.03%,"" Dr Cartwright adds. Confirming the discovery via the work of other observatories like the Eso's Very Large Telescope in Chile makes it the latest success for multi-messenger astronomy - detections combining electromagnetic information like visual and radio data with signals like gravitational waves and neutrinos.

"The police cordon on Thursday evening was near Zizzi restaurant in Castle Street The policing minister should help with the ""extraordinary level of demand"" facing officers following major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, Wiltshire's police commissioner said. Angus Macpherson said he had spoken to policing minister Nick Hurd to ensure the ""increased pressure"" was addressed. The comments were made shortly before police cordoned off a road in Salisbury after a man was reported to be ill. Officers later said there was ""no concern"" for the man's health. On Friday, police said the 33-year-old was cautioned after being arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. A test for the nerve agent Novichok was carried out on the man at Salisbury District Hospital, but proved negative. Police added there was also no ""wider risk to the public"". Mr Macpherson said the resources of forces across the country were also being stretched by the US presidential visit, the Royal International Air Tattoo and large summer events. He said Mr Hurd had reassured him ""the current approach to policing cordons, in relation to the ongoing major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, is under review to help me ensure that policing services more widely across Wiltshire and Swindon remain unaffected"". Police cordoned off the street after a man fell ill Mr Macpherson added: ""Wiltshire Police has received great support from almost every police force across the county since the first major incident was declared in March. ""Alongside the chief constable I couldn't be more grateful for the help and support of those forces, however, with more and more rest days being cancelled and annual leave requests being put on hold, we must now explore a different approach."" Police cordoned off Castle Street in Salisbury at about 18:20 BST on Thursday after a man in his 30s was reported to be ill, near the Zizzi restaurant where ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia dined before they fell ill. It was reopened just after 21:00 BST. On Twitter, Salisbury Police said the man had been taken to Salisbury District Hospital and was ""fully assessed by medical staff"". ""We understand that our initial response to the incident may have looked alarming, but we hope you appreciate why we needed to take this highly precautionary measure,"" they added.

"Fatima and Mierna Choucair were victims of the Grenfell Tower Block Fire A 999 operator told a resident of the Grenfell Tower that she could not advise her on whether to leave her 22nd floor flat during last year's fire. Naomi Li did manage to escape through thick smoke. However, her neighbours - three adults and three children - died. London Fire Brigade manager Jo Smith told the public inquiry into the disaster that advising evacuation could have led the residents into danger. LFB guidance says people should stay in their flat unless affected by the fire. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Why was 'stay put' Grenfell advice so disastrous? Grenfell 'first time' stay-put was dropped The public inquiry into the fire was shown a call transcript between a 999 operator and Grenfell Tower resident Naomi Li who had taken refuge in her neighbour's flat on the 22nd floor. When the operator began to end the call, Ms Li asked: ""Sorry - do we stay in the flat?"" The operator replied: ""Well, I obviously can't really advise you, but I'll let the firemen know you're there, OK?"" While Ms Li survived, her neighbours who stayed - Nadia Choucair, 33, her husband Bassem Choukair, 40, their three children Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and Zainab, three, along with their grandmother Sirria, 60 - all died. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) guidance says people are advised to stay in their flat unless affected by the fire. Ms Smith saidshe abandoned the ""stay put"" advice within 15 minutes of arriving at the control room - nearly two hours after the fire at Grenfell Tower had started. Jo Smith was on call on the night of the fire last June Richard Millett QC, counsel for the inquiry, asked her if the lack of advice provided by the operator was a ""deficiency"" in the response. Ms Smith responded: ""I wasn't there at the time but I can only imagine the situation and I really would believe that the individual knew they were on the 22nd floor, that the fire was on the fourth floor and that actually there might be callers lower down that did need fire survival guidance help."" She added the operator would not have known the situation in the building and that advising the caller to evacuate the flat could have led the residents ""into a more dangerous situation"". She also said it would have been usual practice to explore a means of escape with the caller, ""but that would be if we were receiving one or two calls and not the large volume of calls for help that we were receiving on that night."" A total of 344 Grenfell-related calls were received throughout the night. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Why was 'stay put' advice disastrous?

"Donald Trump's trip to the UK will be the 12th by a US president. But this working, not state, visit is expected to be different to those that have gone before. In 1977 Jimmy Carter came to Britain on his first overseas trip as president. His main aim was to attend the G7 summit in London, but he also chose to visit Newcastle. The city had taken part in a scheme designed to build bridges between the United States and the rest of the world. So the newly elected leader of the free world decided to conduct his first act of global diplomacy from a podium outside the concrete splendour of Newcastle Civic Centre. He was given the freedom of the city by the mayor. And when the peanut farmer from Georgia stepped up to the microphone, he greeted an adoring crowd of 20,000 people thus: ""Howay the lads! I am grateful to be a Geordie now."" The local newspaper, the Chronicle, reported: ""They packed the airport. They packed the streets. They packed the area outside the Civic Centre and they opened their arms to him. And he loved it. A great smile spread across his face... as he was greeted by crowds waving both the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes."" This was how it used to be: British crowds cheering US presidents. President Carter was made an honorary freeman of the city of Newcastle in 1977 When JFK came in 1961, half a million people lined the route between London airport and the west end to catch a glimpse of him and his wife Jackie Kennedy. The scale of the public adulation was in part due to the fact that US presidents enjoyed great popularity in Britain: they were political show business and our closest allies in recent wars. They also came to the UK more rarely. The first president to visit was Woodrow Wilson in 1918 during the post-World War One peace talks. But it was not for another 27 years - and after another world war - that a second US president came to our shores, in 1945. And all Harry S Truman did was visit King George VI on a naval cruiser anchored in Plymouth harbour. Dwight D Eisenhower did not come until 1959. So, only three presidential visits in 40 years. Lyndon Johnson never came, nor did Gerald Ford. How previous presidents were greeted by the UK Will Donald Trump receive a frosty reception in the UK? Giant Donald Trump baby balloon plan sparks online row Treasury to cover policing cost of Trump visit to Scotland US presidents also enjoyed a warm relationship with the Royal Family. Eisenhower was a particular favourite of the Queen, who invited him to stay at Balmoral - the only president to do so. Like Donald Trump, ""Ike"" also owned property in Scotland: not a golf course but an apartment at Culzean Castle on the Ayrshire coast which had been given to him by the owners, in recognition of his role as supreme allied commander during World War Two. Ronald Reagan also got on well with the Queen, who in 1982 personally invited him to stay at Windsor Castle and go for a ride in the Great Park. In 1994, Bill and Hillary Clinton were honoured with a sleepover on board the royal yacht Britannia in Portsmouth. Huge crowds flocked to see President Kennedy during his 1961 visit In 2003 George Bush spent the night at Buckingham Palace - the first president to do so since Wilson in 1918. In contrast, Donald Trump is expected to get a cup of tea when he passes through Windsor on Friday. Nor may President Trump receive quite the same political welcome as his predecessors. He will not attend cabinet as Bill Clinton did in 1997 shortly after Tony Blair was first elected prime minister. He will not get to flip burgers in the Downing Street garden or address both houses of parliament, as President Obama did in 2011. Instead, he will make do with a short visit to the prime minister's country residence, Chequers, like Richard Nixon in 1970. This will be very much a working visit.  A full state visit may have been offered but there is no date in the diary for when it may happen. Of course, presidential visits do not always go smoothly. There was a private diplomatic row in 1982 when the White House delayed replying to the Queen's invitation to Ronald Reagan to stay at Windsor because his wife Nancy's astrologer was worried about overseas travel. In 1997 I watched as Bill Clinton's long motorcade was divided in two when London's Tower Bridge was opened to allow through a Thames sailing barge - much to the consternation of the security men. Barack Obama took part in a memorable barbecue in the No 10 garden in 2011 And in 1977, after a banquet at Buckingham Palace, President Carter decided to bid farewell to the Queen Mother by kissing her full on the lips, something that apparently had not happened since King George VI died in 1952. ""I took a sharp step backwards,"" she recalled later. ""Not quite far enough."" So huge efforts will be made to ensure that President Trump's trip goes smoothly. Many demonstrations have been planned, but the huge security operation surrounding his progress from London to Chequers to Windsor to Scotland - largely by air - means that he may not get too close to the protests. Much harder to cover up will be the fundamental policy differences between the US and British governments. Since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has publicly disagreed with him over his decision to impose trade tariffs, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far-right group. British ministers and officials will do their best to welcome Mr Trump but even they are now talking about the need to respect the office of the presidency rather than the current incumbent as an individual. So the president's trip this week will test a relationship that has recently become much harder to keep special.

"This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner US President Donald Trump has been welcomed to Blenheim Palace by Theresa May, on the first day of his UK visit. The black-tie dinner, with 150 invited guests, is expected to focus on post-Brexit trade, and comes days after Mr Trump said the UK was in ""turmoil"". He and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in the UK on Thursday afternoon. Protesters have gathered outside the US ambassador's residence in London, where the Trumps are staying tonight, and near Blenheim Palace. Extra security is in place to police the protests, but Mr Trump has said that Britons ""like me a lot"" and that he feels ""fine"" about any such protests. Latest updates on Trump's UK visit Trump: Nato states to up defence funding What is going to happen during Trump's trip? The Trumps left Winfield House at approximately 19:00 BST, with Mrs Trump wearing a full-length yellow dress with a pleated skirt. This video can not be played US President Donald Trump arrived at Stansted Airport for a two-day working visit Mr Trump, who will also spend time with the Queen during his two-day working visit, said earlier of the British public: ""I think they agree with me on immigration... You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration... I think that's why Brexit happened."" He said ""Brexit is Brexit"" and the British people ""voted to break it up, so I imagine that's what they'll do but maybe they're taking a different route - I don't know if that is what they voted for"". Mr Trump has recently been under fire for his own immigration policy,which resulted in the separation of immigrant families. Members of the cabinet and business leaders are at the Blenheim Palace dinner While protesters - for and against the president - gathered outside the venue The Trumps landed at Stansted Airport, Essex, at 13:50 BST before a helicopter took them to Winfield House in Regent's Park, where they are staying as guests of the US ambassador. He was met at the airport by dignitaries including International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and US ambassador Woody Johnson. Speaking at the Nato summit in Brussels before he arrived, Mr Trump said the UK was a ""hot spot right now"". This video can not be played Some of Mr Trump's supporters and protesters have been explaining their motivation His visit comes as the governmentpublishes its plans for the UK's relations with the EUafter Brexit. Earlier this weekMr Trump saidit was ""up to the people"" whether Mrs May stayed on as prime minister after two cabinet ministers resigned within hours over her Brexit policy. Protests were also held outside the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park A large police presence has been building up outside Blenheim Palace. Police officers estimated there were more than 1,000 people demonstrating before Mr Trump's arrival. A group of protesters has also gathered outside a fenced-off area in Regent's Park, close to the entrance of Winfield House, where Mr Trump is staying. Among those attending the black-tie dinner at the ancestral home of former Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill are cabinet ministers and business leaders. Guests are dining on Scottish salmon, Hereford beef fillet and strawberries with clotted cream ice-cream. Only one person, the digital entrepreneur and philanthropist Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, has publicly refused the invitation. UK protests greet Trump's 'state visit on the sly' Police beds for Trump visit 'a disgrace' Trump raises questions over Brexit plans Mrs May said the UK visit would be an opportunity to boost trade links and strengthen co-operation on security. Along with trade and security ties, Downing Street said the other key areas to be discussed between the two leaders included Brexit and the Middle East. Ahead of Mr Trump's visit, Mrs May said that when the UK leaves the European Union ""there will be no alliance more important in the years ahead"". Mr Trump travelled to the UK from the Nato summit, where he said member countrieshave agreed to increase their military spending. The US president and first lady were greeted by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, the Queen's representative and the chief operating officer of Stansted Airport They then departed on Marine One to travel to the US ambassador's residence in central London Mr Trump had joked earlier this week that his meeting with Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest"" part of his European trip. Downing Street insisted Mrs May welcomed Mr Trump's decision to ""engage"" with the Russian leader. But she also warned Mr Trump not to ignore the ""malign behaviour"" of Russia. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has had to disagree with him publicly over his decision to impose trade tariffs on EU steel, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far right group. In turn, the US president has described Britain as being in political ""turmoil"", criticised its defence spending and shown no enthusiasm for coming to visit: in the 18 months of his presidency, Mr Trump has chosen to visit 17 other countries first. Whatever this relationship is, it can hardly be described as special. So this trip is about ticking a diplomatic box, getting a visit out of the way before its further delay became politically embarrassing. And as working visits go, it is on the minimal side: no Downing Street barbecue, no cabinet visit, no speech to both Houses of Parliament. The diplomatic aim will be to get through the visit without any gaffes, without upsetting the president, and without him saying anything disobliging about Brexit or a future trade deal. The UK and the US do have a good relationship at an institutional level, in the fields of defence, security and intelligence. The tricky bit is always the politics and the personalities. On Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base. Guess who's coming to dinner with Trump Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip 'Trump Baby' balloon banned from Turnberry The UK-US trade relationship in five charts Stormy Daniels arrested in Ohio - lawyer The pair will then travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for talks with the foreign secretary. The president and first lady will travel to Windsor on Friday afternoon to meet the Queen, before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. This part of the visit is being considered private. The Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces as tens of thousands of people are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday - and in Glasgow on Friday. It has also complained that300 officers working during the visit will have to sleep on camp bedsin a gymnasium that has no hot water and restricted access to hot food. Security has been stepped up outside the US ambassador's residence in London where Mr Trump is staying Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK, including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. But the balloonwill not be allowed to fly over his Turnberry golf course, Police Scotland have said.

"Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Donald Trump after his election US President Donald Trump is set to arrive in the UK on Thursday for a two-day working visit. Mr Trump is the 12th sitting US president to make such a trip and will spend time with the Queen and prime minister before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at his golf resort. It is his first visit to Britain since winning the 2016 presidential election. Thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins described the trip as ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"". A black-tie dinner will be held at Blenheim Palace Mr Trump will fly to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Invited guests - including a number of business leaders - will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May. After spending Thursday night as a guest of US ambassador Woody Johnson at his London residence, Winfield House, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks. The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon. On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. The president's time in Scotland is not counted as part of the working visit. The president and first lady will visit Turnberry in Scotland A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. How Trump's UK visit will be different to those of other US presidents How previous presidents were greeted by the UK Will the US president get a frosty reception? A working visit - like the one Mr Trump is making - may include some of the same activities as a state visit, but there are small differences. For example, on a working visit, the visiting head of state does not address Parliament, nor is their accommodation organised and funded by the UK. Travel plans on a working visit are also organised and funded by the visiting country. President Trump will meet the Queen, but will not stay at Buckingham Palace Tens of thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday and in Glasgow on Saturday. Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police, including 400 from the West Midlands force. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Shaista Aziz, a Labour councillor in Oxford, and one of the organisers of the Together Against Trump protest in London, said the demonstration was about saying ""very clearly that we reject the policies of this administration"". Campaigners raised almost Â£18,000 to pay for the six-metre high inflatable Trump baby British police have not revealed the exact number of officers required to work during Mr Trump's trip - but the Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces. Forces from across the country have been asked to send thousands of officers to assist with protests. The Home Office said they can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". The Treasury has confirmed it will fund policing costs of up to Â£5m in Scotland. The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services."" The president will stay at Winfield House on Thursday night Mr Trump has a number of high profile supporters in the UK - including prominent Brexiteers Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. Speaking of Mr Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary on Monday, Mr Trump said he was a ""friend"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive,"" he said. ""I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" Republicans Overseas UK are organising a rally on Friday to welcome the president while a pub in west London has been renamed The Trump Arms in honour of the visit. The US Embassy said it was looking forward to Mr Trump's arrival ""as an opportunity to highlight the vitality of the special relationship"" between the UK and US. Tension between Trump and allies.

"The police cordon on Thursday evening was near Zizzi restaurant in Castle Street The policing minister should help with the ""extraordinary level of demand"" facing officers following major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, Wiltshire's police commissioner said. Angus Macpherson said he had spoken to policing minister Nick Hurd to ensure the ""increased pressure"" was addressed. The comments were made shortly before police cordoned off a road in Salisbury after a man was reported to be ill. Officers later said there was ""no concern"" for the man's health. On Friday, police said the 33-year-old was cautioned after being arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. A test for the nerve agent Novichok was carried out on the man at Salisbury District Hospital, but proved negative. Police added there was also no ""wider risk to the public"". Mr Macpherson said the resources of forces across the country were also being stretched by the US presidential visit, the Royal International Air Tattoo and large summer events. He said Mr Hurd had reassured him ""the current approach to policing cordons, in relation to the ongoing major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, is under review to help me ensure that policing services more widely across Wiltshire and Swindon remain unaffected"".

"The police cordon on Thursday evening was near Zizzi restaurant in Castle Street The policing minister should help with the ""extraordinary level of demand"" facing officers following major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, Wiltshire's police commissioner said. Angus Macpherson said he had spoken to policing minister Nick Hurd to ensure the ""increased pressure"" was addressed. The comments were made shortly before police cordoned off a road in Salisbury after a man was reported to be ill. Officers later said there was ""no concern"" for the man's health. On Friday, police said the 33-year-old was cautioned after being arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. A test for the nerve agent Novichok was carried out on the man at Salisbury District Hospital, but proved negative. Police added there was also no ""wider risk to the public"". Mr Macpherson said the resources of forces across the country were also being stretched by the US presidential visit, the Royal International Air Tattoo and large summer events. He said Mr Hurd had reassured him ""the current approach to policing cordons, in relation to the ongoing major incidents in Amesbury and Salisbury, is under review to help me ensure that policing services more widely across Wiltshire and Swindon remain unaffected"". Police cordoned off the street after a man fell ill Mr Macpherson added: ""Wiltshire Police has received great support from almost every police force across the county since the first major incident was declared in March.

"This video can not be played WATCH: 'Flying car' concept on show A flying car that will not require a pilot's licence to operate has been unveiled in California. BlackFly can travel for up to 25 miles (40km) at a speed of 62mph. Its makers say it will eventually cost the same as a typical sports-utility car, but early models will be more expensive. It was revealed on Thursday the company is funded by Google co-founder Larry Page. Mr Page is also behind Kitty Hawk, a separate US start-up currently testing its personal aircraft in Las Vegas. Several other rival flying cars are in development across the globe. BlackFly's creator is the Palo Alto-based firm Opener. The car has been tested in Canada, where the countryâs aviation authority has authorised its use. Like Kitty Hawk, BlackFly could perhaps be more accurately described as a human-carrying drone. It is not designed to be driven on roads. The vehicle carries one person in a small cockpit, powered by âeight propulsion systems, spread across two wingsâ. It works best, Opener says, when taking off and landing from grassy surfaces. 'Total command' âWatching BlackFly take flight just blew me away,â said Darren Pleasance, director of the US Experimental Aircraft Association. âIâve never seen anything like it.â While the vehicle will not require a pilot's licence, Opener said as a precaution riders would have to undergo a training programme in order to become acquainted. The BlackFly flying car is said to work best when taking off from grassy areas âEven though not required by Federal Aviation Administration regulations, BlackFly operators will be required to successfully complete the FAA Private Pilot written examination and also complete company-mandated vehicle familiarisation and operator training,"" it said. Self-driving air taxi lifts off Degree in 'flying car' engineering offered online Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? Openerâs chief executive Marcus Leng said the on-board controls offered âinstant gratificationâ. âYou have total command of three-dimensional space,âhe told CBS News correspondent John Blackstone,external. âWhen you press the thumb-stick to climb, you have absolute full control. When you stop in the middle of the air and go off the joystick, the aircraft freezes. âAnd when I say freezesâ¦ it literally freezes in the air.â BlackFly can also fly autonomously, Mr Leng said. 'Will they crash? Probably' Opener joins a long list of companies chasing the ultimate science fiction dream of a flying car, and thanks to rapid improvements in drone capabilities, that future seems closer than ever. Kitty Hawk promises to deliver a ""world free from traffic"" As well as BlackFly and Kitty Hawk, companies such as Uber are also seeking to get into the flying car market - if indeed there ever is one. The Hiller Aviation Museum in Northern California is a graveyard of failed attempts to create a flying car. The vehicles will eventually cost the same as a typical SUV, its creators claim But the museumâs head of operations, Willie Turner, believes this latest batch might be on to something - as long as aviation authorities can accommodate the new ideas. âNow we have the technology,â he said. âBut the regulations are âwell you canât do this, you canât do thatâ. They donât understand it.â He added: âNow will they crash? Probably, but cars crash every day. âYou know itâs not going to be foolproof but it will be much better than the current system we have now."" _______ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"This video can not be played Lloyd's of London chief executive Inga Beale criticises Brexit White Paper The Lloyd's of London chief says the government's plan for relations with the EU after Brexit will speed up the departure of firms from the UK. Inga Beale told the BBC theWhite Paperwould see the 300-year old insurance market go ""full speed ahead"" to set up its subsidiary in Brussels - and spur others on as well. Service sector groups say the plan will affect employment and is a ""real blow"". However, non-services groups were more positive. Services, including banks, insurance companies and investment firms, make up 80% of the UK economy and areone of its most successful exports to the EU. The government wants UK financial services in future to adopt a beefed-up version of a system already used by certain non-EU countries, including the US, Japan and China, whereby they agree to meet certain EU rules to keep access to the bloc. These rules are equivalent to each other in some areas. Kamal Ahmed: the services sacrifice May says White Paper delivers Brexit At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Ms Beale, the chief executive of Lloyd's, said: ""Professional and financial services are really not catered for at all and it's very disappointing. We make up basically 80% of the economy of the UK. ""Lloyd's is to open a subsidiary in Brussels so we will be full steam ahead, and many other banks, insurers and other financial services firms will be moving at pace now."" She said the plans would have a real impact: ""We will no longer be licensed to write business or offer insurance within the EU 27 and this can get right down to personal protection. ""If you've got insurance for your pet and you like to travel to the continent for a holiday, there's a question as to whether your policy will cover you - so this is really serious stuff."" Huw Evans, director-general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""Whatever the final outcome, the insurance industry is too important to be a rule taker. ""Having to comply with financial regulations we have no say over would be the worst possible scenario for our world leading insurance sector, so we will look to the government to negotiate a better outcome than this."" The City of London Corporation, which governs London's financial district, said dropping the push for mutual recognition for so-called ""equivalence"" would curb business opportunities with European counterparts and was a ""real blow"". Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor It seems the government has made a calculation. If there is no agreement on regulatory alignment on goods, chaos at the ports - and economic damage - could ensue. Essential supply chains - such as those used to produce millions of cars - will be disrupted. And there will be no solution to the ""no hard border"" on the island of Ireland. That has to be headed off. On services, the risks are less clear. In sectors such as finance, law and legal - Britain is a global leader, the government says. As such, its services enjoy high levels of global demand and the government believes Britain can make progress on services trade deals outside the EU, Read more from Kamal here. TheCityUK, the professional services lobby group, called the proposals for services ""regrettable and frustrating"". Trade association UK Finance said that simply relying on existing equivalence arrangements would not provide financial institutions with effective market access, but it said the government was right to seek to strengthen and expand equivalence rules. Other industry groups hailed the paper as progress. The EEF, which represents major manufacturers, called it a ""very positive and constructive step forward"" but said more work was needed. The CBI welcomed the plans and said ""protecting jobs and investment now and in future should be the guiding star for both sets of negotiators"". The British Chambers of Commerce called it a ""welcome starting point"" for businesses. One rationale for Brexit is that the UK can adopt its own standards and regulations. But to ensure frictionless trade, it also wants to have these standards recognised automatically by the EU. That is called ""mutual recognition"" and to the EU it is having your cake and eating it as well - and therefore unacceptable. With equivalence, the EU would decide that UK regulations in a specific area achieve the same regulatory objectives even if they do not follow the exact same EU laws. However, the EU assesses whether that third country meets its standards industry by industry, and approval can be withdrawn at very short notice. Settling for equivalence for services (including financial services) will therefore be unpopular with many companies that had hoped the Treasury, which was campaigning hard for mutual recognition, would fight their corner.

"The new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab unveiled the White Paper on Thursday The government has published its long-awaitedBrexit White Paper,external. The document is 104 pages long and follows last week's Chequers agreement which set out the sort of relationship the UK wants with the EU after Brexit. TheWhite Paper is split into four chapters,external: economic partnership, security, cooperation and institutional arrangements. Most of the debate surrounds the first section, the future economic relationship. So here are the key excerpts from the chapter on ""economic partnership"" and what they mean. This is a line that emerged in the Chequers statement last Friday, and it is one of the most important in this White Paper. It is the UK government's answer to the concerns expressed by businesses that rely on ""just-in-time"" manufacturing supply chains (such as car manufacturers), and to the need toavoid the reimposition of a hard border in Ireland. The White Paper proposes a free trade area for goods - but it is very close to single market membership for goods in all but name. The suggestion of a common rulebook sounds very collaborative, but it does - in effect - mean the UK agreeing to take on the EU's rules and regulations in all these areas. If the UK parliament chose not to sign up to any of those rules, the idea of frictionless trade would begin to fall apart. The other big sensitivity in this section will be the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The White Paper says the role of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end, and it sets out detailed proposals for joint institutional arrangements to police future economic ties. But the ECJ is the ultimate legal authority on EU rules with which the UK proposes to harmonise. There's more detail here about how the UK proposes to combine bits of its two previous customs proposals, to create an entirely new customs relationship with the EU. It would take advantage of new technologies to make trade as frictionless as possible, but it would still involve the UK collecting EU tariffs (taxes on imports) at UK borders on the EU's behalf - something which isn't done anywhere else in the world on any significant scale. The White Paper says the UK would also apply its own tariffs, and an independent trade policy, for goods intended for consumption in the UK. In other words, it would still seek to strike its own trade deals around the world, even though it would be bound by EU rules and regulations. For once, Brexiteers and the EU appear united - neither thinks the proposal has much chance of working because of its sheer complexity. Unsurprisingly the UK government disputes that, and says it wants to be at the cutting edge of global customs policy. But it's also worth noting that the White Paper says the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) would have to be phased in - which is code for saying that it wouldn't be ready by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020. Reality Check: What's the EU common rulebook? Reality Check: Why services matter in any Brexit deal? Reality Check: The Brexit challenge for Irish trade The White Paper confirms that the UK will seek active participation in (if not full membership of) the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Medicines Agency. The government is keen to address business demands that they only need to go through one approval mechanism to access both markets, in highly regulated parts of the economy. The EU has previously ruled out full UK membership of these agencies, and noted that it would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice if it were to sign up to their rules and regulations. The White Paper accepts that the UK would not have any voting rights in the way the agencies go about their business, and that it would have to make appropriate financial contributions to them. This is part of the pragmatic Brexit the government is now advocating, but it is not the resumption of full UK sovereignty that some leading leave campaigners had promised. The section on services confirms that the UK is seeking a looser relationship with the EU forroughly 80% of the UK economy. Financial and other services will no longer be able to take advantage of passporting, which gives them automatic access to other EU markets (the UK's Financial Conduct Authority says about 5,500 UK financial firms currently have EU passporting rights). The government has abandoned plans for a new relationship based on the concept of mutual recognition of financial regulations, partly because it had been so comprehensively rejected by the EU. But it is still seeking something more ambitious than the ""equivalence' regime"" that the EU has with most other third countries (part of the problem with that is that it can be withdrawn, by either side, with just 30 days notice). So, the UK argues that the importance of the City of London to the EU's entire financial system means a more ambitious solution needs to be found. The trouble with a lot of these proposals though is that the EU will see them as cherry-picking from the four freedoms that underpin the single market. It has already said that the UK cannot have full access to the single market for goods and not services, especially if it is determined to end the free movement of people. The White Paper emphasises repeatedly that free movement of people will come to an end. Full details of a new immigration policy are due to be published in a separate White Paper, which has already been delayed several times. But there are hints in this document of what could be to come - it sets out proposals for a mobility framework, which is pretty standard in trade agreements. It could - among other things - ""allow citizens to travel freely, without a visa, for tourism and temporary business activity."" But some Brexiteers fear that what will eventually emerge will be free movement under another name, and they are already suspicious that this is just an opening bid from the government. The EU will certainly push for further concessions if the UK is to get anything close to the economic relationship it wants. Part of the problem for the UK is that it is asking the EU to be a little bit more flexible in the way it interprets its rules-based system. But that request is being made at a time when the EU thinks its rules are under threat from external sources like President Trump, and internal sources like governments in Italy, Hungary and Poland.

"Ava-May Littleboy, aged three, was thrown from an inflatable trampoline at Gorleston beach Two people have been arrested on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter over the death of a three-year-old girl who was thrown from an inflatable trampoline. The inflatable ""exploded"" on Gorleston beach in Norfolk on July 1, sending Ava-May Littleboy into the air. She died from a head injury. A man and woman in their 40s, from Great Yarmouth, have been arrested in connection with the death. They are currently being questioned. Witnesses described how people tried to catch the girl, from Somersham in Suffolk, when it happened on Gorleston's Lower Esplanade. The little girl was thrown from an inflatable trampoline at Gorleston beach on 1 July Ava-May had been at the beach with members of her family. Norfolk Police said a post-mortem examination found she died from a head injury, but further investigation would take place to confirm this. An investigation involving the Health and Safety Executive, local authority and police is ongoing. The girl was in cardiac arrest when paramedics arrived In a statement released after her death, Ava-May's family said she could ""light up the darkest rooms"". A fundraising campaign for a memorial bench near her Suffolk home has already raised more than Â£8,000. Her grandmother, Angela Littleboy, told the BBC: ""She was her own little character, she was cheeky, funny, the best leg-hugger ever.

"The marathon cabinet meeting at Chequers lasted nearly 12 hours The cabinet has reached an agreement on the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. Here are the key points fromthe three page deal published by the government.,external The UK will ""maintain a common rulebook for all goods"" with the EU, including agricultural products, after Brexit. A treaty will be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland. Parliament will oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules, ""recognising that this would have consequences"". ""Co-operative arrangements"" will be established between EU and UK competition regulators. ""Different arrangements"" will be organised for services ""where it is in our interests to have regulatory flexibility"". A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"". Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"". The borders between the UK and EU will be treated as a ""combined customs territory"". The UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge  EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. A post-Brexit UK would be able to ""control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world"" without causing border disruption. This avoids a hard Irish border, and removes the need for ""backstop"" arrangements to be put in place before the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the government says. The agreement says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". A ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. These proposals represent ""a precise and responsible approach to the final stage of the negotiations"", the government says. According to the government the plan: Gives the UK an independent trade policy, with the ability to set its own non-EU tariffs and to reach separate trade deals Ends the role of the ECJ in UK affairs Ends annual payments to the EU budget with ""appropriate contributions for joint action in specific areas"" The early reaction from Brexiteers has been that they need to see the full 100-plus page plan  to see whether or not they agree with the government's claims. Full details will be released in a white paper next week. This is not a final Brexit deal. This is an agreement on the UK's preferred way forward as negotiations with the European Union about the future relationship reach a crucial stage.

"This video can not be played Trump baby blimp ready to take first steps As the son of immigrants, Donald Trump has his own special relationship with the United Kingdom. His mother, Mary MacLeod, was born and raised in the village of Tong, on the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis, on Scotland's wild and beautiful north-western fringe. A less Trumpian upbringing is hard to imagine. Mary's pebble-dashed home was modest to say the least, the traditions of the island strictly and austerely Presbyterian. Lewis is not a place of multiple marriages and glittering golden towers. It owes more to Calvin than to Mammon, more to Wittenberg than to Vegas. On Sundays not so many years ago, swings in the island's play parks were chained up. Ferries could not dock, flights were not allowed to land. Mr Trump is not scheduled to visit Lewis this Sabbath or any other day. He talks rarely and in scant detail about his British mother, who emigrated to New York as a ""domestic"" in the 1930s, preferring to stress the influence of his hard-driving German father, Fred Trump. Instead the president and his wife Melania Trump will travel to Trump Turnberry, down the water from Glasgow on the Ayrshire coast, one of his two Scottish golf resorts, where the first couple will stay from Friday until Sunday when they depart for a high-stakes summit in Helsinki. White House aides won't comment on whether Mr Trump will play golf during his visit, saying only that he will use the time to prepare for the meeting in Finland with Russia's President Vladimir Putin. But the weather forecast is good - Scotland is enjoying its best summer in living memory - and the links at the newly refurbished complex will surely prove inviting. Before he can pick up his clubs, though, duty calls in the form of queen and prime minister. For Mr Trump, the route to the ultimate British clubhouse - in this case Windsor Castle - was strewn with obstacles. As soon as the property tycoon became president, Theresa May - still prime minister at the time of writing, despite bitter divisions in her Conservative party over the UK's plans to leave the European Union - was off to Washington like a shot. Mrs May was the first foreign leader to visit the Trump White House, a week after the inauguration in January 2017, and was mocked at home for holding hands with the president and for her obvious eagerness - critics called it desperation - to secure a trade deal with the United States after Brexit. Nonetheless she persisted with the flattery, playing to Mr Trump's ego and taste for pomp by carrying with her an invitation from Queen Elizabeth for a full state visit to the UK, an honour granted to only two other US presidents, Barack Obama and George W Bush. Trump and Merkel in new war of words Trump wants Nato to double spending target Is this the US president most like Trump? Immediately the invitation was controversial. That very day Mr Trump stunned the world - including, it seemed, Mrs May - by announcing a plan to halt all immigration from seven majority-Muslim nations. The new president's supporters were delighted. Hostility to immigration had been a central plank of Mr Trump's campaign and had arguably played a critical role in his victory. His approach attracted some sympathy in the UK, not least with those who saw Brexit as an opportunity to regain control of Britain's borders, but Mr Trump's opponents were louder and they spoke with their pens. In just a few days a petition demanding the withdrawal of the Queen's invitation (such invitations formally bear the monarch's name, but in practice they are extended by the government) gained more than a million signatures. A month later that number had reached 1.86 million and parliament held a (purely symbolic) debate about whether the visit should be cancelled. The pressure intensified after Mr Trump broke with diplomatic tradition by intervening in British politics - repeatedly, directly and publicly. His predecessor Mr Obama did so too, making statements about Scottish independence and Brexit. But while those comments were controversial, they were in line with the UK government's own views on both subjects at the time. Mr Trump's were not. First, the president outraged many Londoners with his response to a terror attack on the British capital in June 2017. With seven (later eight) people dead and dozens injured on London Bridge, Mr Trump criticised the response of the city's Mayor Sadiq Khan as ""pathetic"" because Mr Khan, who is a Muslim, had told people they had nothing to fear from increased police activity in the hours after the attack. This video can not be played Donald Trump challenged London Mayor Sadiq Khan to an IQ test Although privately appalled, Mrs May continued to resist calls for the state visit to be postponed. Then, last November, the president went even further, retweeting three propaganda videos disseminated by Britain First, a small fascist party on the far right fringes of British politics. Criticised by the prime minister, Mr Trump hit back, telling her ""don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom"". The leader of the opposition Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, described the retweets as ""abhorrent"" and ""dangerous"". In the uproar that followed Mr Trump was reported to have told Mrs May that he no longer wanted to accept the Queen's invitation. In the end - after a great deal more marching up hills only to march down again, including a cancelled trip to open the new American Embassy in London - there will be a visit but it will not be a formal state visit, there will be no open carriage ride with the Queen through the streets of the capital. That would have been a security and public relations nightmare given the promise of mass protest. Instead the British government is trying to deliver a state visit on the sly. Officially this is a ""working visit"" but it will include dinner at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, the ancestral home of Winston Churchill; tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle in Berkshire; and a meeting with the prime minister at her country residence, Chequers in Buckinghamshire. All three venues are easily accessible from, but comfortably outside, London. There will also be military ceremonies, pipes and drums, and a demonstration of joint US-UK defence capabilities. Mr Trump will not, though, be given the honour of addressing the British parliament, the speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow having strongly objected to the idea because, he said, ""opposition to racism and sexism"" were ""hugely important considerations"". Still, British officials are keen to stress what they say is an ""extremely strong"" security and intelligence relationship between the two nations and to point out that the UK is one of the few Nato countries already meeting a commitment to spend two per cent of GDP on defence. The US ambassador to the UK, Robert ""Woody"" Johnson, said he expected Mr Trump and Mrs May to discuss a range of issues including Russian election meddling, which Moscow has denied despite evidence to the contrary, and the attempted murder of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the Wiltshire city of Salisbury by means of a nerve agent which has now claimed the life of Dawn Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother-of-three. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Trump protestors urged to be 'peaceful' Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip 'Trump Baby' balloon sparks online row Items also likely to be on the agenda, according to a briefing from a senior source in the British government, include the Middle East, North Korea and relations with China. But Downing Street will be looking for one thing above all else: tangible progress on a post-Brexit trade deal between the world's largest and fifth largest economies. While the EU accounts for about half of the UK's external trade, the US is by far Britain's biggest single trading partner. The desire for a deal is complicated by the president's mercantilist hostility to free trade and the tariffs which he has imposed on the European Union and others. ""We'd like to get started on the negotiation issue,"" says the British government source, cautioning ""we leave the EU on 21 March 2019â¦ we can negotiate but we can't implement"". While Brexit Britain and Trump's America have in common a desire to return to a supposed golden era of independence, to regain control of their own affairs, to restrict immigration, and to reassert their freedom from the constraints of international institutions, they also have significant disagreements: on climate change and Iran to name two glaring examples. The shambolic collapse of the recent G7 meeting in Canada was just the latest illustration of the dysfunction operating at diplomacy's highest levels. Some observers think the UK is in a weak position on this grand stage. ""The irony is that by leaving the EU, the United Kingdom will be less useful to Washington as an ally but it will also need the United States much more,"" said Jeffrey Stacey, a former State Department official under President Obama. ""So May has been thrown into the arms of the most unpredictable US president in living memory,"" he added. Not without protest. Tens of thousands of people have signed up to demonstrate against President Trump's visit to the UK. Events are planned at Blenheim Palace; in central London; at Chequers; in Ayrshire, Edinburgh and elsewhere. Strikingly, the mayor of London, Mr Khan, has given permission for a large balloon depicting President Trump as a snarling, orange baby to be flown over Westminster. The 20ft (6m) high inflatable will rise above the city for two hours. Leo Murray, who is behind the idea that he calls anti-fascist satire, said ""we want to make sure he knows that all of Britain is looking down on him and laughing at him"". British supporters of Mr Trump said the idea was an embarrassment not to the president but to the protesters. But Mr Murray appeared unconcerned, saying: ""Trump Baby will fly!""

"Jordan Burling pictured in 2013 died at the home he shared with his mother and grandmother three years later The mother and grandmother of an emaciated teenager who was likened to a World War Two concentration camp victim have been jailed for manslaughter. Jordan Burling, 18, went into cardiac arrest in Leeds in 2016 and died weighing less than six stone (37kg). Mother Dawn Cranston and grandmother Denise allowed Mr Burling to ""rot to death"", Leeds Crown Court heard. Dawn, 45, and Denise, 70, were convicted of manslaughter and jailed for four and three years respectively. The teenager left to waste away Mr Burling's sister Abigail Burling, who was found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult's death, was ordered to serve 18 months in prison. The judge told the three women it was ""almost beyond belief"" Mr Burling ""should have been allowed to die in his own house in the bosom of his family"". ""Through your gross negligence, a precious human life was lost needlessly,"" he said. Dawn Cranston, 45, Denise Cranston, 70 and Abigail Burling, 25, failed to alert a GP as Jordan Burling's condition worsened Mr Justice Spencer said the pictures of the teenager in an emaciated state were ""hauntingly reminiscent of starving victims of extermination camps in the Second World War"". Mr Burling's malnutrition was such he weighed only 5st 11 lbs (37kg) when he died ""that was not much more than twice the weight he had been at the age of four"", he said. His aunt, Susan Burling, read a victim statement on behalf of his father, Steven, which said the family were trying to cope with a ""living nightmare"". More stories from Yorkshire ""I just can't understand why all these horrific things have happened to me and my family,"" it said. During the trial, the prosecution said Jordan was allowed to ""rot to death"" by the women, who failed to phone for medical assistance until it was too late. Paramedics found Mr Burling wearing a soiled nappy and lying in an unresponsive state on a makeshift inflatable bed in the living room of the house in Butterbowl Garth, Farnley. The living room of the house in Butterbowl Garth, Farnley where Jordan Burling was found by medics A subsequent police search of the property found the remains of a baby boy in a rucksack, hidden on the top shelf of a cupboard in Mr Burling's bedroom for 14 years. Before the trial, his mother admitted endeavouring to conceal the birth of a child and was given a 12-month sentence to run concurrent with her jail term for manslaughter. An NHS dietician had told the court Mr Burling, who was 5ft 5ins (1.67m) tall, had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 13.6, which falls in the ""severe thinness"" category. The figure, based on measurements taken during his post-mortem examination, was the lowest the dietician had recorded in her 26-year career. During the trial, the jury was shown several pictures of Mr Burling taken by his mother on a mobile phone including one on 20 May, just over a month before he died. Dawn Cranston took this picture of Jordan Burling on 20 May 2016 It was estimated he had been malnourished for at least six months before his death on 30 June, having developed bed sores so deep they left bone exposed. The judge said the three women had attempted to take care of Mr Burling as his condition worsened including washing him and changing his adult nappy. They were ""relentless and unpleasant tasks"" and Mr Burling's death was the greatest punishment the three would have to bear, he said. Dr Cleo Van Velsen, a consultant psychiatrist who assessed Dawn, told the jury her behaviour was consistent with a dissociative disorder called depersonalisation - a defence mechanism characterised by a sense of disconnect from the world and your body to cope with acute anxiety or trauma. None of the three have any previous convictions. In a statement read outside court, the family of Mr Burling's father, Steven, said: ""We feel betrayed by the people we trusted to care for Jordan. ""Steven and the family will always remember Jordan having a bubbly and chatty personality. ""We have had two years of hell coming to terms with Jordan's death."" James Rogers, chairman of the Safer Leeds executive, said an independent review was under way into Mr Burling's death.

"Will Croatian fans have Russia's support in the final?

National pride,the Russian spy poisoning case, andthe Ukraine crisisall had a role in fans' feelings asCroatia defeated England in Wednesday night's semi-final.

World Cup 2018: Croatia fans ecstatic after ousting England Shortly after Croatiadefeated Russia on penalties in the quarter finals, defender Domagoj Vida and coach Ognjen Vukojevic - who have each played for FC Dynamo Kiev - dedicated their win to Ukraine on YouTube from their changing room. The clip has been viewed more than 3.5 million times since it was posted on 7 July. A hashtag - #GloryToUkraine - followed, bringing mixed reaction on social media. Ukrainian TV executive Oleksandr Tkachenkopraised the players on Facebook,external, saying it was ""nice they stopped the hosts of this strange World Cup"". Fifa reviewed the video and issued a warning to the players. Ognjen Vukojevic was fined $15,000 (Â£11,360) andsent home by Croatia. Then Vidaappeared to do the same thing again.

"An image showing the fin that experts say is evidence that this is a blue whale Genetic material from a large whale killed off the coast of Iceland has confirmed the creature was a rare hybrid. Campaigners had been concerned that the slaughtered animal was a protected blue whale, the largest species on the planet. Now DNA has shown it to be the offspring of a blue and a fin whale, as the whaling company had claimed. Researchers say these hybrids are rare and trading their meat is illegal. Photographic evidence from anti-whaling groups had shown a large animal being butchered in Iceland early in July  - based on these images, some experts concluded that it was a juvenile male blue, a species that hasn't been deliberately killed since 1978. Now tests carried out at Iceland's Marine Research Institute have confirmed that it was the offspring of a female blue whale and a male fin whale. Wanted: Inspiring name for Mars rover Slower ocean current to boost warming Are UK barbecues fuelling deforestation? The key reason for interest in the species was to determine whether this killing was legal or not under Icelandic law. Weighing as much as 200 tonnes and stretching up to 30 metres, blue whales were hunted to the brink by commercial whalers from many countries including the UK from the 1940s to the 1960s when they became a protected stock under theInternational Whaling Commission,external. That means that all countries, including Iceland agreed not to kill the creatures. It's different for fin whales. While there is an international moratorium on killing all whales, Iceland doesn't agree that fin whales are threatened and gives permits for their hunting. Hybrids between fin and blue whales are a grey area, say specialists. Specialists believe that hybrids are not very common in the waters off Iceland. ""Since 1983, they've only recorded five of them,"" said Astrid Fuchs from the charity,Whale and Dolphin Conservation,external. ""Four of them have been killed by whalers and one is a very beloved whale watching object and is still alive - they are very rare,"" she told BBC News. The company involved was certain all along that the animal it killed was not a blue whale but a hybrid. ""I am absolutely confident that it's a hybrid,"" KristjÃ¡n Loftsson, who runs Hvalur hf, told BBC News at the time. ""To mistake a blue whale for a fin whale is impossible, this whale has all the characterisations of a fin whale in the ocean. There are a lot of blue whales off the Iceland coast, when we see the blows and sail to it, and we realise it is a blue and then we leave it and go and look for fin whales."" An image showing the fin that experts say is evidence that this is a blue whale Those opposed to whaling say that it doesn't really matter that the animal was a hybrid and not a blue whale. They are calling for an immediate end to hunting the species in the waters off Iceland. ""The killing of a blue/fin whale hybrid demonstrates the difficulty for whalers at sea to identify which species they are pursuing,"" said Sigursteinn Masson from the International Fund for Animal Welfare. ""The result is that a rare and protected species has suffered as collateral damage from a cruel, unnecessary and increasingly unpopular hunt."" Iceland sells almost all of its whale meat to Japan; one of a handful of countries that reject the international consensus to protect whales. Now that this whale has been confirmed as a hybrid it means the meat can't be legally shipped anywhere. A Japanese inspector and some of the crew taking pictures of the whale Under the international regulations that govern animal trading, it is the protected status of the hybrid parents that matter - so as it has blue whale parentage, the Japanese market would be closed to it. As this whale has been shown to be a hybrid, it is likely there won't be major repercussions for the whalers. Mr Loftsson says he is being targeted by campaigners and there is nothing unusual about the recent killing. ""This is nothing new to us, we have had at least five in previous years with similar characteristics and DNA analysis shows a completely different profile from a fin whale and that has been described as a hybrid of a blue and a fin,"" he told BBC News. Campaigners, though, believe it could still be the beginning of the end. ""We hope it might be the nail in the coffin of Icelandic whaling,"" said Astrid Fuchs. ""It confirms what scientists have been saying for years, whaling can't be regulated - it is always a bit out of control, they are going out there but they don't know what they are shooting.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: 'Flying car' concept on show A flying car that will not require a pilot's licence to operate has been unveiled in California. BlackFly can travel for up to 25 miles (40km) at a speed of 62mph. Its makers say it will eventually cost the same as a typical sports-utility car, but early models will be more expensive. It was revealed on Thursday the company is funded by Google co-founder Larry Page. Mr Page is also behind Kitty Hawk, a separate US start-up currently testing its personal aircraft in Las Vegas. Several other rival flying cars are in development across the globe. BlackFly's creator is the Palo Alto-based firm Opener. The car has been tested in Canada, where the countryâs aviation authority has authorised its use. Like Kitty Hawk, BlackFly could perhaps be more accurately described as a human-carrying drone. It is not designed to be driven on roads. The vehicle carries one person in a small cockpit, powered by âeight propulsion systems, spread across two wingsâ. It works best, Opener says, when taking off and landing from grassy surfaces. 'Total command' âWatching BlackFly take flight just blew me away,â said Darren Pleasance, director of the US Experimental Aircraft Association. âIâve never seen anything like it.â While the vehicle will not require a pilot's licence, Opener said as a precaution riders would have to undergo a training programme in order to become acquainted. The BlackFly flying car is said to work best when taking off from grassy areas âEven though not required by Federal Aviation Administration regulations, BlackFly operators will be required to successfully complete the FAA Private Pilot written examination and also complete company-mandated vehicle familiarisation and operator training,"" it said. Self-driving air taxi lifts off Degree in 'flying car' engineering offered online Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? Openerâs chief executive Marcus Leng said the on-board controls offered âinstant gratificationâ. âYou have total command of three-dimensional space,âhe told CBS News correspondent John Blackstone,external. âWhen you press the thumb-stick to climb, you have absolute full control. When you stop in the middle of the air and go off the joystick, the aircraft freezes. âAnd when I say freezesâ¦ it literally freezes in the air.â BlackFly can also fly autonomously, Mr Leng said. 'Will they crash? Probably' Opener joins a long list of companies chasing the ultimate science fiction dream of a flying car, and thanks to rapid improvements in drone capabilities, that future seems closer than ever. Kitty Hawk promises to deliver a ""world free from traffic"" As well as BlackFly and Kitty Hawk, companies such as Uber are also seeking to get into the flying car market - if indeed there ever is one. The Hiller Aviation Museum in Northern California is a graveyard of failed attempts to create a flying car. The vehicles will eventually cost the same as a typical SUV, its creators claim But the museumâs head of operations, Willie Turner, believes this latest batch might be on to something - as long as aviation authorities can accommodate the new ideas. âNow we have the technology,â he said. âBut the regulations are âwell you canât do this, you canât do thatâ. They donât understand it.â He added: âNow will they crash? Probably, but cars crash every day. âYou know itâs not going to be foolproof but it will be much better than the current system we have now."" _______ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

"Doctors are using old-fashioned fax machines to communicate Hospitals are still reliant on ""archaic"" fax machines with thousands still in use, a survey shows. Senior doctors said the continued use of the outdated technology was ""ludicrous"", and modern forms of communication were urgently needed. The poll, by the Royal College of Surgeons using freedom of information laws, revealed nearly 9,000 fax machines were in use across England. Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Trust topped the list, relying on 603 machines. ""Alongside innovation like artificial intelligence and robot-assisted surgery, NHS hospital trusts remain stubbornly attached to using archaic fax machines for a significant proportion of their communications. This is ludicrous,"" said Richard Kerr, chair of the Royal College of Surgeons' Commission on the Future of Surgery. ""The NHS cannot continue to rely on a technology most other organisations scrapped in the early 2000s,"" he added. Three-quarters of the trusts in England replied to the survey* - 95 in total. Barts Trust, England's biggest trust, uses 369 machines. Ten trusts said that they did not own any fax machines, but four in ten reported more than 100 in use. The survey follows a report last year by artificial intelligence company DeepMind Health which named the NHS as the world's largest purchaser of fax machines. Separate figures last year showed that the NHS is also heavily reliant on pagers.  The report, by digital company CommonTime, said there were around 130,000 pagers in use at annual cost of Â£6.6m. The report emphasised that pagers were not only costly, but also limited, as they do not support two-way communication. Pagers are still in use in the NHS Faced with old-fashioned technology, DeepMind Health found that frustrated doctors had taken matters into their own hands and were using non-sanctioned apps like SnapChat and WhatsApp to communicate patient information. Health apps to inform patient records Use of WhatsApp in NHS 'widespread' NHS trust scraps faxing of patient data The NHS has been slow to take on board the digital revolution. Back in 2013 then health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who left the department this week, said he wanted the health service to be paperless by 2018. The new health secretary, Matt Hancock, who was appointed this week, is known to be a big supporter of digital technologies. An NHS app allowing GP appointments to be booked and repeat prescriptions to be ordered, is due to be launched this year. Some trusts are embracing new technology. At Oxford University Hospitals Trust, fax machines were switched off last year. Chief information and digital officer Peter Knight said it was ""one of the first"" trusts to turn off its faxes and move to the internal email system called NHSmail. He said the extra security requirements needed for patient data was one reason why the NHS had been slow to move away from fax technology. Responding to the survey, Phillippa Hentsch, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, blamed a lack of funds for the over-reliance on outdated technology. ""For too long NHS capital spending on facilities and technology has been pared back in order to keep services going,"" she said. ""We see the results. Fax machines belong to the past."" Jason Zemmel, executive chairman of Integral Medical Holdings Group, a network which provides administrative support to the NHS, said modernisation was overdue. ""Whilst the service is starting to recognise the importance of technology, this highlights how far we still have to go to ensure that the NHS keeps pace with the complex, changing demands of patients in today's digitalised society."" *Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust was originally included in this article as having 400 fax machines, but the Royal College of Surgeons has since admitted an error was made, and the trust only has one or two stand alone machines.

"This video can not be played John Volanthen reached the group nine days after they went missing in the cave complex A British diver who helped save 12 schoolboys and their football coach from a flooded cave in Thailand says he and other rescuers ""are not heroes"". John Volanthen was the first voice the boys heard after nine days trapped in the underground network in Chiang Rai province. This week, after an 18-day ordeal, they were all rescued from the cave complex. Arriving at Heathrow Airport on Thursday, Mr Volanthen said it was a ""relief"" but played down his heroics. Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant based in Bristol but who grew up in Brighton, was one of the first rescuers to discover the group huddled in the darkness of the Luang Nang Non Cave. The heroes who saved the Wild Boars Cave rescue: The operation in pictures Arriving back in the UK, he said everybody had ""pulled together"" and was ""very, very pleased it worked out quite so well"". ""We're just very happy that the boys are out and safe,"" he said. ""We were very relieved that they were all alive but I think at that point we realised the enormity of the situation and that's perhaps why it took a while to get them all out."" This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys On social media, Mr Volanthen has been described as a ""real hero"" with many calling for him and fellow Briton Rick Stanton to be honoured. But Mr Volanthen dismissed the idea, adding: ""We are not heroes. What we do is very calculating, very calm. It's quite the opposite."" ""We take it one step at a time and hopefully, as we've managed to in this case, we come up with the results."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Volanthen also paid tribute to Thai navy diver Saman Kunan, who died while replenishing oxygen canisters, saying his death was an ""absolute tragedy"" and brought a ""bittersweet"" taste to an otherwise ""excellent"" operation.

How the Thai boys were rescued Key questions on Thai cave rescue The final four boys and their 25-year-old coach were brought to safety on Tuesday, having entered the network for exploration on June 23 before it became flooded by monsoon rains.

"This video can not be played Why Tory MPs are fighting over the government's Brexit white paper The government has published its blueprint for UK relations with the EU, with Theresa May saying it ""delivers on the Brexit people voted for"". Thelong-awaited White Paper,externalis aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. But Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was a ""bad deal for Britain"". And US President Donald Trump said the proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country. Trump: Brexit plan could kill US trade deal Reality Check: What does Brexit White Paper reveal? Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan The White Paper fleshes out the Chequers agreement that sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis. The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. Dominic Raab is fronting the plans after David Davis quit earlier this week New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, formerly a leading figure in the Leave campaign, said the White Paper was a blueprint for a ""principled, pragmatic and ambitious future partnership between the UK and the EU"". ""Now, it is time for the EU to respond in kind, we approach these negotiations with a spirit of pragmatism, compromise and, indeed, friendship, I hope. I trust that the EU will engage with our proposals in the same spirit,"" he told MPs. Asked in Brussels about US President Donald Trump's claim that the British people were not getting the Brexit they voted for, Mrs May said: ""We have come to an agreement on the proposal we are putting to the European Union which absolutely delivers on the Brexit we voted for. ""They voted for us to take back control of our money, our law and our borders. That is exactly what we will do."" Jacob Rees-Mogg: 'Not what the British people voted for' Leading Tory rebel Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""There are very few signs of the prime minister's famous red lines. ""It is a pale imitation of the paper prepared by David Davis, a bad deal for Britain. It is not something I would vote for, nor is it what the British people voted for."" Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith told ministers he had ""deep misgivings"" about the White Paper. ""I voted to leave not to half leave,"" he said. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he would analyse the details with the European Parliament and member states and was ""looking forward"" to negotiations with the UK next week.

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, said he welcomed the UK's proposal for a future ""association agreement"" with the EU - an idea he has been promoting for some time. He added: ""We will analyse the White Paper in light of our priorities: citizens' rights, an operational backstop for Ireland and a deep economic relationship based on the integrity of the union and internal market."" A free trade zone for goods is at the heart of the proposals CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said ""many of the intentions are reassuring"" but ""there are gaps in these proposals and more detail is needed on EU VAT, some services sectors and the new customs system"". ""It's vitally important UK negotiators get their heads down and work with businesses to grapple with the detail and get it right,"" she added. Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""With just 37 weeks before we leave the European Union, we need to see tangible and comprehensive details on these proposals and how they will impact small businesses."" Former chief executive of UK Trade and Investment Sir Andrew Cahn told the BBC the City would be hurt by the lack of a deal on financial services, stating: ""It means the City is going to have to change. It's going to have to change quite radically. ""We will clearly lose business, some business, to Europe. But I think the City will adjust and find a way forward."" Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said the White Paper was ""a fudge, which pleases no one and is politically undeliverable"". Lloyd's boss warns on Brexit services plan The proposals were approved by cabinet last Friday but soon led to a big political fallout Some MPs are already calling it a ""hard Brexit"" for services, even though, overall, the deal suggests much closer ties to the rest of the EU than many Brexiteers had desired. For the prime minister and the government it's an important step in spelling out the reality of leaving - more political freedom does, this paper suggests, come at a cost. And it is a compromise, which by its very nature, can't please everyone. Read Laura' full blog This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow and MPs were unhappy at the White Paper's late arrival Dominic Raab's first speech as Brexit Secretary was halted shortly after it had begun, as MPs shouted that they had not seen the White Paper. Mr Raab said the paper would be made available ""as soon as is practicably possible"". Former Labour minister Ben Bradshaw could be seen throwing copies of the document to MPs on his own bench. At which point, Speaker Bercow decided to suspend sitting for five minutes to give MPs time to read it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Raab had ""not got off to a very good start"", adding: ""The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the government is in such a mess."" Sir Keir told MPs: ""Across business communities, among trade unions and I genuinely believe across this House there is growing unity that the UK should remain economically close to the EU - and that means negotiating a comprehensive customs union with the EU27, and a single market deal with the right balance of rights and obligations tailored to the UK."" Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who, is campaigning for a referendum on the final EU deal - in contrast to his party's leadership - said the White Paper was ""totally unworkable and a bad deal for Britain"". It sets out four areas of future co-operation: The economic partnership between the EU and the UK Security co-operation Future co-operation in areas like aviation and nuclear power The ""institutional frameworks"" that will enforce the agreement The document repeatedly acknowledges that the UK will have more barriers to trade in some areas than there are today. It sets out plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"",  with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The paper says that the UK will end the free of movement of people, but suggests EU citizens would be allowed to come to the UK without visas to do ""paid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances"". No more detail of this was given by officials on Thursday morning, says BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, but they rejected suggestions that it could open the door to freedom of movement for workers. The paper also suggests that there could be ""reciprocal"" arrangements with the EU for the payment of certain limited benefits or social security. Again, officials denied that this would mean widespread access to the UK benefits systems for EU nationals after Brexit, says our correspondent. Both of these elements will be subject to the upcoming negotiation. As the Chequers agreement set out on Friday, the UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services. The government's aim is to preserve free trade in that part of the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. The White Paper also proposes the setting up of a ""governing body"", made up of UK and EU ministers, and then a ""joint committee"" of officials, which would enforce the agreement. Officially, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK would come to an end. British citizens or businesses would no longer be able to take issues to the European Court of Justice - and the court would no longer be able to make judgements on UK cases. But the White Paper accepts that the European Court of Justice will be ""the interpreter of EU rules"" that the UK has agreed to follow in the ""common rule book"". The White Paper also sets out in more detail the government's proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods, where it plans for the UK to collect some EU tariffs. The paper confirms that the UK will not seek ""mutual recognition"" in the services sector, which makes up the vast majority of the economy. A leaked version of an earlier draft of the White Paper, put together by the Brexit department under David Davis, envisaged that there would be such an arrangement. Some MPs have already expressed concern that by pursuing a looser arrangement with the rest of the EU on services it means a ""hard Brexit"" for the majority of the economy while the goods sector stays closely tied to the single market, although technically not inside it.

"Finally, the government's plan for Brexit is not as its critics have complained, a blank sheet of paper. Instead, it'sa White Paper,external, a long document that spells out the compromise Theresa May brokered at Chequers last week. It will be pored over in the days to come. In the main, it's pretty unsurprising and follows the direction of travel the government has adopted of late, giving more detail of how a new customs arrangement will avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, and protect manufacturing; how a new system will work which would see the UK following EU law but not be directly affected (although hugely influenced) by the European Courts, and how freedom of movement as we know it - that allows unlimited immigration to the UK from the EU - will come to an end. Given there have already been two cabinet resignations over the plan, it's blindingly obvious that the bits we know about are going to cause huge trouble in the Tory Party. But on first examination of the detailed paper, three things jump out. The government have described their plan for an ""association agreement"", for the first time. Such agreements were created originally to help countries that wanted to join the EU get ready. They're used more widely now. But some Brexiteers won't like the idea of using that model as a jumping-off point. Secondly, while officials are adamant there is no way that the paper argues for the kind of freedom of movement we have now, it points the way to allowing workers to come to the UK without visas, and also opens the door to some kind of reciprocal arrangement with the EU on benefits. Government sources insist this doesn't mean anything like the kind of free access that EU citizens have now, and indeed, that UK nationals have on the continent. But it does sketch out potential for giving EU citizens preferential access to the UK after we leave the EU. Lastly, it's notable how many times the White Paper says, in terms, that we can't have it all. The document accepts many times that in some areas there will be more barriers to doing business after Brexit, and that in some areas the UK might lose out. And by not going for one whizz bang agreement on services, the largest part of the UK economy has less assurance than goods and manufacturing. Some MPs are already calling it a ""hard Brexit"" for services, even though, overall, the deal suggests much closer ties to the rest of the EU than many Brexiteers had desired. For the prime minister and the government it's an important step in spelling out the reality of leaving - more political freedom does, this paper suggests, come at a cost. And it is a compromise, which by its very nature, can't please everyone. For the prime minister, there are delicate days ahead, to keep the competing interests on board.

"This video can not be played Why Tory MPs are fighting over the government's Brexit white paper The government has published its blueprint for UK relations with the EU, with Theresa May saying it ""delivers on the Brexit people voted for"". Thelong-awaited White Paper,externalis aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. But Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said it was a ""bad deal for Britain"". And US President Donald Trump said the proposals would ""probably kill"" a trade deal with his country. Trump: Brexit plan could kill US trade deal Reality Check: What does Brexit White Paper reveal? Why the EU is silent on May's Brexit plan The White Paper fleshes out the Chequers agreement that sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis. The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. Dominic Raab is fronting the plans after David Davis quit earlier this week New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, formerly a leading figure in the Leave campaign, said the White Paper was a blueprint for a ""principled, pragmatic and ambitious future partnership between the UK and the EU"". ""Now, it is time for the EU to respond in kind, we approach these negotiations with a spirit of pragmatism, compromise and, indeed, friendship, I hope. I trust that the EU will engage with our proposals in the same spirit,"" he told MPs. Asked in Brussels about US President Donald Trump's claim that the British people were not getting the Brexit they voted for, Mrs May said: ""We have come to an agreement on the proposal we are putting to the European Union which absolutely delivers on the Brexit we voted for. ""They voted for us to take back control of our money, our law and our borders. That is exactly what we will do."" Jacob Rees-Mogg: 'Not what the British people voted for' Leading Tory rebel Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""There are very few signs of the prime minister's famous red lines. ""It is a pale imitation of the paper prepared by David Davis, a bad deal for Britain. It is not something I would vote for, nor is it what the British people voted for."" Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith told ministers he had ""deep misgivings"" about the White Paper. ""I voted to leave not to half leave,"" he said. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he would analyse the details with the European Parliament and member states and was ""looking forward"" to negotiations with the UK next week.

Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator, said he welcomed the UK's proposal for a future ""association agreement"" with the EU - an idea he has been promoting for some time. He added: ""We will analyse the White Paper in light of our priorities: citizens' rights, an operational backstop for Ireland and a deep economic relationship based on the integrity of the union and internal market."" A free trade zone for goods is at the heart of the proposals CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said ""many of the intentions are reassuring"" but ""there are gaps in these proposals and more detail is needed on EU VAT, some services sectors and the new customs system"". ""It's vitally important UK negotiators get their heads down and work with businesses to grapple with the detail and get it right,"" she added. Federation of Small Businesses national chairman Mike Cherry said: ""With just 37 weeks before we leave the European Union, we need to see tangible and comprehensive details on these proposals and how they will impact small businesses."" Former chief executive of UK Trade and Investment Sir Andrew Cahn told the BBC the City would be hurt by the lack of a deal on financial services, stating: ""It means the City is going to have to change. It's going to have to change quite radically. ""We will clearly lose business, some business, to Europe. But I think the City will adjust and find a way forward."" Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said the White Paper was ""a fudge, which pleases no one and is politically undeliverable"". Lloyd's boss warns on Brexit services plan The proposals were approved by cabinet last Friday but soon led to a big political fallout Some MPs are already calling it a ""hard Brexit"" for services, even though, overall, the deal suggests much closer ties to the rest of the EU than many Brexiteers had desired. For the prime minister and the government it's an important step in spelling out the reality of leaving - more political freedom does, this paper suggests, come at a cost. And it is a compromise, which by its very nature, can't please everyone. Read Laura' full blog This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow and MPs were unhappy at the White Paper's late arrival Dominic Raab's first speech as Brexit Secretary was halted shortly after it had begun, as MPs shouted that they had not seen the White Paper. Mr Raab said the paper would be made available ""as soon as is practicably possible"". Former Labour minister Ben Bradshaw could be seen throwing copies of the document to MPs on his own bench. At which point, Speaker Bercow decided to suspend sitting for five minutes to give MPs time to read it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Raab had ""not got off to a very good start"", adding: ""The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the government is in such a mess."" Sir Keir told MPs: ""Across business communities, among trade unions and I genuinely believe across this House there is growing unity that the UK should remain economically close to the EU - and that means negotiating a comprehensive customs union with the EU27, and a single market deal with the right balance of rights and obligations tailored to the UK."" Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who, is campaigning for a referendum on the final EU deal - in contrast to his party's leadership - said the White Paper was ""totally unworkable and a bad deal for Britain"". It sets out four areas of future co-operation: The economic partnership between the EU and the UK Security co-operation Future co-operation in areas like aviation and nuclear power The ""institutional frameworks"" that will enforce the agreement The document repeatedly acknowledges that the UK will have more barriers to trade in some areas than there are today. It sets out plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"",  with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The paper says that the UK will end the free of movement of people, but suggests EU citizens would be allowed to come to the UK without visas to do ""paid work in limited and clearly defined circumstances"". No more detail of this was given by officials on Thursday morning, says BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, but they rejected suggestions that it could open the door to freedom of movement for workers. The paper also suggests that there could be ""reciprocal"" arrangements with the EU for the payment of certain limited benefits or social security. Again, officials denied that this would mean widespread access to the UK benefits systems for EU nationals after Brexit, says our correspondent. Both of these elements will be subject to the upcoming negotiation. As the Chequers agreement set out on Friday, the UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services. The government's aim is to preserve free trade in that part of the economy and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. The White Paper also proposes the setting up of a ""governing body"", made up of UK and EU ministers, and then a ""joint committee"" of officials, which would enforce the agreement. Officially, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK would come to an end. British citizens or businesses would no longer be able to take issues to the European Court of Justice - and the court would no longer be able to make judgements on UK cases. But the White Paper accepts that the European Court of Justice will be ""the interpreter of EU rules"" that the UK has agreed to follow in the ""common rule book"". The White Paper also sets out in more detail the government's proposed customs system, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods, where it plans for the UK to collect some EU tariffs. The paper confirms that the UK will not seek ""mutual recognition"" in the services sector, which makes up the vast majority of the economy. A leaked version of an earlier draft of the White Paper, put together by the Brexit department under David Davis, envisaged that there would be such an arrangement. Some MPs have already expressed concern that by pursuing a looser arrangement with the rest of the EU on services it means a ""hard Brexit"" for the majority of the economy while the goods sector stays closely tied to the single market, although technically not inside it.

"The Rock shopping centre in Bury, Greater Manchester, said queues were building at 10:45 BST A cheap teddy offer which left shoppers with young children queuing for up to eight hours amid chaotic scenes has been abandoned over ""safety concerns"". Build-A-Bear Workshop was offering UK customers a chance to buy any bear, which can cost up to Â£52, for the price of their child's age. At Leeds' White Rose Shopping Centre police were called when queues of ""about a mile long"" formed. The company said the response had been ""overwhelming and unprecedented"". There have also been reports of long queues in US shopping centres, where the American company was also putting on the same promotion on Thursday. Birmingham's Bullring shop was among those that shut early Police were called to the White Rose Centre in Leeds due to the popularity of the ""pay your age"" event Many of the company's stores - including Sheffield's Meadowhall shopping centre, Birmingham's Bullring, Telford and Basingstoke - had to shut for the rest of the day following demand. Leeds shopper Paul Shaw said: ""Crazy scenes at the White Rose - Build-A-Bear is in chaos. ""Queuing from the store, all the way outside, approximately five-hour queue.

The queue was already enormous by the time I got there on my day off with my son. Someone told us that people had been queuing there since 06:30 BST and one woman told us she had travelled for more than an hour to get there because it was her closest store. We waited an hour-and-a-half but it was too much for my little boy and I thought there would be no bears left so we took a Â£12 voucher that could be redeemed another time. This video can not be played Twitter user @JRW_Fitness walked the length of this queue in Blackpool Parents on social media criticised the event, saying they were ""disgusted"" by the lack of organisation.

On its website Build-A-Bear describes itself as a ""one-of-a-kind global brand that kids love and parents trust"". The US brand was established in 1997 and has made more than 160 million teddy bears to date. Build-A-Bear stores offer children a chance to design, stuff and dress their own teddy bear. Customers can even add sounds and scents to their toy. Basic bears cost between Â£12 and Â£27 with limited edition toys costing more than Â£50. Clothing for teddies also ranges from Â£4.50 to Â£15. Amanda Bailey, 42, from Mickleover, Derbyshire, started queuing outside the Derby shop with her two daughters, aged two and five, at 09:10 and did not get inside until 12:40. ""I thought I would give the queue an hour and then you get sucked in,"" she said. ""Once inside it took a further two hours to get her bears because of the ""stuffing counter queues"". She said although she saved quite a bit on the cost of the Â£21.50 she bought for both children, she added: ""When I look back I will probably think, 'what have I done that for?', especially with what I will end up paying for parking."" Amanda Bailey queued for hours at the Derby store with daughters Paige (pictured) and Amelia Jolene Quarrell, 34, of Swadlincote, said she and her friend spent about the same length of time queuing both outside and inside the Derby store.

""At the end he takes the gag out of my mouth and he said 'sorry for the prophylactic'."" She added: ""So he had gagged me with a condom.

"This video can not be played Video shows Stormy Daniels being escorted, in handcuffs, from a police van and into Franklin County Correctional Facility Charges against US adult film star Stormy Daniels have been dropped less than 24 hours after she was arrested in a strip club in Columbus, Ohio. Ms Daniels was arrested for allegedly touching a patron in Sirens, the venue where she was performing. Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, shared a court document,externalsaying the case was dismissed on Thursday. Ms Daniels hit the headlines after alleging she had slept with President Donald Trump in 2006, which he denies. Mr Avenatti had earlier called the arrest ""a setup"" and ""politically motivated"". The president and the porn star: Why this matters The conflicting statements in the Stormy Daniels saga Columbus police chief Kim Jacobs said on Thursday her arrest was a ""mistake"" because of a misinterpretation of the law. Ohio law prohibiting physical contact between strippers and customers applies only to those who ""regularly"" dance at a club. Ms Daniels performed for the first time at the Sirens club in Columbus. ""A mistake was made, and I accept full responsibility,""Chief Jacobs told the AP,externalhours after the charges were dropped. A police charge sheet tweeted by a CBS News reporter,externalsays Ms Daniels touched a police officer posing as a patron ""in a specified anatomical area"". She was accused of rubbing undercover police officers' faces against her breasts during her performance. Documents posted on the Franklin County Municipal Court website showed Ms Daniels had posted $6,054 (Â£4,586) in bail. The Franklin County Sheriff's Office in Columbus provided Ms Daniels' mug shot Mr Avenatti tweeted that Ms Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, had been performing ""the same act she has performed across the nation at nearly 100 strip clubs"". Mr Avenatti posted a statement from Ms Daniels saying she would not be able to go ahead with Friday night's show. ""I deeply apologise to my fans in Columbus,"" the statement read.

"Environment questions to Michael Gove and team Urgent question on hostile environment agenda Urgent question on policing during US president's visit Business statement from Leader of the House Statement on Brexit white paper Richard Morris and Lucy Webster The UK government sets out in detail how it wants trade with the EU to work after Brexit. What happened? House of CommonsParliament Two urgent questions and a statement kept the Commons busy today. The sitting was briefly suspended about a minute into Dominic Raab's first speech from the dispatch box as Exiting the EU Secretary. The Speaker was unhappy that MPs did not have copies of the Brexit white paper in front of them to ask questions, so MPs started distributing them amongst themselves, during which time the sitting was suspended. MPs from all parties were critical of the move, while Mr Raab said he would speak to the clerks office over the confusion. Thelong-awaited White Paper,externalis aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. It fleshes out the Chequers agreement that sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis. The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals in the White Paper so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. Labour MPs asked two further questions, one on the pausing of the hostile environment policy for those over 30 in the wake of the Windrush scandal; and the second on police staffing and funding levels during the visit of the US President, Donald Trump. The Commons returns at 2:30pm on Monday, with Home Office questions. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Business Minister Andrew Griffiths says it is easy to ""underestimate"" how significant the collapse of Carillion was, including the impacts on the lives of ""too many"". It is important that ""everything"" the government does is to prevent this from happening again, he says. The business secretary has commissioned a review into the responsibilities of the Financial Reporting Council, he adds. He adds that ""thousands of documents are being considered"" in trying to trace what went wrong at Carillion. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow business minister Bill Esterson says the collapse of Carillion was ""a fiasco"" for the 30,000 employees and 20,000 sub-contractors, the 27,000 members of its defined pension scheme, 30,000 suppliers owed Â£2bn in unpaid invoices, the children who depended on school meals, armed services personnel whose housing is mismanaged and the taxpayer who is picking up the tab for the colossal failure of the government to safeguard large sums of public money. He says the ""cosy"" way in which the big four accountancy firms (Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, and KPMG) operate must come to and end and ask if the government supports calls for the big four to be broken up. He ends by saying that Labour in government would be a party of business for the many, not the few. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Chris Stephens says that the mystery of Carillion's collapse is not something to be surprised about, but instead the surprise was how long the company lasted for. He says the company exploited suppliers and ""gamed with public assets"" and sought to ""eliminate any competitors"". The US president questions whether the UK's current Brexit plan is ""what they voted for"". Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Ms Reeves says the directors, who made the decisions which led to the company's collapse, still refuse to accept their responsibility and continue to deny the findings of her committee's report. She says they awarded themselves bonuses while workers have lost jobs and pensions. She says the auditors, including KPMG, also did not issue the appropriate warnings. She says auditors have the wrong incentives because they report to senior managers. She says that when management and the auditors were seen to be failing, the regulators should have stepped in. She says they were too ""passive"" and acted too late. She says the pension regulator eventually ""barked but did not bite."" She concludes that ""urgent action"" must be taken for those affected and for those who would be affected if the same were to happen again. ""Best value is not the same as lowest price,"" she says. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament MPs move on to a debate on the collapse of Carillion, introduced by the Chair of the Business Committee, Rachel Reeves. She says that this Sunday will be six months since Carillion collapsed, owing money to suppliers and subcontractors and with major projects ""mothballed"". Five committees have looked into its collapse, she says, with her committee considering the causes for its demise. ""Warning lights should have been flashing when such a big business was on the brink,"" she says. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament Education Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that many adopted children have struggled with ""overwhelming"" feelings of rejection and with forming attachments. ""It is truly shocking to hear how single mothers were treated at that time in our country,"" he says, while adding that the church has apologised for their role in this. He says that there general principle that children are better looked after by their own family. He adds that these days forced separation takes place from a court order. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament The shadow children and families minister, Emma Lewell-Buck, says that ""culturally, the 50s, 60s and 70s"" when the majority of these adoption orders were made, was a different time. Welfare benefits were not available and sex education was nonexistent, which affected people who had children out of wedlock, she says. She adds that many of the stories from the time show the ""powerlessness"" women experienced. The very least these women need ""is an apology,"" she says. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament MPs are holding a debate on the practice of forced adoption - a backbench business debate proposed by Labour MPs Alison McGovern and Stephen Twigg. House of CommonsParliament German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and Prime Minister Theresa May during a reception at the end of the Western Balkans Summit The statement on the Brexit white paper concludes and MPs move on to a statement by a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee on global Britain and the Western Balkans. On 9 and 10 July 2018, the UK hosted the 5th annual Western Balkans Summit. Committee member, and Labour MP, Mike Gapes says,due to the resignation of the summit host - the then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson- the summit ""didn't get the attention it deserved"". He says this was the first time the UK had hosted the summit and was ""a test of the UK's commitment to European scrutiny"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative Stephen Metcalfe says his constituents want reassurance the white paper will ""return control over our borders, over our money and our laws"". ""Don't listen to the siren voices,"" he urges, advising people to instead look at the document ""and see where it delivers"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Labour's Wes Streeting suggests that the government's white paper ""doesn't command the support of a majority of the House of Commons"". He asks how the EU, European Commission or European Parliament can take the proposals seriously ""because this house, it is clear, does not."" Dominic Raab accuses the MP of ""blithely skating over divisions in his own party"". He defends the government's plan as a ""positive, principled approach that is deliverable"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Bridgen says colleagues have ""grave concerns"" about this proposal, in terms of how it will play out the wishes of the British people during the referendum. He asks why Mr Raab's first choice of special advisor, Stewart Jackson, was rejected by the Cabinet Office. Mr Raab pays tribute to the work of special advisors and says he will be naming his shortly. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative David Jones says that the role of the European Court of Justice is preserved as the interpreter of EU rules in the UK. He asks what kind of audience British applicants to the court could expect when no longer an EU country. Mr Raab says there is provision for ""consistent interpretation"" of the law under the ECJ. The UK would have a veto over decisions, he says, adding that the UK needs to have agreement over common rules. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Brexit-supporting Conservative Owen Paterson asks the Brexit secretary if the ""common rulebook"" will lead to EU policy being put back into UK law without the ability to amend it. Dominic Raab says the common rulebook will only apply to the extent that is necessary to avoid friction at the border. What's the common rulebook? Have a lookhere. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Labour's Kate Hoey says that it is ""nonsense"" that MPs got the white paper so late, and she asks if Angela Merkel has seen this document before MPs. She asks for assurances that European citizens will no longer receive special treatment in immigration after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Raab says that freedom of movement is something which discriminates the rest of the world against EU nationals in UK immigration. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper questions why there is a lack of detail on the government's post-Brexit immigration plan. Dominic Raab responds that the paper is very clear that free movement will end. Home Secreatry Sajid Javid told the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday that there will be a separate white paper on post-Brexit immigration in the autumn.

"Half of young people in the UK would like to own an electric car â compared with just a quarter of their parents, a survey suggests. The research comes from motoring group the AA, which says myths about electric vehicles are putting off many drivers. This matters because cleaning up air pollution and tackling climate change both depend on mass acceptance of electric vehicles (EVs). Young people seem to be more accepting of the technology than older people. But too many still hold needless fears,external, the AA says. It comes as the government has announced a target for 50% of all new vehicle sales to be in the ultra-low emissions category by 2030. The opinions were revealed in an AA/Populus poll of 10,293 drivers. 85% of people overall in the survey said that there arenât enough public charging points for EVs. 76% said EVs canât go far enough on a single charge. 76% think EVs are too expensive. 67% think EVs take too long to charge. 67% think there isnât enough choice of models There are 16,000 charging points at 5,800 locations and 340 points added monthly. Most driverswill charge their car at home. Range is improving all the time. Several models have a 250-mile-plus range. Some 95% of car journeys are under 25 miles. Costs are coming down. Grants up to Â£4,500 are available and EVs are much cheaper to run - at 2p per mile. Rapid chargers which could charge an EV to around 80% range inaround 30 minutes are on the wayâ ideal for ""filling stations"". There are 38 cars eligible for plug-in grants from a Renault Zoe to Jaguar I-PACE and more on the horizon, such as the Tesla Model 3. The AAâs president Edmund King said: âThe range, charging speed and charging point infrastructure are all on the increase. There needs to be a more concerted effort by us all to sell the benefits of electric vehicles. âDrivers will also need to change their fuelling habits with the majority charging their EVs at night (at home) and then at their destinations. âUltimately outstanding, affordable, stylish EVs with a decent range will sell themselves. Massive savings can already be made on running and service costs, as well as the tax benefits.â âThe younger generation in particular are ready to embrace the electric revolution.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Sir Christopher Meyer was the British ambassador to the US between 1997 and 2003 An ex-British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, is in hospital after being attacked at an underground station in London. His wife, Lady Catherine Meyer, said he was changing Tube lines at Victoria Station on Wednesday afternoon when he was set upon. She said he may have a broken nose and his eye was swollen ""like a balloon"". Police said two teenagers had been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon have been released under investigation while enquiries continue. Describing her husband's condition Lady Meyer said: ""He is not allowed to eat or drink. ""He's a strong lad and his spirits are not bad. He has a patch over his left eye which has thankfully stopped bleeding."" He is waiting to hear whether or not he would be operated on for injuries to his hand and face, she added. This image of Sir Christopher in hospital was supplied by his family Lady Meyer said: ""I am a wife who is angry that her husband has been beaten badly. ""As you get older it's harder to recover from this sort of thing."" She added: ""I think we really need to stop this, if you can't walk in London because of fear of being attacked brutally. ""99% [of people] are kind and nice, but 1% are nasty. ""We need to look at the facts and start doing something more aggressive against this type of violence... we need to be tougher.""

"Donald Trump (far right) says Nato members would ""substantially"" up their budgets Nato allies have cast doubt on US President Donald Trump's claim they had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets, saying they simply remained committed to a 2014 deal. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told US broadcaster CNN the allies had ""a commitment to spend 2%"" of their annual output (GDP) on defence budgets. Members agreed four years ago they would all reach that target by 2024. Mr Trump had hailed ""tremendous progress"" at Nato's summit in Brussels. Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? He has previously been highly critical of the alliance, complaining the US pays more than others. by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Welcome to Trump world. His press conference at Nato ranged from bluster to the bizarre but there is no doubting the president has had an effect. There was ""a new sense of urgency"" about increasing defence spending according to Jens Stoltenberg. But just how much extra money there will be and how quickly remains to be seen. Just as with his summit in North Korea, reality appears to be what President Trump decides it to be. The mere fact that the president of the alliance's essential member could even entertain the idea that the US might leave Nato is extraordinary. But by the end of the summit he said he believed in the alliance. This dissonance is at the heart of the Trump method. He gets results - or appears to - by both strengthening and weakening the alliance at the same time. Nato leaders will be glad this summit is over but remain uneasy as to just what Mr Trump might say when he meets Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Exactly what took place - and what was agreed - behind closed doors at the two-day Nato summit in Brussels is not known. What is known is that Mr Trump called for an emergency meeting on Thursday morning with other Nato members. How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? What does the US contribute to Nato? Unconfirmed reports suggested Mr Trump had threatened to go it alone if other nations did not meetthe alliance's target of 2% of their GDP by 2024. But by the time Mr Trump held a press conference, he was hailing the summit as a success. ""We made a tremendous amount of progress today,"" he said. ""It has been really amazing to see the level of spirit in that room."" It was, he said, ""presently unnecessary"" to consider quitting Nato. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The United States was not being treated fairly"" He added the US commitment to Nato - which was established in 1949 with members agreeing that an attack against one would be considered an attack against them all - remained ""very strong"". Mr Trump went on to say the allies had ""substantially upped their commitment"" and would pay ""more quickly"". Mr Stoltenberg, he added, gave him ""total credit"" for the increased spending which, he said, he instigated during his first Nato meeting last year. Mr Stoltenberg said members had had a ""frank and open discussion"" which ""created a new sense of urgency"", and that the ""clear message from President Trump"" was ""having an impact"". Italy's new Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron also made it clear they had not signed up to anything more than what was agreed four years ago. Trump vows to end 'vicious' African conflicts ""Everyone agreed to raise spending, in line with commitments made in 2014,"" Mr Macron said, adding he was unconvinced by proposals to increase it to 4%. He said France had a clear strategy of analysing security threats and that he could not ask his government for ""tens of billions more"" beyond that. ""It's taxpayers' money we're talking about,"" he said. President Macron also said the meetings had had a different tone to Mr Trump's early morning tweets, which had been typically critical.

Mr Macron said the conversations had been more respectful, according to Reuters news agency. At the meeting, Mr Trump singled out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. Some reports suggest he also shocked other leaders in the room when he turned to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and referred to her by her first name. The Nato leaders also turned their attention to the conflict in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani was present for the second day of talks, and Mr Stoltenberg hopes the bloc will agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024.

On its website Build-A-Bear describes itself as a ""one-of-a-kind global brand that kids love and parents trust"". The US brand was established in 1997 and has made more than 160 million teddy bears to date. Build-A-Bear stores offer children a chance to design, stuff and dress their own teddy bear. Customers can even add sounds and scents to their toy. Basic bears cost between Â£12 and Â£27 with limited edition toys costing more than Â£50. Clothing for teddies also ranges from Â£4.50 to Â£15.

""She's only five, they're not really doing much in school that's important at that age,"" she said.

Customers in the Derby shop said it took them another two hours to buy bears once in the store because of extra queues Gemma Butler, marketing director at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, said: ""This was an ill thought-out and unprofessional promotional execution, one that not only risks their own brand reputation, but has the potential to bring the wider marketing sector into disrepute.""

"More than 100 offences are punishable by flogging under Iran's Islamic penal code Amnesty International has condemned the Iranian authorities for publicly flogging a man who was convicted of consuming alcohol when he was 14 or 15. Local media published photographs of the man - identified only as ""M R"" - being given 80 lashes in a square in the eastern city of Kashmar on Tuesday. Prosecutors say he was arrested in the Iranian year of 1385 (March 2006-March 2007) and sentenced the next year. It is not clear why the punishment was carried out more than 10 years later. What can you be flogged for in Iran? Country profile The photographs show a young man tied to a tree being flogged,externalby a masked man in uniform. A small crowd of people can be seen watching at a distance. ""The circumstances of this case are absolutely shocking, representing another horrific example of the Iranian authorities' warped priorities,"" Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa Director, Philip Luther. said in a statement. ""No-one, regardless of age, should be subjected to flogging; that a child was prosecuted for consuming alcohol and sentenced to 80 lashes beggars belief."" 'I risked everything to dance in Iran' Iranian women dance for arrested teen The Young Journalists Club website quoted Kashmar's prosecutor as sayingM R consumed alcohol at a wedding where an argument caused a fight in which a 17-year-old boy was killed,external. He was not suspected of involvement in the death. Article 265 of Iran's Islamic penal code states that the punishment for consumption of alcohol by a Muslim is 80 lashes. More than 100 other offences are punishable by flogging, including theft, assault, vandalism, defamation and fraud, as well as acts that Amnesty said should not be criminalised, such as adultery, intimate relationships between unmarried men and women, ""breach of public morals"" and consensual same-sex sexual relations. Mr Luther said Iran should abolish all forms of corporal punishment. As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the country was legally obliged to forbid torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment, he noted.

"Donald Trump has raised questions about whether the UK's current Brexit plan is ""what they voted for"". The US president said ""Brexit is Brexit"" but it was turning out ""a little bit differently"" with the UK ""partially involved"" with the EU. ""Maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route,"" he went on. His comments at a press conference in Brussels were made before his visit to the UK - as details of Theresa May's Brexit plan were published. Asked about his remarks, Mrs May said her plan ""absolutely delivers on the Brexit people voted for"". Live: MPs updated on Brexit plans At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Trump 'fine' with protests as he lands in UK Mr Trump backed a Leave vote ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, when he was a US presidential candidate, and he was asked for his views at the Nato summit press conference. ""It's not for me to say,"" the US president said. ""I'd like to see them be able to work it out so it can go quickly, whatever they work out."" It's not the first Mr Trump has had his say on the UK's relationship with the EU: In May 2016, before the EU referendum, he said he thought the UK was ""better off without"" the European Union ""I'm not making that as a recommendation, just my feeling,"" he said, describing the migration crisis as a ""horrible thing for Europe"" and blaming the EU for driving it. In August 2016, after the UK had voted to leave, he tweeted: ""They will soon be calling me Mr Brexit!"" In January 2017, shortly after becoming president, he gave aninterview to Tory MP Michael Gove,external- a prominent Leave campaigner and former journalist - saying: ""I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing."" Also in that interview, the president said the EU was ""a vehicle for Germany"" and that the UK was ""so smart in getting out"". And asked why thought the UK voted to leave, he said that ""people don't want to have other people coming in and destroying their country"" Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, had encouraged a Remain vote, warning of the consequences for trade if the UK left the EU. Mrs May is under pressure over her proposals for a future trading relationship between the UK and EU. Senior ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned, saying they cannot support the proposals. Some Tory backbenchers and other Brexit campaigners are also unhappy, saying it means the UK will be too closely tied to the EU. The government has now published aWhite Paper,externalgiving more details of its plans. They are aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, securing frictionless trade with the EU while also leaving the single market and customs union and regaining control of the UK's borders. The UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services. There are also plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"", with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, after the 2016 referendum in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Brexit. The two sides are negotiating outstanding issues related to its departure as well as the outline of their future relationship once a proposed transition period comes to an end, on 31 December 2020. Both are aiming for an agreement by October, to allow enough time for the UK and European parliaments to vote on what is decided. Dominic Raab, who became Brexit secretary on Monday after Mr Davis quit, told people who are ""criticising or carping"" about the plan that they needed to come up with credible alternatives of their own. The White Paper is not the final deal, as the detailed talks are yet to take place with the EU. The EU has welcomed its publication and said it will respond when it has seen the plans in detail.

"Donald Trump (far right) says Nato members would ""substantially"" up their budgets Nato allies have cast doubt on US President Donald Trump's claim they had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets, saying they simply remained committed to a 2014 deal. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told US broadcaster CNN the allies had ""a commitment to spend 2%"" of their annual output (GDP) on defence budgets. Members agreed four years ago they would all reach that target by 2024. Mr Trump had hailed ""tremendous progress"" at Nato's summit in Brussels. Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? He has previously been highly critical of the alliance, complaining the US pays more than others. by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Welcome to Trump world. His press conference at Nato ranged from bluster to the bizarre but there is no doubting the president has had an effect. There was ""a new sense of urgency"" about increasing defence spending according to Jens Stoltenberg. But just how much extra money there will be and how quickly remains to be seen. Just as with his summit in North Korea, reality appears to be what President Trump decides it to be. The mere fact that the president of the alliance's essential member could even entertain the idea that the US might leave Nato is extraordinary. But by the end of the summit he said he believed in the alliance. This dissonance is at the heart of the Trump method. He gets results - or appears to - by both strengthening and weakening the alliance at the same time. Nato leaders will be glad this summit is over but remain uneasy as to just what Mr Trump might say when he meets Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Exactly what took place - and what was agreed - behind closed doors at the two-day Nato summit in Brussels is not known. What is known is that Mr Trump called for an emergency meeting on Thursday morning with other Nato members. How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? What does the US contribute to Nato? Unconfirmed reports suggested Mr Trump had threatened to go it alone if other nations did not meetthe alliance's target of 2% of their GDP by 2024. But by the time Mr Trump held a press conference, he was hailing the summit as a success. ""We made a tremendous amount of progress today,"" he said. ""It has been really amazing to see the level of spirit in that room."" It was, he said, ""presently unnecessary"" to consider quitting Nato. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The United States was not being treated fairly"" He added the US commitment to Nato - which was established in 1949 with members agreeing that an attack against one would be considered an attack against them all - remained ""very strong"". Mr Trump went on to say the allies had ""substantially upped their commitment"" and would pay ""more quickly"". Mr Stoltenberg, he added, gave him ""total credit"" for the increased spending which, he said, he instigated during his first Nato meeting last year. Mr Stoltenberg said members had had a ""frank and open discussion"" which ""created a new sense of urgency"", and that the ""clear message from President Trump"" was ""having an impact"". Italy's new Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron also made it clear they had not signed up to anything more than what was agreed four years ago. Trump vows to end 'vicious' African conflicts ""Everyone agreed to raise spending, in line with commitments made in 2014,"" Mr Macron said, adding he was unconvinced by proposals to increase it to 4%. He said France had a clear strategy of analysing security threats and that he could not ask his government for ""tens of billions more"" beyond that. ""It's taxpayers' money we're talking about,"" he said. President Macron also said the meetings had had a different tone to Mr Trump's early morning tweets, which had been typically critical.

Mr Macron said the conversations had been more respectful, according to Reuters news agency. At the meeting, Mr Trump singled out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. Some reports suggest he also shocked other leaders in the room when he turned to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and referred to her by her first name. The Nato leaders also turned their attention to the conflict in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani was present for the second day of talks, and Mr Stoltenberg hopes the bloc will agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024.

"Anyone for dinner? So what would you say to dinner with Donald Trump at Blenheim Palace? Some of Britain's top business leaders have been wrestling with this tricky problem since the invite appeared on their desks earlier this week. The President's trade policies - not to mention his somewhat controversial moral compass - might be expected to give some pause for thought. But about 150 are understood to have agreed to attend Thursday's dinner hosted by the Prime Minister. So who exactly are among those deemed important enough to get through the gates of Blenheim palace, where the dinner is expected to be held? With the US hitting European steel exports with 25% tariffs, it may not surprise anyone that Tata Steel's spokesperson, before the question was even finished, blurted out: ""We're not going."" However, when pressed he couldn't confirm whether anyone from Tata had actually been invited. Only one person, the digital entrepreneur and philanthropist Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, has publicly refused the invitation. She said: ""I understand why the government have to entertain Trump, but I certainly don't want to."" The UK-US trade relationship in five charts Why is Donald Trump coming to the UK? Lord Sugar, who has been told by the President that without him ""he'd be nothing"" (referring to his hosting of the UK's version of Mr Trump's TV show The Apprentice), tweeted that he had not been invited. Sir Richard Branson, whose book Finding My Virginity described Mr Trump as having a ""vindictive streak"", is also reported not to be attending. Martha Lane-Fox turned down an invitation to dinner with Donald Trump The BBC understands Richard Gnodde, the European boss of Goldman Sachs, and Steve Hatch of Facebook UK are going. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, will also be there. Insurer Legal and General was happy to admit that not one but two executives were going: chief executive Nigel Wilson, and head of personal investing, Helena Morrissey. Several businesses seem unsure as to whether the dinner was a personal invitation or a business one. BP obviously thinks it's entirely personal, and what its chief executive Bob Dudley does in his spare time (for instance having dinner with the US President) is nothing to do with one of the world's leading oil companies. ""We don't comment on his personal diary,"" said its press office. The London Stock Exchange had the same lack of interest in its chief executive David Schwimmer's engagements outside office hours. Warren East of Rolls-Royce will be having dinner with Donald Trump Iain Anderson, chief executive of the communications agency Cicero Group, which has several clients among the guests, thinks this kind of dinner is nothing to do with private individuals and all to do with business. ""Anyone who goes is going not as a person but as the head of a company,"" he says. ""They are meeting the President. He's the man, whatever you think of him, who wears the badge that says President. And to meet him is important for trade, for business and for people."" So for some companies, saying no was not really an option. Warren East, the chief executive of engineering firm Rolls Royce, will be there. A spokesperson for the company said: ""We have an important operation in the US, whose main customer is the US Department of Defense, as well as an important partner in Boeing."" Steve Varley, chairman of accountanting and professional services group EY, is also going. His press office said: ""As an organisation with its global headquarters in London and over 15,000 people in the UK and 46,000 in the US, EY's attendance is testament to the role we play in supporting our clients' ambitions on a global scale."" So what do these stars of the British business world hope to get out of attending - assuming they even get a few moments face time with Mr Trump? Mr Anderson said: ""The number one issue is of course the trade tariffs, and people want to say something about that. And the second thing is whether there is anything specific we can get in the way of a UK/US bilateral trade deal. ""Whatever you think of Trump he does interact. He does work the room and there may well be an ability to get a one-to-one with him. And remember - he casts himself as a businessman.""

The couple had to return to the UK in May and said there was ""something wrong with the system"". The Home Office said it was working to finish ""checks as soon as possible"". Mr Curteis, 62, a British citizen by birth, said the family was planning to return to the Philippines on Monday to bring Selene home, but still had no passport. Mrs Curteis, 32, a citizen since January 2016, is going to stay with her parents for as long as it takes to bring the child home. Jeweller Mr Curteis said he had provided all the necessary information, but the Passport Office said documents had been sent to the wrong office. He said he had re-sent proof of the baby's address in Manila, and confirmation that his wife has not been married before, as requested, but the office said it had not been received. ""It's very disappointing that we can't get an answer,"" Mr Curteis said. ""We really feel quite dissatisfied with things. If we could just get a date of when we could bring her home. The Curteis family have been separated from their third child since May ""You put it out of your mind really.

"Jordan Burling pictured in 2013 died at the home he shared with his mother and grandmother three years later The mother and grandmother of an emaciated teenager who was likened to a World War Two concentration camp victim have been jailed for manslaughter. Jordan Burling, 18, went into cardiac arrest in Leeds in 2016 and died weighing less than six stone (37kg). Mother Dawn Cranston and grandmother Denise allowed Mr Burling to ""rot to death"", Leeds Crown Court heard. Dawn, 45, and Denise, 70, were convicted of manslaughter and jailed for four and three years respectively. The teenager left to waste away Mr Burling's sister Abigail Burling, who was found guilty of causing or allowing a vulnerable adult's death, was ordered to serve 18 months in prison. The judge told the three women it was ""almost beyond belief"" Mr Burling ""should have been allowed to die in his own house in the bosom of his family"". ""Through your gross negligence, a precious human life was lost needlessly,"" he said. Dawn Cranston, 45, Denise Cranston, 70 and Abigail Burling, 25, failed to alert a GP as Jordan Burling's condition worsened Mr Justice Spencer said the pictures of the teenager in an emaciated state were ""hauntingly reminiscent of starving victims of extermination camps in the Second World War"". Mr Burling's malnutrition was such he weighed only 5st 11 lbs (37kg) when he died ""that was not much more than twice the weight he had been at the age of four"", he said. His aunt, Susan Burling, read a victim statement on behalf of his father, Steven, which said the family were trying to cope with a ""living nightmare"". More stories from Yorkshire ""I just can't understand why all these horrific things have happened to me and my family,"" it said. During the trial, the prosecution said Jordan was allowed to ""rot to death"" by the women, who failed to phone for medical assistance until it was too late. Paramedics found Mr Burling wearing a soiled nappy and lying in an unresponsive state on a makeshift inflatable bed in the living room of the house in Butterbowl Garth, Farnley. The living room of the house in Butterbowl Garth, Farnley where Jordan Burling was found by medics A subsequent police search of the property found the remains of a baby boy in a rucksack, hidden on the top shelf of a cupboard in Mr Burling's bedroom for 14 years. Before the trial, his mother admitted endeavouring to conceal the birth of a child and was given a 12-month sentence to run concurrent with her jail term for manslaughter. An NHS dietician had told the court Mr Burling, who was 5ft 5ins (1.67m) tall, had a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 13.6, which falls in the ""severe thinness"" category. The figure, based on measurements taken during his post-mortem examination, was the lowest the dietician had recorded in her 26-year career. During the trial, the jury was shown several pictures of Mr Burling taken by his mother on a mobile phone including one on 20 May, just over a month before he died. Dawn Cranston took this picture of Jordan Burling on 20 May 2016 It was estimated he had been malnourished for at least six months before his death on 30 June, having developed bed sores so deep they left bone exposed. The judge said the three women had attempted to take care of Mr Burling as his condition worsened including washing him and changing his adult nappy. They were ""relentless and unpleasant tasks"" and Mr Burling's death was the greatest punishment the three would have to bear, he said. Dr Cleo Van Velsen, a consultant psychiatrist who assessed Dawn, told the jury her behaviour was consistent with a dissociative disorder called depersonalisation - a defence mechanism characterised by a sense of disconnect from the world and your body to cope with acute anxiety or trauma. None of the three have any previous convictions. In a statement read outside court, the family of Mr Burling's father, Steven, said: ""We feel betrayed by the people we trusted to care for Jordan. ""Steven and the family will always remember Jordan having a bubbly and chatty personality. ""We have had two years of hell coming to terms with Jordan's death."" James Rogers, chairman of the Safer Leeds executive, said an independent review was under way into Mr Burling's death.

"The UK government has cleared a proposed deal for Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox to buy Sky. The British broadcaster has been the subject of a fierce bidding war between Fox and US cable giant Comcast. Comcast's bid has already been cleared, and Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright said Fox can go ahead if it sells Sky News. Fox has been trying to get approval from UK regulators since 2016 to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Politicians and regulators were concerned it could give Mr Murdoch too much power over the media in the UK. There were also worries about Sky News' long-term financial viability, and how independent it would be editorially. Mr Wright said: ""The publication of the undertakings marks the final stage of the public interest consideration of this case. It is now a matter for the Sky shareholders to decide whether to accept 21CF's bid."" Sky said: ""21CF's offer for Sky has now cleared its outstanding regulatory pre-conditions. This follows the satisfaction by Comcast on 15 June 2018 of its outstanding regulatory pre-conditions, meaning both offers for Sky are now capable of being put formally to Sky shareholders."" Under takeover rules, Sky shareholders will have 60 days to come to a decision about the respective bids once the offers are formally posted. In January, the Competition and Markets Authority said the Fox deal would not be in the public interest on the grounds of ""media plurality"", although it found the firm's broadcasting standards to be up to scratch. Fox has been trying to address the regulatory concerns through concessions, including agreeing to sell Sky News to a bidder such as Disney. Fox has also said that after the sale it will provide Sky News with funding of at least Â£100m a year for 15 years. US media giant Comcastthrew its hat into the ring in Februarywith a Â£22bn offer for Sky, trumping an offer from Fox, and starting a bidding war. On Wednesday the battle for Sky escalated, withComcast offering a Â£26bn dealless than a day after 21st Century Fox increased its offer to Â£24.5bn.

"Around 300 officers from forces across the country have been brought in for the president's visit A police chief has apologised after it was revealed some officers deployed to work on the US president's visit had to sleep in conditions described as ""an absolute disgrace"". Pictures posted on social media showed rows of camp beds in a gymnasium, to be used for officers after 12-hour shifts policing Donald Trump's visit. Essex Police's Assistant Chief Constable Pippa Mills has said sorry. Alternative accommodation has been found for the officers, she added. The Police Federation had said prisoners in cells would be sleeping in better conditions than its officers when the images came to light, describing the situation as ""not acceptable"". Trump's UK visit begins What is going to happen on Trump's trip? Protests and praise Latest updates on Trump's UK visit Ms Mills apologised to the officers who have come from across the UK to join the operation, estimated to cost up to Â£10m. ""The conditions which I have been made aware of are not acceptable,"" she said. ""Working with our military partners we have found alternative accommodation. ""This will address the concerns highlighted."" Chairman of the Hampshire Police Federation John Apter said he was pleased to hear the accommodation had changed: Allow Twitter content?

The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, had voiced concerns about the conditions earlier. Simon Kempton, the organisation's deputy treasurer in England and Wales, said earlier: ""These officers have been asked to leave their families to travel to another part of the country to help protect the public and the president and all they expect in return is to be treated with some dignity and respect."" Labour MP Louise Haigh had raised the issue in the House of Commons, said 100 female officers had just four toilets between them and 300 male officers had just five toilets. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the venue in question was thought to be Colchester Garrison, where about 300 officers had been based. Those who had ""leaked"" photographs were said to be being ""sought out"" and told that ""firm action"" would be taken. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Donald Trump after his election US President Donald Trump is set to arrive in the UK on Thursday for a two-day working visit. Mr Trump is the 12th sitting US president to make such a trip and will spend time with the Queen and prime minister before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at his golf resort. It is his first visit to Britain since winning the 2016 presidential election. Thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins described the trip as ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"". A black-tie dinner will be held at Blenheim Palace Mr Trump will fly to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Invited guests - including a number of business leaders - will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May. After spending Thursday night as a guest of US ambassador Woody Johnson at his London residence, Winfield House, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks. The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon. On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. The president's time in Scotland is not counted as part of the working visit. The president and first lady will visit Turnberry in Scotland A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. How Trump's UK visit will be different to those of other US presidents How previous presidents were greeted by the UK Will the US president get a frosty reception? A working visit - like the one Mr Trump is making - may include some of the same activities as a state visit, but there are small differences. For example, on a working visit, the visiting head of state does not address Parliament, nor is their accommodation organised and funded by the UK. Travel plans on a working visit are also organised and funded by the visiting country. President Trump will meet the Queen, but will not stay at Buckingham Palace Tens of thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday and in Glasgow on Saturday. Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police, including 400 from the West Midlands force. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Shaista Aziz, a Labour councillor in Oxford, and one of the organisers of the Together Against Trump protest in London, said the demonstration was about saying ""very clearly that we reject the policies of this administration"". Campaigners raised almost Â£18,000 to pay for the six-metre high inflatable Trump baby British police have not revealed the exact number of officers required to work during Mr Trump's trip - but the Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces. Forces from across the country have been asked to send thousands of officers to assist with protests. The Home Office said they can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". The Treasury has confirmed it will fund policing costs of up to Â£5m in Scotland. The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services."" The president will stay at Winfield House on Thursday night Mr Trump has a number of high profile supporters in the UK - including prominent Brexiteers Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. Speaking of Mr Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary on Monday, Mr Trump said he was a ""friend"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive,"" he said. ""I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" Republicans Overseas UK are organising a rally on Friday to welcome the president while a pub in west London has been renamed The Trump Arms in honour of the visit. The US Embassy said it was looking forward to Mr Trump's arrival ""as an opportunity to highlight the vitality of the special relationship"" between the UK and US. Tension between Trump and allies.

"This video can not be played John Volanthen reached the group nine days after they went missing in the cave complex A British diver who helped save 12 schoolboys and their football coach from a flooded cave in Thailand says he and other rescuers ""are not heroes"". John Volanthen was the first voice the boys heard after nine days trapped in the underground network in Chiang Rai province. This week, after an 18-day ordeal, they were all rescued from the cave complex. Arriving at Heathrow Airport on Thursday, Mr Volanthen said it was a ""relief"" but played down his heroics. Mr Volanthen, an IT consultant based in Bristol but who grew up in Brighton, was one of the first rescuers to discover the group huddled in the darkness of the Luang Nang Non Cave. The heroes who saved the Wild Boars Cave rescue: The operation in pictures Arriving back in the UK, he said everybody had ""pulled together"" and was ""very, very pleased it worked out quite so well"". ""We're just very happy that the boys are out and safe,"" he said. ""We were very relieved that they were all alive but I think at that point we realised the enormity of the situation and that's perhaps why it took a while to get them all out."" This video can not be played The moment divers discover the missing boys On social media, Mr Volanthen has been described as a ""real hero"" with many calling for him and fellow Briton Rick Stanton to be honoured. But Mr Volanthen dismissed the idea, adding: ""We are not heroes. What we do is very calculating, very calm. It's quite the opposite."" ""We take it one step at a time and hopefully, as we've managed to in this case, we come up with the results."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Volanthen also paid tribute to Thai navy diver Saman Kunan, who died while replenishing oxygen canisters, saying his death was an ""absolute tragedy"" and brought a ""bittersweet"" taste to an otherwise ""excellent"" operation. The diver, who is in his 40s, and Mr Stanton, a fireman from Coventry who is in his 50s, reached the group nine days after they went missing deep within the labyrinth. How the Thai boys were rescued Key questions on Thai cave rescue The final four boys and their 25-year-old coach were brought to safety on Tuesday, having entered the network for exploration on June 23 before it became flooded by monsoon rains. Their rescue was particularly treacherous because the boys, aged 11 to 16, had to swim through tight spaces despite having no previous diving experience.

"Labour has called for a total review of the government's so-called ""hostile environment"" policy after ministers said part of it had been paused. Data-sharing aimed at identifying illegal migrants has been suspended for three months so people from the Windrush generation were not ""erroneously impacted"". The government has already apologised over the Windrush saga. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said wider measures were needed. ""Unless we review it in detail, the Windrush generation will not be the last end of it in terms of unfairness and cruelty,"" she said. Who are the Windrush generation? May apologises to Caribbean leaders On Wednesday, Home Secretary Sajid Javid revealed that pro-active data sharing between the Home Office and other departments had been paused for people of all nationalities over 30-years-old. This was part of what has been called the ""hostile environment"" approach to curbing illegal immigration which has been blamed for members of the Windrush generation, who are in the UK legally, being wrongly threatened with deportation. In the House of Commons, Labour MP David Lammy - who has campaigned on Windrush - accused the government of ""slipping out"" the announcement during England's World Cup semi final football clash with Croatia. He called for more information on a ""hardship scheme"" and an appeal system for those affected. ""When she says pause, why not scrap this hostile environment which is bringing this country into disrepute,"" he said. Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said data sharing had been paused since April, under the tenure of former home secretary Amber Rudd, and would not be restarted until she was confident the Windrush generation would not be affected. She said what the government is calling ""compliant environment"" policies had started under the previous Labour government.

"Environment questions to Michael Gove and team Urgent question on hostile environment agenda Urgent question on policing during US president's visit Business statement from Leader of the House Statement on Brexit white paper Richard Morris and Lucy Webster The UK government sets out in detail how it wants trade with the EU to work after Brexit. What happened? House of CommonsParliament Two urgent questions and a statement kept the Commons busy today. The sitting was briefly suspended about a minute into Dominic Raab's first speech from the dispatch box as Exiting the EU Secretary. The Speaker was unhappy that MPs did not have copies of the Brexit white paper in front of them to ask questions, so MPs started distributing them amongst themselves, during which time the sitting was suspended. MPs from all parties were critical of the move, while Mr Raab said he would speak to the clerks office over the confusion. Thelong-awaited White Paper,externalis aimed at ensuring trade co-operation, with no hard border for Northern Ireland, and global trade deals for the UK. It fleshes out the Chequers agreement that sparked the resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis. The UK is hoping the EU will back the proposals in the White Paper so an exit deal can be struck by the autumn, ahead of the UK's official departure from the EU in March. Labour MPs asked two further questions, one on the pausing of the hostile environment policy for those over 30 in the wake of the Windrush scandal; and the second on police staffing and funding levels during the visit of the US President, Donald Trump. The Commons returns at 2:30pm on Monday, with Home Office questions. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Business Minister Andrew Griffiths says it is easy to ""underestimate"" how significant the collapse of Carillion was, including the impacts on the lives of ""too many"". It is important that ""everything"" the government does is to prevent this from happening again, he says. The business secretary has commissioned a review into the responsibilities of the Financial Reporting Council, he adds. He adds that ""thousands of documents are being considered"" in trying to trace what went wrong at Carillion. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow business minister Bill Esterson says the collapse of Carillion was ""a fiasco"" for the 30,000 employees and 20,000 sub-contractors, the 27,000 members of its defined pension scheme, 30,000 suppliers owed Â£2bn in unpaid invoices, the children who depended on school meals, armed services personnel whose housing is mismanaged and the taxpayer who is picking up the tab for the colossal failure of the government to safeguard large sums of public money. He says the ""cosy"" way in which the big four accountancy firms (Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, and KPMG) operate must come to and end and ask if the government supports calls for the big four to be broken up. He ends by saying that Labour in government would be a party of business for the many, not the few. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Chris Stephens says that the mystery of Carillion's collapse is not something to be surprised about, but instead the surprise was how long the company lasted for. He says the company exploited suppliers and ""gamed with public assets"" and sought to ""eliminate any competitors"". The US president questions whether the UK's current Brexit plan is ""what they voted for"". Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament Ms Reeves says the directors, who made the decisions which led to the company's collapse, still refuse to accept their responsibility and continue to deny the findings of her committee's report. She says they awarded themselves bonuses while workers have lost jobs and pensions. She says the auditors, including KPMG, also did not issue the appropriate warnings. She says auditors have the wrong incentives because they report to senior managers. She says that when management and the auditors were seen to be failing, the regulators should have stepped in. She says they were too ""passive"" and acted too late. She says the pension regulator eventually ""barked but did not bite."" She concludes that ""urgent action"" must be taken for those affected and for those who would be affected if the same were to happen again. ""Best value is not the same as lowest price,"" she says. Carillion collapse debate House of CommonsParliament MPs move on to a debate on the collapse of Carillion, introduced by the Chair of the Business Committee, Rachel Reeves. She says that this Sunday will be six months since Carillion collapsed, owing money to suppliers and subcontractors and with major projects ""mothballed"". Five committees have looked into its collapse, she says, with her committee considering the causes for its demise. ""Warning lights should have been flashing when such a big business was on the brink,"" she says. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament Education Minister Nadhim Zahawi says that many adopted children have struggled with ""overwhelming"" feelings of rejection and with forming attachments. ""It is truly shocking to hear how single mothers were treated at that time in our country,"" he says, while adding that the church has apologised for their role in this. He says that there general principle that children are better looked after by their own family. He adds that these days forced separation takes place from a court order. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament The shadow children and families minister, Emma Lewell-Buck, says that ""culturally, the 50s, 60s and 70s"" when the majority of these adoption orders were made, was a different time. Welfare benefits were not available and sex education was nonexistent, which affected people who had children out of wedlock, she says. She adds that many of the stories from the time show the ""powerlessness"" women experienced. The very least these women need ""is an apology,"" she says. Forced adoption debate House of CommonsParliament MPs are holding a debate on the practice of forced adoption - a backbench business debate proposed by Labour MPs Alison McGovern and Stephen Twigg. House of CommonsParliament German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and Prime Minister Theresa May during a reception at the end of the Western Balkans Summit The statement on the Brexit white paper concludes and MPs move on to a statement by a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee on global Britain and the Western Balkans. On 9 and 10 July 2018, the UK hosted the 5th annual Western Balkans Summit. Committee member, and Labour MP, Mike Gapes says,due to the resignation of the summit host - the then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson- the summit ""didn't get the attention it deserved"". He says this was the first time the UK had hosted the summit and was ""a test of the UK's commitment to European scrutiny"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative Stephen Metcalfe says his constituents want reassurance the white paper will ""return control over our borders, over our money and our laws"". ""Don't listen to the siren voices,"" he urges, advising people to instead look at the document ""and see where it delivers"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Labour's Wes Streeting suggests that the government's white paper ""doesn't command the support of a majority of the House of Commons"". He asks how the EU, European Commission or European Parliament can take the proposals seriously ""because this house, it is clear, does not."" Dominic Raab accuses the MP of ""blithely skating over divisions in his own party"". He defends the government's plan as a ""positive, principled approach that is deliverable"". Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Bridgen says colleagues have ""grave concerns"" about this proposal, in terms of how it will play out the wishes of the British people during the referendum. He asks why Mr Raab's first choice of special advisor, Stewart Jackson, was rejected by the Cabinet Office. Mr Raab pays tribute to the work of special advisors and says he will be naming his shortly. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Conservative David Jones says that the role of the European Court of Justice is preserved as the interpreter of EU rules in the UK. He asks what kind of audience British applicants to the court could expect when no longer an EU country. Mr Raab says there is provision for ""consistent interpretation"" of the law under the ECJ. The UK would have a veto over decisions, he says, adding that the UK needs to have agreement over common rules. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Brexit-supporting Conservative Owen Paterson asks the Brexit secretary if the ""common rulebook"" will lead to EU policy being put back into UK law without the ability to amend it. Dominic Raab says the common rulebook will only apply to the extent that is necessary to avoid friction at the border. What's the common rulebook? Have a lookhere. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Labour's Kate Hoey says that it is ""nonsense"" that MPs got the white paper so late, and she asks if Angela Merkel has seen this document before MPs. She asks for assurances that European citizens will no longer receive special treatment in immigration after the UK leaves the EU. Mr Raab says that freedom of movement is something which discriminates the rest of the world against EU nationals in UK immigration. Brexit white paper statement House of CommonsParliament Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper questions why there is a lack of detail on the government's post-Brexit immigration plan. Dominic Raab responds that the paper is very clear that free movement will end. Home Secreatry Sajid Javid told the Home Affairs Committee on Tuesday that there will be a separate white paper on post-Brexit immigration in the autumn.

"This video can not be played Shropshire couple in passport row see baby via internet A British couple say their baby is being cared for by grandparents in the Philippines because the Home Office has not granted her a passport. Henry Curteis and his wife Shane said they had been trying to bring daughter Selene to Ellesmere, Shropshire, since she was born abroad in April. The couple had to return to the UK in May and said there was ""something wrong with the system"". The Home Office said it was working to finish ""checks as soon as possible"". Mr Curteis, 62, a British citizen by birth, said the family was planning to return to the Philippines on Monday to bring Selene home, but still had no passport. Mrs Curteis, 32, a citizen since January 2016, is going to stay with her parents for as long as it takes to bring the child home. Jeweller Mr Curteis said he had provided all the necessary information, but the Passport Office said documents had been sent to the wrong office. He said he had re-sent proof of the baby's address in Manila, and confirmation that his wife has not been married before, as requested, but the office said it had not been received. ""It's very disappointing that we can't get an answer,"" Mr Curteis said. ""We really feel quite dissatisfied with things. If we could just get a date of when we could bring her home. The Curteis family have been separated from their third child since May ""You put it out of your mind really.

"Fans were emotional after the defeat but are now looking to the future Heartbroken England fans are starting to come to terms with their World Cup exit after the defeat to Croatia. Hopes of a first final since 1966 were dashed on Wednesday after England slipped to a 2-1 loss after extra time. Emergency services across the nation had another busy night, particularly after the match finished. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it faced ""a barrage of 999 calls"" after full-time, including reports of assaults and domestic violence.

Student Josh Chapman said: ""There were times you were looking out for glass bottles more than watching the game."" The city council blamed ""a handful of mindless idiots"" for disruption and said it was reviewing CCTV footage. Up to 150 other fans in the Sheffield fan park showed a touch of class by helping to tidy up, despite the pain of England's defeat. The disappointment was written on the faces of many watching Grant Davidson said the side had ""brought the country together"" during the run to the semi-finals, the first time England had reached the last four since losing to West Germany in 1990.

The final moments of the game werethe most-watched five minutes of British TV since the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, with 26.5 million people tuning in. Despite Trippier giving England an early lead,Croatia clawed their way back into the game and edged past Southgate's side after extra time. Scenes after the game were, perhaps unsurprisingly,more subdued than after the quarter-final win against Sweden.

"This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner US President Donald Trump has been welcomed to Blenheim Palace by Theresa May, on the first day of his UK visit. The black-tie dinner, with 150 invited guests, is expected to focus on post-Brexit trade, and comes days after Mr Trump said the UK was in ""turmoil"". He and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in the UK on Thursday afternoon. Protesters have gathered outside the US ambassador's residence in London, where the Trumps are staying tonight, and near Blenheim Palace. Extra security is in place to police the protests, but Mr Trump has said that Britons ""like me a lot"" and that he feels ""fine"" about any such protests. Latest updates on Trump's UK visit Trump: Nato states to up defence funding What is going to happen during Trump's trip? The Trumps left Winfield House at approximately 19:00 BST, with Mrs Trump wearing a full-length yellow dress with a pleated skirt. This video can not be played US President Donald Trump arrived at Stansted Airport for a two-day working visit Mr Trump, who will also spend time with the Queen during his two-day working visit, said earlier of the British public: ""I think they agree with me on immigration... You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration... I think that's why Brexit happened."" He said ""Brexit is Brexit"" and the British people ""voted to break it up, so I imagine that's what they'll do but maybe they're taking a different route - I don't know if that is what they voted for"". Mr Trump has recently been under fire for his own immigration policy,which resulted in the separation of immigrant families. Members of the cabinet and business leaders are at the Blenheim Palace dinner While protesters - for and against the president - gathered outside the venue The Trumps landed at Stansted Airport, Essex, at 13:50 BST before a helicopter took them to Winfield House in Regent's Park, where they are staying as guests of the US ambassador. He was met at the airport by dignitaries including International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and US ambassador Woody Johnson. Speaking at the Nato summit in Brussels before he arrived, Mr Trump said the UK was a ""hot spot right now"". This video can not be played Some of Mr Trump's supporters and protesters have been explaining their motivation His visit comes as the governmentpublishes its plans for the UK's relations with the EUafter Brexit. Earlier this weekMr Trump saidit was ""up to the people"" whether Mrs May stayed on as prime minister after two cabinet ministers resigned within hours over her Brexit policy. Protests were also held outside the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park A large police presence has been building up outside Blenheim Palace. Police officers estimated there were more than 1,000 people demonstrating before Mr Trump's arrival. A group of protesters has also gathered outside a fenced-off area in Regent's Park, close to the entrance of Winfield House, where Mr Trump is staying. Among those attending the black-tie dinner at the ancestral home of former Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill are cabinet ministers and business leaders. Guests are dining on Scottish salmon, Hereford beef fillet and strawberries with clotted cream ice-cream. Only one person, the digital entrepreneur and philanthropist Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, has publicly refused the invitation. UK protests greet Trump's 'state visit on the sly' Police beds for Trump visit 'a disgrace' Trump raises questions over Brexit plans Mrs May said the UK visit would be an opportunity to boost trade links and strengthen co-operation on security. Along with trade and security ties, Downing Street said the other key areas to be discussed between the two leaders included Brexit and the Middle East. Ahead of Mr Trump's visit, Mrs May said that when the UK leaves the European Union ""there will be no alliance more important in the years ahead"". Mr Trump travelled to the UK from the Nato summit, where he said member countrieshave agreed to increase their military spending. The US president and first lady were greeted by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, the Queen's representative and the chief operating officer of Stansted Airport They then departed on Marine One to travel to the US ambassador's residence in central London Mr Trump had joked earlier this week that his meeting with Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest"" part of his European trip. Downing Street insisted Mrs May welcomed Mr Trump's decision to ""engage"" with the Russian leader. But she also warned Mr Trump not to ignore the ""malign behaviour"" of Russia. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has had to disagree with him publicly over his decision to impose trade tariffs on EU steel, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far right group. In turn, the US president has described Britain as being in political ""turmoil"", criticised its defence spending and shown no enthusiasm for coming to visit: in the 18 months of his presidency, Mr Trump has chosen to visit 17 other countries first. Whatever this relationship is, it can hardly be described as special. So this trip is about ticking a diplomatic box, getting a visit out of the way before its further delay became politically embarrassing. And as working visits go, it is on the minimal side: no Downing Street barbecue, no cabinet visit, no speech to both Houses of Parliament. The diplomatic aim will be to get through the visit without any gaffes, without upsetting the president, and without him saying anything disobliging about Brexit or a future trade deal. The UK and the US do have a good relationship at an institutional level, in the fields of defence, security and intelligence. The tricky bit is always the politics and the personalities. On Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base. Guess who's coming to dinner with Trump Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip 'Trump Baby' balloon banned from Turnberry The UK-US trade relationship in five charts Stormy Daniels arrested in Ohio - lawyer The pair will then travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for talks with the foreign secretary. The president and first lady will travel to Windsor on Friday afternoon to meet the Queen, before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. This part of the visit is being considered private. The Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces as tens of thousands of people are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday - and in Glasgow on Friday. It has also complained that300 officers working during the visit will have to sleep on camp bedsin a gymnasium that has no hot water and restricted access to hot food. Security has been stepped up outside the US ambassador's residence in London where Mr Trump is staying Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK, including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. But the balloonwill not be allowed to fly over his Turnberry golf course, Police Scotland have said.

"Around 300 officers from forces across the country have been brought in for the president's visit A police chief has apologised after it was revealed some officers deployed to work on the US president's visit had to sleep in conditions described as ""an absolute disgrace"". Pictures posted on social media showed rows of camp beds in a gymnasium, to be used for officers after 12-hour shifts policing Donald Trump's visit. Essex Police's Assistant Chief Constable Pippa Mills has said sorry. Alternative accommodation has been found for the officers, she added. The Police Federation had said prisoners in cells would be sleeping in better conditions than its officers when the images came to light, describing the situation as ""not acceptable"".

The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, had voiced concerns about the conditions earlier. Simon Kempton, the organisation's deputy treasurer in England and Wales, said earlier: ""These officers have been asked to leave their families to travel to another part of the country to help protect the public and the president and all they expect in return is to be treated with some dignity and respect."" Labour MP Louise Haigh had raised the issue in the House of Commons, said 100 female officers had just four toilets between them and 300 male officers had just five toilets. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the venue in question was thought to be Colchester Garrison, where about 300 officers had been based.

One issue on President Trump's agenda while he is in Britain will be whether - and how - to deepen that relationship. So just how intertwined are the two economies? As a single country the US is the largest export market for the UK. It is, however, well behind the EU when the bloc is viewed as a single market. There is some logic to viewing the EU in that way, as it has a single external trade policy and most of its members share the same currency. As a supplier of goods and services to the UK, the US comes in second, behind Germany. Viewed from the other side, from President Trump's perspective, the UK is an important trade partner to the US. For both imports and exports it comes behind the immediate neighbours, Canada and Mexico, with which the US has a trade deal: the North American Free Trade Agreement. The US also does more trade with China (at least it does before the full effects of new tariffs are felt). As a source of imports, the Germany and Japan are also ahead of the UK. Bilateral UK/US trade has grown in the past few years, after period of relative stagnation in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The chart below uses data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) which suggest the UK exports more to the US than it imports. The US figures suggest the reverse. In principle they cannot both be true. The ONS says there aremany reasons why the figures might diverge,externaland they are working on it. The goods traded cover a wide range, but there a few types that stand out: aircraft coming (or flying) into the UK, as well as scientific instruments.

There is also an important trans-Atlantic trade in services, including finance, business services and tourism. The interconnections are also apparent in the data on foreign direct investment (FDI).

"Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Donald Trump after his election US President Donald Trump is set to arrive in the UK on Thursday for a two-day working visit. Mr Trump is the 12th sitting US president to make such a trip and will spend time with the Queen and prime minister before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at his golf resort. It is his first visit to Britain since winning the 2016 presidential election. Thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins described the trip as ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"". A black-tie dinner will be held at Blenheim Palace Mr Trump will fly to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Invited guests - including a number of business leaders - will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May. After spending Thursday night as a guest of US ambassador Woody Johnson at his London residence, Winfield House, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks. The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon. On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. The president's time in Scotland is not counted as part of the working visit. The president and first lady will visit Turnberry in Scotland A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. How Trump's UK visit will be different to those of other US presidents How previous presidents were greeted by the UK Will the US president get a frosty reception? A working visit - like the one Mr Trump is making - may include some of the same activities as a state visit, but there are small differences. For example, on a working visit, the visiting head of state does not address Parliament, nor is their accommodation organised and funded by the UK. Travel plans on a working visit are also organised and funded by the visiting country. President Trump will meet the Queen, but will not stay at Buckingham Palace Tens of thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday and in Glasgow on Saturday. Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police, including 400 from the West Midlands force. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Shaista Aziz, a Labour councillor in Oxford, and one of the organisers of the Together Against Trump protest in London, said the demonstration was about saying ""very clearly that we reject the policies of this administration"". Campaigners raised almost Â£18,000 to pay for the six-metre high inflatable Trump baby British police have not revealed the exact number of officers required to work during Mr Trump's trip - but the Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces. Forces from across the country have been asked to send thousands of officers to assist with protests. The Home Office said they can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". The Treasury has confirmed it will fund policing costs of up to Â£5m in Scotland. The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services."" The president will stay at Winfield House on Thursday night Mr Trump has a number of high profile supporters in the UK - including prominent Brexiteers Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. Speaking of Mr Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary on Monday, Mr Trump said he was a ""friend"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive,"" he said. ""I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" Republicans Overseas UK are organising a rally on Friday to welcome the president while a pub in west London has been renamed The Trump Arms in honour of the visit. The US Embassy said it was looking forward to Mr Trump's arrival ""as an opportunity to highlight the vitality of the special relationship"" between the UK and US. Tension between Trump and allies.

"Donald Trump (far right) says Nato members would ""substantially"" up their budgets Nato allies have cast doubt on US President Donald Trump's claim they had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets, saying they simply remained committed to a 2014 deal. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told US broadcaster CNN the allies had ""a commitment to spend 2%"" of their annual output (GDP) on defence budgets. Members agreed four years ago they would all reach that target by 2024. Mr Trump had hailed ""tremendous progress"" at Nato's summit in Brussels. Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? He has previously been highly critical of the alliance, complaining the US pays more than others. by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Welcome to Trump world. His press conference at Nato ranged from bluster to the bizarre but there is no doubting the president has had an effect. There was ""a new sense of urgency"" about increasing defence spending according to Jens Stoltenberg. But just how much extra money there will be and how quickly remains to be seen. Just as with his summit in North Korea, reality appears to be what President Trump decides it to be. The mere fact that the president of the alliance's essential member could even entertain the idea that the US might leave Nato is extraordinary. But by the end of the summit he said he believed in the alliance. This dissonance is at the heart of the Trump method. He gets results - or appears to - by both strengthening and weakening the alliance at the same time. Nato leaders will be glad this summit is over but remain uneasy as to just what Mr Trump might say when he meets Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Exactly what took place - and what was agreed - behind closed doors at the two-day Nato summit in Brussels is not known. What is known is that Mr Trump called for an emergency meeting on Thursday morning with other Nato members. How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? What does the US contribute to Nato? Unconfirmed reports suggested Mr Trump had threatened to go it alone if other nations did not meetthe alliance's target of 2% of their GDP by 2024. But by the time Mr Trump held a press conference, he was hailing the summit as a success. ""We made a tremendous amount of progress today,"" he said. ""It has been really amazing to see the level of spirit in that room."" It was, he said, ""presently unnecessary"" to consider quitting Nato. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The United States was not being treated fairly"" He added the US commitment to Nato - which was established in 1949 with members agreeing that an attack against one would be considered an attack against them all - remained ""very strong"". Mr Trump went on to say the allies had ""substantially upped their commitment"" and would pay ""more quickly"". Mr Stoltenberg, he added, gave him ""total credit"" for the increased spending which, he said, he instigated during his first Nato meeting last year. Mr Stoltenberg said members had had a ""frank and open discussion"" which ""created a new sense of urgency"", and that the ""clear message from President Trump"" was ""having an impact"". Italy's new Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron also made it clear they had not signed up to anything more than what was agreed four years ago. Trump vows to end 'vicious' African conflicts ""Everyone agreed to raise spending, in line with commitments made in 2014,"" Mr Macron said, adding he was unconvinced by proposals to increase it to 4%. He said France had a clear strategy of analysing security threats and that he could not ask his government for ""tens of billions more"" beyond that. ""It's taxpayers' money we're talking about,"" he said. President Macron also said the meetings had had a different tone to Mr Trump's early morning tweets, which had been typically critical.

Mr Macron said the conversations had been more respectful, according to Reuters news agency. At the meeting, Mr Trump singled out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. Some reports suggest he also shocked other leaders in the room when he turned to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and referred to her by her first name. The Nato leaders also turned their attention to the conflict in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani was present for the second day of talks, and Mr Stoltenberg hopes the bloc will agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024.

"Donald Trump's trip to the UK will be the 12th by a US president. But this working, not state, visit is expected to be different to those that have gone before. In 1977 Jimmy Carter came to Britain on his first overseas trip as president. His main aim was to attend the G7 summit in London, but he also chose to visit Newcastle. The city had taken part in a scheme designed to build bridges between the United States and the rest of the world. So the newly elected leader of the free world decided to conduct his first act of global diplomacy from a podium outside the concrete splendour of Newcastle Civic Centre. He was given the freedom of the city by the mayor. And when the peanut farmer from Georgia stepped up to the microphone, he greeted an adoring crowd of 20,000 people thus: ""Howay the lads! I am grateful to be a Geordie now."" The local newspaper, the Chronicle, reported: ""They packed the airport. They packed the streets. They packed the area outside the Civic Centre and they opened their arms to him. And he loved it. A great smile spread across his face... as he was greeted by crowds waving both the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes."" This was how it used to be: British crowds cheering US presidents. President Carter was made an honorary freeman of the city of Newcastle in 1977 When JFK came in 1961, half a million people lined the route between London airport and the west end to catch a glimpse of him and his wife Jackie Kennedy. The scale of the public adulation was in part due to the fact that US presidents enjoyed great popularity in Britain: they were political show business and our closest allies in recent wars. They also came to the UK more rarely. The first president to visit was Woodrow Wilson in 1918 during the post-World War One peace talks. But it was not for another 27 years - and after another world war - that a second US president came to our shores, in 1945. And all Harry S Truman did was visit King George VI on a naval cruiser anchored in Plymouth harbour. Dwight D Eisenhower did not come until 1959. So, only three presidential visits in 40 years. Lyndon Johnson never came, nor did Gerald Ford. How previous presidents were greeted by the UK Will Donald Trump receive a frosty reception in the UK? Giant Donald Trump baby balloon plan sparks online row Treasury to cover policing cost of Trump visit to Scotland US presidents also enjoyed a warm relationship with the Royal Family. Eisenhower was a particular favourite of the Queen, who invited him to stay at Balmoral - the only president to do so. Like Donald Trump, ""Ike"" also owned property in Scotland: not a golf course but an apartment at Culzean Castle on the Ayrshire coast which had been given to him by the owners, in recognition of his role as supreme allied commander during World War Two. Ronald Reagan also got on well with the Queen, who in 1982 personally invited him to stay at Windsor Castle and go for a ride in the Great Park. In 1994, Bill and Hillary Clinton were honoured with a sleepover on board the royal yacht Britannia in Portsmouth. Huge crowds flocked to see President Kennedy during his 1961 visit In 2003 George Bush spent the night at Buckingham Palace - the first president to do so since Wilson in 1918. In contrast, Donald Trump is expected to get a cup of tea when he passes through Windsor on Friday. Nor may President Trump receive quite the same political welcome as his predecessors. He will not attend cabinet as Bill Clinton did in 1997 shortly after Tony Blair was first elected prime minister. He will not get to flip burgers in the Downing Street garden or address both houses of parliament, as President Obama did in 2011. Instead, he will make do with a short visit to the prime minister's country residence, Chequers, like Richard Nixon in 1970. This will be very much a working visit.  A full state visit may have been offered but there is no date in the diary for when it may happen. Of course, presidential visits do not always go smoothly. There was a private diplomatic row in 1982 when the White House delayed replying to the Queen's invitation to Ronald Reagan to stay at Windsor because his wife Nancy's astrologer was worried about overseas travel. In 1997 I watched as Bill Clinton's long motorcade was divided in two when London's Tower Bridge was opened to allow through a Thames sailing barge - much to the consternation of the security men. Barack Obama took part in a memorable barbecue in the No 10 garden in 2011 And in 1977, after a banquet at Buckingham Palace, President Carter decided to bid farewell to the Queen Mother by kissing her full on the lips, something that apparently had not happened since King George VI died in 1952. ""I took a sharp step backwards,"" she recalled later. ""Not quite far enough."" So huge efforts will be made to ensure that President Trump's trip goes smoothly. Many demonstrations have been planned, but the huge security operation surrounding his progress from London to Chequers to Windsor to Scotland - largely by air - means that he may not get too close to the protests. Much harder to cover up will be the fundamental policy differences between the US and British governments. Since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has publicly disagreed with him over his decision to impose trade tariffs, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far-right group. British ministers and officials will do their best to welcome Mr Trump but even they are now talking about the need to respect the office of the presidency rather than the current incumbent as an individual. So the president's trip this week will test a relationship that has recently become much harder to keep special.

BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins described the trip as ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"". A black-tie dinner will be held at Blenheim Palace Mr Trump will fly to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Invited guests - including a number of business leaders - will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May. After spending Thursday night as a guest of US ambassador Woody Johnson at his London residence, Winfield House, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks. The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon. On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. The president's time in Scotland is not counted as part of the working visit. The president and first lady will visit Turnberry in Scotland A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. How Trump's UK visit will be different to those of other US presidents How previous presidents were greeted by the UK Will the US president get a frosty reception? A working visit - like the one Mr Trump is making - may include some of the same activities as a state visit, but there are small differences. For example, on a working visit, the visiting head of state does not address Parliament, nor is their accommodation organised and funded by the UK. Travel plans on a working visit are also organised and funded by the visiting country. President Trump will meet the Queen, but will not stay at Buckingham Palace Tens of thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday and in Glasgow on Saturday. Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police, including 400 from the West Midlands force. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Shaista Aziz, a Labour councillor in Oxford, and one of the organisers of the Together Against Trump protest in London, said the demonstration was about saying ""very clearly that we reject the policies of this administration"". Campaigners raised almost Â£18,000 to pay for the six-metre high inflatable Trump baby British police have not revealed the exact number of officers required to work during Mr Trump's trip - but the Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces. Forces from across the country have been asked to send thousands of officers to assist with protests. The Home Office said they can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". The Treasury has confirmed it will fund policing costs of up to Â£5m in Scotland. The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services."" The president will stay at Winfield House on Thursday night Mr Trump has a number of high profile supporters in the UK - including prominent Brexiteers Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. Speaking of Mr Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary on Monday, Mr Trump said he was a ""friend"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive,"" he said. ""I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" Republicans Overseas UK are organising a rally on Friday to welcome the president while a pub in west London has been renamed The Trump Arms in honour of the visit. The US Embassy said it was looking forward to Mr Trump's arrival ""as an opportunity to highlight the vitality of the special relationship"" between the UK and US. Tension between Trump and allies.

"Papa John's founder John Schnatter has stepped down as chairman of the company's board after apologising for using the N-word in a conference call. The pizza chain founder used the racial slur in a media training session in May. Mr Schnatter quit as chief executive last year aftercriticising the NFLover players' national anthem protests. In a statement on Wednesday, the company said it condemned ""racism and any insensitive language"". It later said it had accepted Mr Schnatter's resignation and that a new chairman would be appointed in the coming weeks. Papa John's is the world's third-largest pizza chain, with nearly 4,900 outlets worldwide. The incident happened during a conference call in May between executives at Papa John's and a marketing agency called Laundry Service. According to Forbes,external, the call involved a role-playing exercise that was supposed to give Mr Schnatter experience in dealing with difficult issues. When discussing how he would distance himself from racist groups, Mr Schnatter said that Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, had never faced criticism for using the N-word, Forbes reported. Mr Schnatter appears as part of Papa John's branding Trump donor Mr Schnatter stepped down as chief executive of the company in 2017 afterhe criticised the National Football League(NFL) for not containing national anthem protests at American football games, which he said were hurting his firm's sales.

"This video can not be played Rescuers carry one of the boys on a stretcher The cave complex in northern Thailand where 12 boys and their football coach were trapped for more than two weeks is set to be turned into a museum. Rescue officials said the museum would showcase how the operation unfolded, predicting it would be a ""major attraction"" for Thailand. At least two companies are also looking to make a film telling the story of the rescue. The rescued group are all now recovering in hospital. How the Thai boys were rescued Who are the Wild Boars? Video has been released showing them in good healthand in good spirits, though they will stay in quarantine for a week. The Thai Navy Seals have also published dramatic footage of the operation itself, showing how expert divers navigated the Wild Boar football team through the perilous journey to the surface. This video can not be played The boys give peace signs as they recover in hospital On Thursday, the Navy Seals were given flower garlands and an enthusiastic welcome as they arrived at a military airport south of the capital, Bangkok. The Tham Luang cave is one of the largest cave systems in Thailand. It lies under the mountains around the small town of Mae Sai, in northern Chiang Rai province on the border with Myanmar. The area is largely undeveloped with only limited tourism facilities. ""The area will become a living museum, to show how the operation unfolded,"" Narongsak Osottanakorn, the former governor and head of the rescue mission, told a news conference. ""An interactive data base will be set up. It will become another major attraction for Thailand."" However, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said precautions will have to be implemented both inside and outside the cave to safeguard tourists. The boys' story has gripped the world It is not clear if the museum will be operational all year round, as Thailand is prone to heavy floods during the monsoon season, which lasts from June until October. It was the sudden onset of that rainy season that trapped the boys deep underground while they were exploring. Two production companies are racing to turn the extraordinary story into a film. Even before all 13 people had been brought out, US studio Pure Flix - which makes inspirational Christian films - had announced its producers were on the ground interviewing rescue workers, Key questions on Thai cave rescue The heroes who saved the Wild Boars Studio co-founder Michael Scott, who lives in Thailand, said his wife had grown up with Saman Gunan,the former Thai Navy Seal member who lost his life during the mission. ""To see all that heroic bravery in the cave, and to get all the divers out, it's just such a touching event and so personal to me,""he said in a video on Twitter,external, filmed at the rescue site. But according to Los Angeles-based Ivanhoe Pictures, they have been officially picked by the Thai government and navy to develop the film. The doctor who chose to stay in the cave US media quoted the company as saying the film would be directed by Jon M Chu. He last partnered with Ivanhoe in directing the forthcoming romantic comedy Crazy Rich Asians. Concerns are already being raised on social media that any film would focus more on the international characters while downplaying the role of Thais. Chu insisted on Twitter that his film would be fair. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Donald Trump has raised questions about whether the UK's current Brexit plan is ""what they voted for"". The US president said ""Brexit is Brexit"" but it was turning out ""a little bit differently"" with the UK ""partially involved"" with the EU. ""Maybe they're taking a little bit of a different route,"" he went on. His comments at a press conference in Brussels were made before his visit to the UK - as details of Theresa May's Brexit plan were published. Asked about his remarks, Mrs May said her plan ""absolutely delivers on the Brexit people voted for"". Live: MPs updated on Brexit plans At-a-glance: The new UK Brexit plan Brexit: All you need to know Trump 'fine' with protests as he lands in UK Mr Trump backed a Leave vote ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, when he was a US presidential candidate, and he was asked for his views at the Nato summit press conference. ""It's not for me to say,"" the US president said. ""I'd like to see them be able to work it out so it can go quickly, whatever they work out."" It's not the first Mr Trump has had his say on the UK's relationship with the EU: In May 2016, before the EU referendum, he said he thought the UK was ""better off without"" the European Union ""I'm not making that as a recommendation, just my feeling,"" he said, describing the migration crisis as a ""horrible thing for Europe"" and blaming the EU for driving it. In August 2016, after the UK had voted to leave, he tweeted: ""They will soon be calling me Mr Brexit!"" In January 2017, shortly after becoming president, he gave aninterview to Tory MP Michael Gove,external- a prominent Leave campaigner and former journalist - saying: ""I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing."" Also in that interview, the president said the EU was ""a vehicle for Germany"" and that the UK was ""so smart in getting out"". And asked why thought the UK voted to leave, he said that ""people don't want to have other people coming in and destroying their country"" Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, had encouraged a Remain vote, warning of the consequences for trade if the UK left the EU. Mrs May is under pressure over her proposals for a future trading relationship between the UK and EU. Senior ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned, saying they cannot support the proposals. Some Tory backbenchers and other Brexit campaigners are also unhappy, saying it means the UK will be too closely tied to the EU. The government has now published aWhite Paper,externalgiving more details of its plans. They are aimed at avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, securing frictionless trade with the EU while also leaving the single market and customs union and regaining control of the UK's borders. The UK would accept a ""common rule book"" for trade in goods, but not services. There are also plans for what is described as an ""association agreement"", with ""joint institutional arrangements"" between the EU and the UK. The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, after the 2016 referendum in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Brexit. The two sides are negotiating outstanding issues related to its departure as well as the outline of their future relationship once a proposed transition period comes to an end, on 31 December 2020. Both are aiming for an agreement by October, to allow enough time for the UK and European parliaments to vote on what is decided. Dominic Raab, who became Brexit secretary on Monday after Mr Davis quit, told people who are ""criticising or carping"" about the plan that they needed to come up with credible alternatives of their own. The White Paper is not the final deal, as the detailed talks are yet to take place with the EU. The EU has welcomed its publication and said it will respond when it has seen the plans in detail.

That made it the most-watched five minutes of British TV since the 2012 Olympic opening ceremony. Wednesday's audience peaked between 21:30-21:35 BST as England tried to find an equaliser at the end of extra time in the semi-final against Croatia. But they couldn't score, meaningCroatia won 2-1to take them into Sunday's final against France. Croatia were underestimated by English pundits - Modric England players came of age - Southgate The overall TV match average for the semi-final was 24.3 million, which doesn't take into account people watching in pubs or on outdoor big screens. ITV said there were also a record 4.3 million requests to watch it online on ITV Hub. About 80% of all viewers watching TV in the UK at the time were tuned into the game. Its ratings reflected the huge interest in England's first World Cup semi-final since 1990. However not everyone could stand the tension and some changed channels. Allow Twitter content?

"Brown rat - an invasive predator that eats seabird eggs and chicks The much maligned rat is not a creature many would associate with coral reefs. But scientists studying reefs on tropical islands say the animals directly threaten the survival of these ecosystems. A team working on the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean found that invasive rats on the islands are a ""big problem"" for coral reefs. Rats decimate seabird populations, in turn decimating the volume of bird droppings - a natural reef fertiliser. The findings are published in Nature.,external Coral reefs entangled with plastic Rats and mice cleared from South Georgia The rare event threatening coral reefs Scientists now advocate eradicating rats from all of the islands to protect these delicate marine habitats. The Chagos Archipelago provided a large-scale natural laboratory to answer this question; although the islands are uninhabited by humans, some of them are now home to invasive rats, brought by ships and shipwrecks. Other islands have remained rat-free. ""The islands with and without rats are like chalk and cheese,"" said lead researcherProf Nick Graham from Lancaster University,external. ""The islands with no rats are full of birds, they're noisy, the sky is full and they smell - because the guano the birds are depositing back on the island is very pungent. ""If you step onto an island with rats, there are next to no seabirds."" By killing seabirds, this study revealed, rats disrupt a healthy ecosystem that depends on the seabird droppings, which fertilise the reefs surrounding the island. On rat-free islands, seabirds including boobies, frigatebirds, noddies, shearwaters and terns travel hundreds of kilometres to feed out in the ocean. When they return to the island, they deposit rich nutrients from the fish they feed on. ""These nutrients are leaching out onto the reef,"" explained Prof Graham. Seabirds like boobies nest far more abundantly on rat-free islands He and his team were able to track the source of those nutrients back to the fish that seabirds fed on by analysing algae and sponges growing on the reef. ""We also found that fish on the reefs adjacent to islands with seabirds were growing faster and were larger for their age than the fish on reefs next to rat-infested islands,"" Prof Graham explained. There were also significantly more fish on rat-free reefs than on those around ""ratty islands"". Coral reefs cover less than 0.1% of the ocean's area, but house about one third of ocean biodiversity. ""Coral reefs are also hugely threatened,"" said Prof Graham. ""So anyone who cares about extinctions and biodiversity needs to care about the future of coral reefs."" Coral reef systems are at ""crisis point"" because of climate change The reefs and their abundance of marine life provide livelihoods for millions of people around the world, so the decline in coral reefs is poised to become a humanitarian crisis. In an accompanying commentary articleDr Nancy Knowlton, a marine scientist from the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC,external, pointed out that, while ""adding rats to the list of dangers faced by reefs might seem discouraging, the discovery of these negative impacts points directly to a specific strategy"" that could slow the ongoing degradation of reefs. That strategy - rat eradication on islands throughout the world - is exactly what the researchers who carried out this study now advocate. ""Coral reef systems are at crisis point because of climate change,"" said Prof Graham. ""And we're desperately trying to find ways to enhance the resilience of coral reefs and allow them to cope with climate change. ""This is one of the clearest examples so far, where eradicating rats will lead to increased numbers of seabirds and this will bolster the coral reef.""

It came as police warned that loyalist paramilitaries were planning to ""orchestrate and participate in serious disorder"" in east Belfast. Meanwhile, there was also another night of disorder in Londonderry, where petrol bombs and missiles were thrown. Short Strand explosion believed to be a pipe bomb Police protection for bonfire removal The incidents on the outskirts of Belfast came after loyalists expressed anger at plans to reduce the size of two bonfire sites over safety fears. Masked men used burning cars to block roads close to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, east Belfast. In nearby Newtownards, a bus with passengers on board was hijacked by a group of masked men, one carrying a suspected firearm, before being set alight. Part of the Lower Newtownards Road was closed in the early hours while police examined a hijacked car, but the area later reopened. Other security alerts resulted in main roads being closed, while one incident prevented passengers leaving Belfast City Airport. Police say in total 13 cars and a bus were burnt out in east Belfast and Newtownards but there was less violence than in previous years. Part of the Lower Newtownards Road was closed while a hijacked car was investigated Bonfires are traditionally lit in many loyalist areas of Northern Ireland on the Eleventh Night to mark the anniversary of the Protestant King William's victory over the Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Hundreds of fires were lit at midnight to usher in the traditional Twelfth of July Orange parades in the region. This video can not be played Eleventh night bonfires - culture and controversy Loyalists claimed they had taken steps to minimise risk to buildings this year and saw attempts to restrict bonfires as attacks on their culture. On Tuesday, a court ordered that a bonfire in Bloomfield, east Belfast, be reduced in size. However, it was set alight in the early hours of Wednesday morning and missiles were thrown at police when they moved in to secure the site to allow contractors to remove material. One of the cars burnt out on the Eleventh night in Dundonald The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said it had received 327 emergency calls by 01:00 BST on Thursday. It said there had been ""164 operational incidents"" of which 57 were bonfire related. Bogside shooting was 'attempted murder' In Londonderry, youths threw petrol bombs and missiles at police stationed on the city's historic walls on Wednesday night. Two suspect devices were also left. A strong police presence, including officers in full riot gear, have been on stand-by in the area between the nationalist Bogside area and the nearby unionist Fountain estate. The latest disturbances came a day after dissident republicans were blamed for firing six shots at police with an automatic weapon in the area - the police are treating the incident as attempted murder. Leaders of the main political parties in Northern Ireland have come together to condemn the recent violence and call for calm. Eleventh Night bonfires culture and controversy.

"Donald Trump (far right) says Nato members would ""substantially"" up their budgets Nato allies have cast doubt on US President Donald Trump's claim they had pledged to ""substantially"" raise their defence budgets, saying they simply remained committed to a 2014 deal. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told US broadcaster CNN the allies had ""a commitment to spend 2%"" of their annual output (GDP) on defence budgets. Members agreed four years ago they would all reach that target by 2024. Mr Trump had hailed ""tremendous progress"" at Nato's summit in Brussels. Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? He has previously been highly critical of the alliance, complaining the US pays more than others. by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Welcome to Trump world. His press conference at Nato ranged from bluster to the bizarre but there is no doubting the president has had an effect. There was ""a new sense of urgency"" about increasing defence spending according to Jens Stoltenberg. But just how much extra money there will be and how quickly remains to be seen. Just as with his summit in North Korea, reality appears to be what President Trump decides it to be. The mere fact that the president of the alliance's essential member could even entertain the idea that the US might leave Nato is extraordinary. But by the end of the summit he said he believed in the alliance. This dissonance is at the heart of the Trump method. He gets results - or appears to - by both strengthening and weakening the alliance at the same time. Nato leaders will be glad this summit is over but remain uneasy as to just what Mr Trump might say when he meets Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Exactly what took place - and what was agreed - behind closed doors at the two-day Nato summit in Brussels is not known. What is known is that Mr Trump called for an emergency meeting on Thursday morning with other Nato members. How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? What does the US contribute to Nato? Unconfirmed reports suggested Mr Trump had threatened to go it alone if other nations did not meetthe alliance's target of 2% of their GDP by 2024. But by the time Mr Trump held a press conference, he was hailing the summit as a success. ""We made a tremendous amount of progress today,"" he said. ""It has been really amazing to see the level of spirit in that room."" It was, he said, ""presently unnecessary"" to consider quitting Nato. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The United States was not being treated fairly"" He added the US commitment to Nato - which was established in 1949 with members agreeing that an attack against one would be considered an attack against them all - remained ""very strong"". Mr Trump went on to say the allies had ""substantially upped their commitment"" and would pay ""more quickly"". Mr Stoltenberg, he added, gave him ""total credit"" for the increased spending which, he said, he instigated during his first Nato meeting last year. Mr Stoltenberg said members had had a ""frank and open discussion"" which ""created a new sense of urgency"", and that the ""clear message from President Trump"" was ""having an impact"". Italy's new Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emmanuel Macron also made it clear they had not signed up to anything more than what was agreed four years ago. Trump vows to end 'vicious' African conflicts ""Everyone agreed to raise spending, in line with commitments made in 2014,"" Mr Macron said, adding he was unconvinced by proposals to increase it to 4%. He said France had a clear strategy of analysing security threats and that he could not ask his government for ""tens of billions more"" beyond that. ""It's taxpayers' money we're talking about,"" he said. President Macron also said the meetings had had a different tone to Mr Trump's early morning tweets, which had been typically critical.

Mr Macron said the conversations had been more respectful, according to Reuters news agency. At the meeting, Mr Trump singled out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. Some reports suggest he also shocked other leaders in the room when he turned to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and referred to her by her first name. The Nato leaders also turned their attention to the conflict in Afghanistan. Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani was present for the second day of talks, and Mr Stoltenberg hopes the bloc will agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024.

"Properties in the UK are taking longer to sell than a year ago owing to the ""uninspiring"" housing market, according to surveyors. Last spring it typically took 16 weeks between a home being listed and being sold, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said. Now that has risen to about 18 weeks on average, the RICS survey found. The figures showed that, in June, sales had recorded the 16th successive month of decline. The areas where homes never cost Â£1m or more Your biggest financial decision - in 10 charts Other surveys have also suggested that the UK housing market has been particularly subdued this year, although the accompanying slowdown in house price rises has cheered many potential first-time buyers. Last week, the Halifax - the UK's largest mortgage lender - said thatUK house prices rose at the slowest pace since March 2013in the year to June, with an increase of 1.8%. The RICS monthly report found that, in June, the amount of property on estate agents' books remained at close to historic lows. ""It is hard to see what is going to provide much impetus for activity in the housing market in the near term,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at RICS. He also pointed to findings that suggested that the number of properties available to rent was slowing. Tax changes, such as a stamp duty surcharge, targeting buy-to-let investors and second-home owners, had led to many landlords leaving the market, RICS said. The likelihood of a increase in interest rates in August has been heightened by recent economic data, according to analysts. This, alongside the usual seasonal factors, seems to have prompted some more activity in the mortgage market, with the number of new home loans hitting its highest monthly total for the year so far in May, according to UK banking trade body UK Finance. However, Jeremy Leaf, north London estate agent, said: ""Unfortunately, any imminent rate rise is likely to have a disproportionately negative effect on already brittle confidence.""

"Croatia will meet France in the World Cup final after sending England out of the competition Croatia is jubilant. Right before the end of the game, a young man in a red and white Croatia football shirt rushed up to me at the fan zone in central Zagreb. ""If we win, I'm going to jump into that fountain,"" he said. Seconds later, as huge victory cheers filled the square, he plunged in, followed by dozens of others, shouting and splashing with joy. People set off fireworks and flares. ""England is going home - and we are going to the final!"" shouted a girl with red and white checks painted on her face. ""We are such a small country, but we can play football!"" Ecstatic Croatia fans cool their passions in a fountain in central Zagreb Huge crowds watched the game on a big screen in Zagreb's main square ""Nobody expected us to win,"" Marko cried. ""The English media all week were making fun of us, saying that we don't have a chance, but it showed in the field that quality reigned supreme. ""In every single game, they play with 100% of their hearts. It's everything to us."" This is Croatia's moment. It's a country of just over 4 million people, that has produced a team of brilliant players. Croatia's President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic (left) offered a Croatia football shirt to British PM Theresa May at the Nato summit in Brussels As he drank beer, Daniel told me it was very significant for his country. ""Croatians are very proud. The last time we got to the semi-finals in a World Cup was in 1998, just after the war and independence. We show we can win. It's more important for a small country."" Croatia beat England 2-1 to reach World Cup final England fans: 'You gave us something to believe in' England players came of age - Southgate Another fan was more philosophical. ""It's an escape for people,"" he said. ""There are no jobs, no money. The politicians are lining their pockets. But tonight people are happy. It makes them forget their problems for a short time."" One fan, Daniel, told the BBC the victory felt ""more important for a small country"" The players have been feted as national heroes. When the team qualified for the quarter-finals, the Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic paid them a visit in their dressing room, stepping over their kit, to hug several of the players in various states of undress. She later released video footage of her, resplendent in a football shirt, jumping up and down with the players. Croatia's president celebrates quarter final success in the team dressing room Croatia's performance in the World Cup has helped shift the spotlight from the dark cloud of corruption scandals surrounding football in this country and murky management within the Croatian football federation. Croatia has been repeatedly punished by Fifa and Uefa over unruly fans known for throwing flares at matches and chanting fascist slogans. And in March, Croatia's captain,Luka Modric, was charged with perjury. Prosecutors say the Real Madrid midfielder gave false testimony during the trial of one of the most powerful figures in Croatian football, the former head of Dinamo Zagreb, Zdravko Mamic, in a multi-million-euro corruption case. Mamic, who was sentenced to six and a half years in prison, is currently in hiding in Bosnia. Croatian football's Mr Big given jail term How hooligans exposed the ugly rift in Croatian football Modric's lawyer told the BBC that he had done nothing wrong and hoped he would not face trial for perjury after the World Cup.

"This video can not be played Rescuers carry one of the boys on a stretcher The cave complex in northern Thailand where 12 boys and their football coach were trapped for more than two weeks is set to be turned into a museum. Rescue officials said the museum would showcase how the operation unfolded, predicting it would be a ""major attraction"" for Thailand. At least two companies are also looking to make a film telling the story of the rescue. The rescued group are all now recovering in hospital. How the Thai boys were rescued Who are the Wild Boars? Video has been released showing them in good healthand in good spirits, though they will stay in quarantine for a week. The Thai Navy Seals have also published dramatic footage of the operation itself, showing how expert divers navigated the Wild Boar football team through the perilous journey to the surface. This video can not be played The boys give peace signs as they recover in hospital On Thursday, the Navy Seals were given flower garlands and an enthusiastic welcome as they arrived at a military airport south of the capital, Bangkok. The Tham Luang cave is one of the largest cave systems in Thailand. It lies under the mountains around the small town of Mae Sai, in northern Chiang Rai province on the border with Myanmar. The area is largely undeveloped with only limited tourism facilities. ""The area will become a living museum, to show how the operation unfolded,"" Narongsak Osottanakorn, the former governor and head of the rescue mission, told a news conference. ""An interactive data base will be set up. It will become another major attraction for Thailand."" However, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has said precautions will have to be implemented both inside and outside the cave to safeguard tourists. The boys' story has gripped the world It is not clear if the museum will be operational all year round, as Thailand is prone to heavy floods during the monsoon season, which lasts from June until October. It was the sudden onset of that rainy season that trapped the boys deep underground while they were exploring. Two production companies are racing to turn the extraordinary story into a film. Even before all 13 people had been brought out, US studio Pure Flix - which makes inspirational Christian films - had announced its producers were on the ground interviewing rescue workers, Key questions on Thai cave rescue The heroes who saved the Wild Boars Studio co-founder Michael Scott, who lives in Thailand, said his wife had grown up with Saman Gunan,the former Thai Navy Seal member who lost his life during the mission. ""To see all that heroic bravery in the cave, and to get all the divers out, it's just such a touching event and so personal to me,""he said in a video on Twitter,external, filmed at the rescue site. But according to Los Angeles-based Ivanhoe Pictures, they have been officially picked by the Thai government and navy to develop the film. The doctor who chose to stay in the cave US media quoted the company as saying the film would be directed by Jon M Chu. He last partnered with Ivanhoe in directing the forthcoming romantic comedy Crazy Rich Asians. Concerns are already being raised on social media that any film would focus more on the international characters while downplaying the role of Thais. Chu insisted on Twitter that his film would be fair. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Schools say the research proves budgets have not been protected The amount of per pupil spending in England's schools has fallen by 8% since 2010, says an analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The study says rising pupil numbers - and cuts to local authorities and sixth form funding - have seen a real-term reduction in school spending. Heads say it disproves government ""rhetoric"" about record funding levels. The Department for Education says funding will be at its ""highest ever level"", reaching Â£43.5bn by 2020. School leaders have been protesting that cash shortages have forced them to cut staff and to ask parents for financial assistance - but the government has argued that school funding has been protected. This research from the IFS definitively concludes that total funding per pupil in England has been reduced, when looked at in the round, taking into account changes in pupil numbers and different routes of funding schools and age groups. Head teachers say it should end the government's ""insistence"" that funding had not been reduced. This video can not be played The head of King's school in Wolverhampton says funding problems have meant lost jobs and unrepaired holes in the roof The study says efforts since 2010 to protect school budgets have focused on pupils up to the age of 16 - at the expense of sixth form funding and support through local authorities. Sixth form funding has been cut by 25% and local authority support is down by 55%. Between 2015 and 2017 the core budget up to the age of 16 fell by 4%, says the IFS analysis. When the sharp rise in pupil numbers is also taken into account, the IFS says there has been a 8% overall reduction in the money spent per pupil between 2009-10 and 2017-18. The studycompares school funding in England and Wales- and says because of the greater population surge in England, per pupil funding has fallen more sharply there, with per pupil funding in Wales down by 5% since 2009-10. ""School spending per pupil has fallen by more in England than in Wales over the last eight years, virtually eliminating the gap in spending per pupil between the two countries,"" said Luke Sibieta, research fellow at the IFS. The school with 300 holes in the roof Heads complain of having to ask parents for school funds Number of secondary schools in deficit has trebled Hinds admits funding pressures on schools This analysis on funding comes as schools are anticipating even further financial pressure - with the teachers' pay round expected soon. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, wrote to the education secretary last week warning that unless there was extra funding for teachers' pay, it would be ""catastrophic"" and effectively leave schools insolvent. An above-inflation pay rise, suggested to be in the region of 3.5%, is expected to help tackle a teacher shortage - which the education secretary has said is a""top priority"". King's school in Wolverhampton is the most improved school in its area, but faces cuts in what it can offer Responding to the IFS report, Mr Barton said ""the facts could not be more plain"". ""Despite the government's repeated insistence that it is spending record levels on education, the reality is that it has significantly cut funding per pupil in real terms. ""The scale of these cuts is a devastating indictment of its commitment to education and has put educational standards in jeopardy."" Mr Barton said schools would have ""no choice"" but to cut back on what they were able to offer pupils - and he accused ministers of failing to respond to a ""crisis which has developed under their watch"". Shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""This analysis is just the latest evidence of the damage that Tory cuts have done to our schools, denying a generation of children the opportunities they deserve."" The Department for Education says that they have moved extra cash into school budgets A Department for Education spokeswoman said that ""School funding in England is at its highest ever level, rising to Â£43.5n by 2020."" ""In fact, analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies itself has shown that real terms per pupil funding for 5-16 year olds in England in 2020 will be more than 50% higher than it was in 2000. ""We have also protected the base rate of funding for 16-19 year olds until 2020, worth Â£4,000 per student for 16-17 year olds.""

"The Australian Ballet's Sleeping Beauty performance was plunged into darkness A hungry rat has been blamed for a power failure during a ballet in Australia. Dancers and audience members were plunged into darkness during the second half of a Sleeping Beauty performance by the Australian Ballet. About 2,000 patrons had to be evacuated by torchlight from the theatre in Adelaide after realising the outage was not an artistic effect. State energy authorities later confirmed rodent damage as the cause. ""[Crews] found a rat that crawled inside one of our 11,000-volt pieces of equipment and had blown a fuse,"" a spokeswoman from South Australia Power Network said. The power outage affected the city's entire riverside arts precinct, and stopped another dance performance in the Adelaide Festival Centre. Allow Twitter content?

Dancers initially carried on with the performance before they were stopped by management. They received a standing ovation from an audience lit by the glow of mobile phones, the Adelaide Advertiser newspaper reported. The theatre's programming director Liz Hawkins told the Australian Broadcasting Corp the incident was unprecedented but patrons had responded with good grace. The ballet won't be rescheduled, but the audience will be given either a refund or some other form of compensation. The rat, it is presumed, did not make it.

"Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland (C) and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (3R) are at the summit Nato leaders are turning their attention to the conflict in Afghanistan, on the second day of a Brussels summit so far dominated by demands from President Donald Trump. Taliban militants reportedly killed up to 30 soldiers in attacks on Afghan army posts on Thursday. Mr Trump has urged Nato allies to commit at least 4% of their annual output (GDP) to military spending. Nato states are currently working towards a target of 2%. President Trump used Thursday morning's meeting to demand that the 2% goal be met by 2019, according to reports. Reuters news agency said he broke from ""a carefully scripted session"" about other Nato matters to emphatically restate his position. In a press conference, Mr Trump was complimentary about the meeting. ""We made a tremendous amount of progress today,"" he said. ""It has been really amazing to see the level of spirit in that room,"" he added, before adding that he believed in Nato and it was a ""fine-tuned machine"". In a separate briefing, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was a clear commitment to Nato from all attendees. There had been concern that President Trump might quit the alliance. But Nato sources, speaking to Reuters, said Mr Trump denied making such a threat. Mr Trump's early-morning tweets from Brussels had been typically critical. Allow Twitter content?

The US leader has specifically singled out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. He has also accused the country of being held prisoner to imported Russian energy, sayingit is ""totally controlled"" by Moscow. EU figures suggest Russia is responsible for between 50% and 75% of Germany's gas imports but gas makes up less than 20% of Germany's energy mix for power production. How much of Germany's gas comes from Russia? What does the US contribute to Nato? Can Nato survive President Donald Trump?

Britain's Prime MinisterTheresa May has already confirmed that the UK will send 440 more troopsto serve in non-combat roles in Afghanistan. The US also committed an extra 3,000 troops to support Afghan forces in September 2017 - bringing its total to 15,000. The Taliban and Afghan forces held a brief ceasefire during Eid celebrations in June US officials have said Washington is planning a strategic review, a year after Mr Trump agreed to remain involved in the 17-year conflict. The US-led invasion drove the hardline Taliban from power in 2001, as part ofa crackdown on Islamist militants after the 9/11 attacks in the US. Thousands of Nato troops were deployed and a long, bloody conflict followed as the ousted militants fought back. In 2014, Nato formally ended the combat mission, handing over to Afghan forces, whom it had trained. Since then, the Taliban have made substantial territorial gains across the country.A BBC study from Januaryfound the group is openly active in 70% of Afghanistan, and controls or threatens more territory than before the foreign troops left. Taliban 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' The cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan On Thursday, officials in Afghanistan said the Taliban had launched an attack on a number of army posts in the northern province of Kunduz. Earlier, dozens of Islamic religious scholars met in Saudi Arabia to discuss Afghanistan's war and called on the Taliban to renounce violence. Nato leaders will discuss the alliance's ties with Georgia and Ukraine. Both countries want to join Nato, but their bids are not expected to make progress.

"President Trump's visit comes at a difficult time for the prime minister The UK is in ""turmoil"" and ""it is up to the people"" whether Theresa May stays as prime minister, Donald Trump has said ahead of his first visit to the country as US President. Mr Trump told reporters before leaving Washington there were ""a lot of things going on"" in the UK at the moment. He said he got on well with Mrs May and had ""always liked"" Boris Johnson, who quit as foreign secretary on Monday. Mr Trump arrives on Thursday after attending the Nato summit. The US President is set to arrive in the UK on the same day as the government publishes its White Paper setting out in more detail Mrs May's controversial offer to the EU on future relations after Brexit. PM's new cabinet meets amid Brexit turmoil Live: Latest after Brexit resignations Who's who guide: Theresa May's cabinet Both Mr Johnson and former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has also quit, have expressed fears it will tie the UK too closely to the EU and make it harder to do trade deals with countries like the US. The US president has previously expressed sympathy for Brexit and said he wanted to do a quick trade deal with the UK once it leaves the EU - which is due to take place on 29 March 2019. Asked about his forthcoming visit, Mr Trump referred to the turbulence of the past 48 hours, which has prompted speculation about Theresa May's future as leader. ""It is going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato,"" he told reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""We will work it out and all countries will be happy. ""So I have Nato, I have the UK - that's a situation with turmoil."" Mr Trump, who has called on other Nato members to pay more for their own defence, joked that his meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest of all"". Asked about Mrs May's future, he said it was a matter for the British people. ""I get along with her very well. I have a very good relationship. That's certainly up to the people, not up to me."" Trump's plans for his UK visit revealed Trump told to appreciate European allies Trump visit to put 'pressure' on police As for Boris Johnson - seen by many as a potential future challenger to Mrs May - Mr Trump said he was a ""friend of mine"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive. I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" The ex-foreign secretary, who warned in his resignation letter on Monday that the ""Brexit dream was dying"", has spoken of his ""increasing admiration"" for Mr Trump and speculated about what Brexit negotiations would be like if he was in charge. Asked about Mr Trump's comments, a No 10 spokesman said Theresa May was looking forward to his visit and was confident he would leave with a ""positive impression"". He said it benefited the UK that Mr Johnson got on well with the US President and the new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was looking forward to build his own links in Washington. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said there was an unwritten rule among world leaders that they don't comment on each other's internal politics - but Mr Trump does not follow such conventions. During his visit, Mr Trump will hold talks with Theresa May, who will also host a dinner for him at Blenheim Palace. He is also due to have tea with The Queen at Windsor Castle. New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the UK will be a ""dependable ally"" Protests are expected against Mr Trump, whose policies - including a travel ban on a number of predominantly Muslim countries, the detention of child migrants on the US-Mexico border and the imposition of tariffs on EU steel and aluminium exports - have all been criticised by the UK. Mrs May has insisted the UK's strategic and historic links with the US mean hosting its US president is essential, although making clear where the UK disagrees with him. After being appointed foreign secretary on Monday, Jeremy Hunt said the UK would be a ""dependable ally, a country that stands up for the values that matter to the people of this country and will be a strong and confident voice in the world"". Mr Hunt urged all ministers to stand behind the prime minister in pursuit of an agreement with the EU based on the approach agreed at Chequers. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who has insisted any Brexit deal must guarantee there is no ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland, has suggested the Chequers agreement might represent a breakthrough. ""If the UK is able to relax some of its red lines, then the European Union should be flexible too,"" he told the Irish Parliament. ""I think perhaps we are now entering into that space."" And speaking on a trip to the United States, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said 80% of the withdrawal deal was agreed and he was now wanted to start negotiating a ""very ambitious"" free trade deal with the UK. The Nato summit in Brussels will be held against a backdrop of unprecedented recent tensions between Europe and the United States over trade and defence. Mr Trump has said the US is spending a disproportionate amount to ""protect"" Europe, amid reports that he might be considering reducing US troop numbers on the continent. The US President took to Twitter to berate European members of the transatlantic alliance, only a handful of which spend 2% of their GDP on defence in line with Nato targets. Allow Twitter content?

"Croatia will meet France in the World Cup final after sending England out of the competition Croatia is jubilant. Right before the end of the game, a young man in a red and white Croatia football shirt rushed up to me at the fan zone in central Zagreb. ""If we win, I'm going to jump into that fountain,"" he said. Seconds later, as huge victory cheers filled the square, he plunged in, followed by dozens of others, shouting and splashing with joy. People set off fireworks and flares. ""England is going home - and we are going to the final!"" shouted a girl with red and white checks painted on her face. ""We are such a small country, but we can play football!"" Ecstatic Croatia fans cool their passions in a fountain in central Zagreb Huge crowds watched the game on a big screen in Zagreb's main square ""Nobody expected us to win,"" Marko cried. ""The English media all week were making fun of us, saying that we don't have a chance, but it showed in the field that quality reigned supreme. ""In every single game, they play with 100% of their hearts. It's everything to us."" This is Croatia's moment. It's a country of just over 4 million people, that has produced a team of brilliant players. Croatia's President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic (left) offered a Croatia football shirt to British PM Theresa May at the Nato summit in Brussels As he drank beer, Daniel told me it was very significant for his country. ""Croatians are very proud. The last time we got to the semi-finals in a World Cup was in 1998, just after the war and independence. We show we can win. It's more important for a small country."" Croatia beat England 2-1 to reach World Cup final England fans: 'You gave us something to believe in' England players came of age - Southgate Another fan was more philosophical. ""It's an escape for people,"" he said. ""There are no jobs, no money. The politicians are lining their pockets. But tonight people are happy. It makes them forget their problems for a short time."" One fan, Daniel, told the BBC the victory felt ""more important for a small country"" The players have been feted as national heroes. When the team qualified for the quarter-finals, the Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic paid them a visit in their dressing room, stepping over their kit, to hug several of the players in various states of undress. She later released video footage of her, resplendent in a football shirt, jumping up and down with the players. Croatia's president celebrates quarter final success in the team dressing room Croatia's performance in the World Cup has helped shift the spotlight from the dark cloud of corruption scandals surrounding football in this country and murky management within the Croatian football federation. Croatia has been repeatedly punished by Fifa and Uefa over unruly fans known for throwing flares at matches and chanting fascist slogans. And in March, Croatia's captain,Luka Modric, was charged with perjury. Prosecutors say the Real Madrid midfielder gave false testimony during the trial of one of the most powerful figures in Croatian football, the former head of Dinamo Zagreb, Zdravko Mamic, in a multi-million-euro corruption case. Mamic, who was sentenced to six and a half years in prison, is currently in hiding in Bosnia. Croatian football's Mr Big given jail term How hooligans exposed the ugly rift in Croatian football Modric's lawyer told the BBC that he had done nothing wrong and hoped he would not face trial for perjury after the World Cup.

Croatia midfielder Luka Modric (centre) was charged with perjury in June The more the team wins, the more the fans are likely to forgive - but the problems remain. Back at the beer tent, Daniel told me his country would have to deal with the corruption issues, ""but not today."" ""After this, we must speak about the problems, but today it is more important to talk about Croatia."" ""It's incredible,"" one of the fans shouted. ""I really can't believe it. We're in the finals.

"Theresa May was the first foreign leader to visit Donald Trump after his election US President Donald Trump is set to arrive in the UK on Thursday for a two-day working visit. Mr Trump is the 12th sitting US president to make such a trip and will spend time with the Queen and prime minister before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at his golf resort. It is his first visit to Britain since winning the 2016 presidential election. Thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins described the trip as ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"". A black-tie dinner will be held at Blenheim Palace Mr Trump will fly to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire. Invited guests - including a number of business leaders - will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May. After spending Thursday night as a guest of US ambassador Woody Johnson at his London residence, Winfield House, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks. The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon. On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. The president's time in Scotland is not counted as part of the working visit. The president and first lady will visit Turnberry in Scotland A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. How Trump's UK visit will be different to those of other US presidents How previous presidents were greeted by the UK Will the US president get a frosty reception? A working visit - like the one Mr Trump is making - may include some of the same activities as a state visit, but there are small differences. For example, on a working visit, the visiting head of state does not address Parliament, nor is their accommodation organised and funded by the UK. Travel plans on a working visit are also organised and funded by the visiting country. President Trump will meet the Queen, but will not stay at Buckingham Palace Tens of thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday and in Glasgow on Saturday. Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police, including 400 from the West Midlands force. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Shaista Aziz, a Labour councillor in Oxford, and one of the organisers of the Together Against Trump protest in London, said the demonstration was about saying ""very clearly that we reject the policies of this administration"". Campaigners raised almost Â£18,000 to pay for the six-metre high inflatable Trump baby British police have not revealed the exact number of officers required to work during Mr Trump's trip - but the Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces. Forces from across the country have been asked to send thousands of officers to assist with protests. The Home Office said they can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". The Treasury has confirmed it will fund policing costs of up to Â£5m in Scotland. The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services."" The president will stay at Winfield House on Thursday night Mr Trump has a number of high profile supporters in the UK - including prominent Brexiteers Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. Speaking of Mr Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary on Monday, Mr Trump said he was a ""friend"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive,"" he said. ""I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" Republicans Overseas UK are organising a rally on Friday to welcome the president while a pub in west London has been renamed The Trump Arms in honour of the visit. The US Embassy said it was looking forward to Mr Trump's arrival ""as an opportunity to highlight the vitality of the special relationship"" between the UK and US. Tension between Trump and allies.

"This video can not be played Mays greet Trumps for UK black-tie dinner US President Donald Trump has been welcomed to Blenheim Palace by Theresa May, on the first day of his UK visit. The black-tie dinner, with 150 invited guests, is expected to focus on post-Brexit trade, and comes days after Mr Trump said the UK was in ""turmoil"". He and First Lady Melania Trump arrived in the UK on Thursday afternoon. Protesters have gathered outside the US ambassador's residence in London, where the Trumps are staying tonight, and near Blenheim Palace. Extra security is in place to police the protests, but Mr Trump has said that Britons ""like me a lot"" and that he feels ""fine"" about any such protests. Latest updates on Trump's UK visit Trump: Nato states to up defence funding What is going to happen during Trump's trip? The Trumps left Winfield House at approximately 19:00 BST, with Mrs Trump wearing a full-length yellow dress with a pleated skirt. This video can not be played US President Donald Trump arrived at Stansted Airport for a two-day working visit Mr Trump, who will also spend time with the Queen during his two-day working visit, said earlier of the British public: ""I think they agree with me on immigration... You see what's going on throughout the world with immigration... I think that's why Brexit happened."" He said ""Brexit is Brexit"" and the British people ""voted to break it up, so I imagine that's what they'll do but maybe they're taking a different route - I don't know if that is what they voted for"". Mr Trump has recently been under fire for his own immigration policy,which resulted in the separation of immigrant families. Members of the cabinet and business leaders are at the Blenheim Palace dinner While protesters - for and against the president - gathered outside the venue The Trumps landed at Stansted Airport, Essex, at 13:50 BST before a helicopter took them to Winfield House in Regent's Park, where they are staying as guests of the US ambassador. He was met at the airport by dignitaries including International Trade Secretary Liam Fox and US ambassador Woody Johnson. Speaking at the Nato summit in Brussels before he arrived, Mr Trump said the UK was a ""hot spot right now"". This video can not be played Some of Mr Trump's supporters and protesters have been explaining their motivation His visit comes as the governmentpublishes its plans for the UK's relations with the EUafter Brexit. Earlier this weekMr Trump saidit was ""up to the people"" whether Mrs May stayed on as prime minister after two cabinet ministers resigned within hours over her Brexit policy. Protests were also held outside the US ambassador's residence in Regent's Park A large police presence has been building up outside Blenheim Palace. Police officers estimated there were more than 1,000 people demonstrating before Mr Trump's arrival. A group of protesters has also gathered outside a fenced-off area in Regent's Park, close to the entrance of Winfield House, where Mr Trump is staying. Among those attending the black-tie dinner at the ancestral home of former Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill are cabinet ministers and business leaders. Guests are dining on Scottish salmon, Hereford beef fillet and strawberries with clotted cream ice-cream. Only one person, the digital entrepreneur and philanthropist Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, has publicly refused the invitation. UK protests greet Trump's 'state visit on the sly' Police beds for Trump visit 'a disgrace' Trump raises questions over Brexit plans Mrs May said the UK visit would be an opportunity to boost trade links and strengthen co-operation on security. Along with trade and security ties, Downing Street said the other key areas to be discussed between the two leaders included Brexit and the Middle East. Ahead of Mr Trump's visit, Mrs May said that when the UK leaves the European Union ""there will be no alliance more important in the years ahead"". Mr Trump travelled to the UK from the Nato summit, where he said member countrieshave agreed to increase their military spending. The US president and first lady were greeted by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, the Queen's representative and the chief operating officer of Stansted Airport They then departed on Marine One to travel to the US ambassador's residence in central London Mr Trump had joked earlier this week that his meeting with Vladimir Putin in the Finnish capital Helsinki on Monday ""may be the easiest"" part of his European trip. Downing Street insisted Mrs May welcomed Mr Trump's decision to ""engage"" with the Russian leader. But she also warned Mr Trump not to ignore the ""malign behaviour"" of Russia. By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Since Donald Trump took office, Theresa May has had to disagree with him publicly over his decision to impose trade tariffs on EU steel, abandon the Iran nuclear deal, move the US embassy to Jerusalem, order a Muslim travel ban and retweet anti-Muslim messages from a British far right group. In turn, the US president has described Britain as being in political ""turmoil"", criticised its defence spending and shown no enthusiasm for coming to visit: in the 18 months of his presidency, Mr Trump has chosen to visit 17 other countries first. Whatever this relationship is, it can hardly be described as special. So this trip is about ticking a diplomatic box, getting a visit out of the way before its further delay became politically embarrassing. And as working visits go, it is on the minimal side: no Downing Street barbecue, no cabinet visit, no speech to both Houses of Parliament. The diplomatic aim will be to get through the visit without any gaffes, without upsetting the president, and without him saying anything disobliging about Brexit or a future trade deal. The UK and the US do have a good relationship at an institutional level, in the fields of defence, security and intelligence. The tricky bit is always the politics and the personalities. On Friday, Mrs May and Mr Trump will go to watch a joint counter-terrorism exercise by British and US special forces at a military base. Guess who's coming to dinner with Trump Trump talks of UK 'turmoil' ahead of trip 'Trump Baby' balloon banned from Turnberry The UK-US trade relationship in five charts Stormy Daniels arrested in Ohio - lawyer The pair will then travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for talks with the foreign secretary. The president and first lady will travel to Windsor on Friday afternoon to meet the Queen, before flying to Scotland to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. This part of the visit is being considered private. The Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces as tens of thousands of people are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday - and in Glasgow on Friday. It has also complained that300 officers working during the visit will have to sleep on camp bedsin a gymnasium that has no hot water and restricted access to hot food. Security has been stepped up outside the US ambassador's residence in London where Mr Trump is staying Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK, including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. But the balloonwill not be allowed to fly over his Turnberry golf course, Police Scotland have said.

"Mr Trump last visited Scotland in June 2016 - the day after the EU referendum Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf has urged people protesting during Donald Trump's visit to Scotland to do so ""safely and peacefully"". The US president is arriving in the UK on Thursday, and is expected tospend the weekend in Scotland. Protests against Mr Trump and his administration's policies have been organised in several Scottish cities. After being briefed by police, Mr Yousaf said protests must be carried out in a ""safe and peaceful manner"". Police Scotland said the presidential visit would require a ""significant policing operation, involving thousands of officers and specialist resources"". Donald Trump's mother: from Lewis to New York President Trump: half Scottish, wholly controversial Trump's uneasy relationship with Scotland President Trump is setting off for a week-long tour of Europe, with talks in Brussels about the future of Nato first up, before meetings with the Queen and Prime Minster Theresa May in England on Thursday. The president is then expected to head north for the weekend - potentially visiting one of the two golf resorts he owns, in Aberdeenshire and Ayrshire - ahead of a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday. Mr Trump's mother was born on the Scottish island of Lewis, and he made several visits to his ""ancestral home"" before he became president. Allow Twitter content?

His last visit to the UK, on the day after the EU referendum, was his first foreign trip as the Republican candidate for the presidency. A small crowd of protestors gathered at Turnberry on that occasion, but far more are expected at events in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen now that he is in office. Some political leaders backed the rallies, with Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard criticising the president's ""politics of hate"" and Green co-convener Patrick Harvie calling him a ""vile xenophobe"". Mr Yousaf said he was confident Police Scotland would come up with a ""professional and effective"" response to the visit, ""facilitating peaceful protest"". He said: ""We understand that many people feel very strongly about President Trump and his administration's policies, and will want to express that this weekend when he is in the country. ""That is why there are a number of organised protest locations across the country this weekend and I would urge people who want to exercise their right to demonstrate in those locations, to do so in a safe and peaceful manner."" Protestors gathered outside Turnberry during Mr Trump's last visit to Scotland The UK government has agreed topay for up to Â£5m of policing costsfor the visit to Scotland, with warnings that it willpile pressure on police forces. Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said ""detailed planning is already well under way"" for a ""significant policing operation"". He said: ""Whilst the exact details of his programme are still being finalised, our objectives will be to ensure the safety of the president and of those travelling with him and to maintain public safety. ""In addition, we will work closely with âany groups to facilitate lawful protest."" Mr Trump has already stirred some controversy, telling reporters as he left the White House for the trip that the UK was in ""turmoil"". Mrs May has just been forced into a reshuffle of her cabinet after the resignations of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis, and the US president said the UK ""certainly has a lot of things going on"". Asked whether Mrs May should stay on, he said ""that's up to the people"", adding that he has a ""very good relationship"" with the prime minister. However, he added that he had ""always liked"" Mr Johnson, saying: ""Boris Johnson is a friend of mine. He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive. Maybe I'll speak to him when I get over there.""

"Anyone for dinner? So what would you say to dinner with Donald Trump at Blenheim Palace? Some of Britain's top business leaders have been wrestling with this tricky problem since the invite appeared on their desks earlier this week. The President's trade policies - not to mention his somewhat controversial moral compass - might be expected to give some pause for thought. But about 150 are understood to have agreed to attend Thursday's dinner hosted by the Prime Minister. So who exactly are among those deemed important enough to get through the gates of Blenheim palace, where the dinner is expected to be held? With the US hitting European steel exports with 25% tariffs, it may not surprise anyone that Tata Steel's spokesperson, before the question was even finished, blurted out: ""We're not going."" However, when pressed he couldn't confirm whether anyone from Tata had actually been invited. Only one person, the digital entrepreneur and philanthropist Baroness Martha Lane-Fox, has publicly refused the invitation. She said: ""I understand why the government have to entertain Trump, but I certainly don't want to."" The UK-US trade relationship in five charts Why is Donald Trump coming to the UK? Lord Sugar, who has been told by the President that without him ""he'd be nothing"" (referring to his hosting of the UK's version of Mr Trump's TV show The Apprentice), tweeted that he had not been invited. Sir Richard Branson, whose book Finding My Virginity described Mr Trump as having a ""vindictive streak"", is also reported not to be attending. Martha Lane-Fox turned down an invitation to dinner with Donald Trump The BBC understands Richard Gnodde, the European boss of Goldman Sachs, and Steve Hatch of Facebook UK are going. Jes Staley, the chief executive of Barclays, will also be there. Insurer Legal and General was happy to admit that not one but two executives were going: chief executive Nigel Wilson, and head of personal investing, Helena Morrissey. Several businesses seem unsure as to whether the dinner was a personal invitation or a business one. BP obviously thinks it's entirely personal, and what its chief executive Bob Dudley does in his spare time (for instance having dinner with the US President) is nothing to do with one of the world's leading oil companies. ""We don't comment on his personal diary,"" said its press office. The London Stock Exchange had the same lack of interest in its chief executive David Schwimmer's engagements outside office hours. Warren East of Rolls-Royce will be having dinner with Donald Trump Iain Anderson, chief executive of the communications agency Cicero Group, which has several clients among the guests, thinks this kind of dinner is nothing to do with private individuals and all to do with business. ""Anyone who goes is going not as a person but as the head of a company,"" he says. ""They are meeting the President. He's the man, whatever you think of him, who wears the badge that says President. And to meet him is important for trade, for business and for people."" So for some companies, saying no was not really an option. Warren East, the chief executive of engineering firm Rolls Royce, will be there. A spokesperson for the company said: ""We have an important operation in the US, whose main customer is the US Department of Defense, as well as an important partner in Boeing."" Steve Varley, chairman of accountanting and professional services group EY, is also going. His press office said: ""As an organisation with its global headquarters in London and over 15,000 people in the UK and 46,000 in the US, EY's attendance is testament to the role we play in supporting our clients' ambitions on a global scale."" So what do these stars of the British business world hope to get out of attending - assuming they even get a few moments face time with Mr Trump? Mr Anderson said: ""The number one issue is of course the trade tariffs, and people want to say something about that. And the second thing is whether there is anything specific we can get in the way of a UK/US bilateral trade deal. ""Whatever you think of Trump he does interact. He does work the room and there may well be an ability to get a one-to-one with him. And remember - he casts himself as a businessman.""
