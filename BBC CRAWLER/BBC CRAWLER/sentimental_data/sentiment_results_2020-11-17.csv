"Jewellery designer Michael Saiger, who brokered PPE contracts for the NHS, at a fashion show in 2009 A Spanish businessman who acted as a go-between to secure protective garments for NHS staff in the coronavirus pandemic was paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK taxpayer cash. The consultant had been in line for a further $20m of UK public funds, documents filed in a US court reveal. The legal papers also reveal the American supplier of the PPE called the deals ""lucrative"". The Department of Health said proper checks are done for all contracts. A legal dispute playing out in the courts in Miami has helped shine a light on the amount of money some companies have made supplying the NHS with equipment to protect staff from Covid infection. Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Safety concerns halt use of 50 million NHS masks Earlier this year, as the coronavirus pandemic was spreading rapidly around the world, Florida-based jewellery designer Michael Saiger set up a business to supply PPE to governments. He used his experience of working with factories in China to land what are described as ""a number of lucrative contracts"" supplying protective gloves and gowns to the NHS. Mr Saiger signed up a Spanish businessman, Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson, to help with ""procurement, logistics, due diligence, product sourcing and quality control"" of the PPE equipment. In effect, Mr Andersson was expected to find a manufacturer for deals that had already been done. Mr Andersson was paid more than $28m (Â£21m) for his work on two government contracts to supply the NHS. He was described in court documents as having done ""very well under this arrangement"". Earlier in the year there was a shortage of protective equipment for NHS medics In June, Mr Saiger signed three more agreements to supply the NHS with millions of gloves and surgical gowns. When the UK government paid up, his go-between, Mr Andersson, would have been in line for a further $20m in consulting fees. But the court documents allege that once the agreements had been signed, Mr Andersson stopped doing any work for Mr Saiger. It's not clear whether Mr Andersson received any of the money for this second batch of deals. This led to PPE deliveries being delayed to NHS frontline workers, Mr Saiger claims, and the company ""scrambling"" to fulfil the contracts by other means. So far the UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has published contracts with Mr Saiger's company, Saiger LLC, totalling more than Â£200m. These were awarded without being opened to competition. Alongside the legal dispute in Florida, the deals are set to be challenged in UK courts, by campaign group the Good Law Project. It accuses government ministers of not paying ""sufficient regard"" to tax-payers' money over a contract with the firm. ""We do not understand why, as late as June, government was still making direct awards of contracts sufficiently lucrative as to enable these sorts of profits to be made,"" Jolyon Maugham, the project's director told the BBC. ""The real criticism that is to be made here is of the huge profits that government allows to be generated."" This is not the first time concerns have been raised about PPE contracts the DHSC signed during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this year, the BBC revealed that50 million face masks the government bought could not be usedin the NHS because of safety concerns. And last week, it exposed concerns that thegovernment had leaned on safety officials to certify PPEwhich had been wrongly classified. A DHSC spokesperson said the department had been ""working tirelessly"" to deliver PPE, with more than 4.9 billion items delivered to frontline health workers so far and nearly 32 billion items ordered ""to provide a continuous supply"". They added: ""Proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts, and we take these checks extremely seriously."" The BBC asked Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson for comment but he has not so far responded. Saiger LLC said: ""At the height of the pandemic, and at a time when the NHS was in need of high-quality PPE that met the required safety standards, we delivered for Britain, on time and at value. ""At no time have we ever used any 'middlemen'. We have few full-time staff so for large projects we bring in short-term contractors for additional expertise and capacity, allowing us to deliver what is needed. ""We are exceptionally proud to have played our part in providing frontline workers in the UK, including nurses, doctors and hospital staff, with the millions of pieces of PPE they need to stay safe and to save lives.""

"Â£1.3bn will be invested in electric vehicle charging points as part of the plan New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will not be sold in the UK from 2030, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. But some hybrids would still be allowed, he confirmed. It is part of what Mr Johnson calls a ""green industrial revolution"" to tackle climate change and create jobs in industries such as nuclear energy. Critics say the Â£4bn allocated to implement the 10-point plan is far too small for the scale of the challenge. The total amount of new money announced in the package is a 25th of the projected Â£100bn cost of high-speed rail, HS2. UK climate plan: what do the terms mean? A really simple guide to climate change Electric vehicles: Your questions answered Shift to electric cars 'requires Herculean effort' This video can not be played Will the UK be ready for a 2030 ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars? Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Breakfast the Â£4bn was part of a broader Â£12bn package of public investment, which ""will help to bring in three times as much in terms of private sector money"". Mr Sharma, who is president of the COP26 international climate summit that the UK will host next year, said the money would also support the creation of 250,000 jobs in parts of the UK ""where we want to see levelling up"". The government hopes that many of those jobs will be in northern England and in Wales, and that 60,000 will be in offshore wind. The government has also given funding to boost cycling and walking Offshore wind:Produce enough offshore wind to power every home in the UK, quadrupling how much it produces to 40 gigawatts by 2030, and supporting up to 60,000 jobs. Hydrogen:Have five gigawatts of ""low carbon"" hydrogen production capacity by 2030 - for industry, transport, power and homes - and develop the first town heated by the gas by the end of the decade. Nuclear:Pushing nuclear power as a clean energy source and including provision for a large nuclear plant, as well as for advanced small nuclear reactors, which could support 10,000 jobs. Electric vehicles:Phasing out sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles and investing in grants to help buy cars and charge point infrastructure. Public transport, cycling and walking:Making cycling and walking more attractive ways to travel and investing in zero-emission public transport for the future. Jet zero and greener maritime:Supporting research projects for zero-emission planes and ships. Homes and public buildings:Making homes, schools and hospitals greener, warmer and more energy efficient, including a target to install 600,000 heat pumps every year by 2028. Carbon capture:Developing world-leading technology to capture and store harmful emissions away from the atmosphere, with a target to remove 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 - equivalent to all emissions of the industrial Humber. Nature:Protecting and restoring the natural environment, with plans to include planting 30,000 hectares of trees a year. Innovation and finance:Developing cutting-edge technologies and making the City of London the global centre of green finance. The plan includes provision for a large nuclear plant -likely to be at Sizewell in Suffolk- and for advanced small nuclear reactors, which it is hoped, will create an estimated 10,000 jobs at Rolls-Royce and other firms. The government is close to giving the green light to a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk The plans will also affect some people's homes. The government will bring forward, to 2023, the date by which new homes will need to be warmed without using gas heating. Free home insulation: Too good to be true? Sea's heat to warm historic house Extra Â£40m pledged for green spaces in England Why the UK's carbon-free future will need rules It will aim to install 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 - these are low-energy electrical devices for warming homes. And it hasextended the Green Homes Grant for home insulationfor a year after the first tranche was massively over-subscribed. Clean hydrogen will be blended into the natural gas supply to reduce overall emissions from gas, and the government wants a town to volunteer for a trial of 100% hydrogen for heat, industry and cooking. The hydrogen - attracting a subsidy of up to Â£500m - will be produced in places such as the North East of England, partly by energy from offshore wind. The prime minister wants his green plan to be powered by wind farms like this one in Redcar, Teesside The government wants to breathe new life into de-industrialised areas by teaming hydrogen production with the manufacture of wind turbines, and with four clusters of firms using carbon capture and storage. Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype? UK carbon capture project begins This is when emissions from chimneys are captured and forced into rocks underground. The hope is to transform depressed areas into hi-tech hubs. This will get funding of an extra Â£200m. Another key point of the plan is a Â£1.3bn investment in electric vehicle (EV) charging points. Grants for EV buyers will stretch to Â£582m to help people make the transition. There is also nearly Â£500m for battery manufacture in the Midlands and the north-east of England. Many of the details of the plan will be written into an energy white paper proposing future legislation, which is expected by the end of the month. In the race to clean up motoring, the UK is now in second place after Norway, which has a fossil fuel vehicle abolition date of 2025. UK car makers have warned about the scale of the challenge, but the government believes that forcing technological change can give firms a competitive edge. But will the so-called ""green revolution"" achieve its aim of massive job creation? Experts said the Â£4bn would go a long way if it were spent on labour-intensive insulation, but not far if ploughed into expensive, mechanised carbon capture. The prime minister said: ""My 10-point plan will create, support and protect hundreds of thousands of green jobs, whilst making strides towards net zero by 2050. ""Our green industrial revolution will be powered by the wind turbines of Scotland and the North East, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales, so we can look ahead to a more prosperous, greener future."" Mr Johnson said his plans aimed to create jobs and address climate change at the same time. The UK will host the COP26 UN summit - seen as the most important round of talks to tackle climate change since the Paris Agreement in 2015 - in Glasgow this time next year.It had been due to take place in 2020 but was postponed by 12 months because of the pandemic. The plans are aimed to put the UK on track to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband criticised the plan, saying that the funding ""in this long-awaited"" announcement does not ""remotely meet the scale of what is needed"" to tackle unemployment and the climate emergency. ""Only a fraction of the funding announced today is new."" Mr Miliband, who served as energy and climate change secretary from 2008-10,  said Labour wanted the government to bring forward Â£30bn of capital investment over the next 18 months and invest it in low-carbon sectors to support 400,000 additional jobs. And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas welcomed some measures but said the plan ""completely fails to rise to the gravity of this moment"". ""When you put it in the context of the scale of the climate and nature emergencies that we face, and indeed the scale of the job emergencies that we face, then it's nowhere near ambitious enough, it's not urgent enough, it's not bold enough,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She criticised the Â£4bn allocation, saying ""the resources aren't there in order to make this a really strategic package"". Ms Lucas also said the government's message is ""inconsistent"" and it must make clear  which technologies it wants to invest in. She said nuclear power is ""massively costly"", will not be ""on stream"" until the middle of the 2030s, and risks undermining focus on offshore wind. The Green Party called for a transformation of the entire economy to reduce emissions, including scrapping the Â£27bn road-building programme, which will actually increase emissions. However, Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of energy supplier SSE, told the Today programme he was pleased ""to see this level of ambition from the government"". He said the plan was ""a really important step in getting the green recovery going"" and would ""help create a lot more jobs"". Mike Hulme, professor of human geography at the University of Cambridge, said critics should not ""nit-pick about precise details"" of the plan as it was ""far more important is to endorse the direction of travel that has been set for the next decade"". Tanya Steele from WWF-UK said the government had ""fired the starting gun on the action we need to see"". She added: ""We now need the chancellor to live up to the ambition expressed today through a spending review that tests every line of public spending to ensure it's compatible with meeting our climate goals.""

"The Lords Conduct Committee concluded Lord Ahmed emotionally and sexually exploited a vulnerable woman A member of the House of Lords retired from Parliament after seeing a conduct report recommending he be expelled for sexually exploiting a vulnerable woman. TheLords Conduct Committee,externalconcluded Lord Ahmed of Rotherham emotionally and sexually exploited Tahira Zaman, who came to him for help in 2017. The inquiry into his behaviour followed a BBC Newsnight investigation. Lord Ahmed said the allegations in the report were not true and he would appeal against the decision. Ms Zaman said she was ""elated and relieved"" at the report's findings. The Lords Conduct Committee report concluded Lord Ahmed had exploited Ms Zaman, despite knowing she was receiving treatment for anxiety and depression. The Lords Commissioner for Standards, Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, said this ""exacerbates the seriousness"" of his breaches of the code of conduct. Ms Zaman told Newsnight last year: ""I was looking for help and he took advantage of me, he abused his power."" She said she had approached Lord Ahmed because she thought he could help her get the Metropolitan Police to investigate a faith healer who she believed was exploiting women. Lord Ahmed wrote to the Met Police Commissioner on headed paper on 2 March, and he and Ms Zaman met at a restaurant in east London in February 2017 to discuss the case. After dinner, Ms Zaman alleged that Lord Ahmed groped her upper thigh. On the balance of probabilities, the Commissioner for Standards' investigation found that Lord Ahmed had sexually assaulted her. Ms Zaman says she was shocked by his behaviour and broke off contact. But, encouraged by a friend, she messaged Lord Ahmed on 14 July that year to ask if he had received a reply from the police. He said he had and they arranged to meet at his house in east London to discuss it. She told Newsnight last year: ""He was saying I'm beautiful and, you know, he really likes me."" Later that evening, in September 2017, they had sex. The Commissioner for Standards concludes: ""I find that it is more likely than not that Ms Zaman went to Lord Ahmed's house at his invitation to discuss the offer made by the police to meet her. ""However, he had no intention of forwarding her concerns to the police and his use of the offer of a meeting made in the letter from the police to lure Ms Zaman to his house was dishonest."" Tahira Zaman complained about Lord Ahmed's behaviour to the Lords' Commissioner for Standards Lord Ahmed continued to pursue her and Ms Zaman felt they were entering into a relationship. But Ms Zaman says that after two months the relationship ended. She says she realised she had been exploited. Ms Zaman first complained to the House of Lords about Lord Ahmed's behaviour in January 2018. She approached Newsnight after the Commissioner for Standards told her Lord Ahmed could not be investigated because the code of conduct only covered his parliamentary ""duties"" - mainly proceedings of the House of Lords. Newsnight began to investigate the Lords' decision not to accept Ms Zaman's complaint, for a film broadcast in February last year. Interviewed by Newsnight, Lord Carlile QC, a former deputy high court judge, said the Commissioner for Standards had ""got it wrong"", adding: ""If someone comes to you for help, particularly if they're vulnerable and you form a sexual relationship, actually that's disgraceful."" The Commissioner for Standards denied this, telling Newsnight that was a misunderstanding of the code of conduct. Ten weeks after the film was broadcast, the House of Lords changed the wording of the code to cover parliamentary ""activities"", rather than just ""duties"". It was retrospective and so covered Lord Ahmed's behaviour. Ms Zaman re-submitted her complaint, which led to a detailed investigation by the Commissioner for Standards. Responding to the report, Ms Zaman said: ""I feel elated and relieved because the whole experience for me was quite traumatising. I'm still digesting, digesting it. ""I keep on telling myself that I've got what I wanted - I wanted justice."" Lord Ahmed said: ""I am extremely disappointed by the report of the conduct committee, which is based on a flawed and unfair investigation process. ""I have always said, and maintain, that the allegations contained in the report are not true. ""Given this, I am now going to continue pursuing my appeal to the European Court of Human Rights to remedy this injustice."" You can see Newsnight's update on its investigation at 22:45 GMT.

"British Airways is to launch a voluntary Covid-19 test for passengers travelling to the UK from three US airports. The airline wants to persuade governments that testing travellers will make quarantining unnecessary. American Airlines is also taking part in the trial, which followsa similar effort by United Airlines. The government is looking at how testing can reduce the time travellers to the UK need to self-isolate. British Airways owner IAG has long criticised the 14-day quarantine imposed on arrivals, saying it deters people from flying and damages airlines. It is also trying to convince the US government to open its borders to travellers from the UK, who have been barred since March. The trial begins on 25 November and will be free to eligible customers on three flights: American Airlines flight AA50 from Dallas Fort Worth to Heathrow British Airways flight BA268 from Los Angeles to Heathrow And British Airways flight BA114 from New York John F. Kennedy to Heathrow. Customers will be tested 72 hours before their trip, as well as during and after travelling. If they test positive before travelling, they will have to reschedule or cancel their flight, but will be able to rebook at a later date without a fee. The trial will run to mid-December, and British Airways would like to test 500 passengers. British Airways owner IAG cuts flight numbers again British Airways' boss replaced amid industry's 'worst crisis' Covid: Taskforce to look at virus testing for UK arrivals Boss chief executive Sean Doyle,who was parachuted into the role in October, said: ""If we have a testing formula it gives people certainty from which they can plan."" He added that he was ""confident"" the airline would demonstrate that a test three days before flying would make quarantining unnecessary. Heathrow is already offering rapid coronavirus tests for people travelling to destinations where proof of a negative result is required on arrival. It comes as airlines struggle with a massive slump in demand that hascost the industry $84.3bn (Â£64bn) in lost sales,externalglobally this year. The UK government hasset up a taskforceto look at how tests could reduce the quarantine period for people flying to the UK, but it says travellers would still need to isolate for a number of days. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""The government's Global Travel Taskforce is working at pace, with clinicians, devolved administrations and the travel industry to develop measures as quickly as possible to protect air connectivity and consider how testing could be used to reduce the self-isolation period.""

"Rangers fear the unique white skin of the giraffe may make the animal vulnerable to poachers The world's only known white giraffe has been fitted with a GPS tracking device to keep poachers at bay in north-east Kenya, conservationists say. A conservation group said rangers could monitor the lone male giraffe's movements in real time. The giraffe has a rare genetic condition called leucism, which causes the loss of skin pigmentation. He is thought to be the last of his kind, after poachers killed two of his family members in March. Rangers fear the giraffe could suffer the same fate as his relatives, a female and her seven-month-old calf with similar white skin. Their carcasses were found in a conservation area in Kenya's north-eastern Garissa County, where the male giraffe is currently living alone. Rare white giraffes killed by poachers in Kenya The Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, which oversees wildlife in the area, said the tracking device was attached to one of the giraffe's horns on 8 November. In a statement released on Tuesday, the non-profit group said the tracking device would give hourly updates on the giraffe's whereabouts, enabling rangers to ""keep the unique animal safe from poachers"". The male giraffe's family - a female and a calf - were found dead in March this year The manager of the group, Mohammed Ahmednoor, thanked conservationists for their help in protecting the giraffe and other wildlife. ""The giraffe's grazing range has been blessed with good rains in the recent past and the abundant vegetation bodes well for the future of the white male,"" he said. The Kenya Wildlife Society, the main conservation body in the east-African country, said it was happy to assist in efforts to protect ""unique wildlife like the only known white giraffe"". White giraffes were first spotted in Kenya in March 2016, about two months after a sighting in neighbouring Tanzania. A year later, white giraffes made headlines again, after the mother and her calf from the conservancy in Kenya's Garissa County were caught on camera. Native to more than 15 African countries, giraffes are the world's tallest mammals. They are hunted by poachers for their hides, meat and body parts. Some 40% of the giraffe population has disappeared in the last 30 years, with poaching and wildlife trafficking contributing to this decline, according to theAfrica Wildlife Foundation (AWF),external. Giraffes have been designated as a vulnerable species onThe International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List,external, with an estimated population of 68,293 globally.

"Â£1.3bn will be invested in electric vehicle charging points as part of the plan New cars and vans powered wholly by petrol and diesel will not be sold in the UK from 2030, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. But some hybrids would still be allowed, he confirmed. It is part of what Mr Johnson calls a ""green industrial revolution"" to tackle climate change and create jobs in industries such as nuclear energy. Critics say the Â£4bn allocated to implement the 10-point plan is far too small for the scale of the challenge. The total amount of new money announced in the package is a 25th of the projected Â£100bn cost of high-speed rail, HS2. UK climate plan: what do the terms mean? A really simple guide to climate change Electric vehicles: Your questions answered Shift to electric cars 'requires Herculean effort' This video can not be played Will the UK be ready for a 2030 ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars? Business Secretary Alok Sharma told BBC Breakfast the Â£4bn was part of a broader Â£12bn package of public investment, which ""will help to bring in three times as much in terms of private sector money"". Mr Sharma, who is president of the COP26 international climate summit that the UK will host next year, said the money would also support the creation of 250,000 jobs in parts of the UK ""where we want to see levelling up"". The government hopes that many of those jobs will be in northern England and in Wales, and that 60,000 will be in offshore wind. The government has also given funding to boost cycling and walking Offshore wind:Produce enough offshore wind to power every home in the UK, quadrupling how much it produces to 40 gigawatts by 2030, and supporting up to 60,000 jobs. Hydrogen:Have five gigawatts of ""low carbon"" hydrogen production capacity by 2030 - for industry, transport, power and homes - and develop the first town heated by the gas by the end of the decade. Nuclear:Pushing nuclear power as a clean energy source and including provision for a large nuclear plant, as well as for advanced small nuclear reactors, which could support 10,000 jobs. Electric vehicles:Phasing out sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030 to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles and investing in grants to help buy cars and charge point infrastructure. Public transport, cycling and walking:Making cycling and walking more attractive ways to travel and investing in zero-emission public transport for the future. Jet zero and greener maritime:Supporting research projects for zero-emission planes and ships. Homes and public buildings:Making homes, schools and hospitals greener, warmer and more energy efficient, including a target to install 600,000 heat pumps every year by 2028. Carbon capture:Developing world-leading technology to capture and store harmful emissions away from the atmosphere, with a target to remove 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030 - equivalent to all emissions of the industrial Humber. Nature:Protecting and restoring the natural environment, with plans to include planting 30,000 hectares of trees a year. Innovation and finance:Developing cutting-edge technologies and making the City of London the global centre of green finance. The plan includes provision for a large nuclear plant -likely to be at Sizewell in Suffolk- and for advanced small nuclear reactors, which it is hoped, will create an estimated 10,000 jobs at Rolls-Royce and other firms. The government is close to giving the green light to a new nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk The plans will also affect some people's homes. The government will bring forward, to 2023, the date by which new homes will need to be warmed without using gas heating. Free home insulation: Too good to be true? Sea's heat to warm historic house Extra Â£40m pledged for green spaces in England Why the UK's carbon-free future will need rules It will aim to install 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 - these are low-energy electrical devices for warming homes. And it hasextended the Green Homes Grant for home insulationfor a year after the first tranche was massively over-subscribed. Clean hydrogen will be blended into the natural gas supply to reduce overall emissions from gas, and the government wants a town to volunteer for a trial of 100% hydrogen for heat, industry and cooking. The hydrogen - attracting a subsidy of up to Â£500m - will be produced in places such as the North East of England, partly by energy from offshore wind. The prime minister wants his green plan to be powered by wind farms like this one in Redcar, Teesside The government wants to breathe new life into de-industrialised areas by teaming hydrogen production with the manufacture of wind turbines, and with four clusters of firms using carbon capture and storage. Is the hydrogen tech 'revolution' hope or hype? UK carbon capture project begins This is when emissions from chimneys are captured and forced into rocks underground. The hope is to transform depressed areas into hi-tech hubs. This will get funding of an extra Â£200m. Another key point of the plan is a Â£1.3bn investment in electric vehicle (EV) charging points. Grants for EV buyers will stretch to Â£582m to help people make the transition. There is also nearly Â£500m for battery manufacture in the Midlands and the north-east of England. Many of the details of the plan will be written into an energy white paper proposing future legislation, which is expected by the end of the month. In the race to clean up motoring, the UK is now in second place after Norway, which has a fossil fuel vehicle abolition date of 2025. UK car makers have warned about the scale of the challenge, but the government believes that forcing technological change can give firms a competitive edge. But will the so-called ""green revolution"" achieve its aim of massive job creation? Experts said the Â£4bn would go a long way if it were spent on labour-intensive insulation, but not far if ploughed into expensive, mechanised carbon capture. The prime minister said: ""My 10-point plan will create, support and protect hundreds of thousands of green jobs, whilst making strides towards net zero by 2050. ""Our green industrial revolution will be powered by the wind turbines of Scotland and the North East, propelled by the electric vehicles made in the Midlands and advanced by the latest technologies developed in Wales, so we can look ahead to a more prosperous, greener future."" Mr Johnson said his plans aimed to create jobs and address climate change at the same time. The UK will host the COP26 UN summit - seen as the most important round of talks to tackle climate change since the Paris Agreement in 2015 - in Glasgow this time next year.It had been due to take place in 2020 but was postponed by 12 months because of the pandemic. The plans are aimed to put the UK on track to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband criticised the plan, saying that the funding ""in this long-awaited"" announcement does not ""remotely meet the scale of what is needed"" to tackle unemployment and the climate emergency. ""Only a fraction of the funding announced today is new."" Mr Miliband, who served as energy and climate change secretary from 2008-10,  said Labour wanted the government to bring forward Â£30bn of capital investment over the next 18 months and invest it in low-carbon sectors to support 400,000 additional jobs. And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas welcomed some measures but said the plan ""completely fails to rise to the gravity of this moment"". ""When you put it in the context of the scale of the climate and nature emergencies that we face, and indeed the scale of the job emergencies that we face, then it's nowhere near ambitious enough, it's not urgent enough, it's not bold enough,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She criticised the Â£4bn allocation, saying ""the resources aren't there in order to make this a really strategic package"". Ms Lucas also said the government's message is ""inconsistent"" and it must make clear  which technologies it wants to invest in. She said nuclear power is ""massively costly"", will not be ""on stream"" until the middle of the 2030s, and risks undermining focus on offshore wind. The Green Party called for a transformation of the entire economy to reduce emissions, including scrapping the Â£27bn road-building programme, which will actually increase emissions. However, Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of energy supplier SSE, told the Today programme he was pleased ""to see this level of ambition from the government"". He said the plan was ""a really important step in getting the green recovery going"" and would ""help create a lot more jobs"". Mike Hulme, professor of human geography at the University of Cambridge, said critics should not ""nit-pick about precise details"" of the plan as it was ""far more important is to endorse the direction of travel that has been set for the next decade"". Tanya Steele from WWF-UK said the government had ""fired the starting gun on the action we need to see"". She added: ""We now need the chancellor to live up to the ambition expressed today through a spending review that tests every line of public spending to ensure it's compatible with meeting our climate goals.""

"Rising numbers of Covid-19 deaths have pushed the total number of UK deaths further above the expected level for this time of year. 2,225 deaths involving Covid-19 were registered in the week of 6 November, up by 628 in a week. Deaths registered for any reason were 15% above the level expected at this time of year. The total number of ""excess"" deaths, those above expected levels, since the start of the pandemic is now 70,839 Most of these deaths occurred in the first wave: the weeks since the start of October account for just over 5,500 of that total. ""Excess"" deaths are the difference between the deaths seen this year (the height of the shaded area in the chart above) and the average over the previous five years for the same weeks (shown by the dashed line). It includes people whose Covid-19 wasn't confirmed by a positive test and people who died because of the strain the pandemic has put on the NHS and society. The weekly number of excess deaths is rising. In the most recent set of figures, deaths were 15% above expected levels compared to 11% above expected levels the week before. In the most recent week of data, London saw no deaths above the average level for this time of year. But the North West of England saw 1,900 deaths in a single week, nearly 500 more than would be expected. The North West and Northern Ireland have consistently seen the highest levels of excess deaths in the UK in recent weeks. The figures for Wales have risen sharply in the last two weeks.

"US troops have been involved in the fight against the Islamic State jihadist group in Iraq Senior Republicans and US allies have voiced alarm at the announcement that a large number of American troops will be removed from Afghanistan and Iraq. The US is to withdraw 2,500 troops from both countries by mid-January, the US Department of Defense confirmed. President Donald Trump has long called for troops to come home and has criticised US interventions abroad. The head of Nato warned of a ""very high price"". Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the plan ""a mistake"". Mr McConnell - usually a staunch defender of Mr Trump - also warned the president against making ""any earth-shaking changes in regards to defence and foreign policy"" before leaving the White House. Mr Trump is yet to concede to Democrat Joe Biden, and the cuts are scheduled to take place five days before Mr Biden takes office on 20 January 2021. Fighting for a future in a war without end How much has the Afghanistan war cost the US? The Afghan war: The short and long story The president-elect has said he is ""rightly weary of our longest war"" in Afghanistan but also said there was a need to ""end the war responsibly, in a manner that ensures we both guard against threats to our homeland and never have to go back"". The Biden transition team has not yet commented on the announcement. In Iraq, the number of US troops will be cut by 500 to 2,500, while the number of service personnel in Afghanistan will fall from 4,500 to about 2,500. Acting US Defense Secretary Chris Miller - who was installed last week after Mr Trump abruptly fired Mark Esper - said the move reflected the president's policy ""to bring the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to a successful and responsible conclusion and to bring our brave service members home"". ""We will protect our children from the heavy burden and toll of perpetual war, and we will honour the sacrifices made in the services of peace and stability in Afghanistan, Iraq and around the world,"" he said. He did not confirm if the drawdown plan had been endorsed by Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but said the decision followed ""continuous engagement with the president's national security cabinet"". Until Mr Esper's removal, the Pentagon had said the Taliban had not met pledges to reduce violence, which has soared since the militants began peace talks with the Afghan government in September. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? Mr Miller said the US had met its goal of defeating extremists and helping ""local partners and allies to take the lead in the fight"". US officials said the withdrawal plans had yet to be hammered out in detail and it was not yet clear which troops would be pulled out, Reuters news agency reports. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman said he and Mr Miller had spoken on the phone about ""continued meaningful US military support to the Afghan Security and Defence Forces"". Shortly after the announcement, several rockets were fired into the Green Zone in Baghdad and landed near the US embassy. It is the first such attack since Iraqi militias linked to Iran agreed to stop targeting the embassy compound last month. The Iraqi military said an Iraqi child was killed and five civilians were wounded. By Secunder Kermani, BBC Afghanistan and Pakistan correspondent President Trump has been determined to withdraw troops from Afghanistan. There were even fears he might try to recall all remaining forces before Joe Biden assumes office. That hasn't happened, but this cut in troop numbers will reduce the leverage the Biden administration will have over the Taliban. Under the US-Taliban agreement signed in February, all US forces will be withdrawn by May 2021, but, in theory, only if the Taliban fulfil certain conditions. Those don't seem to have been met yet. Talks between the Taliban and Afghan officials have finally begun, but progress has been slow, and violence has been intensifying. Meanwhile, many in the intelligence community still haveconcerns about the Taliban's continuing links with al-Qaeda. Mr Biden has also signalled his intent to eventually withdraw forces, but the expectation is he may be willing to proceed more slowly, and place the Taliban under greater scrutiny. He has also talked of a desire to leave a small counter-terrorism force in the country. The Taliban, however, could react violently to that proposal or any change in the withdrawal schedule. Afghan forces face losing crucial US firepower in the air US forces have been in Afghanistan since 2001. A US-led coalition ousted the Taliban weeks after the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US by al-Qaeda, which was then based in Afghanistan The Taliban regrouped and became an insurgent force that by 2018 was active in more than two-thirds of the country The US started withdrawing troops from Afghanistanas part of an agreement signed by the US and the militants in February this year. But violence in the country has increased recently as the group steps up its offensives amid stalled negotiations with the Afghan government Thousands of US forces are in Iraq as part of an international coalition to fight against the Islamic State (IS) group Along with Mr McConnell, several other senior Republicans also voiced concerns. Texas Republican congressman Mac Thornberry called the move a ""mistake"", saying cutting troop numbers would ""undercut negotiations"" currently under way aiming to bring an end to fighting in Afghanistan. And Senator Ben Sasse, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said it was a ""weak retreat"" and that it was ""not grounded in reality and will make the world a more dangerous place."" Nato Secretary-General Jen Stoltenberg, in a rare public show of concern, said ""the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high"". In a statement, he added that Afghanistan risked once again becoming a platform for international militants to organise attacks. The alliance relies heavily on the US forces for logistical support in Afghanistan. They form the bulk ofabout 12,000 troops from 38 Nato allies and partner countries, including the UK,external, serving in the country. Afghan fears rise as US ends its longest war Afghans dare to hope for peace Has Trump kept his promises on the military? Some analysts say the sharp, fast reduction of troops would weaken the Afghan government's ability to deal with a resurgent Taliban. ""The US is only going to be able to focus on counter-terrorism operation - it's really going to have to cut back its train, advise and assist mission which means the Afghan government is going to feel the brunt of this,"" said Seth Jones, senior adviser at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. This video can not be played ""The violence must come down"" says US General Miller But at least one Democratic politician supported President Trump's move. Adam Smith - the chair of the House Armed Services Committee - said it was ""the right policy decision"". ""While the history of conflict in the region is complex and predates our direct involvement, after nearly 20 years of armed conflict, Americans and Afghans alike are ready for the violence to end,"" he wrote in a statement. People in Afghanistan are desperate for an end to war - but many analysts fear the Afghan army is not strong enough to fight on its own if violence continues after foreign troops have left.

"British Airways is to launch a voluntary Covid-19 test for passengers travelling to the UK from three US airports. The airline wants to persuade governments that testing travellers will make quarantining unnecessary. American Airlines is also taking part in the trial, which followsa similar effort by United Airlines. The government is looking at how testing can reduce the time travellers to the UK need to self-isolate. British Airways owner IAG has long criticised the 14-day quarantine imposed on arrivals, saying it deters people from flying and damages airlines. It is also trying to convince the US government to open its borders to travellers from the UK, who have been barred since March. The trial begins on 25 November and will be free to eligible customers on three flights: American Airlines flight AA50 from Dallas Fort Worth to Heathrow British Airways flight BA268 from Los Angeles to Heathrow And British Airways flight BA114 from New York John F. Kennedy to Heathrow. Customers will be tested 72 hours before their trip, as well as during and after travelling. If they test positive before travelling, they will have to reschedule or cancel their flight, but will be able to rebook at a later date without a fee.

Altogether there are597 cases across the health board's hospitals, an increase on last week.,external Deaths overall in Wales were a third above average in the week to 6 November, according to the ONS. So-called excess deaths - a key indicator of how the pandemic is progressing - shows there were 207 deaths more than the five-year average. This is 33% higher than average, which is the highest proportion in England and Wales after north west England for the latest week. Deaths involving Covid-19 were up 45 compared to the number registered the week before. There were 62 deaths registered across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area involving coronavirus - including 53 in hospital. There have been127 deaths from Covid-19 infections caught in hospital outbreaksup to last week. There were also 49 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, 24 in Swansea Bay, 12 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 12 in Cardiff and Vale. There were five deaths in Hywel Dda and two hospital deaths involving Powys residents. The figures show: The total number of Covid deaths up to and registered by 6 November was 3,050 When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, there was a total of 3,119 deaths Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) with 433 deaths has now overtaken Cardiff (430) with the largest number of deaths There were 23 deaths involving confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in care homes in the latest week - the highest number in five months RCT's death rate - when population size is taken into consideration - is the third highest across England and Wales, at 180 deaths per 100,000, while Merthyr Tydfil has now moved into the worst 10 areas. This video can not be played Molly Evans says she lost her best friend when grandmother Iris Davies, 69, died with Covid Iris Davies, 69, from Ynyshir, Rhondda, died recently from Covid-19 and her granddaughter Molly Evans said it was like losing a best friend, describing her as someone who ""loved life and lived her best life"". ""She was the most family-orientated person, the glue of our family - she was also the most outgoing person, a social person before all this happened,"" said Molly, 23. ""We went to watch musicals, she came to watch me at the eisteddfod, at football."" Iris died at the beginning of thefirebreak lockdownafter losing her best friend to coronavirus two months before, so Molly says her grandmother had talked about death. Iris Davies was treated in hospital before she died The family did their best to protect her and take all the right precautions, but Molly believes the geography of the Rhondda community and its close-knit nature brings people closer together, and this may be a factor for its high death rate. ""When it sinks in, it's devastating,"" she said. ""It's hard to accept because I log on to social media and there are people saying 'is Covid real?' ""I've seen her with my own eyes, on a ventilator. Between breaths she was still trying to make a joke of things. She was fighting so much."" Medical statistician Dr Rhian Daniel, of Cardiff University, told BBC Wales' Newyddion programme that more detailed analysis was needed, but the number of public-facing jobs, including care work, as well as low-paid jobs could all play a part in the big differences in mortality between places such as Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr and areas such as Pembrokeshire. ""Chance can play a big role, but there are likely to be more structural reasons - occupation might be an important factor,"" she added.

"Forces in England and Wales can resume issuing Â£10,000 fines for breaches of Covid rules on gatherings of more than 30 people, police chiefs have said. On Friday the NPCC advised forces to temporarily issue a court summons rather than a fixed penalty notice. There were concerns about a potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenged the fixed penalty in court. The National Police Chiefs' Council said this issue had now been addressed. A spokesman said: ""Following discussions with government, the issue we flagged last Friday has been fully addressed, and forces are advised that they can resume issuing Â£10,000 FPNs [fixed penalty notices] where appropriate."" ""People found to be in breach of the regulations relating to gatherings of over 30 people will be made fully aware of their options when faced with a Â£10k FPN, to ensure fairness. ""The option of summons will remain available to officers, as it always has been, should the unique circumstances of a case mean that this is the most appropriate course of action. However, the vast majority of cases can be dealt with by way of FPN."" When fines go to court they are means-tested against a person's income - meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. Warning over tough fines as new lockdown begins What are the lockdown rules where you live? In a statement earlier on Tuesday, a government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we have a strong deterrent. We are working with forces to ensure people are fully aware of their options when faced with a fixed penalty notice. ""If someone chooses not to pay their fixed penalty notice, the matter may be considered by a court and the individual could be subject to a criminal conviction."" The NPCC said it had previously advised temporarily suspending the use of fixed penalty notices ""because of a potential disparity between those who opt to pay the FPN and those who see their case reach the court where the FPN would be means tested against personal income"". West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson had previously asked ministers for ""urgent clarity"" on the issue, and accused the government of failing to provide the police with ""workable Covid legislation"". In a letter to the policing minister Kit Malthouse, Labour's Mr Jamieson said: ""I feel thoroughly embarrassed that I have been personally supporting the government's actions, which, at best, are questionable.""

"Patients at the University Hospital of Wales will take part in a clinical trial Mouthwash can kill coronavirus within 30 seconds of being exposed to it in a lab, a scientific study indicates. Scientists at Cardiff University found there were ""promising signs"" that over-the-counter mouthwashes may help to destroy the virus. The report,externalcomes ahead of a clinical trial on Covid-19 on patients at the University Hospital of Wales. Dr Nick Claydon said the study could lead to mouthwash becoming an important part of people's routines. While the research suggests use of mouthwash may help kill the virus in saliva, there is not evidence it could be used as a treatment for coronavirus, as it will not reach the the respiratory tract or the lungs. Dr Claydon, a specialist periodontologist, said: ""If these positive results are reflected in Cardiff University's clinical trial, CPC-based mouthwashes... could become an important addition to people's routine, together with hand washing, physical distancing and wearing masks, both now and in the future."" How many deaths have there been? Covid-19 in Wales: What do the stats tell us? Do we ever follow the science? The university report states that mouthwashes containing at least 0.07% cetypyridinium chloride (CPC) showed ""promising signs"" of being able to eradicate the virus when exposed to the virus in a lab. While the report is yet to be peer reviewed, it supports another recent study which found CPC-based mouthwashes are effective in reducing viral load. Dr Richard Stanton, lead author on the study, said: ""This study adds to the emerging literature that several commonly-available mouthwashes designed to fight gum disease can also inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (and other related coronaviruses) when tested in the laboratory under conditions that are designed to mimic the oral/nasal cavity in a test tube. ""This study is not yet peer reviewed and published which means it has not yet been scrutinised by other scientists as is the usual process with academic research. It has now been submitted for publication in a journal. ""People should continue to follow the preventive measures issued by the UK government, including washing hands frequently and maintaining social distance."" Cardiff University scientists have stressed that people should continue to follow official advice when it comes to trying to prevent the spread of coronavirus A clinical trial will look at whether it helps to reduce levels of the virus in the saliva of Covid-19 patients at the hospital in Cardiff, with results expected early next year. Prof David Thomas, from the university, said the initial results were encouraging, but the clinical trial would not produce evidence of how to prevent transmission between patients. ""Whilst these mouthwashes very effectively eradicate the virus in the laboratory, we need to see if they work in patients and this is the point of our ongoing clinical study,"" he said. ""The ongoing clinical study will, however, show us how long any effects last, following a single administration of the mouthwash in patients with Covid-19.""We need to understand if the effect of over-the-counter mouthwashes on the Covid-19 virus achieved in the laboratory can be reproduced in patients.""

"Owen and Bredge Ward's son said his parents ""were always together"" Tributes have been paid to a couple who died 12 hours apart after contracting Covid-19. Owen and Bredge Ward, who were both 69, passed away in hospital on Monday. Last week, their family had hoped Mr and Mrs Ward, from Strabane, County Tyrone, were recovering from Covid-19. Instead, they are now preparing for their funeral on Wednesday. Their son, Martin, said he was in ""complete shock"" and urged people to adhere to public health guidance. Martin, who is one of six children, held his father's hand as he died, while his siblings were with his mother at the funeral home. He sais his parents ""doted"" on their nine grandchildren and, sadly, they will never get to meet their 10th grandchild. Mr and Mr Ward enjoyed spending time with their grandchildren before the coronavirus pandemic ""We can't have a proper wake, hear all the stories that people would be talking about,"" Martin, a nurse at University College Hospital Galway, told BBC News NI. ""We can't do that because of Covid-19 and all the restrictions, which need to be in place."" He said his mother's condition started to improve last week, but then his father ""went downhill"" and was put into a coma. ""This is what the disease does - it can be mild or it can devastate lives,"" he said. ""Within hours, my mum, who was improving, just went downhill. Maybe it was the shock. ""Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse. ""She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too. ""Even though they were sedated and had pain relief and loving care from the staff at Altnagelvin Hospital, both of them just completely collapsed within a couple of hours and that's just how it is. ""It's the hurt and suffering that this virus can cause."" Martin, who lives in Galway, in the Republic of Ireland, with his young family, said Covid-19 guidance should be the same on both sides of the border. Martin Ward has urged people to follow the public health guidelines following his parents' death ""It's a cross-border thing,"" he said. ""We live on an island and we can't separate each jurisdiction because it impacts upon all of us. It impacts on communities on both sides of the border. ""The only thing I want to say to people north and south of the border is to think about other people. ""We knew from February or March what could happen and people have to take on board that this can cause a hell of a lot of harm to people's families. ""The economic aspect is terribly damaging too, so we have to try to limit the spread and adhere to the guidelines, social distancing where you can and when you can't, put on a face mask. ""Treat everyone the same - with respect and as if they are one of your family - so you can minimise the harm to others.""

"This video can not be played Anita offers to sell a stolen child for 80,000 Kenyan shillings Kenya's government has ordered an investigation into the theft and sale of babies following a BBC investigation into the black market trade. The announcement came after BBC Africa Eye revealed children were stolen to order from a Nairobi public hospital. A hospital official used legitimate paperwork to take custody of a two-week-old boy before selling him directly to an undercover reporter. A government minister said the culprits would face the ""full force of the law"". Addressing a packed press conference in Nairobi, Labour and Social Protection Minister Simon Chelugui said the sellers and buyers were equally culpable. Flanked by top police officials, Mr Chelugui promised a thorough investigation. The investigation Buying a baby on Nairobi's black market The baby stealers,external The investigation by BBC Africa Eye uncovered a trade in children stolen from vulnerable mothers living on the street, as well as the existence of illegal clinics dotted around Nairobi where babies are sold for as little as Â£300 ($400). The investigation also revealed corruption at Mama Lucy Kibaki, a public hospital in Nairobi. Fred Leparan, a clinical social worker at the hospital, facilitated the sale of an abandoned two-week-old baby boy to undercover reporters, later accepting 300,000 shillings (Â£2,000) in cash. Both Mr Leparan and Mama Lucy Kibaki hospital declined requests to comment on the investigation's findings. Speaking at the press conference on Tuesday, the labour minister, Mr Chelugui, also acknowledged that improvements to some of Kenya's child protection services were needed. There are no reliable statistics on child trafficking in the East African state, but a non-governmental organisation, Missing Child Kenya, said it had been involved in nearly 600 cases in the past three years.

"Forces in England and Wales can resume issuing Â£10,000 fines for breaches of Covid rules on gatherings of more than 30 people, police chiefs have said. On Friday the NPCC advised forces to temporarily issue a court summons rather than a fixed penalty notice. There were concerns about a potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenged the fixed penalty in court. The National Police Chiefs' Council said this issue had now been addressed. A spokesman said: ""Following discussions with government, the issue we flagged last Friday has been fully addressed, and forces are advised that they can resume issuing Â£10,000 FPNs [fixed penalty notices] where appropriate."" ""People found to be in breach of the regulations relating to gatherings of over 30 people will be made fully aware of their options when faced with a Â£10k FPN, to ensure fairness. ""The option of summons will remain available to officers, as it always has been, should the unique circumstances of a case mean that this is the most appropriate course of action. However, the vast majority of cases can be dealt with by way of FPN."" When fines go to court they are means-tested against a person's income - meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. Warning over tough fines as new lockdown begins What are the lockdown rules where you live? In a statement earlier on Tuesday, a government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we have a strong deterrent. We are working with forces to ensure people are fully aware of their options when faced with a fixed penalty notice. ""If someone chooses not to pay their fixed penalty notice, the matter may be considered by a court and the individual could be subject to a criminal conviction."" The NPCC said it had previously advised temporarily suspending the use of fixed penalty notices ""because of a potential disparity between those who opt to pay the FPN and those who see their case reach the court where the FPN would be means tested against personal income"". West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson had previously asked ministers for ""urgent clarity"" on the issue, and accused the government of failing to provide the police with ""workable Covid legislation"". In a letter to the policing minister Kit Malthouse, Labour's Mr Jamieson said: ""I feel thoroughly embarrassed that I have been personally supporting the government's actions, which, at best, are questionable.""

"Animal charities have warned against ""extremely irresponsible"" breeders selling kittens and puppies on Facebook, as demand increases over lockdown. Facebook guidelines state animals cannot be sold between private individuals. But a BBC investigation has revealed puppies and kittens are being advertised through the platform. Charities warned the animals may be sick, too young or it could be a scam. The RSPCA called these sellers ""extremely irresponsible"". ""We know that there are lots of unscrupulous breeders and sellers out there who exploit social media and classified websites in order to sell puppies and kittens without arousing suspicion,"" a spokesperson said. People should consider adopting from a rescue centre first, or follow its advice on buyingdogs,externalandcats,external- including seeing where the animal was bred, the charity added. In closed Facebook groups, some pedigree breeds were advertised for over Â£1,000. One public post advertised ""long-haired doll-face Persian"" kittens as ""ready to go"" and asking interested buyers to get in touch. Some kittens and puppies were also offered for ""worldwide delivery"". One post, selling ragdoll kittens, specified gloves and a mask must be worn on collection, due to Covid-19 restrictions. ""A Â£150 deposit (non-refundable) will secure the kitten, updated pics until collection day,"" it added. Facebook said it was investigating examples the BBC had sent, and encouraged users to report any posts they saw. ""We do not allow the sale of animals on Facebook including in private groups, and when we find this type content we take it down,"" a spokesperson added. This comes as coronavirus lockdown has led to an increased demand for new pets. In April, The Kennel Club, one of the UK's biggest dog welfare organisations saidsearches for puppies on its website had doubledbetween February and March as the restrictions were announced. Prices of kittens and puppies sold online have risen into the thousands. Butscam reporting service Action Fraudsaid con artists were advertising online with pictures of pets to buy, and asking for a deposit even though they had none to sell. Victims had lost more than Â£280,000 in two months, it said. Meanwhile, charities including Battersea Dogs Home, Cats Protection and the RSPCA have also warned against people rushing into getting a new pet. This video can not be played Meet the animals abandoned during lockdown There are concerns that as life returns to normal and people spend less time at home, pets will be abandoned. ""The pandemic has created the ideal conditions for unscrupulous pet sellers to thrive, as they appear to have a credible reason for not allowing buyers to view the kitten with their mother first,"" Cats Protection's head of advocacy, Jacqui Cuff, said. ""Sadly, we fear there are many underage kittens being sold on Facebook by vendors who are impatient to make a quick profit. These kittens can go on to have serious, life-threatening illnesses or be so poorly socialised that they're not suitable as pets."" Many new kittens or puppies come from farms, in inhumane conditions, which is why its important to view the animal with its mother. Puppies or kittens should be seen with their mother before buying (library photo) One of the challenges for Facebook was that this activity happened in closed groups and it relied on individual users to report it, the Pet Advertising Advisory Group said. It has published alist of minimum standards,externalfor websites that sell animals - including automated removal of adverts with blacklisted words, banning vendors who post illegal adverts and including a recent photograph of the animal. The group said it had met Facebook to discuss the ""illegal and inappropriate adverts"" but as the platform does not filter posts before they are published, ""it is unlikely that Facebook could or would"" apply the same standards.

"The government is to invest Â£4bn in creating 250,000 new green jobs as part of its plan to hit net zero emissions. It also aims to equip a generation of workers with new green skills. The government will release its long-awaited 10-point plan to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050 later on Tuesday. It will emphasise the potential jobs that the so-called green industrial revolution could bring to regions that have suffered industrial decline. The BBC can confirm that technology to capture and store carbon created in industrial processes will receive substantial government investment. Give us green post-Covid recovery, urges CBI boss The plan will also include investment in offshore wind as already announced by the prime minister at the Conservative Party conference. Residential heating is one of the biggest emitters of carbon and there will be government grants towards making homes more energy efficient - which again it hopes will create thousands of new jobs. It is thought the final plan will also include investments in hydrogen power and there may be a commitment to new nuclear energy. In October, the BBC learned that the government wasclose to giving the green light to a new nuclear power stationat Sizewell in Suffolk. It comes after the collapse of nuclear projects in Anglesey and Cumbria after Japanese firms Hitachi and Toshiba pulled out. The figure of Â£4bn will be considered by many as a small down-payment on a transformation that the Committee on Climate Changes estimates will cost Â£1 trillion over the next 30 years. The full 10-point plan will be published tonight at 22:30 ahead of a press conference and round table with key stakeholders on Wednesday. There has also been speculation that a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be brought forward to 2030 - five years earlier than previously planned. Hybrid vehicles, which have petrol or diesel engines but also use electric power, will have a stay of execution until 2035. Bentley reveals plan to go fully electric by 2030 Plans for a ban on the sale of traditional petrol and diesel cars were first announced in 2017, as part of a strategy to clean up city air. It was meant to take effect in 2040. In February, that target was brought forward to 2035, as the government sought to burnish its environmental credentials ahead of a now-postponed UN climate summit in Glasgow, but it now looks set to be revised again. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, believes that meeting the government's target will require serious support for the industry.

"Travel rules have been relaxed for people arriving in England to work on poultry farms to ensure there is enough turkey available for Christmas dinners. From 04:00 on Tuesday, seasonal workers from abroad can start work straight away during their 14-day quarantine. The transport secretary said the new measures will ensure food producers can ""keep up with the Christmas demand"". Industry groups had previously warned of turkey shortages without enough skilled workers to process the meat. Under the new rules, seasonal staff must still self-isolate from the rest of the public for the first 14 days. To avoid any potential spread of coronavirus, they also have to form ""cohorts"", or live and work with a group of the same workers during their time in England. They will not be allowed to mix with other employees. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""Christmas dinner is the highlight of the year for many families and this year it will be particularly significant."" He added that the new measures would support businesses who ""have faced unprecedented challenges from coronavirus"". The boss of the British Poultry Council (BPC) had urged the government to exempt seasonal workers from quarantine rules in October. Richard Griffiths warnedthat 1,000 workers from the European Union were needed to stop Christmas supply from collapsing. On Tuesday, he said he hoped that the new exemption would be ""helpful"" in the run-up to Christmas. ""Industry is determined to deliver Christmas to households across the nation. If the exemption helps us deliver a fantastic Christmas and helps our smaller seasonal producers out, then it can only be a good thing."" Shortage of poultry workers could hit Christmas dinner Christmas curbs fears hit Scotland's turkey farms Christmas cards 'even more poignant' this year About 5,500 seasonal workers arrive on farms in England each year to help during the festive period, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The type of skills turkey production requires are not available among UK workers, the BPC has previously said. Workers need to have been trained specifically in Watok - Welfare of Animals at Time of Killing - and licensed to kill or slaughter animals, which means holding a certificate of competence from the Food Standards Agency. ""The UK meat industry needs access to reliable skilled workers wherever they come from in order to keep the flow of food from our farms to our plates,"" said Tony Goodger of the Association of Independent Meat Suppliers. He added: ""What we need now is a clear steer that the system will be in place much earlier in 2021 should we need it."" This year, all non-UK seasonal poultry workers are required to leave England by 31 December, at which point the exemption will no longer be in force.

"Jeremy Corbyn was suspended by the Labour Party in October Labour's ruling body is meeting to discuss Jeremy Corbyn's suspension. Last month, a report from the UK's human rights watchdog (EHRC) said the party broke the law by failing to stamp out anti-Jewish racism in the party. Responding to the report, the former leader said the scale of anti-Semitism had been ""dramatically overstated"" by his opponents, andhe was suspended. Sir Keir Starmer said those who think the issue had been ""exaggerated"" should ""be nowhere near the Labour Party"". However, the decision to suspend Mr Corbyn was taken by the party's General Secretary David Evans, not the new leader. A panel made up of members from the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) is now meeting to decide whether to take further disciplinary action or to lift his suspension. Ahead of the meeting on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn - who has been a member of the party for 54 years - released a statement on Facebook, saying concerns over anti-Semitism within Labour are ""neither exaggerated nor overstated"". But the Board of Deputies of British Jews said their community did not accept ""this pathetic non-apology"". Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from the Labour Party? What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Rules brought in under Mr Corbyn mean NEC panels - made up of five members, advised by a barrister - look specifically at anti-Semitism cases on a monthly basis. The can decide to either: Take no further action Issue a reminder of values - which is a less formal sanction Issue a reminder of conduct - which is closer to a formal warning Rule for a time-limited suspension Rule for an expulsion The panel can also refer any cases to the National Constitutional Committee, which is an elected body in the Labour Party that hears and decides on complaints. The five members of Labour's ruling national executive who will decide Jeremy Corbyn's political fate have a tricky task. Some of the former Labour leader's colleagues on the left of the party wanted him to apologise for his remarks, feeling this was the easiest route to having his suspension lifted. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a ""clarification"", making it clear he wasn't belittling concerns over anti-Semitism, and that he was referring to the scale of the problem being overstated, not its seriousness. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has called this a ""pathetic non-apology"", so if he is reinstated, the party can expect the row over anti-Semitism to reignite. If, however, further disciplinary action is taken, a section of the left will regard that as a declaration of civil war - something which those closest to Mr Corbyn hope to avoid. After thedamning EHRC reportLabour wants to move on from the toxic issue of anti-Semitism - but is already finding that is easier said than done. Mr Corbyn - who led the party for almost five years - said he had already given a statement to Labour to ""clear up any confusion"" about what he had meant when he responded to the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's report. He said the report's release ""should have been a moment for the Labour Party to come together in a determination to address the shortcomings of the past and work as one to root out anti-Semitism in our own ranks and wider society"". Mr Corbyn, who is still an MP despite his suspension from the party, said it was ""not his intention"" to say anti-Jewish racism should be tolerated, and he ""regrets the pain this issue has caused the Jewish community"". His statement added: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" But the Board of Deputies of British Jews condemned the statement and called for action from Labour. President of the organisation, Marie van der Zyl, added: ""If the party wants to show it is serious about tackling anti-Jewish racism, it will consign this statement, just like the culture which led to the EHRC's damning findings, to the dustbin of history. ""To do otherwise would be a failure of leadership which would risk the party slipping backwards."" Asked about the statement, a Labour Party spokesman said they would not ""give a running commentary on an individual case"". This video can not be played In comments before his suspension from Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said anti-Semitism complaints numbers were ""exaggerated"" Labour has been plagued by allegations of anti-Jewish racism by some of its supporters since 2016, mostly on social media. Anti-Semitic abuse is against the law and in May last year the EHRC - which polices human rights and equalities in the UK - launched an investigation into Labour's handling of complaints about the behaviour of some of its supporters. When it published its report in October, the Commission put some of the blame on ""serious failings"" under Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party. But Labour said it was his reaction to the report that led to his suspension, rather its findings. This video can not be played Kier Starmer: ""An ability to recognise the hurt, draw a line and move on"" Many Labour MPs stood by the decision to suspend Mr Corbyn, including Margaret Hodge, parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement. But his allies in the Commons, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, called for the decision to be reversed. On his Facebook post, the former leader said: ""I hope this matter is resolved as quickly as possible, so that the party can work together to root out anti-Semitism and unite to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government.""

"This video can not be played The first minister says level 4 restrictions are 'intended to be short and sharp' More than two million people are to be placed under Scotland's toughest Covid lockdown restrictions from Friday. The move will see level four rules imposed in 11 council areas across western and central Scotland, including Glasgow. It will mean non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms will have to close, although schools will still be open. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. They will be imposed from 18:00 on Friday in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian will also move to level four - with about 2.3 million people affected across the 11 local authority areas. Live updates on the Covid levels announcement Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? However, East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. Ms Sturgeon also said the existing advice for people in level three or four not to travel outside their own council area except for ""certain essential purposes"" will become law from Friday. This will also mean that people living elsewhere in Scotland must not travel to level three or level four areas, except for essential purposes, and there must be no non-essential travel between Scotland and other parts of the UK. The first minister said there were grounds for ""continued and significant concern"" about levels of the virus in all of the council areas that would be moving to the highest tier of restrictions. She added: ""The infection rate in all of these areas remains stubbornly and worryingly high. ""At these levels, we simply do not have the assurance we need that hospital and ICU services will be able to cope as we go deeper into winter."" You must not visit other people's homes, but can still meet outdoors with up to six people from two households People should stay at or close to home as much as possible Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut But schools will remain open The first minister said people in level four areas should only be going out and about during the three-week period that the restrictions are in place for a limited number of reasons. These include childcare, caring for someone who is vulnerable, exercise or shopping for essential goods. In the seven days up to Friday, Scotland as a whole had just over 140 new cases of Covid per 100,000 people. Ms Sturgeon said all of the areas moving to level four were above that rate - ranging from West Lothian, which saw 158 cases per 100,000, to Glasgow with 277. Restaurants across the Level Four areas will have to shut completely from Friday She said the ""short, sharp"" move to level four would allow restrictions in the affected areas to be eased ""much more quickly"" than they would be if they remained in level three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in the same level as they currently are, although Ms Sturgeon said she hoped that Argyll and Bute could soon move from level two to level one. And she said that people from level one areas will be able to meet outdoors with up to eight people from a maximum of three households from Thursday, rather than the current six people from two households. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And restrictions, including the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants, arein place across Northern Ireland until 26 November. Business leaders had warned ahead of Ms Sturgeon's announcement that the highest tier of restrictions would have a ""severe"" impact on many retailers during the crucial Christmas trading period, and have questioned the scientific evidence for closing many businesses down. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents some of the country's biggest pub and restaurant chains, said the fact that Covid cases in many Level Three areas had not fallen despite licensed premises largely being closed showed that household transmission was the biggest driver of the virus. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce described the news as ""devastating"" and called for more emphasis on mass testing to avoid ""a miserable cycle of lockdowns"" through winter. The EIS teaching union, which is already surveying its members on whether they would consider striking over safety concerns, called for schools in Level Four areas to now move to either blended or remote learning. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said more than 700 Covid patients are in its hospitals and the number has been ""increasing steadily"" in recent weeks. Chief executive Jane Grant said: ""Our staff and services are under the same levels of pressure as they were at the peak of the first Covid wave so we hope these new restrictions will help us to continue to provide vital services and support to our staff, patients and their loved ones."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson gave a cautious welcome to the move on the condition that it allowed a more general easing of restrictions over the festive period. She added: ""However, as has happened on several occasions before, it would be deeply regrettable if these restrictions were to be stretched any further, leaving people in limbo before Christmas and businesses unable to plan"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was a ""stark difference"" between levels three and four, and called on the Scottish government to set out the ""hard data"" that the decisions had been based on. And he questioned why areas such as North and South Lanarkshire had been included at a time when their transmission rates were falling. Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said restrictions were being ""ratcheted up in parts of the country where the number of cases is going down"" and said the government was ""shutting down sectors without clear evidence they are the cause of the spread"".

"Labour has readmitted former leader Jeremy Corbyn as a member following his suspension last month. He was punished after saying the scale of anti-Semitism in the party had been ""overstated"", in response to a damning report by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission. Mr Corbyn issued a statement earlier saying he regretted any ""pain"" caused. But current leader Sir Keir Starmer maintained Mr Corbyn's initial reaction to the report had been ""wrong"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said a decision had not yet been taken on whether to restore the Labour whip to Mr Corbyn, which would allow him to sit once more as one of its MPs. Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour? A panel made up of members of the party's National Executive Committee met on Tuesday to decide whether to take further disciplinary action against him or to lift the suspension. After it decided to readmit Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir tweeted that it had been a ""painful day for the Jewish community and those Labour members who have fought so hard to tackle anti-Semitism"". He added: ""Jeremy Corbyn's statement in response to the EHRC report was wrong and completely distracted from a report that identified unlawful conduct in our tackling of racism within the Labour Party. This should shame us all."" When Labour acted swiftly and decisively to suspend Jeremy Corbyn, it was seen as a signal the party wanted to distance itself from a toxic period in its recent past. Sir Keir Starmer said he hadn't instigated the action but he supported it. But whatever decision was reached on Tuesday, criticism would have followed. Mr Corbyn didn't apologise for suggesting the scale of anti-Semitism had been overstated by political opponents, which was the reason for his suspension. He simply clarified what he had meant. So reinstating him was bound to attract criticism from those cheered by his suspension. Not to have reinstated him, however, would most likely have fuelled a factional war between those supportive of the Starmer leadership and those - including some union leaders - who remain close to Mr Corbyn. Sir Keir reiterated his commitment to an independent complaints process in the New Year - an Equality and Human Rights Commission recommendation. But putting Labour under fresh leadership hasn't silenced or banished those still supportive of the old leadership. And the line Sir Keir wants to draw under the anti-Semitism rows hasn't been fully drawn. In a statement earlier on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn - who is currently an independent MP - said it was ""not his intention"" to say anti-Jewish racism should be tolerated, and that he regretted the ""pain"" caused. His statement added: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" It is not yet clear whether Mr Corbyn will face further sanctions from the party. Its general secretary, David Evans, took the decision to suspend him in October, although Sir Keir endorsed it. The ECHR's report found Labour had breached the Equalities Act over its handling of complaints of anti-Semitism during Mr Corbyn's time in charge. Labour said Mr Corbyn had been suspended ""for a failure to retract"" his words. Following his readmission, the Islington North MP said: ""I hope this matter is resolved as quickly as possible, so that the party can work together to root out anti-Semitism and unite to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government."" But the Jewish Labour Movement called the decision to readmit Mr Corbyn ""extraordinary"", adding: ""After his failure of leadership to tackle anti-Semitism, so clearly set out in the EHRC's report, any reasonable and fair-minded observer would see Jeremy Corbyn's statement today as insincere and wholly inadequate."" Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ""What message does this send? Zero tolerance either means zero tolerance or it's meaningless."" The co-chairman of the Conservative Party, MP Amanda Milling, has written to Sir Keir, saying: ""You have claimed that Labour is 'under new leadership', but now is the moment to prove it - Mr Corbyn should be expelled permanently."" Former Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman, who quit the party over anti-Semitism concerns last year, said the decision was a ""backward step"". ""What Keir Starmer and the chief whip should do now is to refuse to restore the whip to Jeremy Corbyn, in that way they can show that they are determinedâ¦ to rid the party of this dreadful stain,"" she told BBC Newsnight. However, Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Mr Corbyn, called the reinstatement a ""correct, fair and unifying decision"". He said Labour had to ""move forward"" in implementing the EHRC's recommendations and ""redouble our efforts to inspire voters"" about Sir Keir's policies, acting as a ""unified and strong"" party. And Jenny Manson, co-chairman of pro-Corbyn group Jewish Voice for Labour, told BBC Newsnight that ""an awful lot of us are very happy he (Mr Corbyn) is back in the party"" and would be ""very sad indeed"" if the whip is taken away from him.

"From Boxing Day the whole of mainland Scotland will be in the country's toughest tier of restrictions for at least three weeks. So what can you  do - and not do - in level four? Is your area in the toughest level? People should not be meeting in each others houses. However, six adults from two separate households can meet in a public place. Children under 12 do not count towards that total. Exceptions to the ban include another household providing care and support to a ""vulnerable person"". The extended household rule applies in level four. This allows people who live alone - or who are a single adult with children under 18 - being considered part of another household to reduce loneliness and isolation. Where parents do not live in the same household, children can move between their parents' homes. Up to two households - totalling no more than six - can meet in a private garden or a public place like a park. Children under 12 do not count toward that number and they also do not need to maintain social distancing. Young people aged between 12 and 17 can meet up in groups of up to six outdoors. These groups are not subject to the two household limit but physical distancing is required. If you are meeting in someone's garden you can go inside if you need to use the toilet but should wipe down surfaces you touch with antibacterial wipes and use only freshly laundered or paper towels. Restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars will be closed. Takeaways can operate as normal with face coverings and physical distancing rules being followed. Hotels and other accommodation providers can serve food up to 10pm to guests. Room service, including alcohol, is allowed. All holiday accommodation is closed to tourists. Hotels, B&Bs and self-catering can remain open for essential customers - for example anyone who is staying for essential work purposes. Only essential retail can open providing they follow and have implemented Scottish government guidance to ensure the safety of customers and staff. Click and collect, on-line services and outdoor retail, such as garden centres, outdoor markets and car lots, can also remain open. Services which involve ""close contact"" cannot operate. These include hairdressers; barbers; hair removal and massage therapies. They also include dress-fitting; tattoo and piercing and indoor portrait photography. Indoor sports facilities, including gyms, have to close. You are permitted to meet others outdoors for informal exercise or sport and outdoor gyms can remain open. Outdoor non-contact sports are permitted for all age groups. All leisure and entertainment premises, including cinemas, must be closed. Film and TV production can continue to take place. All public buildings such as libraries have to close, however, library click and collect services can still operate. Churches, mosques, temples and synagogues can remain open subject to two metre distancing and a maximum of 20 worshippers. Wedding ceremonies and civil partnerships, with a maximum of 20 people (including the couple) are allowed - providing the venue is big enough for 2m distancing. Face coverings must be worn except for the couple getting married and the person conducting the service. However, receptions cannot follow a ceremony. Funerals and wakes can take place with a maximum capacity of 20 guests. Education Schools, colleges and universities can remain open. Early learning and childcare can continue to operate. However, informal childcare is only allowed for anyone employed in essential or permitted services. If you want to delve deeper into the Scottish government's level four rules, clickhere,external.

"The number of Covid-19 infections in Scotland has risen, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). TheONS Covid infection survey,externalestimates an average of219,600people were infected on any given day in the week up to 31 December - that's aboutone in 25 people. Figures from theNational Records of Scotland,externalalso show there were81Covid deaths in the week ending 8 January, which is higher than the previous week. A total of16,465people in Scotland have died with Covid since the outbreak began in March 2020. This page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and is updated weekly. The ONS has been carrying out a Covid infection survey of randomly selected households in Scotland since September 2020. Nowmass testing has ended, it has become the best estimate of the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland. The pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals. At the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020, there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with more than 200 being treated in intensive care. Numbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again in the autumn. In January 2021, the number of patients with Covid in hospital went above 2,000. During the Omicron surge in cases in early 2022, the total number of patients with Covid surpassed the 2021 peak. However, the numbers being treated in intensive care are lower than they were early in the pandemic. The first Covid-19 death in Scotlandwas reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020. The spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when deaths remained at a relatively low level. The rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021. The number of deaths in subsequent waves of Covid infections peaked at much lower levels, but deaths are still occurring. There are two ways to count total deaths from Covid-19.The National Records of Scotland (NRS) reports all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. The NRS also publishes data on excess deaths,compared with a five-year average,external. Excess deaths from most causes rose in 2020and in 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.

For example, anadult living on their own,externalin England can form a bubble with another household of any size. Prof Ferguson toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""You could think of allowing three or four households to bubble
together for a week but not contact anybody else, which would give more
opportunity to see loved ones but not a free for all. ""And that, I mean
modelling, would suggest increases risk somewhat but in a controllable way.â Ferguson's modelling was used by the government before the lockdown in March. The governments from the four nations have held talks about taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. According to our audience research, this graphic produced by the World Health Organization showing coronavirus symptoms was one of the most shared posts on Facebook
on Monday. It's a good reminder of what the more serious symptoms are, as well as the less common ones, as new Covid cases are on the rise in many parts of the world.

centre of a row about government aid for Polish performers hit by the pandemic. The fund worth 400m zloty (Â£80m) has now been frozen, after complaints
that the right-wing nationalist government was favouring disco polo stars who
are already well off. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said the aid issue had become
politicised. Defending the Cultural Support Fund (FWK), he tweeted that âthe recipients
of support were not determined by sympathies, but by an algorithm showing who had lost
income as a result of the pandemicâ. But the funding â desperately needed by many artists whose
income has dried up â is now under review. The website Notes from Poland names several disco polo stars
who each got more than 500,000 zloty (Â£100,000). Disco polo - heavy on drum machines and synthesisers - is popular at Polish weddings, with its simple tunes and lyrics. Composer Piotr Rubik was among the critics, mocking the fund
by singing: âIâll form a disco polo band and get two million.â Adam Murray has been reminiscing about times he's had at Bramall Lane Radio 1 DJ Jordan North faced his fear of snakes on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here by chanting about his ""happy place"" - Burnley FC's Turf Moor stadium. While there were plenty of jokes to be had (including whether it was a happier place for Burnley fans or away teams) it also got fans thinking about their own home grounds, which they're missing during the pandemic. We've been talking to some of them about their memories. They include Adam Murray, who says being held up by his dad at Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's ground, is one of his first memories. ""When it's something you've had around you all your life, it's generally a happy place - win, lose or draw, it's about the family time and the time with your friends,"" he says.

Martin, one of their six children, held his father's hand as he died and said he was in ""complete shock"". He said his parents ""were always together"" and ""doted"" on their nine grandchildren. He said his mother's condition started to improve last week, but then his father ""went downhill"" and was put into a coma. ""Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse. ""She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too.""

London Zoo had to close its doors to the public for the second time during England's four-week November lockdown.  Pfizer has launched a pilot delivery programme
for its Covid-19 vaccine in four US states. Last week Pfizer announced its vaccine had been90% effective in preventing the illness during trials. However the vaccine must be shipped and stored
at -70C (-94F) to remain effective, posing a significant logistical challenge for its distribution. Pfizer will run the pilot delivery programme
in Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico and Tennessee. The varied size of the states
will allow the company to see how the vaccine can reach everyone in those
areas. âWe are hopeful that results from this vaccine
delivery pilot will serve as the model for other US states and international
governments, as they prepare to implement effective Covid-19 vaccine programmes,â
the company said in a statement. Pfizer says it hopes to have enough safety data
from the trials by next week to apply for emergency use authorisation. We usually bring you the latest coronavirus figures from the UK around this time. But today, the government figures aren't going to be available until after 18:00 due to ""technical difficulties"", accordingto a message on the site,external. We will updateour own data pagewhen we have those figures. Parts of England haverecorded thousands of additional coronavirus casesafter the government changed its recording methods. Cases were assigned to the address in a patient's NHS records, but this did not account for those who have recently moved, such as students relocating for university. Officials say the change had not affected decisions about local or national lockdown restrictions. Newcastle saw cases rise by more than a quarter, followed by York and Lincoln. Richmondshire, in North Yorkshire, had the highest proportion of cases re-allocated away from the area. Of the area's 677 cases between 1 September and 15 November, 124 were placed elsewhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China, where the virus started, is one of the few
countries where life is back to a version of normal, post-coronavirus. No new domestic symptomatic or asymptomatic cases have been
detected in the last 24 hours. But there are growing concerns in the country
that Covid-19 may enter China via imported frozen goods. A number of localised outbreaks earlier in the year in cities like Beijing and Qingdao were linked to handlers of imported frozen products,external, and China has been increasingly warning that cold-chain goods (those perishable goods transported at low temperatures) pose a serious threat to communities. On Monday, Chinaâs customs agency said it had âstepped up
effortsâ to prevent the virus from entering China by contacting all of the 109
countries that export cold-chain goods to the country.It also said it had suspended receiving goods from some 99 companies in 20 countries that export to China,external. However, New Zealandâs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has
questioned claims that the coronavirus was found on beef exports from New
Zealand, given the country has also returned to a version of normal. She said
she had been advised New Zealand exports were stored with products from
Argentina that had tested positive, following reports New Zealand goods had
tested positive in the Chinese city of Jinan. âWe are confident our products are not exported
with Covid on them, given our status as being essentially Covid-19 free,â she told a press conference on Monday. A spokesperson from the NZ Ministry of
Foreign Affairs added: âNew Zealand has not been informed of this officially by the
Chinese authorities. âNew Zealand officials are working now to
ascertain the origin and veracity of these reports.â Some of the major dates in Scotland's virus response:  Police chiefs have suspended the use of Â£10,000 fines for those who breach coronavirus rules on large gatherings. It comes amid concerns over potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenge the fees in court. When fines go to court they are means-tested, meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. The National Police Chief's Council (NPCC) said it was working ""urgently"" with the government over the issue. Read more here Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The days are growing cold, the first snow is
falling on the ski slopes, and Swiss minds are turning to their favourite dish.
Nothing is more comforting than sitting round the table with good friends,
sharing a cheese fondue. But in these troubled Covid times, some are
questioning the fondue ritual: spearing a piece of bread, dipping it in that
communal pot of bubbling cheese, and transferring it straight to your mouth. No
self-respecting Swiss wants to endure a winter without fondue â but is it safe? Arnaud Favre, who organizes the annual fondue
festival, is sure it is. âLots of people have been worrying about
whether itâs OK to eat fondue, with your friends, or even with people you donât
know â the answer is, thereâs really nothing to fear. The Covid virus dies
above 50 degrees Centigrade - fondue is cooked at 80 degrees."" Unfortunately for Arnaud, his fondue festival
has been cancelled this year â big crowds of cheese-hungry people are too much
of a risk. Restaurants in many parts of Switzerland are closed too â but a
fondue at home with friends is still allowed, although the ritual is becoming
more flexible. Instead of one fork, fondue fans suggest, have
two, one for dipping, and the other for eating. The advice seems to be working
â as the Swiss brace themselves for this Covid winter, fondue sales are rising. The boss of Moderna, the company behind one of the Covid vaccines whose initial trial results have recently been announced, has warned that long negotiations over purchasing the
new vaccine will slow down deliveries to European countries. Stephane Bancel told AFP news agency that other
nations who have signed deals will get priority. The UK has already signed a
deal with Moderna to supply five million doses from next spring. âIt is clear that with a delay this is not
going to limit the total amount but it is going to slow down delivery,â he
said. Earlier this week, Moderna announced its
vaccine was nearly 95% effective, according to early data. Moderna is planning to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the US in the next few weeks. US country singer Dolly Parton has been credited with helping fundthe successful Moderna vaccine announced on Monday, thanks to a  large financial donation she made earlier this year. Back in April, the country singer announced she was donating $1m (Â£800,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, for coronavirus research. Allow Twitter content?

"Landlords in England are to be held more accountable, the government has said, as part of social housing reforms three years after the Grenfell fire. They include a charter setting out what tenants can expect from a landlord, including to be safe in their home and to know how the landlord is performing in areas like repairs and complaints. The housing secretary says it will give tenants ""a much stronger voice"". But Labour said the reforms ""appear to water down previous proposals"". Housing charity Shelter warned there was a ""chronic shortage of social housing"" and that ""any new dawn for social renters must come with major investment in new homes too"". The proposals are part of a ""fundamental rethink"" on social housing following the Grenfell Tower tragedy. Thefirst phase of the Grenfell inquiryconcluded that cladding put on during a refurbishment fuelled the fire in June 2017, which led to the deaths of 72 people. It is now examining how the tower block blaze could have happened in the first place. 'More powers' for social housing tenants Shortage of affordable homes, report warns 'I've spent 18 years on housing waiting list' The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the Social Housing White Paper had been drafted with the views of those devastated by Grenfell in mind. Ministers say they will ""deliver on the commitment we made to the Grenfell community that never again would the voices of residents go unheard"". The White Paper - a document setting out proposed new laws before they are formalised in a government bill - pledges that complaints to landlords should be dealt with promptly and fairly, and tenants should expect to be treated with respect alongside the backing of a consumer regulator. Alongside these promises, residents have also been told they will have a good quality home and neighbourhood to live in. Ed Daffarn, a Grenfell survivor and member of bereaved families and survivors group Grenfell United, said: ""If this White Paper is going to make a difference, the (social housing) regulator and the ombudsman need to understand the devastating impact bad landlords can and do have on people's lives. ""We have little faith that bad landlords will improve themselves - so the responsibility now lies with the regulator and ombudsman to use their new powers to ensure no residents are ever treated how we were. ""Ultimately it will be for residents themselves to determine if these changes go far enough to making their lives better and homes safer - and creating a lasting legacy for the 72 innocent lives so needlessly lost at Grenfell."" The Social Housing White Paper was born from the shock and grief of Grenfell. The prime minister at the time, Theresa May, told a hushed House of Commons that she would ensure the voice of those living in social housing could never be ignored again. ""Long after the TV cameras have gone, and the world has moved on,"" she said, ""let the legacy of this awful tragedy be that we resolve never to forget these people and instead to gear our policies and our thinking towards making their lives better and bringing them into the political process."" There was to be legislation to ensure her promise would be met. Parliament was told it would be a ""wide-ranging top-to-bottom review of the issues facing the sector"" and the ""most substantial report of its kind for a generation"". But four housing ministers, three housing secretaries and more than three years later, we have only just seen the government's proposals for the first time. Few will argue with the measures to give tenants a greater say and to strengthen their rights. But only last September, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick also referred to how the White Paper would ""boost the supply"" of social housing. There are, however, no firm commitments to increase the number of council houses in England. In the summer, a senior committee of MPs told the government the country needed a net addition of 90,000 social-rented homes a year. Although the White Paper does refer to increasing the supply of social housing (it could hardly fall any lower), its focus is on general affordability, with particular emphasis on what they call ""affordable home ownership"", a product that is out of reach for those on the lowest incomes. For some, this is the great hole in the middle of this White Paper. The prime minister says the proposals will ensure ""social housing tenants are treated with the respect they deserve"", but critics argue there is too little for the 93,000 households in England currently stuck in temporary accommodation, or the estimated 3.8 million people in need of social housing. Mr Jenrick has also announced a consultation on making smoke and carbon monoxide alarms mandatory in all rental properties. He said the reforms would bring ""transformational change"" that would give social housing residents ""a much stronger voice"". ""I want to see social housing tenants empowered by a regulatory regime and a culture of transparency, accountability, decency and public service befitting of the best intentions and deep roots of social housing in this country,"" he added. But Labour's shadow minister for housing and planning, Mike Amesbury, said: ""The government's response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy has been slow at every stage. They were slow to re-house residents, slow to remove deadly cladding, and slow to come forward with social housing reforms. ""Two years late, this White Paper appears to water down previous proposals. The government must do all it can to ensure a disaster like Grenfell can never happen again. That means tackling stigma, putting tenants' voices centre stage, and ensuring the regulator has real teeth. ""Today's proposals contain nothing to help the thousands struggling in the private rented sector, make up for a lost decade of social housing, or tackle the housing crisis."" This video can not be played What is social housing and why do we have it? The Local Government Association (LGA) said it was ""paramount that the voice of all social housing residents is heard"". And Kate Henderson, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said the White Paper was ""an important and welcome milestone in the country's response to the Grenfell Tower tragedy"", adding that ""housing associations have demonstrated willingness to be more accountable and transparent"". Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said the reforms were a ""welcome step in the right direction in the urgent task of protecting social tenants"". But she warned: ""With over a million households already on the social housing waiting list, and many more families potentially facing homelessness as the recession bites, any new regulatory system is being set up to fail unless we build many more social homes."" The White Paper only applies to England as social housing in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been devolved.

"The government is to invest Â£4bn in creating 250,000 new green jobs as part of its plan to hit net zero emissions. It also aims to equip a generation of workers with new green skills. The government will release its long-awaited 10-point plan to make the UK carbon neutral by 2050 later on Tuesday. It will emphasise the potential jobs that the so-called green industrial revolution could bring to regions that have suffered industrial decline. The BBC can confirm that technology to capture and store carbon created in industrial processes will receive substantial government investment. Give us green post-Covid recovery, urges CBI boss The plan will also include investment in offshore wind as already announced by the prime minister at the Conservative Party conference. Residential heating is one of the biggest emitters of carbon and there will be government grants towards making homes more energy efficient - which again it hopes will create thousands of new jobs. It is thought the final plan will also include investments in hydrogen power and there may be a commitment to new nuclear energy. In October, the BBC learned that the government wasclose to giving the green light to a new nuclear power stationat Sizewell in Suffolk. It comes after the collapse of nuclear projects in Anglesey and Cumbria after Japanese firms Hitachi and Toshiba pulled out. The figure of Â£4bn will be considered by many as a small down-payment on a transformation that the Committee on Climate Changes estimates will cost Â£1 trillion over the next 30 years. The full 10-point plan will be published tonight at 22:30 ahead of a press conference and round table with key stakeholders on Wednesday. There has also been speculation that a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be brought forward to 2030 - five years earlier than previously planned. Hybrid vehicles, which have petrol or diesel engines but also use electric power, will have a stay of execution until 2035. Bentley reveals plan to go fully electric by 2030 Plans for a ban on the sale of traditional petrol and diesel cars were first announced in 2017, as part of a strategy to clean up city air. It was meant to take effect in 2040. In February, that target was brought forward to 2035, as the government sought to burnish its environmental credentials ahead of a now-postponed UN climate summit in Glasgow, but it now looks set to be revised again. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders, believes that meeting the government's target will require serious support for the industry.

"Forces in England and Wales can resume issuing Â£10,000 fines for breaches of Covid rules on gatherings of more than 30 people, police chiefs have said. On Friday the NPCC advised forces to temporarily issue a court summons rather than a fixed penalty notice. There were concerns about a potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenged the fixed penalty in court. The National Police Chiefs' Council said this issue had now been addressed. A spokesman said: ""Following discussions with government, the issue we flagged last Friday has been fully addressed, and forces are advised that they can resume issuing Â£10,000 FPNs [fixed penalty notices] where appropriate."" ""People found to be in breach of the regulations relating to gatherings of over 30 people will be made fully aware of their options when faced with a Â£10k FPN, to ensure fairness. ""The option of summons will remain available to officers, as it always has been, should the unique circumstances of a case mean that this is the most appropriate course of action. However, the vast majority of cases can be dealt with by way of FPN.""

The NPCC said it had previously advised temporarily suspending the use of fixed penalty notices ""because of a potential disparity between those who opt to pay the FPN and those who see their case reach the court where the FPN would be means tested against personal income"".

"Owen and Bredge Ward's son said his parents ""were always together"" Tributes have been paid to a couple who died 12 hours apart after contracting Covid-19. Owen and Bredge Ward, who were both 69, passed away in hospital on Monday. Last week, their family had hoped Mr and Mrs Ward, from Strabane, County Tyrone, were recovering from Covid-19. Instead, they are now preparing for their funeral on Wednesday. Their son, Martin, said he was in ""complete shock"" and urged people to adhere to public health guidance. Martin, who is one of six children, held his father's hand as he died, while his siblings were with his mother at the funeral home. He sais his parents ""doted"" on their nine grandchildren and, sadly, they will never get to meet their 10th grandchild. Mr and Mr Ward enjoyed spending time with their grandchildren before the coronavirus pandemic ""We can't have a proper wake, hear all the stories that people would be talking about,"" Martin, a nurse at University College Hospital Galway, told BBC News NI. ""We can't do that because of Covid-19 and all the restrictions, which need to be in place."" He said his mother's condition started to improve last week, but then his father ""went downhill"" and was put into a coma. ""This is what the disease does - it can be mild or it can devastate lives,"" he said. ""Within hours, my mum, who was improving, just went downhill. Maybe it was the shock. ""Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse. ""She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too. ""Even though they were sedated and had pain relief and loving care from the staff at Altnagelvin Hospital, both of them just completely collapsed within a couple of hours and that's just how it is. ""It's the hurt and suffering that this virus can cause."" Martin, who lives in Galway, in the Republic of Ireland, with his young family, said Covid-19 guidance should be the same on both sides of the border. Martin Ward has urged people to follow the public health guidelines following his parents' death ""It's a cross-border thing,"" he said. ""We live on an island and we can't separate each jurisdiction because it impacts upon all of us. It impacts on communities on both sides of the border. ""The only thing I want to say to people north and south of the border is to think about other people. ""We knew from February or March what could happen and people have to take on board that this can cause a hell of a lot of harm to people's families. ""The economic aspect is terribly damaging too, so we have to try to limit the spread and adhere to the guidelines, social distancing where you can and when you can't, put on a face mask. ""Treat everyone the same - with respect and as if they are one of your family - so you can minimise the harm to others.""

"Sia, Ed Sheeran and Tones And I all made the top 10 Australian pop star Tones And I has the most-Shazamed song of all time, with her 2019 breakout hit Dance Monkey. More than 200 million people a month use the Shazam app to identify songs they have heard but don't know the names of. Dance Monkey, which was written about the singer's experiences of busking in Byron Bay, has been Shazamed 36.6 million times, the company said. Second place went to Lilly Wood & The Prick's 2014 hit Prayer In C. Tones And I, the stage name of singer-songwriter Toni Watson, said the app had been invaluable for her career. ""I didn't have a following when I released Dance Monkey, but [Shazam] gave me the opportunity to reach more people and elevate my fanbase, which has all led to creating a career for myself,"" she said in a statement. Dance Monkey spent 11 weeks at number one in the UK at the end of last year, and topped the charts in 29 other countries. It also holds the record for the most Shazamed song in a single day.

Shazam's all-time chart shows that dance music and quirky pop are the most commonly searched-for genres, with Avicii's Wake Me Up and OMI's Cheerleader both ranking highly. Four of the top 10 are one-hit wonders, including Gotye's 2012 chart-topper Somebody That I Used To Know and Passenger's Let Her Go, from 2013. On the other hand, Ed Sheeran appears three times in the top 20, meaning some people heard Thinking Out Loud being played for the millionth time and wondered, ""Who sings that one again?""

The top 20 looks like this: The full top 100 is available onApple Music,external. Shazam's technology works by analysing the unique sonic fingerprint of a song - and matches the audio you send via your phone to the music in its database. When it launched in 2002, it was called 2580 - the phone number users dialled to access the service. At the time, it had one million songs in its database and took 15 seconds to process a user's request - sending the results back via text message. Today, it can take as little as two seconds to comb through tens of millions songs, and can cope with remixes, background noise and cover versions. The company first turned a profit in 2016 and was sold to Apple for a reported $400m (Â£302m) a year later. Apple's hope was that the app would drive users to its streaming service, Apple Music. The user data would also give them insight into the music people were listening to, which could be used to influence playlists and the songs promoted on its homepage. Since then, Apple Music's subscriber base has topped 60 million, putting it in second place to Spotify.

Altogether there are597 cases across the health board's hospitals, an increase on last week.,external Deaths overall in Wales were a third above average in the week to 6 November, according to the ONS. So-called excess deaths - a key indicator of how the pandemic is progressing - shows there were 207 deaths more than the five-year average. This is 33% higher than average, which is the highest proportion in England and Wales after north west England for the latest week. Deaths involving Covid-19 were up 45 compared to the number registered the week before. There were 62 deaths registered across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area involving coronavirus - including 53 in hospital. There have been127 deaths from Covid-19 infections caught in hospital outbreaksup to last week. There were also 49 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area, 24 in Swansea Bay, 12 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 12 in Cardiff and Vale.

This video can not be played Molly Evans says she lost her best friend when grandmother Iris Davies, 69, died with Covid Iris Davies, 69, from Ynyshir, Rhondda, died recently from Covid-19 and her granddaughter Molly Evans said it was like losing a best friend, describing her as someone who ""loved life and lived her best life"". ""She was the most family-orientated person, the glue of our family - she was also the most outgoing person, a social person before all this happened,"" said Molly, 23. ""We went to watch musicals, she came to watch me at the eisteddfod, at football."" Iris died at the beginning of thefirebreak lockdownafter losing her best friend to coronavirus two months before, so Molly says her grandmother had talked about death. Iris Davies was treated in hospital before she died The family did their best to protect her and take all the right precautions, but Molly believes the geography of the Rhondda community and its close-knit nature brings people closer together, and this may be a factor for its high death rate. ""When it sinks in, it's devastating,"" she said. ""It's hard to accept because I log on to social media and there are people saying 'is Covid real?' ""I've seen her with my own eyes, on a ventilator. Between breaths she was still trying to make a joke of things. She was fighting so much."" Medical statistician Dr Rhian Daniel, of Cardiff University, told BBC Wales' Newyddion programme that more detailed analysis was needed, but the number of public-facing jobs, including care work, as well as low-paid jobs could all play a part in the big differences in mortality between places such as Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr and areas such as Pembrokeshire. ""Chance can play a big role, but there are likely to be more structural reasons - occupation might be an important factor,"" she added.

"Forces in England and Wales can resume issuing Â£10,000 fines for breaches of Covid rules on gatherings of more than 30 people, police chiefs have said. On Friday the NPCC advised forces to temporarily issue a court summons rather than a fixed penalty notice. There were concerns about a potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenged the fixed penalty in court. The National Police Chiefs' Council said this issue had now been addressed. A spokesman said: ""Following discussions with government, the issue we flagged last Friday has been fully addressed, and forces are advised that they can resume issuing Â£10,000 FPNs [fixed penalty notices] where appropriate."" ""People found to be in breach of the regulations relating to gatherings of over 30 people will be made fully aware of their options when faced with a Â£10k FPN, to ensure fairness. ""The option of summons will remain available to officers, as it always has been, should the unique circumstances of a case mean that this is the most appropriate course of action. However, the vast majority of cases can be dealt with by way of FPN."" When fines go to court they are means-tested against a person's income - meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. Warning over tough fines as new lockdown begins What are the lockdown rules where you live? In a statement earlier on Tuesday, a government spokesperson said: ""It is right that we have a strong deterrent. We are working with forces to ensure people are fully aware of their options when faced with a fixed penalty notice. ""If someone chooses not to pay their fixed penalty notice, the matter may be considered by a court and the individual could be subject to a criminal conviction."" The NPCC said it had previously advised temporarily suspending the use of fixed penalty notices ""because of a potential disparity between those who opt to pay the FPN and those who see their case reach the court where the FPN would be means tested against personal income"". West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson had previously asked ministers for ""urgent clarity"" on the issue, and accused the government of failing to provide the police with ""workable Covid legislation"". In a letter to the policing minister Kit Malthouse, Labour's Mr Jamieson said: ""I feel thoroughly embarrassed that I have been personally supporting the government's actions, which, at best, are questionable."" West Midlands Police has already issued 13 of the fines, reserved for the most serious social-distancing breaches. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Douglas Ross (right) said he would be speaking directly to the prime minister about his reported remarks The Scottish Conservative leader has insisted that Boris Johnson does believe in devolution despite reports that he described it as a ""disaster"". Douglas Ross said he would be speaking to the prime minister later about his reported remarks to a virtual meeting of Conservative MPs. But he claimed it was the SNP's ""obsession"" with independence, rather than devolution, that was the problem. The SNP said the PM had shown his ""contempt"" for Scotland. And Scottish Labour said Mr Johnson was currently the biggest threat to the future of the United Kingdom. The prime minister was in a Zoom meeting with Tory MPs representing dozens of seats in northern England on Monday when he is said to have made the remarks. The UK government's Scottish independence dilemma Is Scotland moving towards independence? Battle lines drawn again over Scotland's future The Sun newspaper reported that he told the MPs that ""devolution has been a disaster north of the border"", and had been former prime minister Tony Blair's ""biggest mistake"". It has been suggested by some taking part in the Zoom meeting that Mr Johnson was answering a question that had been put to him about devolution in England. Number 10 has not denied the reports, with a Downing Street source saying: ""The PM has always supported devolution, but Tony Blair failed to foresee the rise of separatists in Scotland. ""Devolution is great - but not when it's used by separatists and nationalists to break up the UK."" This video can not be played Hendry: PM ""caught red handed"" on Scotland comments Speaking to BBC Scotland, Mr Ross described the row as a ""distraction"" ahead of next May's Scottish Parliament election. He added: ""The prime minister was elected as mayor of London twice, so he believes in devolution. ""The Conservative manifesto at the election just a year ago focused on devolution and ensuring that we strengthen devolution right across the country. ""Devolution is not the problem. The problem has been the SNP's obsession over its thirteen and a half years in power with separating Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom"". This comes six months before vital elections right across the UK, important particularly in Scotland, just when the SNP has been starting to warm up its campaign, and just when discussions about how the UK government ought to respond are taking place too. It is one thing - and, of course, legitimate - for political rivals to criticise each other. But to suggest the way that Scotland has been run for more than a decade is a ""disaster"" is quite another. And the worry among Scottish Tories is the implication that Boris Johnson's understanding of the political situation is far from complete. Read Laura's blog in full But SNP MP Drew Henry said the prime minister's comments ""underline the contempt that Boris Johnson and the Scottish Tories have for the people of Scotland"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast he said: ""Effectively what they are saying is it's alright for Scotland to have devolution as long as they vote for the Westminster party we want them to."" Former Conservative Scottish secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said Mr Johnson's comments were ""typical"" of the ""rather loose language"" the prime minister sometimes uses. ""What he should have said is devolution has become a disaster because the Scottish national government, the SNP government in Scotland, are using the Scottish Parliament and the power they've got to try and destroy the United Kingdom,"" Sir Malcolm told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the SNP, which has been in power since 2007, has been ""pretty useless"" on domestic Scottish issues and have become ""obsessed with demands for referendums"". ""What I'm absolutely certain of is that it was not meant to be an attack on the principle of devolution,"" he said. Devolution is the name for the way powers once held by the government in Westminster have been passed to elected groups in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Devolved powers include health, housing, fire services, some areas of transport and education. However, Scotland has always had its own education system and a separate legal system. The UK government, based in London, has kept many powers, such as defence, foreign policy and most forms of tax. Public votes about devolution were held in 1997 in Scotland and Wales, and in both parts of Ireland in 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement. It led to the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some parts of England have directly-elected mayors, who also have devolved powers. The mayor of London, for example, is responsible for transport and policing in the capital. Elections for the Scottish Parliament take place next May. The SNP is currently the largest party with 61 MSPs and the Conservative Party is the second-largest with 31 - eight seats ahead of Labour. Ms Sturgeon's SNP says a second referendum on independence - following Scotland's vote against it in 2014 - should happen if her party wins. But Mr Johnson has ruled this out. In response to Mr Johnson's reported remarks to Tory MPs, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""Worth bookmarking these PM comments for the next time Tories say they're not a threat to the powers of the Scottish Parliament - or, even more incredibly, that they support devolving more powers."" The SNP is seeking a mandate for another independence referendum in May's election She added that the ""only way to protect and strengthen"" the Scottish Parliament was through independence for Scotland. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the ""Neanderthal"" reported remarks made by the PM ""expose the underlying thinking and philosophy in Downing Street"". He told BBC News the comments were ""reminiscent of the voices of Thatcherism and Majorism of the 1980s and 1990s, which were steadfastly opposed to devolution"". ""In my view, what Boris Johnson is doing is defying the popular will of the people of Scotland, and I don't think that's a very good place for any prime minister to be in.""

"Under the tier system in place before England's lockdown, areas such as Nottingham saw tougher restrictions than others The government is seeking ""greater consistency"" as it prepares to reintroduce England's regional Covid tier system next month, the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said ministers were reviewing the measures in each tier. He said he expected a conclusion to be reached ""within the next week or so"". It comes after a senior government adviser saidthe three-tier system used in England before the lockdown may need strengthening. The government hopes to introduce tiers again when the national lockdown ends on 2 December. Meanwhile, in Scotland the toughest level of Covid restrictionsare to be introduced in 11 council areas- including Glasgow - on Friday. The level four rules will see the closure of non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms. England tiers may need strengthening - adviser How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? What are the lockdown rules where you live? Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast that ministers would look at ""whether the measures that we had in the old tiers were effective"". He pointed out that restrictions had ""varied quite a bit in different parts of the country"", with some areas under the strictest level - tier three (very high) - introducing their own rules in addition to baseline measures. ""I think in the new tiers we would like greater consistency, and we will have to look at the evidence to see which of those measures [were] actually the most impactful on the virus, so that we take the most evidence-based approach that we can do,"" he said. ""We haven't come to a conclusion on that yet, to be perfectly honest, but we will be within the next week or so."" Mr Jenrick said ministers would also look at ""whether the new national measures themselves have had an impact and how great an impact that has been"". ""We won't know that with any certainty until the last week of November,"" he said. He also said it looked as though ""a very large proportion of the population"" would have access to a vaccine in the first half of 2021, and confirmed that the government did not have plans to make it compulsory. Asked in the House of Commons whether the government intended to impose tougher restrictions on tier one (medium) areas, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was ""too early to do the analysis... but of course we remain vigilant"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth responded that MPs would ""soon be asked to make a decision on the future of the lockdown, so the earlier we get that information the better"". Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he was ""a little bit unhappy"" about the idea of either modifying tier one or getting rid of it completely, adding that it was important to balance health needs with the economy. He said he felt the tier system had been working before the national lockdown. ""It may have been slower than a full lockdown, but it was working and I think a return to that with some flexibility, I think will be the right way to go,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains England's Covid tier lockdown system Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia and an adviser to the World Health Organization, also said he believed England would need to return to the tier system after the national lockdown ends. ""What we need to do is make it more responsive and rapid to changes in the epidemic at the local level... then I think we do have a real opportunity to control the epidemic,"" he told the programme. However, he said he hoped there would be some further relaxation over the Christmas period. ""Maybe only for a few days but I think providing that we have some rules still in place and we avoid too big gatherings - I do hope that we can manage to have a more normal Christmas than we might otherwise have been expecting,"" he said. It comes a day after Public Health England's Susan Hopkins - who is a member of the government's scientific advisory group (Sage) - said tier one measures had ""very little effect"" on the spread of the virus. Speaking at the government's evening coronavirus briefing on Monday, she said that, prior to the lockdown, the ""tiering of the country"" had had a ""different effect in each area"". ""Tier three plus"" had led to a reduction in cases in the North West, she said, while tier two ""holds in some areas and not in others"", depending on ""how well individuals are taking that advice in"". However, she added: ""We see very little effect from tier one and when we look at what tiers may be there in the future, we will have to think about strengthening them to get us through the winter months until the vaccine is available for everyone.""

Before England went into its second lockdown this month, nearly a fifth of the population was living in tier three areas. They included those in West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, the Liverpool City Region, Warrington and Nottinghamshire. Some areas introduced tougher restrictions than others, going beyond the baseline tier three measures. For example, betting shops, saunas, tattoo parlours and nail salons wereclosed in Nottinghamshire.

"Jeremy Corbyn was suspended by the Labour Party in October Labour's ruling body is meeting to discuss Jeremy Corbyn's suspension. Last month, a report from the UK's human rights watchdog (EHRC) said the party broke the law by failing to stamp out anti-Jewish racism in the party. Responding to the report, the former leader said the scale of anti-Semitism had been ""dramatically overstated"" by his opponents, andhe was suspended. Sir Keir Starmer said those who think the issue had been ""exaggerated"" should ""be nowhere near the Labour Party"". However, the decision to suspend Mr Corbyn was taken by the party's General Secretary David Evans, not the new leader. A panel made up of members from the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) is now meeting to decide whether to take further disciplinary action or to lift his suspension. Ahead of the meeting on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn - who has been a member of the party for 54 years - released a statement on Facebook, saying concerns over anti-Semitism within Labour are ""neither exaggerated nor overstated"". But the Board of Deputies of British Jews said their community did not accept ""this pathetic non-apology"". Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from the Labour Party? What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Rules brought in under Mr Corbyn mean NEC panels - made up of five members, advised by a barrister - look specifically at anti-Semitism cases on a monthly basis. The can decide to either: Take no further action Issue a reminder of values - which is a less formal sanction Issue a reminder of conduct - which is closer to a formal warning Rule for a time-limited suspension Rule for an expulsion The panel can also refer any cases to the National Constitutional Committee, which is an elected body in the Labour Party that hears and decides on complaints. The five members of Labour's ruling national executive who will decide Jeremy Corbyn's political fate have a tricky task. Some of the former Labour leader's colleagues on the left of the party wanted him to apologise for his remarks, feeling this was the easiest route to having his suspension lifted. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a ""clarification"", making it clear he wasn't belittling concerns over anti-Semitism, and that he was referring to the scale of the problem being overstated, not its seriousness. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has called this a ""pathetic non-apology"", so if he is reinstated, the party can expect the row over anti-Semitism to reignite. If, however, further disciplinary action is taken, a section of the left will regard that as a declaration of civil war - something which those closest to Mr Corbyn hope to avoid. After thedamning EHRC reportLabour wants to move on from the toxic issue of anti-Semitism - but is already finding that is easier said than done. Mr Corbyn - who led the party for almost five years - said he had already given a statement to Labour to ""clear up any confusion"" about what he had meant when he responded to the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's report. He said the report's release ""should have been a moment for the Labour Party to come together in a determination to address the shortcomings of the past and work as one to root out anti-Semitism in our own ranks and wider society"". Mr Corbyn, who is still an MP despite his suspension from the party, said it was ""not his intention"" to say anti-Jewish racism should be tolerated, and he ""regrets the pain this issue has caused the Jewish community"". His statement added: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" But the Board of Deputies of British Jews condemned the statement and called for action from Labour. President of the organisation, Marie van der Zyl, added: ""If the party wants to show it is serious about tackling anti-Jewish racism, it will consign this statement, just like the culture which led to the EHRC's damning findings, to the dustbin of history. ""To do otherwise would be a failure of leadership which would risk the party slipping backwards."" Asked about the statement, a Labour Party spokesman said they would not ""give a running commentary on an individual case"". This video can not be played In comments before his suspension from Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said anti-Semitism complaints numbers were ""exaggerated"" Labour has been plagued by allegations of anti-Jewish racism by some of its supporters since 2016, mostly on social media. Anti-Semitic abuse is against the law and in May last year the EHRC - which polices human rights and equalities in the UK - launched an investigation into Labour's handling of complaints about the behaviour of some of its supporters. When it published its report in October, the Commission put some of the blame on ""serious failings"" under Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party. But Labour said it was his reaction to the report that led to his suspension, rather its findings. This video can not be played Kier Starmer: ""An ability to recognise the hurt, draw a line and move on"" Many Labour MPs stood by the decision to suspend Mr Corbyn, including Margaret Hodge, parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement. But his allies in the Commons, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, called for the decision to be reversed. On his Facebook post, the former leader said: ""I hope this matter is resolved as quickly as possible, so that the party can work together to root out anti-Semitism and unite to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government.""

"From Boxing Day the whole of mainland Scotland will be in the country's toughest tier of restrictions for at least three weeks. So what can you  do - and not do - in level four? Is your area in the toughest level? People should not be meeting in each others houses. However, six adults from two separate households can meet in a public place. Children under 12 do not count towards that total. Exceptions to the ban include another household providing care and support to a ""vulnerable person"". The extended household rule applies in level four. This allows people who live alone - or who are a single adult with children under 18 - being considered part of another household to reduce loneliness and isolation. Where parents do not live in the same household, children can move between their parents' homes. Up to two households - totalling no more than six - can meet in a private garden or a public place like a park. Children under 12 do not count toward that number and they also do not need to maintain social distancing. Young people aged between 12 and 17 can meet up in groups of up to six outdoors. These groups are not subject to the two household limit but physical distancing is required. If you are meeting in someone's garden you can go inside if you need to use the toilet but should wipe down surfaces you touch with antibacterial wipes and use only freshly laundered or paper towels. Restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars will be closed. Takeaways can operate as normal with face coverings and physical distancing rules being followed. Hotels and other accommodation providers can serve food up to 10pm to guests. Room service, including alcohol, is allowed. All holiday accommodation is closed to tourists. Hotels, B&Bs and self-catering can remain open for essential customers - for example anyone who is staying for essential work purposes. Only essential retail can open providing they follow and have implemented Scottish government guidance to ensure the safety of customers and staff. Click and collect, on-line services and outdoor retail, such as garden centres, outdoor markets and car lots, can also remain open. Services which involve ""close contact"" cannot operate. These include hairdressers; barbers; hair removal and massage therapies. They also include dress-fitting; tattoo and piercing and indoor portrait photography. Indoor sports facilities, including gyms, have to close. You are permitted to meet others outdoors for informal exercise or sport and outdoor gyms can remain open. Outdoor non-contact sports are permitted for all age groups. All leisure and entertainment premises, including cinemas, must be closed. Film and TV production can continue to take place. All public buildings such as libraries have to close, however, library click and collect services can still operate. Churches, mosques, temples and synagogues can remain open subject to two metre distancing and a maximum of 20 worshippers. Wedding ceremonies and civil partnerships, with a maximum of 20 people (including the couple) are allowed - providing the venue is big enough for 2m distancing. Face coverings must be worn except for the couple getting married and the person conducting the service. However, receptions cannot follow a ceremony. Funerals and wakes can take place with a maximum capacity of 20 guests. Education Schools, colleges and universities can remain open. Early learning and childcare can continue to operate. However, informal childcare is only allowed for anyone employed in essential or permitted services. If you want to delve deeper into the Scottish government's level four rules, clickhere,external.

"The number of Covid-19 infections in Scotland has risen, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). TheONS Covid infection survey,externalestimates an average of219,600people were infected on any given day in the week up to 31 December - that's aboutone in 25 people. Figures from theNational Records of Scotland,externalalso show there were81Covid deaths in the week ending 8 January, which is higher than the previous week. A total of16,465people in Scotland have died with Covid since the outbreak began in March 2020. This page analyses the key figures for the Covid pandemic in Scotland and is updated weekly. The ONS has been carrying out a Covid infection survey of randomly selected households in Scotland since September 2020. Nowmass testing has ended, it has become the best estimate of the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland. The pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals. At the peak of the outbreak in spring 2020, there were more than 1,500 Covid patients in hospital, with more than 200 being treated in intensive care. Numbers reduced over the summer of 2020, but started to rise steadily again in the autumn. In January 2021, the number of patients with Covid in hospital went above 2,000. During the Omicron surge in cases in early 2022, the total number of patients with Covid surpassed the 2021 peak. However, the numbers being treated in intensive care are lower than they were early in the pandemic. The first Covid-19 death in Scotlandwas reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March 2020. The spring outbreak peaked in mid-April 2020 and then mainly declined until the summer, when deaths remained at a relatively low level. The rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn of 2020 as the second wave of the pandemic took hold, finally peaking at the end of January 2021. The number of deaths in subsequent waves of Covid infections peaked at much lower levels, but deaths are still occurring. There are two ways to count total deaths from Covid-19.The National Records of Scotland (NRS) reports all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. The NRS also publishes data on excess deaths,compared with a five-year average,external. Excess deaths from most causes rose in 2020and in 2021. The exception in both years has been deaths from respiratory diseases, which have seen lower than average excess deaths.

"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says 11 areas will move to level 4 of Covid rules - the toughest restrictions The 11 areas: City of Glasgow, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, East Dunbartonshire, West Dunbartonshire, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, East Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian Nineteen areas will see no change, while two will move from level 3 to level 2 A government minister, Robert Jenrick, says England's post-lockdown tier system is being ""reviewed"", after an adviser said it may need to be tougher The number of weekly deaths in England and Wales mentioning Covid-19 on the death certificate reaches highest level since May Police in UK suspend Â£10k fines for large gatherings, due to concern over unequal treatment US President-elect Joe Biden has warned Donald Trump's refusal to hand over power to him in the usual way could cost lives amid the pandemic A number of US states have imposed new restrictions as cases in the US top 11 million EasyJet has reported its first annual loss in its 25-year history as the pandemic continues to bite deeply into the airline industry Edited by Claudia Allen and Owen Amos That's all from the Covid-19 live page today - we'll be back tomorrow morning. The writers were Alexandra Fouche, Cherry Wilson, Lauren Turner, Katie Wright, and Sophie Williams. The editors were Claudia Allen and Owen Amos. We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a quick recap of the main coronavirus stories in the UK today: Thanks for tuning in to our coverage today - the live page will end soon. Here are the headlines from around the world today: Radio 4 PM A former UK government adviser, Prof Neil Ferguson, says numerous families could become a ""bubble"" for a week to be able to spend Christmas together. A so-called ""bubble"" allows people who live in different households to be treated as one, in order to meet virus rules. For example, anadult living on their own,externalin England can form a bubble with another household of any size. Prof Ferguson toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""You could think of allowing three or four households to bubble
together for a week but not contact anybody else, which would give more
opportunity to see loved ones but not a free for all. ""And that, I mean
modelling, would suggest increases risk somewhat but in a controllable way.â Ferguson's modelling was used by the government before the lockdown in March. The governments from the four nations have held talks about taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. According to our audience research, this graphic produced by the World Health Organization showing coronavirus symptoms was one of the most shared posts on Facebook
on Monday. It's a good reminder of what the more serious symptoms are, as well as the less common ones, as new Covid cases are on the rise in many parts of the world. We have more here onwhat coronavirus symptoms are and how to protect yourself.  This video can not be played Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate? This video can not be played US senators Sherrod Brown and Dan Sullivan clash over face masks in chamber A Polish brand of dance music â disco polo â is at the
centre of a row about government aid for Polish performers hit by the pandemic. The fund worth 400m zloty (Â£80m) has now been frozen, after complaints
that the right-wing nationalist government was favouring disco polo stars who
are already well off. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said the aid issue had become
politicised. Defending the Cultural Support Fund (FWK), he tweeted that âthe recipients
of support were not determined by sympathies, but by an algorithm showing who had lost
income as a result of the pandemicâ. But the funding â desperately needed by many artists whose
income has dried up â is now under review. The website Notes from Poland names several disco polo stars
who each got more than 500,000 zloty (Â£100,000). Disco polo - heavy on drum machines and synthesisers - is popular at Polish weddings, with its simple tunes and lyrics. Composer Piotr Rubik was among the critics, mocking the fund
by singing: âIâll form a disco polo band and get two million.â Adam Murray has been reminiscing about times he's had at Bramall Lane Radio 1 DJ Jordan North faced his fear of snakes on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here by chanting about his ""happy place"" - Burnley FC's Turf Moor stadium. While there were plenty of jokes to be had (including whether it was a happier place for Burnley fans or away teams) it also got fans thinking about their own home grounds, which they're missing during the pandemic. We've been talking to some of them about their memories. They include Adam Murray, who says being held up by his dad at Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's ground, is one of his first memories. ""When it's something you've had around you all your life, it's generally a happy place - win, lose or draw, it's about the family time and the time with your friends,"" he says. Read more fans' stories here. Northern Irish coupleOwen and Bredge Ward, both 69, from County Tyrone, died just 12 hours apart after contracting Covid-19. Martin, one of their six children, held his father's hand as he died and said he was in ""complete shock"". He said his parents ""were always together"" and ""doted"" on their nine grandchildren. He said his mother's condition started to improve last week, but then his father ""went downhill"" and was put into a coma. ""Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse. ""She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too.""

According to their keepers, the animals have noticed the lack of visitors and are beginning to miss the attention they would normally get from humans. London Zoo had to close its doors to the public for the second time during England's four-week November lockdown.  Pfizer has launched a pilot delivery programme
for its Covid-19 vaccine in four US states. Last week Pfizer announced its vaccine had been90% effective in preventing the illness during trials. However the vaccine must be shipped and stored
at -70C (-94F) to remain effective, posing a significant logistical challenge for its distribution. Pfizer will run the pilot delivery programme
in Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico and Tennessee. The varied size of the states
will allow the company to see how the vaccine can reach everyone in those
areas. âWe are hopeful that results from this vaccine
delivery pilot will serve as the model for other US states and international
governments, as they prepare to implement effective Covid-19 vaccine programmes,â
the company said in a statement. Pfizer says it hopes to have enough safety data
from the trials by next week to apply for emergency use authorisation. We usually bring you the latest coronavirus figures from the UK around this time. But today, the government figures aren't going to be available until after 18:00 due to ""technical difficulties"", accordingto a message on the site,external. We will updateour own data pagewhen we have those figures. Parts of England haverecorded thousands of additional coronavirus casesafter the government changed its recording methods. Cases were assigned to the address in a patient's NHS records, but this did not account for those who have recently moved, such as students relocating for university. Officials say the change had not affected decisions about local or national lockdown restrictions. Newcastle saw cases rise by more than a quarter, followed by York and Lincoln. Richmondshire, in North Yorkshire, had the highest proportion of cases re-allocated away from the area. Of the area's 677 cases between 1 September and 15 November, 124 were placed elsewhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China, where the virus started, is one of the few
countries where life is back to a version of normal, post-coronavirus. No new domestic symptomatic or asymptomatic cases have been
detected in the last 24 hours. But there are growing concerns in the country
that Covid-19 may enter China via imported frozen goods. A number of localised outbreaks earlier in the year in cities like Beijing and Qingdao were linked to handlers of imported frozen products,external, and China has been increasingly warning that cold-chain goods (those perishable goods transported at low temperatures) pose a serious threat to communities. On Monday, Chinaâs customs agency said it had âstepped up
effortsâ to prevent the virus from entering China by contacting all of the 109
countries that export cold-chain goods to the country.It also said it had suspended receiving goods from some 99 companies in 20 countries that export to China,external. However, New Zealandâs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has
questioned claims that the coronavirus was found on beef exports from New
Zealand, given the country has also returned to a version of normal. She said
she had been advised New Zealand exports were stored with products from
Argentina that had tested positive, following reports New Zealand goods had
tested positive in the Chinese city of Jinan. âWe are confident our products are not exported
with Covid on them, given our status as being essentially Covid-19 free,â she told a press conference on Monday. A spokesperson from the NZ Ministry of
Foreign Affairs added: âNew Zealand has not been informed of this officially by the
Chinese authorities. âNew Zealand officials are working now to
ascertain the origin and veracity of these reports.â Some of the major dates in Scotland's virus response:  Police chiefs have suspended the use of Â£10,000 fines for those who breach coronavirus rules on large gatherings. It comes amid concerns over potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenge the fees in court. When fines go to court they are means-tested, meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. The National Police Chief's Council (NPCC) said it was working ""urgently"" with the government over the issue. Read more here Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The days are growing cold, the first snow is
falling on the ski slopes, and Swiss minds are turning to their favourite dish.
Nothing is more comforting than sitting round the table with good friends,
sharing a cheese fondue. But in these troubled Covid times, some are
questioning the fondue ritual: spearing a piece of bread, dipping it in that
communal pot of bubbling cheese, and transferring it straight to your mouth. No
self-respecting Swiss wants to endure a winter without fondue â but is it safe? Arnaud Favre, who organizes the annual fondue
festival, is sure it is. âLots of people have been worrying about
whether itâs OK to eat fondue, with your friends, or even with people you donât
know â the answer is, thereâs really nothing to fear. The Covid virus dies
above 50 degrees Centigrade - fondue is cooked at 80 degrees."" Unfortunately for Arnaud, his fondue festival
has been cancelled this year â big crowds of cheese-hungry people are too much
of a risk. Restaurants in many parts of Switzerland are closed too â but a
fondue at home with friends is still allowed, although the ritual is becoming
more flexible. Instead of one fork, fondue fans suggest, have
two, one for dipping, and the other for eating. The advice seems to be working
â as the Swiss brace themselves for this Covid winter, fondue sales are rising. The boss of Moderna, the company behind one of the Covid vaccines whose initial trial results have recently been announced, has warned that long negotiations over purchasing the
new vaccine will slow down deliveries to European countries. Stephane Bancel told AFP news agency that other
nations who have signed deals will get priority. The UK has already signed a
deal with Moderna to supply five million doses from next spring. âIt is clear that with a delay this is not
going to limit the total amount but it is going to slow down delivery,â he
said. Earlier this week, Moderna announced its
vaccine was nearly 95% effective, according to early data. Moderna is planning to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the US in the next few weeks. US country singer Dolly Parton has been credited with helping fundthe successful Moderna vaccine announced on Monday, thanks to a  large financial donation she made earlier this year. Back in April, the country singer announced she was donating $1m (Â£800,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, for coronavirus research. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The first minister says level 4 restrictions are 'intended to be short and sharp' More than two million people are to be placed under Scotland's toughest Covid lockdown restrictions from Friday. The move will see level four rules imposed in 11 council areas across western and central Scotland, including Glasgow. It will mean non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms will have to close, although schools will still be open. The level four restrictions will remain in place until 11 December. They will be imposed from 18:00 on Friday in East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire. North and South Lanarkshire, East and South Ayrshire, Stirling and West Lothian will also move to level four - with about 2.3 million people affected across the 11 local authority areas. Live updates on the Covid levels announcement Has your area been put into the toughest level? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? However, East Lothian and Midlothian will move from level three to level two from next Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. Ms Sturgeon also said the existing advice for people in level three or four not to travel outside their own council area except for ""certain essential purposes"" will become law from Friday. This will also mean that people living elsewhere in Scotland must not travel to level three or level four areas, except for essential purposes, and there must be no non-essential travel between Scotland and other parts of the UK. The first minister said there were grounds for ""continued and significant concern"" about levels of the virus in all of the council areas that would be moving to the highest tier of restrictions. She added: ""The infection rate in all of these areas remains stubbornly and worryingly high. ""At these levels, we simply do not have the assurance we need that hospital and ICU services will be able to cope as we go deeper into winter."" You must not visit other people's homes, but can still meet outdoors with up to six people from two households People should stay at or close to home as much as possible Those who can work from home should do so - although construction and manufacturing workplaces can remain open Only essential indoor retail premises will remain open Close contact services, such as hairdressers and beauty salons, visitor attractions, leisure and entertainment settings and indoor gyms will close With the exception of takeaway services, hospitality premises must also shut But schools will remain open The first minister said people in level four areas should only be going out and about during the three-week period that the restrictions are in place for a limited number of reasons. These include childcare, caring for someone who is vulnerable, exercise or shopping for essential goods. In the seven days up to Friday, Scotland as a whole had just over 140 new cases of Covid per 100,000 people. Ms Sturgeon said all of the areas moving to level four were above that rate - ranging from West Lothian, which saw 158 cases per 100,000, to Glasgow with 277. Restaurants across the Level Four areas will have to shut completely from Friday She said the ""short, sharp"" move to level four would allow restrictions in the affected areas to be eased ""much more quickly"" than they would be if they remained in level three. All of the country's other council areas will remain in the same level as they currently are, although Ms Sturgeon said she hoped that Argyll and Bute could soon move from level two to level one. And she said that people from level one areas will be able to meet outdoors with up to eight people from a maximum of three households from Thursday, rather than the current six people from two households. England is currently in a national lockdown, and ministers arehoping to reintroduce a tiered system of restrictionswhen that ends on 2 December. National lockdown restrictions were eased in Wales earlier this month, although there are still curbs on meeting other households and travelling outside the country. And restrictions, including the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants, arein place across Northern Ireland until 26 November. Business leaders had warned ahead of Ms Sturgeon's announcement that the highest tier of restrictions would have a ""severe"" impact on many retailers during the crucial Christmas trading period, and have questioned the scientific evidence for closing many businesses down. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which represents some of the country's biggest pub and restaurant chains, said the fact that Covid cases in many Level Three areas had not fallen despite licensed premises largely being closed showed that household transmission was the biggest driver of the virus. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce described the news as ""devastating"" and called for more emphasis on mass testing to avoid ""a miserable cycle of lockdowns"" through winter. The EIS teaching union, which is already surveying its members on whether they would consider striking over safety concerns, called for schools in Level Four areas to now move to either blended or remote learning. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said more than 700 Covid patients are in its hospitals and the number has been ""increasing steadily"" in recent weeks. Chief executive Jane Grant said: ""Our staff and services are under the same levels of pressure as they were at the peak of the first Covid wave so we hope these new restrictions will help us to continue to provide vital services and support to our staff, patients and their loved ones."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson gave a cautious welcome to the move on the condition that it allowed a more general easing of restrictions over the festive period. She added: ""However, as has happened on several occasions before, it would be deeply regrettable if these restrictions were to be stretched any further, leaving people in limbo before Christmas and businesses unable to plan"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was a ""stark difference"" between levels three and four, and called on the Scottish government to set out the ""hard data"" that the decisions had been based on. And he questioned why areas such as North and South Lanarkshire had been included at a time when their transmission rates were falling. Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said restrictions were being ""ratcheted up in parts of the country where the number of cases is going down"" and said the government was ""shutting down sectors without clear evidence they are the cause of the spread"".

"TikTok is making it easier for parents to safeguard their children on its video-sharing app. New features include the ability to change the youngster's settings remotely to block them from carrying out searches, and to prevent strangers from seeing their posts. Children can still override these limitations but not without their parents being told. The action comes a fortnight afterBBC Panorama raised safety concerns. The documentary highlighted how predators have abused the platform's recommendation engine to target some of its youngest users.

"The number of couples getting divorced in England and Wales surged by almost a fifth in 2019 to the highest level in five years, figures reveal. TheOffice for National Statistics,externaldata shows 107,599 opposite-sex divorces in 2019, an increase of 18.4% from 90,871 in 2018 - the highest since 2014, when 111,169 were granted. There were also 822 same-sex divorces, nearly twice the number (428) in 2018. The ONS said a casework backlog in 2018 could partly account for the increase. 'Divorce boom' forecast due to lockdown strain 'No-fault' divorce bill backed by MPs The friends helping people divorce without lawyers Unreasonable behaviour was the most common reason for divorce, cited by 49% of wives and 35% of husbands in heterosexual marriage, in 63% of female same-sex divorces and and 70% of male ones. At the moment, in order to divorce, either one spouse has to allege adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion by the other. Currently, a person can apply for a divorce if both parties agree and they have beenseparated from their spouse for two years,external. Someone wishing to obtain a divorce without the consent of their spouse must live apart from them for five years. This is expected to change with the introduction of the ""no-fault"" divorce next autumn, after which they will only have to state that the marriage has broken down irretrievably. The number of same-sex divorces has increased each year, reflecting the increasing size of the same-sex married population since March 2014 when the law changed to allow them to marry, the ONS says. Of the 822 same-sex divorces last year, almost three-quarters were between female couples, a similar proportion to in 2018. Meanwhile the divorce rate among opposite-sex couples last year increased to 8.9 divorces per 1,000 married people, from 7.5 in 2018. The median length time for those marriages to have lasted before divorce was 12.3 years. The ONS said last year's increase in divorces was the largest in percentage terms increase since 1972, when the recent introduction of the Divorce Reform Act 1969 made it easier for couples to divorce. But there has been an overall downward trend since the most recent peak of 153,065 divorces in 2003, the ONS said, with opposite-sex divorces in 2019 still 30% lower than in that year. This was broadly consistent with an overall decline in the number of marriages between 2003 and 2009, it said, adding: ""Changes in attitudes to cohabitation as an alternative to marriage or prior to marriage, particularly at younger ages, are likely to have been a factor affecting the general decrease in divorce rates since 2003."" The latest figures comeas family lawyers have predicted a ""post-lockdown divorce boom""amid warnings the coronavirus pandemic is putting a strain on relationships. Advice charity Citizens Advice said divorce guidance searches had risen since April after a drop in visits when lockdown started. It said views of its divorce webpage on the first September weekend were up 25% compared with the same date in 2019. Tom MacInnes, chief analyst for Citizens Advice, said: ""We know that this pandemic has put an enormous strain on people financially but our data shows that strain is also being felt in people's relationships.""

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether the toughest Covid restrictions are to be imposed in the west of Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said on Monday it was ""likely"" that some areas would be moved from level three to level four. This could include the six councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area, including Glasgow itself. There has also been speculation that both North and South Lanarkshire could be moved to the highest tier. Rising numbers of cases have previously been highlighted in Stirling and in both East and South Ayrshire, which are all currently in level three. But the government has also been looking at whether any areas could move down a level, with Ms Sturgeon saying: ""This is not a one-way street"". Any changes, which will be announced by Ms Sturgeon at about 14:20, would come into force from Friday. What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? No part of Scotland has been placed in the top level since the tiered system - which ranges from level zero to level four and is reviewed on a weekly basis - came into force on 2 November. However, there have been concerns that infection rates are not reducing quickly enough - or are continuing to rise - in some of the 22 areas that are currently in level three. Level four restrictions would see the closure of a wide range of premises including non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers, gyms and leisure centres, although schools would remain open. Ms Sturgeon has said that moving to the highest level ""for a limited period in some areas"" could help protect the NHS and pave the way for some easing of restrictions at Christmas. Level four is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March. Socialising would not be allowed in people's homes, but six people from two households could still meet outdoors and there would be no limit on outdoor exercise. However, people would be advised to minimise the number of meetings with people from other households, and to follow social distancing guidance. Those living under level four restrictions would be advised to avoid any unnecessary travel out of the area, and to keep journeys within the area to an absolute minimum. The premises which would close include: Non-essential shops Pubs, restaurants and cafes, although takeaways can still operate Leisure centres and gyms Hairdressers, barbers, beauticians and any other close contact retail services Indoor visitor attractions and all leisure and entertainment premises. However, schools would remain open full-time. Read more about the level four restrictions The Scottish Retail Consortium has warned of the impact that the highest tier of restrictions would have on shops. Director David Lonsdale said: ""The scientific evidence indicates retail is a safe environment and closing stores will do little to suppress the virus. ""However, the economic impacts of forced closure during the Christmas trading period are severe, which is why it should only be a last resort."" In neighbouring East and West Dunbartonshire, council leaders are split over whether a move to level four is now the right thing to do. Andrew Polson, the Conservative leader of East Dunbartonshire, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme the Scottish government must show ""extreme caution"" because of the impact on businesses and people's mental health. He said: ""I know the people of East Dunbartonshire are looking for some relaxation of the restrictions. ""We should be continuing with the tier system we've got. We are only two weeks into it and I think we need to let it go."" Rising numbers of cases have previously been highlighted in Stirling Jonathan McColl, the SNP leader of neighbouring West Dunbartonshire Council, said the move to level four would be ""incredibly difficult"" for businesses. However, he insisted the threat to public health was the number one priority. He told Good Morning Scotland: ""It has to be a major consideration for the government of the impact it has on, particularly, small and medium-sized enterprises that don't have the same capacity to be as resilient. ""But you have to look at the whole thing in the round. We are trying to protect people and save lives here. ""The absolute worst-case scenario would be if we were in a lockdown over Christmas. Nobody wants that."" Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute, Borders, and Dumfries and Galloway are currently in level two, with Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles in level one. Ms Sturgeon's cabinet will decide on any changes on Tuesday morning before she makes a statement in the Scottish Parliament in the afternoon. Talks have been taking place between the Scottish government and the local authorities in the areas which are under threat of being placed into level four. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said on Friday that councils in the west of Scotland had been warned that the move to level four was possible. On Monday, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I think it is likely that we will see some areas go to level four this week. ""But is it inevitable? Until we have taken that final decision, no of course it's not.""

"Patients at the University Hospital of Wales will take part in a clinical trial Mouthwash can kill coronavirus within 30 seconds of being exposed to it in a lab, a scientific study indicates. Scientists at Cardiff University found there were ""promising signs"" that over-the-counter mouthwashes may help to destroy the virus. The report,externalcomes ahead of a clinical trial on Covid-19 on patients at the University Hospital of Wales. Dr Nick Claydon said the study could lead to mouthwash becoming an important part of people's routines. While the research suggests use of mouthwash may help kill the virus in saliva, there is not evidence it could be used as a treatment for coronavirus, as it will not reach the the respiratory tract or the lungs. Dr Claydon, a specialist periodontologist, said: ""If these positive results are reflected in Cardiff University's clinical trial, CPC-based mouthwashes... could become an important addition to people's routine, together with hand washing, physical distancing and wearing masks, both now and in the future."" How many deaths have there been? Covid-19 in Wales: What do the stats tell us? Do we ever follow the science? The university report states that mouthwashes containing at least 0.07% cetypyridinium chloride (CPC) showed ""promising signs"" of being able to eradicate the virus when exposed to the virus in a lab. While the report is yet to be peer reviewed, it supports another recent study which found CPC-based mouthwashes are effective in reducing viral load. Dr Richard Stanton, lead author on the study, said: ""This study adds to the emerging literature that several commonly-available mouthwashes designed to fight gum disease can also inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (and other related coronaviruses) when tested in the laboratory under conditions that are designed to mimic the oral/nasal cavity in a test tube. ""This study is not yet peer reviewed and published which means it has not yet been scrutinised by other scientists as is the usual process with academic research. It has now been submitted for publication in a journal. ""People should continue to follow the preventive measures issued by the UK government, including washing hands frequently and maintaining social distance."" Cardiff University scientists have stressed that people should continue to follow official advice when it comes to trying to prevent the spread of coronavirus A clinical trial will look at whether it helps to reduce levels of the virus in the saliva of Covid-19 patients at the hospital in Cardiff, with results expected early next year. Prof David Thomas, from the university, said the initial results were encouraging, but the clinical trial would not produce evidence of how to prevent transmission between patients. ""Whilst these mouthwashes very effectively eradicate the virus in the laboratory, we need to see if they work in patients and this is the point of our ongoing clinical study,"" he said. ""The ongoing clinical study will, however, show us how long any effects last, following a single administration of the mouthwash in patients with Covid-19.""We need to understand if the effect of over-the-counter mouthwashes on the Covid-19 virus achieved in the laboratory can be reproduced in patients.""

"Vulnerable children are often used by so-called ""county lines"" gangs ""County lines"" gangs could be using children in care across north Wales to distribute drugs to get around lockdown restrictions, it is claimed. The urban gangs use young people to expand their markets for drugs like cocaine and heroin into smaller towns. But research for the North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner suggests fewer children are being sent from larger cities. There are also claims some councils have ""their heads in the sand"". But the board representing councils, police and probation said it had not been invited to take part in the study. Drug dealers 'pretending to be uni students' The research by the crime and justice consultancy Crest Advisory comes as England is in the middle of amonth-long national lockdown, with travel restricted between Wales and England. Travel between the countries was also limited during Wales' recent firebreak lockdown and before that local lockdowns. ""Gangs have had to change their business model,"" said North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones ""With the roads being quieter, less people on the trains, it's been easier for the police, British Transport Police, ourselves, to detect people who are coming to north Wales to deal drugs. ""So now what they're doing is trying to recruit children and young people locally and I'm particularly concerned about people in care being recruited to deal county lines."" Crest Advisory conducted interviews with officers from North Wales Police and Merseyside Police, as well as other agencies as part of a wider project looking at county lines and looked-after children. Joe Calouri, head of policy at Crest, told Welsh language news programme Newyddion that gangs were already having to adapt due to more effective police work, but restrictions on movement during the pandemic had ""accelerated"" change. ""They've reacted by recruiting local children,"" he said. This video can not be played What is ""county lines""? ""And because of the use of technology and apps and social media, it's very easy for gangs to recruit children without even meeting them by having peers recruit them and controlling them via social network apps."" The issue of children in care homes - and where they come from - can be complicated. As well as caring for children and young people from the region, a number of care homes in north Wales provide for out-of-area children, including from larger cities in England. But local authorities may not know if children from outside the region are placed in their locality alongside local children. A number of councils in north Wales said they would not have accurate data as it's the responsibility of the placing authority to inform them. One council said it was ""often not informed by placing authorities"". Mr Calouri said local authorities did not engage with the research project. ""We have a concern that perhaps local authorities have their heads in the sand slightly on this issue and are still viewing it as a problem from outside rather than a problem that they need to deal with locally and poses a risk to local children,"" he added. ""Having reviewed their local safeguarding board documents, we don't see much evidence of proactive local planning around the risk or an understanding of what the risks are. ""People in north Wales should be very concerned about the changing threat of county lines. ""Over time we've seen elsewhere in the country how, as gangs start to recruit more locally, and rely less on trafficking children over borders, over time there's a high level of violence, there's post code-style gangs that form and it often results in high level violence and even murder in some situations. ""North Wales have the opportunity to be ahead of the curve in preventing this from happening, but to do that they need to recognise the threat of county lines locally and take action, rather than treating it as a problem that's come in from outside from Merseyside."" In a statement, the North Wales Children's Safeguarding Board, which is made up of local authorities, health board, police and probation, said: ""The request to participate with the Crest Research has not formally been presented. ""We hope that police colleagues at the board will take the opportunity to present the research proposal. ""We are aware that work is currently taking place between Wales Government safeguarding and advocacy unit and the heads of service across Wales around considering further amendments to the practice guide.""

"Marie Stopes, pictured around 1955, founded the first birth control clinic in Britain and later focussed on the needs of the developing world A leading abortion provider has changed its name to break ties with Marie Stopes, the controversial birth control pioneer who believed in the creation of a super race. Marie Stopes International, which provides contraception and abortions to women and girls in 37 countries, is now known as MSI Reproductive Choices. The charity said her views on eugenics were in ""stark contrast"" to its values. It added the events of 2020 reaffirmed a name change was the right decision. Marie Stopes set up Britain's first birth control clinic in 1921 in Holloway, north London, despite medical and religious opposition. The Marie Stopes Mothers' Clinic, which gave women advice and contraception, later moved to Whitfield Street, in central London. In 1976, doctor Tim Black heard the clinic was in financial difficulty and bought the lease to the building, thereby co-founding the modern organisation and the first of more than 600 Marie Stopes International clinics around the world. MSI Reproductive Choices said Stopes' legacy has become ""deeply entangled"" with her views on eugenics and wanted to address the ""understandable misapprehensions"" that the charity had a meaningful connection to her. Eugenics is the study of the selective breeding of humans to increase heritable characteristics, which are considered desirable. Stopes was a member of the Eugenics Society and advocated for the sterilisation of people considered unfit for parenthood. MSI Reproductive Choices said these views ""though not uncommon at that time, are now rightly discredited"". Simon Cooke, chief executive of MSI Reproductive Choices, said: ""The name of the organisation has been a topic of discussion for many years and the events of 2020 have reaffirmed that changing our name is the right decision."" Marie Stopes, born in Edinburgh in 1880, is a controversial historical figure. She wrote a best-selling sex-manual for women and was a birth control pioneer. On a darker note, she also corresponded with Adolf Hitler and believed in the creation of a super race. When Stopes set up her first birth control clinic in 1921, everyone assumed that she had trained in medicine. Yet it was fossil plants and coal that was her expertise. It was her personal experience that motivated her to promote sex education and the use of contraception. After a failed marriage, she wrote Britain's first sex manual, Married Love. She opened Britain's first birth control clinic in north London in 1921 and founded the National Birth Control Council, later known as the Family Planning Association. Despite services in her name offering abortion care after her death in 1958, she had actually been opposed to abortion. Her legacy is marked by an English Heritage blue plaque on her first London home in Upper Norwood, south-east London, describing her as a promoter of sex education and birth control.

"This video can not be played The changes will make it more expensive for NI dealers to buy cars from Great Britain Brexit-related changes are set to make it more expensive for NI car dealers to source second-hand vehicles from GB. Currently when dealers buy a vehicle in GB and then sell it in Northern Ireland, they only have to pay VAT on the profit. But from January they will have to pay VAT on the full price they paid for the car in GB. This will drastically reduce the profit margins on those vehicles or see price rises for consumers. The VAT bill for a car bought for Â£8,000 and sold for Â£10,000 could rise from Â£333 to Â£1666. GB is a significant source of second-hand cars for NI either from auctions or cars coming off a lease. From January many EU rules will apply on trade from GB to NI including what is known as the VAT margin scheme. The margin scheme is the arrangement which allows VAT to be paid on the profit rather than the full price. From 1 January NI will be part of the EU scheme rather than the UK one. NI drivers will need green card to cross the border What are the rules on driving in the EU after Brexit? NI leaders warn of Brexit threat to food supplies Official guidance from HMRC states: ""In line with EU rules, margin schemes involving goods, such as the second-hand margin schemes, will not usually apply for sales in Northern Ireland where the stock is purchased in Great Britain. ""Margin schemes will remain available for sales of goods that are purchased in Northern Ireland or the EU, whether sold to customers in Northern Ireland, Great Britain or the EU."" It is understood the issue is being raised at the Joint Committee - the UK-EU body which is overseeing the NI part of the Brexit deal. The EU would have to agree to set aside this provision of the deal if the new arrangement is not to begin in January.

"There are ""no plans"" to extend the Christmas break for schools in NI, Education Minister Peter Weir has said. He dismissed the possibility that schools could close early for the holiday as a ""rumour"". NI's currentR numberhas now climbed closer to 1.0 and is expected to rise as the hospitality industry opens up over the next couple of weeks. As a result, additional interventions are expected before Christmas, the chief scientific adviser said. Prof Ian Young said the R value had risen in recent weeks due to continued widespread community transmission of the virus. He added that additional mitigations will be suggested to the hospitality industry including reducing numbers and increasing ventilation. Meanwhile the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride appealed to everyone to continue playing their part despite the fact that the ""virus continues to mess with our heads and our lives"". Dr McBride said he's optimistic that Northern Ireland will begin to vaccinate some people by the end of the year. Earlier, DUP leader Arlene Foster said she did not rule out blocking more Covid-19 restrictions if required. However, the first minister added she wanted to ""find consensus"" with executive colleagues. Last week, the DUP blocked two separate proposals from the health minister to extend restrictions by triggering a cross-community vote. The DUP has been criticised by other Stormont parties for using the measure. It can be used on any issue in the executive, of three or more ministers ask for a vote to be taken on that basis, effectively giving parties with enough ministers a veto. NI Executive aiming to 'protect' Christmas period Covid-19 row lays bare Stormont's rocky foundations NI Covid restrictions extended for one more week On Monday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a ""matter of profound concern and regret"" that the DUP had used it twice. Mrs Foster said the veto was used on a ""key decision"" because of the impact of restrictions on the economy. ""I hope we can come to decisions in a collaborative, collegiate way... I want to make sure we go forward together,"" she added. The first minister also dismissed reports that an executive meeting scheduled for Tuesday had been cancelled. ""We normally only meet on a Thursday - nothing should be read into that at all. Government is continuing, we don't need an executive to make that happen,"" she said. Justice Minister Naomi Long said shehad considered her position in the executivebecause of last week's handling of restrictions, and said continued use of the veto was an ""abuse of power"" by the DUP. Education Minister Peter Weir said an extended Christmas break could lead to a greater spread of the virus Some of the current Covid-19 restrictions are due to end on Friday with the reopening of close-contact services and unlicensed hospitality businesses. Restaurants, pubs and hotels can reopen on 27 November, as the rest of the Covid-19 restrictions introduced on 16 October will expire at midnight on 26 November. Ms O'Neill has said the executive will doall it can to ""protect"" as much of the Christmas periodas possible. It comes after NI's chief scientific adviser warned further Covid-19 restrictions will likely be recommended before Christmas. Prof Ian Young said mid-December could be the ""big risk period"". A further nine people with Covid-19 have died in NI, the Department of Health has said. The death toll recorded by the department now stands at 878. There were also another 549 confirmed cases of the virus recorded in the last 24-hour reporting period. A total of 47,711 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began. On Tuesday, 11 more people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the Republic of Ireland died, according to Department of Health figures. The total number of Covid-19 related deaths in the country is now 1,995. In addition, a further 366 cases of coronavirus were confirmed, bringing the total number to 68,686. On Tuesday, Education Minister Peter Weir said schools would not be closing early for the Christmas holidays for two reasons. ""We want to ensure the maximum amount of education for our young people and I don't want to see any further disruption to that,"" he said. ""It's also the case that we've seen the biggest problems not within the controlled environment of schools but actually some of the things that have happened outside of schools. ""If we simply inject an extra week of holiday into the Christmas period, from a public health point of view, it's likely to lead to much higher levels of socialisation and greater spread of the virus."" Mr Weir was speaking during a visit to a school in Bangor where he announced an additional Â£5m for schools to pay for mental health help for pupils. The minister said the money would allow schools to pick which wellbeing initiatives they want to invest in. In other coronavirus developments on Tuesday: Almost 15,000self-isolation grants,externalhave been paid out in NI since the scheme was set up in March, amounting to Â£2.1m - it is a non-repayable grant for workers on low incomes who are experiencing financial difficulties as a result of being told to self-isolate The Irish cabinet is expected to agree on newfines of less than â¬300 for people drinking alcohol outdoors.

"EasyJet has reported its first annual loss in the airline's 25-year history as the coronavirus crisis continues to affect the travel industry deeply. The airline posted a loss of Â£1.27bn for the year to 30 September as revenues more than halved. EasyJet added that it expected to fly at just 20% of normal capacity into next year. The pandemic has hit airlines hard, with lockdowns and restrictions cutting the number of people travelling. However, EasyJet welcomed the possibility of a Covid-19 vaccine being rolled out, and said underlying demand was strong for air travel. Chief executive Johan Lundgren told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said that the recent developments on Covid vaccines ""certainly is good news, because we know that is going to be a very critical part of the recovery"". ""But I don't think it's only about the vaccine, I think it's also about the fact that we need to have testing in place, we need to have also refined development of the quarantine system,"" he added. ""We know that people want to travel. On the news of the vaccine last Monday, bookings were up close to 50%, so it just gives evidence to the fact that any good news that comes out of here makes people more confident making bookings going forward."" EasyJet's revenues plunged due to government travel restrictions in most of its markets,the airline said,external. These included full national lockdowns, which led the airline to ground its entire fleet for 11 weeks. There was some recovery in demand in the summer as lockdowns were eased, but widespread quarantine restrictions in September once again eroded demand, it said. The news on possible vaccines may be good, but EasyJet is still hunkering down for a long, hard winter, running a fifth of its normal schedule. The airline was one of the original standard bearers for low-budget aviation in Europe. Its business model has always been focused on cost control. Even so, it has had to cut its outgoings aggressively in order to save cash. A tight belt has become even tighter - although deals with unions allowed it to tone down plans for sweeping redundancies. The simple fact is that if airlines can't fly, they can't make money, and even a relatively lean operation like EasyJet will burn through cash. But there is one positive. The airline believes that passengers still want to fly and demand will be there once travel restrictions have been removed. The pandemic has put great pressure on EasyJet's finances, forcing it to take on more debt, go to shareholders for extra cash, and sell dozens of its aircraft. Mr Lundgren said that in the near future EasyJet should not need more than the Â£3bn it has already raised. ""No, we think we're in a good position at this moment in time,"" he told the Today programme. ""But we always also said that we're going to continue to review all the options that are out there to make sure we can cope with the circumstances, and you know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about when the recovery is going to take place."" Norwegian Air faces 'very uncertain future' Rolls-Royce to cut 1,400 jobs as cull continues Boeing to cut 20% of workforce by end of 2021 EasyJet has been making use of UK government support, borrowing Â£600m in April. The airline said on Tuesday that after talks with the Bank of England and the Treasury, it would extend its borrowing under the government Corporate Finance Facility scheme, and stagger repayments. EasyJet's results ""show the stark reality of a global pandemic on a once profitable airline,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""With the vaccine offering light at the end of a very long tunnel EasyJet will have to navigate its way through a lengthy winter saddled with considerable debt."" The airline's management ""has administered some tough medicine"" she said, including cutting its workforce and ""even flying its planes slower to reduce its fuel bill"". ""However, if EasyJet can keep its head above water it could really fly in the second half of 2021 as pent up consumer demand fuels a return to foreign holidays,"" Ms Palmer added.

"From Boxing Day the whole of mainland Scotland will be in the country's toughest tier of restrictions for at least three weeks. So what can you  do - and not do - in level four? Is your area in the toughest level? People should not be meeting in each others houses. However, six adults from two separate households can meet in a public place. Children under 12 do not count towards that total. Exceptions to the ban include another household providing care and support to a ""vulnerable person"". The extended household rule applies in level four. This allows people who live alone - or who are a single adult with children under 18 - being considered part of another household to reduce loneliness and isolation. Where parents do not live in the same household, children can move between their parents' homes. Up to two households - totalling no more than six - can meet in a private garden or a public place like a park. Children under 12 do not count toward that number and they also do not need to maintain social distancing. Young people aged between 12 and 17 can meet up in groups of up to six outdoors. These groups are not subject to the two household limit but physical distancing is required. If you are meeting in someone's garden you can go inside if you need to use the toilet but should wipe down surfaces you touch with antibacterial wipes and use only freshly laundered or paper towels. Restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars will be closed. Takeaways can operate as normal with face coverings and physical distancing rules being followed. Hotels and other accommodation providers can serve food up to 10pm to guests. Room service, including alcohol, is allowed. All holiday accommodation is closed to tourists. Hotels, B&Bs and self-catering can remain open for essential customers - for example anyone who is staying for essential work purposes. Only essential retail can open providing they follow and have implemented Scottish government guidance to ensure the safety of customers and staff. Click and collect, on-line services and outdoor retail, such as garden centres, outdoor markets and car lots, can also remain open. Services which involve ""close contact"" cannot operate. These include hairdressers; barbers; hair removal and massage therapies. They also include dress-fitting; tattoo and piercing and indoor portrait photography. Indoor sports facilities, including gyms, have to close. You are permitted to meet others outdoors for informal exercise or sport and outdoor gyms can remain open. Outdoor non-contact sports are permitted for all age groups. All leisure and entertainment premises, including cinemas, must be closed. Film and TV production can continue to take place. All public buildings such as libraries have to close, however, library click and collect services can still operate. Churches, mosques, temples and synagogues can remain open subject to two metre distancing and a maximum of 20 worshippers. Wedding ceremonies and civil partnerships, with a maximum of 20 people (including the couple) are allowed - providing the venue is big enough for 2m distancing. Face coverings must be worn except for the couple getting married and the person conducting the service. However, receptions cannot follow a ceremony. Funerals and wakes can take place with a maximum capacity of 20 guests. Education Schools, colleges and universities can remain open. Early learning and childcare can continue to operate. However, informal childcare is only allowed for anyone employed in essential or permitted services. If you want to delve deeper into the Scottish government's level four rules, clickhere,external.

"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a quick recap of the main coronavirus stories in the UK today: Thanks for tuning in to our coverage today - the live page will end soon. Here are the headlines from around the world today: Radio 4 PM A former UK government adviser, Prof Neil Ferguson, says numerous families could become a ""bubble"" for a week to be able to spend Christmas together. A so-called ""bubble"" allows people who live in different households to be treated as one, in order to meet virus rules. For example, anadult living on their own,externalin England can form a bubble with another household of any size. Prof Ferguson toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""You could think of allowing three or four households to bubble
together for a week but not contact anybody else, which would give more
opportunity to see loved ones but not a free for all. ""And that, I mean
modelling, would suggest increases risk somewhat but in a controllable way.â Ferguson's modelling was used by the government before the lockdown in March. The governments from the four nations have held talks about taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. According to our audience research, this graphic produced by the World Health Organization showing coronavirus symptoms was one of the most shared posts on Facebook
on Monday. It's a good reminder of what the more serious symptoms are, as well as the less common ones, as new Covid cases are on the rise in many parts of the world. We have more here onwhat coronavirus symptoms are and how to protect yourself.  This video can not be played Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate?

centre of a row about government aid for Polish performers hit by the pandemic. The fund worth 400m zloty (Â£80m) has now been frozen, after complaints
that the right-wing nationalist government was favouring disco polo stars who
are already well off. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said the aid issue had become
politicised. Defending the Cultural Support Fund (FWK), he tweeted that âthe recipients
of support were not determined by sympathies, but by an algorithm showing who had lost
income as a result of the pandemicâ. But the funding â desperately needed by many artists whose
income has dried up â is now under review. The website Notes from Poland names several disco polo stars
who each got more than 500,000 zloty (Â£100,000). Disco polo - heavy on drum machines and synthesisers - is popular at Polish weddings, with its simple tunes and lyrics. Composer Piotr Rubik was among the critics, mocking the fund
by singing: âIâll form a disco polo band and get two million.â Adam Murray has been reminiscing about times he's had at Bramall Lane Radio 1 DJ Jordan North faced his fear of snakes on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here by chanting about his ""happy place"" - Burnley FC's Turf Moor stadium. While there were plenty of jokes to be had (including whether it was a happier place for Burnley fans or away teams) it also got fans thinking about their own home grounds, which they're missing during the pandemic. We've been talking to some of them about their memories. They include Adam Murray, who says being held up by his dad at Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's ground, is one of his first memories. ""When it's something you've had around you all your life, it's generally a happy place - win, lose or draw, it's about the family time and the time with your friends,"" he says. Read more fans' stories here. Northern Irish coupleOwen and Bredge Ward, both 69, from County Tyrone, died just 12 hours apart after contracting Covid-19. Martin, one of their six children, held his father's hand as he died and said he was in ""complete shock"". He said his parents ""were always together"" and ""doted"" on their nine grandchildren. He said his mother's condition started to improve last week, but then his father ""went downhill"" and was put into a coma. ""Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse. ""She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too.""

According to their keepers, the animals have noticed the lack of visitors and are beginning to miss the attention they would normally get from humans. London Zoo had to close its doors to the public for the second time during England's four-week November lockdown.  Pfizer has launched a pilot delivery programme
for its Covid-19 vaccine in four US states. Last week Pfizer announced its vaccine had been90% effective in preventing the illness during trials. However the vaccine must be shipped and stored
at -70C (-94F) to remain effective, posing a significant logistical challenge for its distribution. Pfizer will run the pilot delivery programme
in Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico and Tennessee. The varied size of the states
will allow the company to see how the vaccine can reach everyone in those
areas. âWe are hopeful that results from this vaccine
delivery pilot will serve as the model for other US states and international
governments, as they prepare to implement effective Covid-19 vaccine programmes,â

But today, the government figures aren't going to be available until after 18:00 due to ""technical difficulties"", accordingto a message on the site,external. We will updateour own data pagewhen we have those figures. Parts of England haverecorded thousands of additional coronavirus casesafter the government changed its recording methods. Cases were assigned to the address in a patient's NHS records, but this did not account for those who have recently moved, such as students relocating for university. Officials say the change had not affected decisions about local or national lockdown restrictions. Newcastle saw cases rise by more than a quarter, followed by York and Lincoln. Richmondshire, in North Yorkshire, had the highest proportion of cases re-allocated away from the area. Of the area's 677 cases between 1 September and 15 November, 124 were placed elsewhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China, where the virus started, is one of the few
countries where life is back to a version of normal, post-coronavirus. No new domestic symptomatic or asymptomatic cases have been
detected in the last 24 hours. But there are growing concerns in the country
that Covid-19 may enter China via imported frozen goods. A number of localised outbreaks earlier in the year in cities like Beijing and Qingdao were linked to handlers of imported frozen products,external, and China has been increasingly warning that cold-chain goods (those perishable goods transported at low temperatures) pose a serious threat to communities. On Monday, Chinaâs customs agency said it had âstepped up
effortsâ to prevent the virus from entering China by contacting all of the 109
countries that export cold-chain goods to the country.It also said it had suspended receiving goods from some 99 companies in 20 countries that export to China,external. However, New Zealandâs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has
questioned claims that the coronavirus was found on beef exports from New
Zealand, given the country has also returned to a version of normal. She said
she had been advised New Zealand exports were stored with products from
Argentina that had tested positive, following reports New Zealand goods had
tested positive in the Chinese city of Jinan. âWe are confident our products are not exported
with Covid on them, given our status as being essentially Covid-19 free,â she told a press conference on Monday. A spokesperson from the NZ Ministry of
Foreign Affairs added: âNew Zealand has not been informed of this officially by the
Chinese authorities. âNew Zealand officials are working now to
ascertain the origin and veracity of these reports.â Some of the major dates in Scotland's virus response:  Police chiefs have suspended the use of Â£10,000 fines for those who breach coronavirus rules on large gatherings. It comes amid concerns over potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenge the fees in court. When fines go to court they are means-tested, meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. The National Police Chief's Council (NPCC) said it was working ""urgently"" with the government over the issue.

falling on the ski slopes, and Swiss minds are turning to their favourite dish.
Nothing is more comforting than sitting round the table with good friends,
sharing a cheese fondue. But in these troubled Covid times, some are
questioning the fondue ritual: spearing a piece of bread, dipping it in that
communal pot of bubbling cheese, and transferring it straight to your mouth. No
self-respecting Swiss wants to endure a winter without fondue â but is it safe? Arnaud Favre, who organizes the annual fondue
festival, is sure it is. âLots of people have been worrying about
whether itâs OK to eat fondue, with your friends, or even with people you donât
know â the answer is, thereâs really nothing to fear. The Covid virus dies
above 50 degrees Centigrade - fondue is cooked at 80 degrees."" Unfortunately for Arnaud, his fondue festival
has been cancelled this year â big crowds of cheese-hungry people are too much
of a risk. Restaurants in many parts of Switzerland are closed too â but a
fondue at home with friends is still allowed, although the ritual is becoming
more flexible. Instead of one fork, fondue fans suggest, have
two, one for dipping, and the other for eating. The advice seems to be working
â as the Swiss brace themselves for this Covid winter, fondue sales are rising. The boss of Moderna, the company behind one of the Covid vaccines whose initial trial results have recently been announced, has warned that long negotiations over purchasing the
new vaccine will slow down deliveries to European countries. Stephane Bancel told AFP news agency that other
nations who have signed deals will get priority. The UK has already signed a
deal with Moderna to supply five million doses from next spring. âIt is clear that with a delay this is not
going to limit the total amount but it is going to slow down delivery,â he
said. Earlier this week, Moderna announced its
vaccine was nearly 95% effective, according to early data. Moderna is planning to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the US in the next few weeks. US country singer Dolly Parton has been credited with helping fundthe successful Moderna vaccine announced on Monday, thanks to a  large financial donation she made earlier this year. Back in April, the country singer announced she was donating $1m (Â£800,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, for coronavirus research. Allow Twitter content?

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether the toughest Covid restrictions are to be imposed in the west of Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said on Monday it was ""likely"" that some areas would be moved from level three to level four. This could include the six councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area, including Glasgow itself. There has also been speculation that both North and South Lanarkshire could be moved to the highest tier. Rising numbers of cases have previously been highlighted in Stirling and in both East and South Ayrshire, which are all currently in level three. But the government has also been looking at whether any areas could move down a level, with Ms Sturgeon saying: ""This is not a one-way street"". Any changes, which will be announced by Ms Sturgeon at about 14:20, would come into force from Friday. What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? No part of Scotland has been placed in the top level since the tiered system - which ranges from level zero to level four and is reviewed on a weekly basis - came into force on 2 November. However, there have been concerns that infection rates are not reducing quickly enough - or are continuing to rise - in some of the 22 areas that are currently in level three. Level four restrictions would see the closure of a wide range of premises including non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers, gyms and leisure centres, although schools would remain open. Ms Sturgeon has said that moving to the highest level ""for a limited period in some areas"" could help protect the NHS and pave the way for some easing of restrictions at Christmas. Level four is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March. Socialising would not be allowed in people's homes, but six people from two households could still meet outdoors and there would be no limit on outdoor exercise. However, people would be advised to minimise the number of meetings with people from other households, and to follow social distancing guidance. Those living under level four restrictions would be advised to avoid any unnecessary travel out of the area, and to keep journeys within the area to an absolute minimum. The premises which would close include: Non-essential shops Pubs, restaurants and cafes, although takeaways can still operate Leisure centres and gyms Hairdressers, barbers, beauticians and any other close contact retail services Indoor visitor attractions and all leisure and entertainment premises. However, schools would remain open full-time. Read more about the level four restrictions The Scottish Retail Consortium has warned of the impact that the highest tier of restrictions would have on shops. Director David Lonsdale said: ""The scientific evidence indicates retail is a safe environment and closing stores will do little to suppress the virus. ""However, the economic impacts of forced closure during the Christmas trading period are severe, which is why it should only be a last resort."" In neighbouring East and West Dunbartonshire, council leaders are split over whether a move to level four is now the right thing to do. Andrew Polson, the Conservative leader of East Dunbartonshire, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme the Scottish government must show ""extreme caution"" because of the impact on businesses and people's mental health. He said: ""I know the people of East Dunbartonshire are looking for some relaxation of the restrictions. ""We should be continuing with the tier system we've got. We are only two weeks into it and I think we need to let it go."" Rising numbers of cases have previously been highlighted in Stirling Jonathan McColl, the SNP leader of neighbouring West Dunbartonshire Council, said the move to level four would be ""incredibly difficult"" for businesses. However, he insisted the threat to public health was the number one priority. He told Good Morning Scotland: ""It has to be a major consideration for the government of the impact it has on, particularly, small and medium-sized enterprises that don't have the same capacity to be as resilient. ""But you have to look at the whole thing in the round. We are trying to protect people and save lives here. ""The absolute worst-case scenario would be if we were in a lockdown over Christmas. Nobody wants that."" Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute, Borders, and Dumfries and Galloway are currently in level two, with Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles in level one. Ms Sturgeon's cabinet will decide on any changes on Tuesday morning before she makes a statement in the Scottish Parliament in the afternoon. Talks have been taking place between the Scottish government and the local authorities in the areas which are under threat of being placed into level four. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said on Friday that councils in the west of Scotland had been warned that the move to level four was possible. On Monday, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I think it is likely that we will see some areas go to level four this week. ""But is it inevitable? Until we have taken that final decision, no of course it's not.""

We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a quick recap of the main coronavirus stories in the UK today: Thanks for tuning in to our coverage today - the live page will end soon. Here are the headlines from around the world today: Radio 4 PM A former UK government adviser, Prof Neil Ferguson, says numerous families could become a ""bubble"" for a week to be able to spend Christmas together. A so-called ""bubble"" allows people who live in different households to be treated as one, in order to meet virus rules. For example, anadult living on their own,externalin England can form a bubble with another household of any size. Prof Ferguson toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""You could think of allowing three or four households to bubble
together for a week but not contact anybody else, which would give more
opportunity to see loved ones but not a free for all. ""And that, I mean
modelling, would suggest increases risk somewhat but in a controllable way.â Ferguson's modelling was used by the government before the lockdown in March. The governments from the four nations have held talks about taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. According to our audience research, this graphic produced by the World Health Organization showing coronavirus symptoms was one of the most shared posts on Facebook
on Monday. It's a good reminder of what the more serious symptoms are, as well as the less common ones, as new Covid cases are on the rise in many parts of the world. We have more here onwhat coronavirus symptoms are and how to protect yourself.  This video can not be played Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate? This video can not be played US senators Sherrod Brown and Dan Sullivan clash over face masks in chamber A Polish brand of dance music â disco polo â is at the
centre of a row about government aid for Polish performers hit by the pandemic. The fund worth 400m zloty (Â£80m) has now been frozen, after complaints
that the right-wing nationalist government was favouring disco polo stars who
are already well off. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said the aid issue had become
politicised. Defending the Cultural Support Fund (FWK), he tweeted that âthe recipients
of support were not determined by sympathies, but by an algorithm showing who had lost
income as a result of the pandemicâ. But the funding â desperately needed by many artists whose
income has dried up â is now under review. The website Notes from Poland names several disco polo stars
who each got more than 500,000 zloty (Â£100,000). Disco polo - heavy on drum machines and synthesisers - is popular at Polish weddings, with its simple tunes and lyrics. Composer Piotr Rubik was among the critics, mocking the fund
by singing: âIâll form a disco polo band and get two million.â Adam Murray has been reminiscing about times he's had at Bramall Lane Radio 1 DJ Jordan North faced his fear of snakes on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here by chanting about his ""happy place"" - Burnley FC's Turf Moor stadium. While there were plenty of jokes to be had (including whether it was a happier place for Burnley fans or away teams) it also got fans thinking about their own home grounds, which they're missing during the pandemic. We've been talking to some of them about their memories. They include Adam Murray, who says being held up by his dad at Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's ground, is one of his first memories. ""When it's something you've had around you all your life, it's generally a happy place - win, lose or draw, it's about the family time and the time with your friends,"" he says. Read more fans' stories here. Northern Irish coupleOwen and Bredge Ward, both 69, from County Tyrone, died just 12 hours apart after contracting Covid-19. Martin, one of their six children, held his father's hand as he died and said he was in ""complete shock"". He said his parents ""were always together"" and ""doted"" on their nine grandchildren. He said his mother's condition started to improve last week, but then his father ""went downhill"" and was put into a coma. ""Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse. ""She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too.""

According to their keepers, the animals have noticed the lack of visitors and are beginning to miss the attention they would normally get from humans. London Zoo had to close its doors to the public for the second time during England's four-week November lockdown.  Pfizer has launched a pilot delivery programme
for its Covid-19 vaccine in four US states. Last week Pfizer announced its vaccine had been90% effective in preventing the illness during trials. However the vaccine must be shipped and stored
at -70C (-94F) to remain effective, posing a significant logistical challenge for its distribution. Pfizer will run the pilot delivery programme
in Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico and Tennessee. The varied size of the states
will allow the company to see how the vaccine can reach everyone in those
areas. âWe are hopeful that results from this vaccine
delivery pilot will serve as the model for other US states and international
governments, as they prepare to implement effective Covid-19 vaccine programmes,â
the company said in a statement. Pfizer says it hopes to have enough safety data

Cases were assigned to the address in a patient's NHS records, but this did not account for those who have recently moved, such as students relocating for university. Officials say the change had not affected decisions about local or national lockdown restrictions. Newcastle saw cases rise by more than a quarter, followed by York and Lincoln. Richmondshire, in North Yorkshire, had the highest proportion of cases re-allocated away from the area. Of the area's 677 cases between 1 September and 15 November, 124 were placed elsewhere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China, where the virus started, is one of the few
countries where life is back to a version of normal, post-coronavirus. No new domestic symptomatic or asymptomatic cases have been
detected in the last 24 hours. But there are growing concerns in the country
that Covid-19 may enter China via imported frozen goods. A number of localised outbreaks earlier in the year in cities like Beijing and Qingdao were linked to handlers of imported frozen products,external, and China has been increasingly warning that cold-chain goods (those perishable goods transported at low temperatures) pose a serious threat to communities. On Monday, Chinaâs customs agency said it had âstepped up
effortsâ to prevent the virus from entering China by contacting all of the 109
countries that export cold-chain goods to the country.It also said it had suspended receiving goods from some 99 companies in 20 countries that export to China,external. However, New Zealandâs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has
questioned claims that the coronavirus was found on beef exports from New
Zealand, given the country has also returned to a version of normal. She said
she had been advised New Zealand exports were stored with products from
Argentina that had tested positive, following reports New Zealand goods had
tested positive in the Chinese city of Jinan. âWe are confident our products are not exported
with Covid on them, given our status as being essentially Covid-19 free,â she told a press conference on Monday. A spokesperson from the NZ Ministry of
Foreign Affairs added: âNew Zealand has not been informed of this officially by the
Chinese authorities. âNew Zealand officials are working now to
ascertain the origin and veracity of these reports.â Some of the major dates in Scotland's virus response:  Police chiefs have suspended the use of Â£10,000 fines for those who breach coronavirus rules on large gatherings. It comes amid concerns over potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenge the fees in court. When fines go to court they are means-tested, meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. The National Police Chief's Council (NPCC) said it was working ""urgently"" with the government over the issue. Read more here Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The days are growing cold, the first snow is
falling on the ski slopes, and Swiss minds are turning to their favourite dish.
Nothing is more comforting than sitting round the table with good friends,
sharing a cheese fondue. But in these troubled Covid times, some are
questioning the fondue ritual: spearing a piece of bread, dipping it in that
communal pot of bubbling cheese, and transferring it straight to your mouth. No
self-respecting Swiss wants to endure a winter without fondue â but is it safe? Arnaud Favre, who organizes the annual fondue
festival, is sure it is. âLots of people have been worrying about
whether itâs OK to eat fondue, with your friends, or even with people you donât
know â the answer is, thereâs really nothing to fear. The Covid virus dies
above 50 degrees Centigrade - fondue is cooked at 80 degrees."" Unfortunately for Arnaud, his fondue festival
has been cancelled this year â big crowds of cheese-hungry people are too much
of a risk. Restaurants in many parts of Switzerland are closed too â but a
fondue at home with friends is still allowed, although the ritual is becoming
more flexible. Instead of one fork, fondue fans suggest, have
two, one for dipping, and the other for eating. The advice seems to be working
â as the Swiss brace themselves for this Covid winter, fondue sales are rising. The boss of Moderna, the company behind one of the Covid vaccines whose initial trial results have recently been announced, has warned that long negotiations over purchasing the
new vaccine will slow down deliveries to European countries. Stephane Bancel told AFP news agency that other
nations who have signed deals will get priority. The UK has already signed a
deal with Moderna to supply five million doses from next spring. âIt is clear that with a delay this is not
going to limit the total amount but it is going to slow down delivery,â he
said. Earlier this week, Moderna announced its
vaccine was nearly 95% effective, according to early data. Moderna is planning to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the US in the next few weeks. US country singer Dolly Parton has been credited with helping fundthe successful Moderna vaccine announced on Monday, thanks to a  large financial donation she made earlier this year. Back in April, the country singer announced she was donating $1m (Â£800,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, for coronavirus research. Allow Twitter content?

"Vulnerable children are often used by so-called ""county lines"" gangs ""County lines"" gangs could be using children in care across north Wales to distribute drugs to get around lockdown restrictions, it is claimed. The urban gangs use young people to expand their markets for drugs like cocaine and heroin into smaller towns. But research for the North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner suggests fewer children are being sent from larger cities. There are also claims some councils have ""their heads in the sand"". But the board representing councils, police and probation said it had not been invited to take part in the study. Drug dealers 'pretending to be uni students' The research by the crime and justice consultancy Crest Advisory comes as England is in the middle of amonth-long national lockdown, with travel restricted between Wales and England. Travel between the countries was also limited during Wales' recent firebreak lockdown and before that local lockdowns. ""Gangs have had to change their business model,"" said North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones ""With the roads being quieter, less people on the trains, it's been easier for the police, British Transport Police, ourselves, to detect people who are coming to north Wales to deal drugs. ""So now what they're doing is trying to recruit children and young people locally and I'm particularly concerned about people in care being recruited to deal county lines."" Crest Advisory conducted interviews with officers from North Wales Police and Merseyside Police, as well as other agencies as part of a wider project looking at county lines and looked-after children. Joe Calouri, head of policy at Crest, told Welsh language news programme Newyddion that gangs were already having to adapt due to more effective police work, but restrictions on movement during the pandemic had ""accelerated"" change. ""They've reacted by recruiting local children,"" he said. This video can not be played What is ""county lines""? ""And because of the use of technology and apps and social media, it's very easy for gangs to recruit children without even meeting them by having peers recruit them and controlling them via social network apps."" The issue of children in care homes - and where they come from - can be complicated. As well as caring for children and young people from the region, a number of care homes in north Wales provide for out-of-area children, including from larger cities in England. But local authorities may not know if children from outside the region are placed in their locality alongside local children. A number of councils in north Wales said they would not have accurate data as it's the responsibility of the placing authority to inform them. One council said it was ""often not informed by placing authorities"". Mr Calouri said local authorities did not engage with the research project. ""We have a concern that perhaps local authorities have their heads in the sand slightly on this issue and are still viewing it as a problem from outside rather than a problem that they need to deal with locally and poses a risk to local children,"" he added. ""Having reviewed their local safeguarding board documents, we don't see much evidence of proactive local planning around the risk or an understanding of what the risks are. ""People in north Wales should be very concerned about the changing threat of county lines. ""Over time we've seen elsewhere in the country how, as gangs start to recruit more locally, and rely less on trafficking children over borders, over time there's a high level of violence, there's post code-style gangs that form and it often results in high level violence and even murder in some situations. ""North Wales have the opportunity to be ahead of the curve in preventing this from happening, but to do that they need to recognise the threat of county lines locally and take action, rather than treating it as a problem that's come in from outside from Merseyside."" In a statement, the North Wales Children's Safeguarding Board, which is made up of local authorities, health board, police and probation, said: ""The request to participate with the Crest Research has not formally been presented. ""We hope that police colleagues at the board will take the opportunity to present the research proposal. ""We are aware that work is currently taking place between Wales Government safeguarding and advocacy unit and the heads of service across Wales around considering further amendments to the practice guide.""

"Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner have met England's regional mayors to discuss ""shifting power out of Westminster"". The UK has had devolved governments since the late 1990s, which work alongside the Westminster Parliament. There are different types of devolution across the UK's nations and parts of England. For many years England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were run by the UK government, based in Westminster in London, but there were growing calls to transfer some of this power to Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Public votes about devolution were held in 1997 in Scotland and Wales, and on both sides of the Northern Irish/Irish border in 1998 as part ofthe Good Friday Agreement. This led to the creation of three elected institutions: the Scottish Parliament the National Assembly for Wales (now called the Senedd) the Northern Ireland Assembly. A number of mayoral posts have also been introduced in England, with varying powers. Speaking ahead of her meeting with the mayors, Ms Rayner said that ""for too long"" Westminster had ""tightly gripped control"" and ""held back opportunities for towns, cities and villages across the UK"". Sir Keir said the government will let ""those with skin in the game - those that know their communities - make much better decisions"". Mayors will be required to draw up local plans to boost economic growth, which is one of the new government's five ""missions"". Mayors visit Downing Street for devolution talks The UK government in Westminster remains responsible for policies which affect just England, as well as overall policy in a number of areas. These include defence and national security, foreign policy, immigration, citizenship and tax - although Scotland has its own powers to raise and lower income tax. The Scottish Parliament sits at Holyrood in Edinburgh. There are 129 elected Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). Scotland already had its own legal and education system. After devolution, it became responsible for many other areas, including: Agriculture, forestry and fishing Education Environment Health Housing Justice, policing and courts Local government Some transport Taxes including income tax, stamp duty and air passenger duty Some welfare powers Its powers were extended in 2012, after the 2014 referendum on whether Scotland should become independent, and again in 2016 through the Scotland Act. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has formed the Scottish government at Holyrood since 2007, continues to argue for full independence. Timeline of Scottish devolution Since May 2020, the National Assembly of Waleshas been known as the Senedd Cymru (Welsh Parliament).It meets in Cardiff Bay, and is made up of 60 elected Members of the Senedd (MS). The Senedd's responsibilities include: Agriculture, forestry and fishing Education Environment Health and social care Housing Local government Highways and transport Some control over income tax, stamp duty and landfill tax Welsh language Timeline of Welsh devolution The Northern Ireland Assembly sits at Stormont in Belfast. There are 90 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs). Devolution in Northern Ireland is different to Scotland and Wales, with government powers divided into three categories: Transferred powerscontrolled by the Northern Ireland Assembly Reserved powersremain with Westminster, but could be transferred in the future if the Northern Ireland Executive wants them. These include prisons and civil defence Excepted powerscannot be moved to Stormont without special laws being made in Westminster. They include elections and national defence Stormont's main powers include: Agriculture Education Environment and planning Health and social services Local government Justice, policing and prisons Control over air passenger duty Transport Culture, language and sport The power-sharing agreement between the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland is also key. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister - one representing each of the two largest parties in power - jointly lead the government in a mandatory coalition. Despite different job titles, they have the same powers. The assembly was dissolved for three years afterrelations broke down between governing parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in- in January 2017. The two parties re-entered devolved government in January 2020 alongside three smaller parties - the Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Alliance. But in February 2022, the DUP again boycotted the executive in protest against post-Brexit trade agreements. Two years later,devolved government was restoredwhen the DUP agreed to returnafter reaching a new trade deal with Westminster. Over the past 20 years, more powers have been given to local and regional mayors in areas like transport and housing. The Mayor of London was the first role of this kind, created alongside the London Assembly, after a referendum in 1998. Sadiq Khan was re-elected for a second term as London mayor in May 2024 The London mayor decides how much money to spend and sets priorities in some key areas. They can set bus and Tube fares, and decide targets for the number of affordable homes. What does the mayor and the London Assembly do? There are a number of other directly-elected mayors across England,with varying powers,external: 13 local authority mayors, who typically have the same powers as local authorities, which have a council leader instead of a mayor (with some exceptions) 11 metro mayors, who can set out plans to boost their local economy and have some powers over housing and transport Norfolk and Suffolk are expected to introduce mayors in May 2025. Local authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are not covered by the legislation that introduced the different types of elected mayors in England.

"It was only on Sunday that the prime minister was hoping to use this week as a reset, relaunch, even rebrand, of his government after the crazy B-movie version of House of Cards that's been playing out in the last few days. But that night Boris Johnson got caught up in the realities of coronavirus again, being ""pinged"" after a meeting with a group of half a dozen MPs, one of whom later tested positive, confining him to Downing Street for the next fortnight. But it's his own gaffe on Monday that will knock his planned return to calm off course. Johnson 'called Scottish devolution a disaster' On a call with a powerful group of northern Tory MPs, the prime minister was asked about devolution. It has groaned and strained under the stress of the pandemic over the last few months, while relations with the other UK governments, as well as some city-region mayors, have been far from straightforward. But it now seems,as the Sun first reported,that Mr Johnson did not just say that things had been a bit tricky. Downing Street is not denying the suggestion that he said it had been a ""disaster north of the border"". This comes six months before vital elections right across the UK, important particularly in Scotland. It is just when the SNP has been starting to warm up its campaign, and just when discussions about how the UK government ought to respond are taking place too.You can read more about that here. It is one thing - and, of course, legitimate - for political rivals to criticise each other. But to suggest the way that Scotland has been run for more than a decade is a ""disaster"" is quite another. And the worry among Scottish Tories is the implication that Mr Johnson's understanding of the political situation is far from complete. Douglas Ross was more polite than some of his colleagues about the PM The notion of devolution used to be controversial in Scotland, and the Tories used to oppose it. But that's not been the case for a long time. What is devolution and how does it work across the UK? Even the UK government's own website says officially that ""devolution has made a real difference to the lives of people in Scotland - and recognises the wishes of the people to have more say over matters that affect them"". Within a few minutes, no surprise, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon responded to what had been reported - frankly a political gift for her to amplify her claims that Mr Johnson doesn't understand Scotland. Shortly afterwards, the new-ish Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, tried, sort of, to justify what had been said. His colleagues are less diplomatic in private. One veteran Scottish Tory told me: ""This is dire - it's totally out of touch and reflects a Westminster-centric view of 1992, not 2020."" Another said: ""The anger tonight is palpable and the worst I've ever seen towards a Tory PM."" There's a sense that the prime minister doesn't have that long to get a grip of the government after a crazy few days. An unforced error on a vital issue like this is hardly likely to help.

"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is demanding another referendum If you can tear yourself away from the counting of votes in the United States, (and I appreciate if you are into politics, that's not easy right now), it is well worth noting what's going on in the warm up to a big political fight on this side of the pond, arguments that we are going to be talking about a lot in the coming months. There is a huge set of elections, straddling many parts of the UK next May, and the most contentious arguments are likely to be in the elections for the Scottish Parliament. In that poll, you guessed it, the central question on the ballot paper is likely to be that of Scottish independence. With a solid trend of polls backing independence in recent months, the SNP is hopeful of another convincing result in the May ballot that will give them a mandate for another referendum on whether Scotland should stay in the UK. Their problem, even if they win convincingly in May, is that the law says it's up to the UK government to decide whether or not there should be another referendum - a vote some Scots are massively eager to have, but which others want like a hole in the head. You can read more about the laws around a referendumhere. Is Scotland moving towards independence? Johnson rejects Sturgeon's indyref2 demand And the SNP themselves said, at the time, that the 2014 referendum was a ""once in a generation opportunity"" for those who want Scotland to be independent. The UK government's problem is that if the SNP does win convincingly in May on a promise of having another referendum, denying that would just amplify the argument that Westminster doesn't listen to what Scots want, and likely increase support for independence. Alister Jack has rejected a referendum for a ""generation"" That's whythe comments from Scottish Secretary Alister Jackthis morning are notable. He said that ""once in a generation"" means there can't be an independence referendum for many, many years. Not surprisingly, the SNP have leapt on his words, even comparing his comments to President Trump's bizarre, sometimes rambling, statements since the US election - so full of claims without evidence about fraud or irregularities in the voting that some of the American TV networks cut him off while he was still talking. One US politician making wild allegations about fraud is obviously not the same as another in the UK hardening their opposition to another kind of poll taking place, which the government has the legal right to permit or not. Yet the UK government does have an acute dilemma, and it knows it. And not everyone in Westminster agrees that the answer to a hypothetical big SNP win in May can be, ""no, not now, and not nearly ever"". To put it mildly, there is a range of opinion in government on how to meet the demands for a referendum in practice. There are concerns among Tories too about Labour's weakness at Holyrood,which you can read about here. At the very least, the UK government intends to be more present, more prominent, in Scotland, to move away from what one government source admits was an attitude of ""devolve and forget"" that has built up over successive UK administrations. But making the argument for the Union more obviously, and more visibly is one thing - there is no guarantee that in the coming months Scottish voters will like what they see.

We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a quick recap of the main coronavirus stories in the UK today: Thanks for tuning in to our coverage today - the live page will end soon. Here are the headlines from around the world today: Radio 4 PM A former UK government adviser, Prof Neil Ferguson, says numerous families could become a ""bubble"" for a week to be able to spend Christmas together. A so-called ""bubble"" allows people who live in different households to be treated as one, in order to meet virus rules. For example, anadult living on their own,externalin England can form a bubble with another household of any size. Prof Ferguson toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""You could think of allowing three or four households to bubble
together for a week but not contact anybody else, which would give more
opportunity to see loved ones but not a free for all. ""And that, I mean
modelling, would suggest increases risk somewhat but in a controllable way.â Ferguson's modelling was used by the government before the lockdown in March. The governments from the four nations have held talks about taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. According to our audience research, this graphic produced by the World Health Organization showing coronavirus symptoms was one of the most shared posts on Facebook
on Monday. It's a good reminder of what the more serious symptoms are, as well as the less common ones, as new Covid cases are on the rise in many parts of the world. We have more here onwhat coronavirus symptoms are and how to protect yourself.  This video can not be played Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate? This video can not be played US senators Sherrod Brown and Dan Sullivan clash over face masks in chamber A Polish brand of dance music â disco polo â is at the
centre of a row about government aid for Polish performers hit by the pandemic. The fund worth 400m zloty (Â£80m) has now been frozen, after complaints
that the right-wing nationalist government was favouring disco polo stars who
are already well off. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said the aid issue had become
politicised. Defending the Cultural Support Fund (FWK), he tweeted that âthe recipients
of support were not determined by sympathies, but by an algorithm showing who had lost
income as a result of the pandemicâ. But the funding â desperately needed by many artists whose
income has dried up â is now under review. The website Notes from Poland names several disco polo stars
who each got more than 500,000 zloty (Â£100,000). Disco polo - heavy on drum machines and synthesisers - is popular at Polish weddings, with its simple tunes and lyrics. Composer Piotr Rubik was among the critics, mocking the fund
by singing: âIâll form a disco polo band and get two million.â Adam Murray has been reminiscing about times he's had at Bramall Lane Radio 1 DJ Jordan North faced his fear of snakes on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here by chanting about his ""happy place"" - Burnley FC's Turf Moor stadium. While there were plenty of jokes to be had (including whether it was a happier place for Burnley fans or away teams) it also got fans thinking about their own home grounds, which they're missing during the pandemic. We've been talking to some of them about their memories. They include Adam Murray, who says being held up by his dad at Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's ground, is one of his first memories. ""When it's something you've had around you all your life, it's generally a happy place - win, lose or draw, it's about the family time and the time with your friends,"" he says.

Martin, one of their six children, held his father's hand as he died and said he was in ""complete shock"". He said his parents ""were always together"" and ""doted"" on their nine grandchildren. He said his mother's condition started to improve last week, but then his father ""went downhill"" and was put into a coma. ""Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse. ""She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too.""

for its Covid-19 vaccine in four US states. Last week Pfizer announced its vaccine had been90% effective in preventing the illness during trials. However the vaccine must be shipped and stored

in Rhode Island, Texas, New Mexico and Tennessee. The varied size of the states
will allow the company to see how the vaccine can reach everyone in those

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China, where the virus started, is one of the few
countries where life is back to a version of normal, post-coronavirus. No new domestic symptomatic or asymptomatic cases have been
detected in the last 24 hours. But there are growing concerns in the country
that Covid-19 may enter China via imported frozen goods. A number of localised outbreaks earlier in the year in cities like Beijing and Qingdao were linked to handlers of imported frozen products,external, and China has been increasingly warning that cold-chain goods (those perishable goods transported at low temperatures) pose a serious threat to communities. On Monday, Chinaâs customs agency said it had âstepped up
effortsâ to prevent the virus from entering China by contacting all of the 109
countries that export cold-chain goods to the country.It also said it had suspended receiving goods from some 99 companies in 20 countries that export to China,external. However, New Zealandâs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has
questioned claims that the coronavirus was found on beef exports from New
Zealand, given the country has also returned to a version of normal. She said
she had been advised New Zealand exports were stored with products from
Argentina that had tested positive, following reports New Zealand goods had
tested positive in the Chinese city of Jinan. âWe are confident our products are not exported
with Covid on them, given our status as being essentially Covid-19 free,â she told a press conference on Monday. A spokesperson from the NZ Ministry of
Foreign Affairs added: âNew Zealand has not been informed of this officially by the
Chinese authorities. âNew Zealand officials are working now to
ascertain the origin and veracity of these reports.â Some of the major dates in Scotland's virus response:  Police chiefs have suspended the use of Â£10,000 fines for those who breach coronavirus rules on large gatherings.

Nothing is more comforting than sitting round the table with good friends,
sharing a cheese fondue. But in these troubled Covid times, some are
questioning the fondue ritual: spearing a piece of bread, dipping it in that
communal pot of bubbling cheese, and transferring it straight to your mouth. No
self-respecting Swiss wants to endure a winter without fondue â but is it safe? Arnaud Favre, who organizes the annual fondue
festival, is sure it is. âLots of people have been worrying about
whether itâs OK to eat fondue, with your friends, or even with people you donât
know â the answer is, thereâs really nothing to fear. The Covid virus dies
above 50 degrees Centigrade - fondue is cooked at 80 degrees."" Unfortunately for Arnaud, his fondue festival
has been cancelled this year â big crowds of cheese-hungry people are too much
of a risk. Restaurants in many parts of Switzerland are closed too â but a
fondue at home with friends is still allowed, although the ritual is becoming
more flexible. Instead of one fork, fondue fans suggest, have
two, one for dipping, and the other for eating. The advice seems to be working
â as the Swiss brace themselves for this Covid winter, fondue sales are rising. The boss of Moderna, the company behind one of the Covid vaccines whose initial trial results have recently been announced, has warned that long negotiations over purchasing the
new vaccine will slow down deliveries to European countries. Stephane Bancel told AFP news agency that other
nations who have signed deals will get priority. The UK has already signed a
deal with Moderna to supply five million doses from next spring. âIt is clear that with a delay this is not
going to limit the total amount but it is going to slow down delivery,â he
said. Earlier this week, Moderna announced its
vaccine was nearly 95% effective, according to early data. Moderna is planning to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the US in the next few weeks. US country singer Dolly Parton has been credited with helping fundthe successful Moderna vaccine announced on Monday, thanks to a  large financial donation she made earlier this year. Back in April, the country singer announced she was donating $1m (Â£800,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, for coronavirus research. Allow Twitter content?

"Rashford says his books will be for every child ""even if I have to deliver them myself"" Footballer Marcus Rashford has followed his free school meals campaign by launching a book club to help children enjoy the escapism of reading. The Manchester United and England star has teamed up with Macmillan Children's Books to promote reading and literacy. Books were ""never a thing we could budget for as a family"", he said. ""I only started reading at 17, and it completely changed my outlook and mentality."" He said reading shouldn't be for ""just those that can afford it"". Allow Twitter content?

The 23-year-old continued: ""I wish I was offered the opportunity to really engage with reading more as a child. ""There were times where the escapism of reading could have really helped me. I want this escapism for all children."" Macmillan said the scheme would see a large number of books being given away to children from vulnerable and under-privileged backgrounds. Rashford added: ""We know there are over 380,000 children across the UK today that have never owned a book, children that are in vulnerable environments. That has to change."" A spokeswoman for the publisher said it would work with Rashford and charities to ""find the most effective mechanisms to reach the children who need them"". The project will begin with an illustrated non-fiction book called YOU ARE A CHAMPION: Unlock Your Potential, Find Your Voice And Be The BEST You Can Be, which will be aimed at children aged 11-16, and published in May 2021. Each chapter will start with a story from Rashford's own life and will cover such topics as the value of education, positive mentality, understanding culture, and female role models. Carl Anka, a journalist for sports media group The Athletic, and Katie Warriner, a performance psychologist, will help write the book. Rashford will then publish two fiction titles for readers aged seven upwards. Meanwhile, the Marcus Rashford Book Club will give away books from the publisher's existing roster ""with the aim of championing the works of creatives from all backgrounds"".

""No matter where you grow up, talent should be recognised and championed. Under the Marcus Rashford Book Club young writers, illustrators and creatives will be seen and they will be offered a platform to shine.""

"This video can not be played Just one month into his new role as consul general, Stephen Ellison saves a university student from drowning A British diplomat hailed a hero fordiving into a river in China to save a drowning studenthas said he was just the ""fastest"" to get his shoes off. Stephen Ellison, 61, consul-general in Chongqing, was walking by a river in a nearby village when he saw the woman struggling in the deep water. Mr Ellison said jumping into the water was a ""split-second"" decision after he was the first to get his shoes off. He told the BBC: ""I'm just happy it was a great ending for everybody."" Video footage filmed by onlookers show the 24-year-old student - who has not been named - struggling in the fast-moving current, before disappearing under a footbridge and emerging face down, apparently unconscious. After slipping into the river on some rocks, the woman became ""submerged for a little while"" and then was ""floating very lifeless on the water"", the consul general, who takes part in triathlons, told BBC Breakfast. Mr Ellison, who is originally from Newcastle, said everything ""happened very quickly"" when he made the ""split-second"" decision to take his shoes off and jump, fully clothed, into the river to save her. ""When I reached her and turned her over, she wasn't breathing, she was unconscious and I really was fearing the worst"", he said of the rescue, which took place on Saturday morning. The diplomat held on to a lifebuoy attached to a rope that had been thrown towards him by passers-by, who then helped pull him and the woman to safety. Mr Ellison said he felt a ""great relief"" when the woman began to breathe, before she was hoisted out of the water by the passers-by. He swam around to shallower rocks and climbed out of the river. He was given dry clothes and warm drinks by ""very kind"" villagers. Stephen Ellison, centre, said the woman was shaken by the experience but recovering Mr Ellison said jumping into the river was not a ""big decision"". ""I'm sure there would have been others into the river very quickly... I think I was the fastest one to get my shoes off, that's all that was,"" he said. He acknowledged there had been some ""some very kind comments"" online about his actions, adding that he was ""so pleased the young girl was OK"". ""I'm just happy it was a great ending for everybody involved,"" he said. He said the student, who is from Wuhan and attends Chongqing University, was shaken by the experience and recovering slowly. But she was extremely grateful and has invited him to dinner with her family next weekend, which he said he would be ""delighted"" to attend. Mr Ellison is head of the British mission in Chongqing where his role is primarily to support bilateral trade links between Britain and China. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring's China media analyst Relations between China and the UK have been rapidly deteriorating over the past year, amid rows over Hong Kong, tech firm Huawei and coronavirus. Yet there's full praise online for Stephen Ellison, with Chinese social media users calling him a ""hero"", a ""role model"" and someone who is ""worthy of admiration"" for saving the student, who media said fell ""while taking pictures"". He's being described as ""uncle"", a term rarely used to describe foreigners. ""You'd call such a person a knight in the UK; in China we call him a hero,"" one user on the popular Sina Weibo site says. ""For such a big official to go into the water himself to save someoneâ¦ you've got to like this,"" another wrote. Footage of the incident filmed on locals' phones has racked up more than one million views after it was posted online by popular media outlets Global Times and Pear Video. It's also got locals doing a bit of self-reflection on how they view foreigners. Despite recent negative feeling towards Britain, many Chinese say they're ""shocked"" that ""so many [local] people were watching, and not a single person rushed to the water themselves"" to help.

The writers were Alexandra Fouche, Cherry Wilson, Lauren Turner, Katie Wright, and Sophie Williams. The editors were Claudia Allen and Owen Amos. We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly so here's a quick recap of the main coronavirus stories in the UK today: Thanks for tuning in to our coverage today - the live page will end soon. Here are the headlines from around the world today: Radio 4 PM A former UK government adviser, Prof Neil Ferguson, says numerous families could become a ""bubble"" for a week to be able to spend Christmas together. A so-called ""bubble"" allows people who live in different households to be treated as one, in order to meet virus rules. For example, anadult living on their own,externalin England can form a bubble with another household of any size. Prof Ferguson toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""You could think of allowing three or four households to bubble
together for a week but not contact anybody else, which would give more
opportunity to see loved ones but not a free for all. ""And that, I mean
modelling, would suggest increases risk somewhat but in a controllable way.â Ferguson's modelling was used by the government before the lockdown in March. The governments from the four nations have held talks about taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. According to our audience research, this graphic produced by the World Health Organization showing coronavirus symptoms was one of the most shared posts on Facebook
on Monday. It's a good reminder of what the more serious symptoms are, as well as the less common ones, as new Covid cases are on the rise in many parts of the world. We have more here onwhat coronavirus symptoms are and how to protect yourself.  This video can not be played Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how long should I self-isolate? This video can not be played US senators Sherrod Brown and Dan Sullivan clash over face masks in chamber A Polish brand of dance music â disco polo â is at the
centre of a row about government aid for Polish performers hit by the pandemic. The fund worth 400m zloty (Â£80m) has now been frozen, after complaints
that the right-wing nationalist government was favouring disco polo stars who
are already well off. Culture Minister Piotr Glinski said the aid issue had become
politicised. Defending the Cultural Support Fund (FWK), he tweeted that âthe recipients
of support were not determined by sympathies, but by an algorithm showing who had lost
income as a result of the pandemicâ. But the funding â desperately needed by many artists whose
income has dried up â is now under review. The website Notes from Poland names several disco polo stars
who each got more than 500,000 zloty (Â£100,000). Disco polo - heavy on drum machines and synthesisers - is popular at Polish weddings, with its simple tunes and lyrics. Composer Piotr Rubik was among the critics, mocking the fund
by singing: âIâll form a disco polo band and get two million.â Adam Murray has been reminiscing about times he's had at Bramall Lane Radio 1 DJ Jordan North faced his fear of snakes on I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here by chanting about his ""happy place"" - Burnley FC's Turf Moor stadium. While there were plenty of jokes to be had (including whether it was a happier place for Burnley fans or away teams) it also got fans thinking about their own home grounds, which they're missing during the pandemic. We've been talking to some of them about their memories. They include Adam Murray, who says being held up by his dad at Bramall Lane, Sheffield United's ground, is one of his first memories. ""When it's something you've had around you all your life, it's generally a happy place - win, lose or draw, it's about the family time and the time with your friends,"" he says. Read more fans' stories here. Northern Irish coupleOwen and Bredge Ward, both 69, from County Tyrone, died just 12 hours apart after contracting Covid-19. Martin, one of their six children, held his father's hand as he died and said he was in ""complete shock"". He said his parents ""were always together"" and ""doted"" on their nine grandchildren. He said his mother's condition started to improve last week, but then his father ""went downhill"" and was put into a coma. ""Fast forward a week and my father was improving and my mother was getting worse. ""She passed away yesterday, then my father, from a position where he was getting better, just completely collapsed and within a couple of hours of my mother dying, he passed away too.""

"Boris Johnson has rejected the request from Nicola Sturgeon The UK government has formally rejected a call from Scotland's first minister for a second independence referendum. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a referendum would ""continue the political stagnation Scotland has seen for the past decade"". And he said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously pledged that the 2014 referendum would be a ""once in a generation"" vote. Ms Sturgeon tweeted that the Tories were attempting to ""deny democracy"". She said Mr Johnson's formal refusal of her request for a referendum to be held later this year was ""predictable but also unsustainable and self defeating"", and insisted that ""Scotland will have the right to choose"". The first minister also said the Scottish government would set out its response and ""next steps"" before the end of the month, and that the devolved Scottish Parliament would again be asked to ""back Scotland's right to choose our own future"". Scottish independence: What might happen next? Brian Taylor: PM's move predictable but not subtle What is a section 30 order? Scottish voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45% in the referendum in 2014. Ms Sturgeon says she wants to hold another vote on independence, andmade a formal request last monthfor the UK government to transfer powers - known as a Section 30 order - to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh that would ensure any referendum is legal. The request came after Ms Sturgeon's SNP, which forms the Scottish government, won 48 of the 59 seats in Scotland in the UK general election. In hiswritten response to Ms Sturgeon,external, the prime minister said he had ""carefully considered and noted"" her arguments. But he said: ""You and your predecessor (Alex Salmond) made a personal promise that the 2014 independence referendum was a""once in a generation"" vote. ""The people of Scotland voted decisively on that promise to keep our United Kingdom together, a result which both the Scottish and UK governments committed to respect in the Edinburgh Agreement."" A large pro-independence march was held in Glasgow at the weekend Mr Johnson said the UK government would ""continue to uphold the democratic decision of the Scottish people and the promise you made to them"". And he said he did not want to see Scotland's schools, hospitals and employment ""again left behind because of a campaign to separate the UK"". The prime minister added: ""For that reason, I cannot agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums"". The formal rejection comes days after the UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said another victory in next year's Scottish Parliament election would still not give the SNP a mandate to hold a referendum. SNP victory 'will not be mandate for indyref2' Ms Sturgeon has previously warned that a ""flat no"" from Mr Johnson to her request would ""not be the end of the matter"". But she has made clear that she will not hold an unofficial referendum similar to the disputed one in Catalonia in 2017, arguing that it would not actually deliver independence as the result would not be recognised by the EU or wider international community. The first minister said: ""The Tories are terrified of Scotland having the right to choose our own future. They know that given the choice the overwhelming likelihood is that people will choose the positive option of independence. ""The Tories - and their allies in the leaderships of Labour and the Lib Dems - lack any positive case for the union, so all they can do is try to block democracy. ""It shows utter contempt for the votes, views and interests of the people of Scotland and it is a strategy that is doomed to failure."" The prospect of an independence referendum on Nicola Sturgeon's preferred timetable - the second half of 2020 - now looks very remote. The first minister is confident that Mr Johnson's refusal will help make the case for independence in the longer term, but for now her options are limited. In the first instance, she is planning another vote at Holyrood to underline the backing of MSPs for a new referendum. With the SNP and Greens holding a majority between them, this is sure to pass - but this has happened before, to little avail. She has not ruled out going to court, but this would hardly accelerate matters - constitutional lawyers have warned that""there are no legal short cuts"",externalaround the political battlefield. So the next clear opportunity to break the deadlock may be the 2021 Holyrood elections. Ms Sturgeon clearly has one eye on that poll already, talking about the Tories being on a ""road back to political oblivion"". Between now and then, another year of constitutional stalemate beckons.

"This video can not be played Just one month into his new role as consul general, Stephen Ellison saves a university student from drowning A British diplomat hailed a hero fordiving into a river in China to save a drowning studenthas said he was just the ""fastest"" to get his shoes off. Stephen Ellison, 61, consul-general in Chongqing, was walking by a river in a nearby village when he saw the woman struggling in the deep water. Mr Ellison said jumping into the water was a ""split-second"" decision after he was the first to get his shoes off. He told the BBC: ""I'm just happy it was a great ending for everybody."" Video footage filmed by onlookers show the 24-year-old student - who has not been named - struggling in the fast-moving current, before disappearing under a footbridge and emerging face down, apparently unconscious. After slipping into the river on some rocks, the woman became ""submerged for a little while"" and then was ""floating very lifeless on the water"", the consul general, who takes part in triathlons, told BBC Breakfast. Mr Ellison, who is originally from Newcastle, said everything ""happened very quickly"" when he made the ""split-second"" decision to take his shoes off and jump, fully clothed, into the river to save her. ""When I reached her and turned her over, she wasn't breathing, she was unconscious and I really was fearing the worst"", he said of the rescue, which took place on Saturday morning. The diplomat held on to a lifebuoy attached to a rope that had been thrown towards him by passers-by, who then helped pull him and the woman to safety. Mr Ellison said he felt a ""great relief"" when the woman began to breathe, before she was hoisted out of the water by the passers-by. He swam around to shallower rocks and climbed out of the river. He was given dry clothes and warm drinks by ""very kind"" villagers. Stephen Ellison, centre, said the woman was shaken by the experience but recovering Mr Ellison said jumping into the river was not a ""big decision"". ""I'm sure there would have been others into the river very quickly... I think I was the fastest one to get my shoes off, that's all that was,"" he said. He acknowledged there had been some ""some very kind comments"" online about his actions, adding that he was ""so pleased the young girl was OK"". ""I'm just happy it was a great ending for everybody involved,"" he said. He said the student, who is from Wuhan and attends Chongqing University, was shaken by the experience and recovering slowly. But she was extremely grateful and has invited him to dinner with her family next weekend, which he said he would be ""delighted"" to attend. Mr Ellison is head of the British mission in Chongqing where his role is primarily to support bilateral trade links between Britain and China. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring's China media analyst Relations between China and the UK have been rapidly deteriorating over the past year, amid rows over Hong Kong, tech firm Huawei and coronavirus. Yet there's full praise online for Stephen Ellison, with Chinese social media users calling him a ""hero"", a ""role model"" and someone who is ""worthy of admiration"" for saving the student, who media said fell ""while taking pictures"". He's being described as ""uncle"", a term rarely used to describe foreigners. ""You'd call such a person a knight in the UK; in China we call him a hero,"" one user on the popular Sina Weibo site says. ""For such a big official to go into the water himself to save someoneâ¦ you've got to like this,"" another wrote. Footage of the incident filmed on locals' phones has racked up more than one million views after it was posted online by popular media outlets Global Times and Pear Video. It's also got locals doing a bit of self-reflection on how they view foreigners. Despite recent negative feeling towards Britain, many Chinese say they're ""shocked"" that ""so many [local] people were watching, and not a single person rushed to the water themselves"" to help.

"Jeremy Corbyn was suspended by the Labour Party in October Labour's ruling body is meeting to discuss Jeremy Corbyn's suspension. Last month, a report from the UK's human rights watchdog (EHRC) said the party broke the law by failing to stamp out anti-Jewish racism in the party. Responding to the report, the former leader said the scale of anti-Semitism had been ""dramatically overstated"" by his opponents, andhe was suspended. Sir Keir Starmer said those who think the issue had been ""exaggerated"" should ""be nowhere near the Labour Party"". However, the decision to suspend Mr Corbyn was taken by the party's General Secretary David Evans, not the new leader. A panel made up of members from the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) is now meeting to decide whether to take further disciplinary action or to lift his suspension. Ahead of the meeting on Tuesday, Mr Corbyn - who has been a member of the party for 54 years - released a statement on Facebook, saying concerns over anti-Semitism within Labour are ""neither exaggerated nor overstated"". But the Board of Deputies of British Jews said their community did not accept ""this pathetic non-apology"". Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from the Labour Party? What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Rules brought in under Mr Corbyn mean NEC panels - made up of five members, advised by a barrister - look specifically at anti-Semitism cases on a monthly basis. The can decide to either: Take no further action Issue a reminder of values - which is a less formal sanction Issue a reminder of conduct - which is closer to a formal warning Rule for a time-limited suspension Rule for an expulsion The panel can also refer any cases to the National Constitutional Committee, which is an elected body in the Labour Party that hears and decides on complaints. The five members of Labour's ruling national executive who will decide Jeremy Corbyn's political fate have a tricky task. Some of the former Labour leader's colleagues on the left of the party wanted him to apologise for his remarks, feeling this was the easiest route to having his suspension lifted. Instead, Mr Corbyn issued a ""clarification"", making it clear he wasn't belittling concerns over anti-Semitism, and that he was referring to the scale of the problem being overstated, not its seriousness. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has called this a ""pathetic non-apology"", so if he is reinstated, the party can expect the row over anti-Semitism to reignite. If, however, further disciplinary action is taken, a section of the left will regard that as a declaration of civil war - something which those closest to Mr Corbyn hope to avoid. After thedamning EHRC reportLabour wants to move on from the toxic issue of anti-Semitism - but is already finding that is easier said than done. Mr Corbyn - who led the party for almost five years - said he had already given a statement to Labour to ""clear up any confusion"" about what he had meant when he responded to the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission's report. He said the report's release ""should have been a moment for the Labour Party to come together in a determination to address the shortcomings of the past and work as one to root out anti-Semitism in our own ranks and wider society"". Mr Corbyn, who is still an MP despite his suspension from the party, said it was ""not his intention"" to say anti-Jewish racism should be tolerated, and he ""regrets the pain this issue has caused the Jewish community"". His statement added: ""To be clear, concerns about anti-Semitism are neither 'exaggerated' nor 'overstated'. ""The point I wished to make was that the vast majority of Labour Party members were and remain committed anti-racists deeply opposed to anti-Semitism."" But the Board of Deputies of British Jews condemned the statement and called for action from Labour. President of the organisation, Marie van der Zyl, added: ""If the party wants to show it is serious about tackling anti-Jewish racism, it will consign this statement, just like the culture which led to the EHRC's damning findings, to the dustbin of history. ""To do otherwise would be a failure of leadership which would risk the party slipping backwards."" Asked about the statement, a Labour Party spokesman said they would not ""give a running commentary on an individual case"". This video can not be played In comments before his suspension from Labour, Jeremy Corbyn said anti-Semitism complaints numbers were ""exaggerated"" Labour has been plagued by allegations of anti-Jewish racism by some of its supporters since 2016, mostly on social media. Anti-Semitic abuse is against the law and in May last year the EHRC - which polices human rights and equalities in the UK - launched an investigation into Labour's handling of complaints about the behaviour of some of its supporters. When it published its report in October, the Commission put some of the blame on ""serious failings"" under Mr Corbyn's leadership of the party. But Labour said it was his reaction to the report that led to his suspension, rather its findings. This video can not be played Kier Starmer: ""An ability to recognise the hurt, draw a line and move on"" Many Labour MPs stood by the decision to suspend Mr Corbyn, including Margaret Hodge, parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement. But his allies in the Commons, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, called for the decision to be reversed. On his Facebook post, the former leader said: ""I hope this matter is resolved as quickly as possible, so that the party can work together to root out anti-Semitism and unite to oppose and defeat this deeply damaging Conservative government.""

"""I am sure 'mum guilt' will be familiar to many parents. Guilt that you are not spending enough time with your family and that you are not giving 100% at work,"" says HR professional Helen Cholmeley. The mum-of-two from Newbury has been juggling part-time work with looking after her daughters for the past decade. Last year, she decided it was time to move on from her previous job at a telecommunications company. But few part-time roles were being advertised, she says. ""It's really hard to progress when you're part-time. If you look at any internal jobs boards, you'll rarely find any part-time roles. I felt it hindered my career and I decided it was time for a change."" Eventually, she spotted a new flexible role at the insurance firm Zurich. The company, which employs 4,500 in the UK, began advertising part-time, job share or flexible options in all job vacancies last year. ""In my first week, my daughter had to have an emergency dentist appointment. I didn't need to worry. I could take the time to be with my daughter without fear. ""Flexibility removes that feeling [of guilt]. I can be a mum and a technology consultant."" How can you find out if you're getting equal pay? Flexible working will be a new normal after virus 'Working from home has made childcare easier' A new a government-backed study for Zurich insurance suggests that women like Helen are 20% more likely to apply for senior roles if they offer flexible hours. Using gender-neutral language in job adverts also generated ""significant change"", it found. The research - which was carried out by the Behavioural Insights Team, a government-backed think tank - found women have struggled to progress in their careers at Zurich in the past. It found there had been a lack of applications from women for senior roles, many of which had not been available on a flexible basis. Female employees reported this had made them less likely to apply. ""We've seen hugely encouraging results, simply by adding six words to our job adverts [offering flexible working arrangements],"" said Steve Collinson, Zurich's head of HR. ""By offering roles that fit flexibly around family life, employers could open the floodgates to a much wider pool of untapped talent. ""This will also help women progress into higher paid jobs whilst fitting other commitments around their careers,"" he added. Since changing its policy on job adverts, the number of women hired for top roles has risen by 33%, it says. Since changing its policy on job adverts, the number of women hired for top roles at Zurich has risen by 33% Alison Martin, the boss of Zurich's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told the BBC's Today programme that the move was also necessary to tackle the firm's gender pay gap - the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. ""We thought this was probably one of the underlying reasons why we have a gender pay gap. It was just over 20% when we last published it, and that's simply too high."" ""So we tried to make sure there were as many opportunities for [women] because, let's face it, the best thing you can do as a company is have a diverse and inclusive workforce."" According to the research, women are more likely to have caring responsibilities and may struggle to progress into more senior roles if they do not offer flexible working options. Some even end up leaving the labour market. The study, which looked at Zurich job vacancies between March 2019 and February 2020, found many more men also applied for roles when they offered flexible working options, suggesting the issue was ""just as important"" for them. Existing part-time employees also reported a stronger sense of ""belonging"" due to the shift, pointing to the fear some workers have of being judged for not working full-time. Minister for Women Baroness Berridge said: ""The benefits of flexible working have really been emphasised during recent months. ""We want to see more employers embracing practices such as working from home and returners programmes, which can have a positive impact for both men and women.""

"Under the tier system in place before England's lockdown, areas such as Nottingham saw tougher restrictions than others The government is seeking ""greater consistency"" as it prepares to reintroduce England's regional Covid tier system next month, the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said ministers were reviewing the measures in each tier. He said he expected a conclusion to be reached ""within the next week or so"". It comes after a senior government adviser saidthe three-tier system used in England before the lockdown may need strengthening. The government hopes to introduce tiers again when the national lockdown ends on 2 December. Meanwhile, in Scotland the toughest level of Covid restrictionsare to be introduced in 11 council areas- including Glasgow - on Friday. The level four rules will see the closure of non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants and gyms. England tiers may need strengthening - adviser How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? What are the lockdown rules where you live? Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast that ministers would look at ""whether the measures that we had in the old tiers were effective"". He pointed out that restrictions had ""varied quite a bit in different parts of the country"", with some areas under the strictest level - tier three (very high) - introducing their own rules in addition to baseline measures. ""I think in the new tiers we would like greater consistency, and we will have to look at the evidence to see which of those measures [were] actually the most impactful on the virus, so that we take the most evidence-based approach that we can do,"" he said. ""We haven't come to a conclusion on that yet, to be perfectly honest, but we will be within the next week or so."" Mr Jenrick said ministers would also look at ""whether the new national measures themselves have had an impact and how great an impact that has been"". ""We won't know that with any certainty until the last week of November,"" he said. He also said it looked as though ""a very large proportion of the population"" would have access to a vaccine in the first half of 2021, and confirmed that the government did not have plans to make it compulsory. Asked in the House of Commons whether the government intended to impose tougher restrictions on tier one (medium) areas, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was ""too early to do the analysis... but of course we remain vigilant"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth responded that MPs would ""soon be asked to make a decision on the future of the lockdown, so the earlier we get that information the better"". Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he was ""a little bit unhappy"" about the idea of either modifying tier one or getting rid of it completely, adding that it was important to balance health needs with the economy. He said he felt the tier system had been working before the national lockdown. ""It may have been slower than a full lockdown, but it was working and I think a return to that with some flexibility, I think will be the right way to go,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains England's Covid tier lockdown system Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia and an adviser to the World Health Organization, also said he believed England would need to return to the tier system after the national lockdown ends. ""What we need to do is make it more responsive and rapid to changes in the epidemic at the local level... then I think we do have a real opportunity to control the epidemic,"" he told the programme. However, he said he hoped there would be some further relaxation over the Christmas period. ""Maybe only for a few days but I think providing that we have some rules still in place and we avoid too big gatherings - I do hope that we can manage to have a more normal Christmas than we might otherwise have been expecting,"" he said. It comes a day after Public Health England's Susan Hopkins - who is a member of the government's scientific advisory group (Sage) - said tier one measures had ""very little effect"" on the spread of the virus. Speaking at the government's evening coronavirus briefing on Monday, she said that, prior to the lockdown, the ""tiering of the country"" had had a ""different effect in each area"". ""Tier three plus"" had led to a reduction in cases in the North West, she said, while tier two ""holds in some areas and not in others"", depending on ""how well individuals are taking that advice in"". However, she added: ""We see very little effect from tier one and when we look at what tiers may be there in the future, we will have to think about strengthening them to get us through the winter months until the vaccine is available for everyone.""

Before England went into its second lockdown this month, nearly a fifth of the population was living in tier three areas. They included those in West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, the Liverpool City Region, Warrington and Nottinghamshire. Some areas introduced tougher restrictions than others, going beyond the baseline tier three measures. For example, betting shops, saunas, tattoo parlours and nail salons wereclosed in Nottinghamshire.

"EasyJet has reported its first annual loss in the airline's 25-year history as the coronavirus crisis continues to affect the travel industry deeply. The airline posted a loss of Â£1.27bn for the year to 30 September as revenues more than halved. EasyJet added that it expected to fly at just 20% of normal capacity into next year. The pandemic has hit airlines hard, with lockdowns and restrictions cutting the number of people travelling. However, EasyJet welcomed the possibility of a Covid-19 vaccine being rolled out, and said underlying demand was strong for air travel. Chief executive Johan Lundgren told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said that the recent developments on Covid vaccines ""certainly is good news, because we know that is going to be a very critical part of the recovery"". ""But I don't think it's only about the vaccine, I think it's also about the fact that we need to have testing in place, we need to have also refined development of the quarantine system,"" he added. ""We know that people want to travel. On the news of the vaccine last Monday, bookings were up close to 50%, so it just gives evidence to the fact that any good news that comes out of here makes people more confident making bookings going forward."" EasyJet's revenues plunged due to government travel restrictions in most of its markets,the airline said,external. These included full national lockdowns, which led the airline to ground its entire fleet for 11 weeks. There was some recovery in demand in the summer as lockdowns were eased, but widespread quarantine restrictions in September once again eroded demand, it said. The news on possible vaccines may be good, but EasyJet is still hunkering down for a long, hard winter, running a fifth of its normal schedule. The airline was one of the original standard bearers for low-budget aviation in Europe. Its business model has always been focused on cost control. Even so, it has had to cut its outgoings aggressively in order to save cash. A tight belt has become even tighter - although deals with unions allowed it to tone down plans for sweeping redundancies. The simple fact is that if airlines can't fly, they can't make money, and even a relatively lean operation like EasyJet will burn through cash. But there is one positive. The airline believes that passengers still want to fly and demand will be there once travel restrictions have been removed. The pandemic has put great pressure on EasyJet's finances, forcing it to take on more debt, go to shareholders for extra cash, and sell dozens of its aircraft. Mr Lundgren said that in the near future EasyJet should not need more than the Â£3bn it has already raised. ""No, we think we're in a good position at this moment in time,"" he told the Today programme. ""But we always also said that we're going to continue to review all the options that are out there to make sure we can cope with the circumstances, and you know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about when the recovery is going to take place."" Norwegian Air faces 'very uncertain future' Rolls-Royce to cut 1,400 jobs as cull continues Boeing to cut 20% of workforce by end of 2021 EasyJet has been making use of UK government support, borrowing Â£600m in April. The airline said on Tuesday that after talks with the Bank of England and the Treasury, it would extend its borrowing under the government Corporate Finance Facility scheme, and stagger repayments. EasyJet's results ""show the stark reality of a global pandemic on a once profitable airline,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""With the vaccine offering light at the end of a very long tunnel EasyJet will have to navigate its way through a lengthy winter saddled with considerable debt."" The airline's management ""has administered some tough medicine"" she said, including cutting its workforce and ""even flying its planes slower to reduce its fuel bill"". ""However, if EasyJet can keep its head above water it could really fly in the second half of 2021 as pent up consumer demand fuels a return to foreign holidays,"" Ms Palmer added.

"Swift (left) has been trying to get her master recording rights back from Braun (right) since he bought them last year US singer Taylor Swift has confirmed a report that music mogul Scooter Braun has sold the rights to her first six albums. US entertainment magazine Variety first reported on Monday that Braun had sold the recordings - known as masters - to an investment fund. It said the deal is thought to be worth more than $300m (Â£227m). Writing on Twitter, Swift said it was ""the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge"". It is the latest development in the dispute between Swift and Braun - Swift has previously accused Braun of trying to ""dismantle"" her musical legacy. There has been no initial response from Braun to the Variety report or Swift's remarks. The BBC has sent an email to Braun for comment. Swift signed a deal with record label Big Machine in 2004 granting it ownership of the master recordings to her first six albums in exchange for a cash advance to kick-start her career. What is the Swift v Braun dispute all about? Taylor Swift 'bullied' by man who now owns her music In the music industry, ownership of masters means you control what can be done with the original recording of a song or album, from re-releases and box sets to making it available for use in an advert or on a streaming platform. Owners of popular songs can earn a huge amount of money. Braun bought Big Machine in June 2019, and with it the rights to most of Swift's work. Since then the pair have been locked in a major battle over control of the music. Swift, as the writer or co-writer of her music, still owns the publishing rights, which means she has power to veto some of Braun's attempts to exploit her recordings. Speaking to Billboard magazine last year, she said she had turned down ""dozens of requests,external"" for the use of Shake It Off every week since Braun had bought her back catalogue. In her latest statement, Swift said she had been ""actively trying to regain ownership of my master recordings"" in 2020 and had tried to enter talks with Braun. She said Braun's legal team wanted her to sign a non-disclosure agreement stating ""I would never say another word about Scooter Braun unless it was positive"". Allow Twitter content?

Then just a few weeks ago, Swift wrote, she was contacted by private equity company Shamrock Holdings who said they had bought her music and album art from Braun. While she was ""open to the possibility of a partnership with Shamrock"", she learnt that under the terms Braun ""will continue to profit off my old music"" for years. ""I simply cannot in good conscience bring myself to be involved in benefiting Scooter Braun's interests,"" she wrote in a letter she sent to the company, which she included in her tweet. She also said she has begun re-recording some of her older music and thanked her fans for their support. ""I love you guys and I'm just gonna keep cruising, as they say,"" she wrote. Was Taylor Swift really banned from playing her hits? Braun pleads with Taylor Swift after death threats Swift and Braun have had a poor relationship for years. When his company, Ithaca Holdings, paid $300m to acquire Swift's former record label last year, Swift saw it as an act of aggression that ""stripped me of my life's work"". She accused Braun - who also manages Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Demi Lovato - of ""incessant, manipulative bullying"". But Braun last year told Variety Magazine that the dispute had ""gotten out of hand"" afterhe and his family received death threats. ""I think there are a lot of real problems in the world, and I think that these problems that are being discussed can be discussed behind closed doors and figured out pretty easily, and it's something I've wanted to do for six months,""he told the magazine,external. Scooter Braun and his wife, cancer activist Yael Cohen Shamrock Capital, which now owns Swift's first six albums, is a private equity firm originally set up by the Disney family. It currently has approximately $2.1bn (Â£1.58bn) of assets under management, including a string of technology and marketing companies. In a statement obtained byBillboard,external, the company said: ""Taylor Swift is a transcendent artist with a timeless catalogue. We made this investment because we believe in the immense value and opportunity that comes with her work. ""We fully respect and support her decision and, while we hoped to formally partner, we also knew this was a possible outcome that we considered. We appreciate Taylor's open communication and professionalism with us these last few weeks. We hope to partner with her in new ways moving forward and remain committed to investing with artists in their work.""

"'The word 'PhD' wasn't in my vocabulary', says Dr Suriyah Bi White applicants are offered places to study for a PhD at a higher rate than black, Asian and ethnic minority candidates, data obtained by BBC Newsnight has found. The programme sent freedom of information requests to 133 UK universities, requesting data for the academic years between 2015 and 2020. Of the 62 universities which responded, all but one had a higher acceptance rate for white applicants. The data shows the imbalance was starkest for black applicants. Fifty one universities provided a detailed breakdown by ethnicity, and this showed black applicants had the lowest proportion of successful offer rates at 33 of these universities. This data includes offers to home and international applicants. A PhD is the highest academic qualification a student can achieve. The degree involves significant independent research into a chosen field. Getting a PhD is a crucial step to progress to an academic career. While at undergraduate level there are more ethnic minority students than ever before, this is not the case for PhD study. At postgraduate research level, the proportion of black and ethnic minority students drops drastically, although this can vary according to the area of study. From the data obtained by BBC Newsnight, one example showed there were 8,088 offers for white candidates, compared to only 386 for those of black ethnicity. Assistant Professor at Durham University, Dr Jason Arday, is one of a minority of black academics in the UK Dr Jason Arday, an associate professor at Durham Universiity, is one of a minority of black academics in the UK. ""Even though I did see a lot of black and [ethnic] minority students at university, I was never actually taught by a person of colour. So that was kind of the first notable omission that I saw,"" he told BBC Newsnight. Dr Arday has conducted research into black students' experiences across universities, and says the barriers are often subtle. They depend on things such as supervisors and lecturers selecting students at undergraduate level to progress onto PhD studies. ""The type of people I saw get cherry-picked were white middle-class people. And that never extended, in my opinion, to black or minority ethnic people."" Universities told to tackle race attainment gap Racism in the UK: 'I feel like an alien' More BAME students win places at Oxford University A first-class or upper-second degree is normally required to go on to postgraduate research. Areport by Universities UK,externalshows that white undergraduate students are awarded higher grades in comparison to their black, Asian and minority ethnic peers. Former Education Secretary Damien Hinds spoke to BBC Newsnight about the degree attainment: ""I think your research on PhDs is important and ground-breaking. What we were absolutely aware of was this gap in attainment at firsts and 2:1s. The Office for Students is focused on this, trying to identify what the blockage is."" Dr Suriyah Bi grew up in Alum Rock, Birmingham, one of the most deprived areas in the UK. She attended a local comprehensive school and - against all expectations - made it to Oxford University, and an academic career as a lecturer. Dr Bi feels her background as a working-class Muslim Kashmiri woman was a block when trying to get into academia. ""The word 'PhD' was not in my vocabulary until I was an undergraduate at Oxford"", she told BBC Newsnight. ""I think when you have a number of multiple intersecting minority identities, you're carrying the burden of what each of those identities brings. And they combine and conflate and make it even more difficult for you."" Funding a PhD can be critical for people from low-income black, Asian and ethnic minority backgrounds. Dr Arday says he had several jobs to pay for his degree, He adds that most of his peers secured funding for their doctorates, but he was not aware this resource was available. ""That information is inaccessible to black and ethnic minority prospective academics."" Dr Arday's experiences and research have left him reflecting about the challenges faced by black people in academia. ""Universities portray this veneer of egalitarianism, fairness, equality and diversity, but are actually one of the biggest facilitators of inequity,"" he said. ""I would always vehemently argue that academics have influence, and... I think it's really important that we should use that platform to challenge structural inequality.""

"Workers at the factories, who live mostly in poverty, allowed the BBC to photograph them anonymously Indian workers in factories supplying the supermarket chains Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury's, and the fashion brand Ralph Lauren, told the BBC they are being subjected to exploitative conditions. Women working at a Ralph Lauren supplier said they had been forced to stay overnight to complete orders, sometimes requiring them to sleep on the factory floor. ""We're made to work continuously, often through the night, sleeping at 3am then waking up by 5am for another full day,"" one woman said in an interview. ""Our bosses don't care. They're only bothered about production,"" she said. The BBC has withheld the names of those who agreed to be interviewed, as well as the names of the factories, to protect the workers' safety. Workers at the supermarket supplier said they had been made to endure conditions which would be unacceptable for staff employed by the same brands in the UK. ""We don't get toilet breaks, we don't get time to drink water on shift. We barely get time to eat lunch,"" one woman said. She said a manager would sometimes stand behind staff in the canteen and blow a whistle to send them back to work. Another employee said staff were forced to work overtime and prevented from going home until extra work was finished. ""They've increased our workload. We're forced to stay late to finish it - or they yell at us and threaten to fire us. We're scared as we don't want to lose our jobs."" The four brands supplied by the factories we investigated all said they were concerned about the allegations put to them by the BBC and would investigate. This young woman feeds her family on a salary of Â£61 per month. She told the BBC it was a struggle. The women working at these garment factories all live in poverty in a rural area of South India. The charity Action Aid, which supports more than 1,200 female garment workers across 45 villages in this specific region, told the BBC that forced overtime, verbal abuse and poor working conditions were routine at the factories in question. Allegations such as these are not confined to the garment industry. Low wages and weak labour laws have long made India an attractive place for foreign brands looking to outsource work. Unions are rare and virtually absent in the private sector, making informal and contract workers especially vulnerable. While inspections are mandatory, rampant corruption and a sluggish system has meant that factories are rarely held to account for breaking the law. The garment industry draws more attention because it's driven by exports and counts some of the world's biggest brands as among its clients. India is the world's second-largest manufacturer and exporter of garments after China. India's garment makers directly employ about 12.9 million people in factories and millions more outside, including their own homes, according to a2019 report,externalthat investigated working conditions in the sector. Several women who spoke to the BBC described a climate of fear at the factory supplying Ralph Lauren. They said managers did not give them notice to work additional hours, instead threatening them with the sack if they were unable to stay on. ""The supervisor always shouts at us,"" one woman said. ""If we make any error in stitching, I'll be taken to the master who is very scary. The master will start swearing and shouting at us. It's a terrifying experience"" Another woman, a widow who supports her family financially, said: ""They ask us to work so late I can't even feed my children at night. They shouldn't treat us like slaves, they should give us respect,"" she said. This worker at a factory supplying the UK supermarkets told us staff do not get water or toilet breaks The claims appear to violate India's Factories Act, which states that no worker should exceed more than 48 hours a week (or 60 hours with overtime), nor should they be made to work for more than nine hours in one day. The law also states that women should only work night shifts if they choose to do so. Ralph Lauren's 2020Global Citizenship and sustainability report,externalsays the company is ""committed to conducting our global operations ethically with respect for the dignity of all people who make our products"". The report also includes a pledge to ensure employees ""must not be made to work excessive working hours"" and says there should be no ""verbal harassment, coercion, punishment or abuse"". The three brands are all members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), and have signed up to itsbase code,externalwhich includes a pledge to ensure working hours are not excessive, overtime is voluntary and that workers are not subject to verbal abuse. In a statement, Ralph Lauren said it was deeply concerned by the allegations put to the company by the BBC and would investigate. ""We require all of our suppliers to meet strict operating standards to ensure a safe, healthy and ethical workplace, and we conduct regular third-party audits at all factories,"" the company said. The factory supplying the fashion brand denied the staff members' allegations and said it was compliant with the law. The three supermarket brands all said they were shocked to hear the reports and were working together to ensure the issues were remedied, in particular on excessive working hours. Sainsbury's said it was ""insisting on a number of actions the supplier must take in order for us to continue to work with them"", including ""immediate actions and ongoing commitments the supplier must make while we continue to closely monitor the site"". Tesco said: ""We don't tolerate any abuse of workers' rights and fully investigated these allegations as soon as we were made aware. We were deeply troubled with what we found."" Women are underpaid throughout global supply chains, according to the charity Action Aid Tesco said its plan included ""prohibiting excessive overtime, strengthening grievance procedures"" and ensuring workers were ""fully compensated at the correct rates for hours they've worked"". Marks & Spencer said it ""undertook an immediate unannounced audit"" in the wake of the claims, the company said it ""identified overtime working practices that are not acceptable"", but disputed worker accounts about access to toilet breaks and water. The company also said it had a ""robust"" plan in place and would be ""undertaking regular unannounced audits to ensure its implementation"". These kinds of brands do not own or operate factories in India, which creates distance between them and working conditions there, but one owner of a clothing supplier - who did not want to be named - told the BBC that if brands push for cheaper clothes it can leave suppliers with no choice but to cut corners to meet orders. ""It's the brand who wants to maximize the profit. So, they push you to a level wherein you have to do the exploitation in order to survive,"" he said. The owner, who used to supply a major UK brand not mentioned in this story, described some factory audit processes as a ""sham"". ""The factory is aware when the auditors are coming, so they keep everything in perfect condition before,"" he said. ""The moment the audit is over, everything goes back to normal, which means exploitation and non compliance."" He said that poor checks and balances, combined with a lack of responsibility by the brands, makes it hard to stamp out that exploitation. ""It is the way of working in the textile industry, it's just not India, it's everywhere."" And as profits are squeezed, women often find themselves losing out. Payslips seen by the BBC show women working in garment factories can earn as little as Â£2.50 per day, making items which, in some cases, sell for hundreds of pounds. The factory workers who spoke to the BBC live in poverty in rural southern India More than 40% of workers surveyed by Action Aid India reported that their average monthly income was in the range of Rs. 2000-5000. (Â£20-Â£50). ""Women are undervalued and underpaid throughout global supply chains,"" said Esther Mariaselvam, the associate director at Action Aid's Chennai office. All of the workers who spoke to the BBC described living in impoverished conditions and said they struggled to survive on their salaries. One woman working at the Ralph Lauren supplier said she supported her entire family on a wage of around 6,000 rs (Â£61 per month), after deductions. Still in her late teens, she became the breadwinner after her father died and now provides for her mother and two sisters. Her salary is within the local legal minimum wage bracket for her job, but labour rights organisations say women like her should be earning more than three times as much. The Asia Floor Wage Alliance organisation which advocates for higher salaries for garment workers in the region, has set a monthly living wage in India of at least 18,727 rs (Â£190). Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have previously made commitments to a living wage. Ralph Lauren has not done so explicitly. But according to payslips seen by the BBC, neither of the factories we investigated appeared to be paying their workers anything close to the Asia Floor Wage Alliance recommended minimum amount. We asked all four brands to comment on the living wage but none of them responded on the specific issue. Charities have called on major brands to do more to protect those in the supply chain feeding their stores Anna Bryher, from the advocacy group Labour behind the Label, said it was the responsibility of brands to ensure fair and safe working conditions. ""If you're a brand and you're making clothing in different countries around the world then you need to look at  whether you're paying your workers enough to live with dignity,"" she said. ""It's your responsibility as the company at the top of the supply chain to know what is happening in your supply chain and to make sure that it's fair."" Local labour laws were not doing enough to address exploitation, the push for change needs to come from the brands themselves,"" argues Vivek Soundararajan, a senior lecturer at Bath University who researches global supply chains. ""Most checks and balances do not include workers voices, they do not include what workers actually need,"" he said. ""I think the brand should take the full responsibility â¦ They may not run the factory, but they get all the benefits."" Photographs by Rextane Nissi S. Additional reporting by Peter Emmerson.

"The English Collective of Prostitutes said new restrictions made it ""more urgent"" that the government provide emergency payments The second national lockdown is going to push sex workers ""even deeper into crisis"", according to a campaign group. The English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP) has called for state support for workers in the coronavirus pandemic. It said people were having to choose between risking their health by working or seeing their family go hungry. Cari - not her real name - from the ECP said the new restrictions made it ""more urgent that the government provide the emergency payments we are demanding"". She said the government needed to address ""sex workers' illegal status that prevents women claiming the entitlements available to other workers"". About 80% of sex workers were single mothers operating in order to take care of their children, she estimated. Former sex worker Cari, from the Bristol area, said while a lot of women had stopped working because of safety concerns, some had continued as they did not have access to any financial aid. ""Those who have to work are being very careful with clients. It is very, very difficult. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't,"" she said. Rachel Mac Dermot, from Bristol's One25 charity, said: ""These women are the most marginalised, the most stereotyped, the most stigmatised. And I hate that. ""They could be your mum, your sister, your daughter, your best friend."" During the pandemic, the charity had to close down its women-only safe space but it has been providing food parcels to women who have been self-isolating. ""It's a bit different at the moment but before the pandemic we had a GP, a sexual health nurse and prescribing nurse visit each week,"" said Ms Mac Dermot. ""Accessing support like healthcare, that you or I might take for granted, can be practically impossible for some women we meet."" Cari said she hoped the government would legalise sex work and acknowledge what sex workers did counted as work. ""Criminalising it makes it so much harder to come forward and access help. Sex workers currently can't even go to their GP's to get help, since it's illegal to do sex work during the pandemic,"" she said. ""But there are also no financial aids for sex workers, so how will this work? We have to decriminalise sex work. We have to."" A government spokesman said: ""We have no plans to change the law around prostitution and are committed to tackling the harm and exploitation associated with sex work. ""Universal Credit is providing a vital safety net to those who need support during the pandemic."" 'Scary' being a sex worker during a pandemic.

"""I am sure 'mum guilt' will be familiar to many parents. Guilt that you are not spending enough time with your family and that you are not giving 100% at work,"" says HR professional Helen Cholmeley. The mum-of-two from Newbury has been juggling part-time work with looking after her daughters for the past decade. Last year, she decided it was time to move on from her previous job at a telecommunications company. But few part-time roles were being advertised, she says. ""It's really hard to progress when you're part-time. If you look at any internal jobs boards, you'll rarely find any part-time roles. I felt it hindered my career and I decided it was time for a change."" Eventually, she spotted a new flexible role at the insurance firm Zurich. The company, which employs 4,500 in the UK, began advertising part-time, job share or flexible options in all job vacancies last year. ""In my first week, my daughter had to have an emergency dentist appointment. I didn't need to worry. I could take the time to be with my daughter without fear. ""Flexibility removes that feeling [of guilt]. I can be a mum and a technology consultant."" How can you find out if you're getting equal pay? Flexible working will be a new normal after virus 'Working from home has made childcare easier' A new a government-backed study for Zurich insurance suggests that women like Helen are 20% more likely to apply for senior roles if they offer flexible hours. Using gender-neutral language in job adverts also generated ""significant change"", it found. The research - which was carried out by the Behavioural Insights Team, a government-backed think tank - found women have struggled to progress in their careers at Zurich in the past. It found there had been a lack of applications from women for senior roles, many of which had not been available on a flexible basis. Female employees reported this had made them less likely to apply. ""We've seen hugely encouraging results, simply by adding six words to our job adverts [offering flexible working arrangements],"" said Steve Collinson, Zurich's head of HR. ""By offering roles that fit flexibly around family life, employers could open the floodgates to a much wider pool of untapped talent. ""This will also help women progress into higher paid jobs whilst fitting other commitments around their careers,"" he added. Since changing its policy on job adverts, the number of women hired for top roles has risen by 33%, it says. Since changing its policy on job adverts, the number of women hired for top roles at Zurich has risen by 33% Alison Martin, the boss of Zurich's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told the BBC's Today programme that the move was also necessary to tackle the firm's gender pay gap - the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. ""We thought this was probably one of the underlying reasons why we have a gender pay gap. It was just over 20% when we last published it, and that's simply too high."" ""So we tried to make sure there were as many opportunities for [women] because, let's face it, the best thing you can do as a company is have a diverse and inclusive workforce."" According to the research, women are more likely to have caring responsibilities and may struggle to progress into more senior roles if they do not offer flexible working options. Some even end up leaving the labour market. The study, which looked at Zurich job vacancies between March 2019 and February 2020, found many more men also applied for roles when they offered flexible working options, suggesting the issue was ""just as important"" for them. Existing part-time employees also reported a stronger sense of ""belonging"" due to the shift, pointing to the fear some workers have of being judged for not working full-time. Minister for Women Baroness Berridge said: ""The benefits of flexible working have really been emphasised during recent months. ""We want to see more employers embracing practices such as working from home and returners programmes, which can have a positive impact for both men and women.""

A so-called ""bubble"" allows people who live in different households to be treated as one, in order to meet virus rules. For example, anadult living on their own,externalin England can form a bubble with another household of any size.

together for a week but not contact anybody else, which would give more
opportunity to see loved ones but not a free for all. ""And that, I mean
modelling, would suggest increases risk somewhat but in a controllable way.â Ferguson's modelling was used by the government before the lockdown in March.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China, where the virus started, is one of the few
countries where life is back to a version of normal, post-coronavirus. No new domestic symptomatic or asymptomatic cases have been
detected in the last 24 hours. But there are growing concerns in the country
that Covid-19 may enter China via imported frozen goods. A number of localised outbreaks earlier in the year in cities like Beijing and Qingdao were linked to handlers of imported frozen products,external, and China has been increasingly warning that cold-chain goods (those perishable goods transported at low temperatures) pose a serious threat to communities. On Monday, Chinaâs customs agency said it had âstepped up
effortsâ to prevent the virus from entering China by contacting all of the 109
countries that export cold-chain goods to the country.It also said it had suspended receiving goods from some 99 companies in 20 countries that export to China,external. However, New Zealandâs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has
questioned claims that the coronavirus was found on beef exports from New
Zealand, given the country has also returned to a version of normal. She said
she had been advised New Zealand exports were stored with products from
Argentina that had tested positive, following reports New Zealand goods had
tested positive in the Chinese city of Jinan. âWe are confident our products are not exported
with Covid on them, given our status as being essentially Covid-19 free,â she told a press conference on Monday. A spokesperson from the NZ Ministry of
Foreign Affairs added: âNew Zealand has not been informed of this officially by the
Chinese authorities. âNew Zealand officials are working now to
ascertain the origin and veracity of these reports.â Some of the major dates in Scotland's virus response:  Police chiefs have suspended the use of Â£10,000 fines for those who breach coronavirus rules on large gatherings. It comes amid concerns over potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenge the fees in court. When fines go to court they are means-tested, meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. The National Police Chief's Council (NPCC) said it was working ""urgently"" with the government over the issue. Read more here Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The days are growing cold, the first snow is
falling on the ski slopes, and Swiss minds are turning to their favourite dish.
Nothing is more comforting than sitting round the table with good friends,
sharing a cheese fondue. But in these troubled Covid times, some are
questioning the fondue ritual: spearing a piece of bread, dipping it in that
communal pot of bubbling cheese, and transferring it straight to your mouth. No
self-respecting Swiss wants to endure a winter without fondue â but is it safe? Arnaud Favre, who organizes the annual fondue
festival, is sure it is. âLots of people have been worrying about
whether itâs OK to eat fondue, with your friends, or even with people you donât
know â the answer is, thereâs really nothing to fear. The Covid virus dies
above 50 degrees Centigrade - fondue is cooked at 80 degrees."" Unfortunately for Arnaud, his fondue festival
has been cancelled this year â big crowds of cheese-hungry people are too much
of a risk. Restaurants in many parts of Switzerland are closed too â but a
fondue at home with friends is still allowed, although the ritual is becoming
more flexible. Instead of one fork, fondue fans suggest, have
two, one for dipping, and the other for eating. The advice seems to be working
â as the Swiss brace themselves for this Covid winter, fondue sales are rising. The boss of Moderna, the company behind one of the Covid vaccines whose initial trial results have recently been announced, has warned that long negotiations over purchasing the
new vaccine will slow down deliveries to European countries. Stephane Bancel told AFP news agency that other
nations who have signed deals will get priority. The UK has already signed a
deal with Moderna to supply five million doses from next spring. âIt is clear that with a delay this is not
going to limit the total amount but it is going to slow down delivery,â he
said. Earlier this week, Moderna announced its
vaccine was nearly 95% effective, according to early data. Moderna is planning to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the US in the next few weeks. US country singer Dolly Parton has been credited with helping fundthe successful Moderna vaccine announced on Monday, thanks to a  large financial donation she made earlier this year. Back in April, the country singer announced she was donating $1m (Â£800,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, for coronavirus research. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Lack of co-operation from Trump administration 'more embarrassing than debilitating' US President-elect Joe Biden has warned that ""people may die"" if his incoming administration continues to be impeded by incumbent Donald Trump. Mr Biden said co-ordination was needed to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. He called President Trump's refusal to acknowledge he lost the election, despite calls to do so from both sides, ""totally irresponsible"". The Trump campaign launched a flurry of legal challenges in the wake of the 3 November vote to contest ballot counts. The president's team is trying to have courts overturn votes in key states on the grounds that many ballots were invalid or improperly counted. So far those efforts have failed and no evidence of significant fraud has emerged. President-elect Biden, a Democrat, has 306 votes in the electoral college, surpassing the 270 threshold needed to win. Yet Mr Trump, a Republican, tweeted on Monday: ""I won the Election!"" How is President Trump challenging the result? Is this Covid wave in US the worst yet? The government agency that launches transition process - the General Services Administration (GSA), headed by a Trump appointee - has yet to recognise Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris as winners. This leaves them without access to sensitive government briefings that are normally provided to an incoming administration. This video can not be played How to move on after the US election Aides to the president-elect have said that Mr Trump's refusal to engage in a transition also means Mr Biden's team has been excluded from planning around a vaccination distribution strategy. Speaking in his home state of Delaware on Monday, Mr Biden said of the stalled transition: ""Does anyone understand this? It's about saving lives, for real, this is not hyperbole."" ""More people may die if we don't co-ordinate,"" he added. Calling nationwide vaccine distribution a ""huge undertaking"", Mr Biden said that if his team had to wait until 20 January - his presidential inauguration - until they could begin work on the distribution programme, they would be behind by ""over a month, month and a half"". Asked if he would encourage state leaders to reinstate stay-at-home orders, the president-elect sidestepped, and instead called on officials to encourage mask-wearing. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien spoke of a ""professional transition"" to the next administration on Monday. His tone was different from that of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who spoke of a ""second Trump administration"" last week, and others who act as though the president will remain. When I asked Judd Deere, a spokesman here at the White House, about Mr O'Brien's remarks and his own role in the transition, Mr Deere shot the idea down: ""There's not a transition at this point."" When I asked about advice he'd give to those who will come after him, he got a bit testy: ""I don't speak in hypotheticals."" His remarks reinforce those of the secretary of state, but clash with those of the national security adviser, an unsurprising development, given that their boss is himself a bundle of contradictions. He has tweeted about a Biden victory one moment and then reversed himself, and his cabinet secretary, adviser and others reflect his zig-zaggy approach. The Wisconsin Elections Commission on Monday said the Trump campaign would have to pay nearly $8m (Â£6m) for a vote recount in that state - which Mr Biden appears to have won by 20,000 ballots - if it still wanted one. Why 2020 is not the same as the 2000 recount How will this endless US election end? Facebook removes racist posts about Kamala Harris But in a consolation for Mr Trump, Georgia officials said they had found nearly 2,600 ballots that had not been counted in a Republican-leaning county on election night. A voting official in the state, Gabriel Sterling, said the ballots were overlooked because of ""a person not executing their job properly"". The isolated discovery was expected to improve Mr Trump's vote count by a net 800 - not by enough to overturn Mr Biden's lead of more than 14,000 ballots. Georgia is conducting a statewide, by-hand recount because of the 0.3% margin separating the rivals. Meanwhile, the official overseeing the recount, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, told CNN on Monday that he had been coming under pressure from a fellow Republican, Trump ally and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, to disqualify legally posted ballots in certain counties. Mr Graham denied the claim, telling Politico the two had merely had a ""very pleasant"" conversations about signature verification processes.

"This video can not be played Hurricane Iota will bring torrential rain to parts of Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize and Guatemala A powerful hurricane has brought torrential rains and strong winds to Nicaragua's Caribbean coast, two weeks after another devastating storm hit. Iota made landfall as a category four storm near the town of Puerto Cabezas, where patients had to be evacuated from a makeshift hospital after its roof was ripped off. Residents are in shelters, and there are fears of food shortages. The storm has weakened and Honduras is expected to be hit later on Tuesday. Before making landfall in Nicaragua, Iota had brought high winds and flooding to Colombia's Caribbean coast The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) saidIota was now a category two storm,,externalbut warned it could bring life-threatening storm surges, catastrophic winds, flash flooding and landslides. Number of named Atlantic storms breaks records Why do storms have names? Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms Iota struck Nicaragua on Monday evening with sustained winds of nearly 155mph (250km/h), the NHC said. It strengthened at sea to a category five storm but it weakened as it made landfall. In Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, the storm damaged wooden homes, flooded streets and cut off electricity. Residents said the wind ripped away the roofs of houses ""like they were made of cardboard"". ""I haven't eaten. I don't know where I'm going to sleep here,"" 80-year-old Prinsila Glaso told AFP news agency. This video can not be played Heavy rains as Hurricane Iota nears land There were no immediate reports of casualties. Nicaraguan officials said around 40,000 people had been evacuated from areas in the storm's path. ""[Iota] is the strongest hurricane that has touched Nicaraguan soil since records began,"" said Marcio Baca, director of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies. The hurricane is forecast to move inland across the country before hitting southern Honduras. The effect of the rains could be particularly devastating in areas already drenched by Hurricane Eta. Iota made landfall just 15 miles (24km) south of where Eta hit on 3 November. In Honduras, officials said at least 50,000 people had been removed from high-risk areas. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez warned: ""What's drawing closer is a bomb."" Before reaching Central America the storm moved past the Colombian island of Providencia in the Caribbean, cutting off electricity and killing at least one person, officials said. Colombian President IvÃ¡n Duque said 98% of the infrastructure in Providencia, home to around 5,000 people, had been damaged.

This year's Atlantic hurricane season has broken the record for the number of named storms. For only the second time on record officials have had to start using the letters of the Greek alphabet to start storm names after running out of nameson its traditional alphabetical list. Eta left at least 200 people dead. The worst-hit area was Guatemala's central Alta Verapaz region, where mudslides buried dozens of homes in the village of QuejÃ¡, with some 100 people feared dead.

On Monday, Chinaâs customs agency said it had âstepped up
effortsâ to prevent the virus from entering China by contacting all of the 109
countries that export cold-chain goods to the country.It also said it had suspended receiving goods from some 99 companies in 20 countries that export to China,external. However, New Zealandâs Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has
questioned claims that the coronavirus was found on beef exports from New
Zealand, given the country has also returned to a version of normal. She said
she had been advised New Zealand exports were stored with products from
Argentina that had tested positive, following reports New Zealand goods had
tested positive in the Chinese city of Jinan. âWe are confident our products are not exported
with Covid on them, given our status as being essentially Covid-19 free,â she told a press conference on Monday. A spokesperson from the NZ Ministry of
Foreign Affairs added: âNew Zealand has not been informed of this officially by the
Chinese authorities. âNew Zealand officials are working now to
ascertain the origin and veracity of these reports.â Some of the major dates in Scotland's virus response:  Police chiefs have suspended the use of Â£10,000 fines for those who breach coronavirus rules on large gatherings. It comes amid concerns over potential disparity between the amount being paid by some upfront, compared to those who challenge the fees in court. When fines go to court they are means-tested, meaning the recipient's ability to pay is taken into account. The National Police Chief's Council (NPCC) said it was working ""urgently"" with the government over the issue. Read more here Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The days are growing cold, the first snow is
falling on the ski slopes, and Swiss minds are turning to their favourite dish.
Nothing is more comforting than sitting round the table with good friends,
sharing a cheese fondue. But in these troubled Covid times, some are
questioning the fondue ritual: spearing a piece of bread, dipping it in that
communal pot of bubbling cheese, and transferring it straight to your mouth. No
self-respecting Swiss wants to endure a winter without fondue â but is it safe? Arnaud Favre, who organizes the annual fondue
festival, is sure it is. âLots of people have been worrying about
whether itâs OK to eat fondue, with your friends, or even with people you donât
know â the answer is, thereâs really nothing to fear. The Covid virus dies
above 50 degrees Centigrade - fondue is cooked at 80 degrees."" Unfortunately for Arnaud, his fondue festival
has been cancelled this year â big crowds of cheese-hungry people are too much
of a risk. Restaurants in many parts of Switzerland are closed too â but a
fondue at home with friends is still allowed, although the ritual is becoming
more flexible. Instead of one fork, fondue fans suggest, have
two, one for dipping, and the other for eating. The advice seems to be working
â as the Swiss brace themselves for this Covid winter, fondue sales are rising. The boss of Moderna, the company behind one of the Covid vaccines whose initial trial results have recently been announced, has warned that long negotiations over purchasing the
new vaccine will slow down deliveries to European countries. Stephane Bancel told AFP news agency that other
nations who have signed deals will get priority. The UK has already signed a
deal with Moderna to supply five million doses from next spring. âIt is clear that with a delay this is not
going to limit the total amount but it is going to slow down delivery,â he
said. Earlier this week, Moderna announced its
vaccine was nearly 95% effective, according to early data. Moderna is planning to apply for approval to use the vaccine in the US in the next few weeks. US country singer Dolly Parton has been credited with helping fundthe successful Moderna vaccine announced on Monday, thanks to a  large financial donation she made earlier this year. Back in April, the country singer announced she was donating $1m (Â£800,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, for coronavirus research. Allow Twitter content?

"EasyJet has reported its first annual loss in the airline's 25-year history as the coronavirus crisis continues to affect the travel industry deeply. The airline posted a loss of Â£1.27bn for the year to 30 September as revenues more than halved. EasyJet added that it expected to fly at just 20% of normal capacity into next year. The pandemic has hit airlines hard, with lockdowns and restrictions cutting the number of people travelling. However, EasyJet welcomed the possibility of a Covid-19 vaccine being rolled out, and said underlying demand was strong for air travel. Chief executive Johan Lundgren told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said that the recent developments on Covid vaccines ""certainly is good news, because we know that is going to be a very critical part of the recovery"". ""But I don't think it's only about the vaccine, I think it's also about the fact that we need to have testing in place, we need to have also refined development of the quarantine system,"" he added. ""We know that people want to travel. On the news of the vaccine last Monday, bookings were up close to 50%, so it just gives evidence to the fact that any good news that comes out of here makes people more confident making bookings going forward."" EasyJet's revenues plunged due to government travel restrictions in most of its markets,the airline said,external. These included full national lockdowns, which led the airline to ground its entire fleet for 11 weeks. There was some recovery in demand in the summer as lockdowns were eased, but widespread quarantine restrictions in September once again eroded demand, it said. The news on possible vaccines may be good, but EasyJet is still hunkering down for a long, hard winter, running a fifth of its normal schedule. The airline was one of the original standard bearers for low-budget aviation in Europe. Its business model has always been focused on cost control. Even so, it has had to cut its outgoings aggressively in order to save cash. A tight belt has become even tighter - although deals with unions allowed it to tone down plans for sweeping redundancies. The simple fact is that if airlines can't fly, they can't make money, and even a relatively lean operation like EasyJet will burn through cash. But there is one positive. The airline believes that passengers still want to fly and demand will be there once travel restrictions have been removed. The pandemic has put great pressure on EasyJet's finances, forcing it to take on more debt, go to shareholders for extra cash, and sell dozens of its aircraft. Mr Lundgren said that in the near future EasyJet should not need more than the Â£3bn it has already raised. ""No, we think we're in a good position at this moment in time,"" he told the Today programme. ""But we always also said that we're going to continue to review all the options that are out there to make sure we can cope with the circumstances, and you know, there's still a lot of uncertainty about when the recovery is going to take place."" Norwegian Air faces 'very uncertain future' Rolls-Royce to cut 1,400 jobs as cull continues Boeing to cut 20% of workforce by end of 2021 EasyJet has been making use of UK government support, borrowing Â£600m in April. The airline said on Tuesday that after talks with the Bank of England and the Treasury, it would extend its borrowing under the government Corporate Finance Facility scheme, and stagger repayments. EasyJet's results ""show the stark reality of a global pandemic on a once profitable airline,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""With the vaccine offering light at the end of a very long tunnel EasyJet will have to navigate its way through a lengthy winter saddled with considerable debt."" The airline's management ""has administered some tough medicine"" she said, including cutting its workforce and ""even flying its planes slower to reduce its fuel bill"". ""However, if EasyJet can keep its head above water it could really fly in the second half of 2021 as pent up consumer demand fuels a return to foreign holidays,"" Ms Palmer added.

"Workers at the factories, who live mostly in poverty, allowed the BBC to photograph them anonymously Indian workers in factories supplying the supermarket chains Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury's, and the fashion brand Ralph Lauren, told the BBC they are being subjected to exploitative conditions. Women working at a Ralph Lauren supplier said they had been forced to stay overnight to complete orders, sometimes requiring them to sleep on the factory floor. ""We're made to work continuously, often through the night, sleeping at 3am then waking up by 5am for another full day,"" one woman said in an interview. ""Our bosses don't care. They're only bothered about production,"" she said. The BBC has withheld the names of those who agreed to be interviewed, as well as the names of the factories, to protect the workers' safety. Workers at the supermarket supplier said they had been made to endure conditions which would be unacceptable for staff employed by the same brands in the UK. ""We don't get toilet breaks, we don't get time to drink water on shift. We barely get time to eat lunch,"" one woman said. She said a manager would sometimes stand behind staff in the canteen and blow a whistle to send them back to work. Another employee said staff were forced to work overtime and prevented from going home until extra work was finished. ""They've increased our workload. We're forced to stay late to finish it - or they yell at us and threaten to fire us. We're scared as we don't want to lose our jobs."" The four brands supplied by the factories we investigated all said they were concerned about the allegations put to them by the BBC and would investigate. This young woman feeds her family on a salary of Â£61 per month. She told the BBC it was a struggle. The women working at these garment factories all live in poverty in a rural area of South India. The charity Action Aid, which supports more than 1,200 female garment workers across 45 villages in this specific region, told the BBC that forced overtime, verbal abuse and poor working conditions were routine at the factories in question. Allegations such as these are not confined to the garment industry. Low wages and weak labour laws have long made India an attractive place for foreign brands looking to outsource work. Unions are rare and virtually absent in the private sector, making informal and contract workers especially vulnerable. While inspections are mandatory, rampant corruption and a sluggish system has meant that factories are rarely held to account for breaking the law. The garment industry draws more attention because it's driven by exports and counts some of the world's biggest brands as among its clients. India is the world's second-largest manufacturer and exporter of garments after China. India's garment makers directly employ about 12.9 million people in factories and millions more outside, including their own homes, according to a2019 report,externalthat investigated working conditions in the sector. Several women who spoke to the BBC described a climate of fear at the factory supplying Ralph Lauren. They said managers did not give them notice to work additional hours, instead threatening them with the sack if they were unable to stay on. ""The supervisor always shouts at us,"" one woman said. ""If we make any error in stitching, I'll be taken to the master who is very scary. The master will start swearing and shouting at us. It's a terrifying experience"" Another woman, a widow who supports her family financially, said: ""They ask us to work so late I can't even feed my children at night. They shouldn't treat us like slaves, they should give us respect,"" she said. This worker at a factory supplying the UK supermarkets told us staff do not get water or toilet breaks The claims appear to violate India's Factories Act, which states that no worker should exceed more than 48 hours a week (or 60 hours with overtime), nor should they be made to work for more than nine hours in one day. The law also states that women should only work night shifts if they choose to do so. Ralph Lauren's 2020Global Citizenship and sustainability report,externalsays the company is ""committed to conducting our global operations ethically with respect for the dignity of all people who make our products"". The report also includes a pledge to ensure employees ""must not be made to work excessive working hours"" and says there should be no ""verbal harassment, coercion, punishment or abuse"". The three brands are all members of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), and have signed up to itsbase code,externalwhich includes a pledge to ensure working hours are not excessive, overtime is voluntary and that workers are not subject to verbal abuse. In a statement, Ralph Lauren said it was deeply concerned by the allegations put to the company by the BBC and would investigate. ""We require all of our suppliers to meet strict operating standards to ensure a safe, healthy and ethical workplace, and we conduct regular third-party audits at all factories,"" the company said. The factory supplying the fashion brand denied the staff members' allegations and said it was compliant with the law. The three supermarket brands all said they were shocked to hear the reports and were working together to ensure the issues were remedied, in particular on excessive working hours. Sainsbury's said it was ""insisting on a number of actions the supplier must take in order for us to continue to work with them"", including ""immediate actions and ongoing commitments the supplier must make while we continue to closely monitor the site"". Tesco said: ""We don't tolerate any abuse of workers' rights and fully investigated these allegations as soon as we were made aware. We were deeply troubled with what we found."" Women are underpaid throughout global supply chains, according to the charity Action Aid Tesco said its plan included ""prohibiting excessive overtime, strengthening grievance procedures"" and ensuring workers were ""fully compensated at the correct rates for hours they've worked"". Marks & Spencer said it ""undertook an immediate unannounced audit"" in the wake of the claims, the company said it ""identified overtime working practices that are not acceptable"", but disputed worker accounts about access to toilet breaks and water. The company also said it had a ""robust"" plan in place and would be ""undertaking regular unannounced audits to ensure its implementation"". These kinds of brands do not own or operate factories in India, which creates distance between them and working conditions there, but one owner of a clothing supplier - who did not want to be named - told the BBC that if brands push for cheaper clothes it can leave suppliers with no choice but to cut corners to meet orders. ""It's the brand who wants to maximize the profit. So, they push you to a level wherein you have to do the exploitation in order to survive,"" he said. The owner, who used to supply a major UK brand not mentioned in this story, described some factory audit processes as a ""sham"". ""The factory is aware when the auditors are coming, so they keep everything in perfect condition before,"" he said. ""The moment the audit is over, everything goes back to normal, which means exploitation and non compliance."" He said that poor checks and balances, combined with a lack of responsibility by the brands, makes it hard to stamp out that exploitation. ""It is the way of working in the textile industry, it's just not India, it's everywhere."" And as profits are squeezed, women often find themselves losing out. Payslips seen by the BBC show women working in garment factories can earn as little as Â£2.50 per day, making items which, in some cases, sell for hundreds of pounds. The factory workers who spoke to the BBC live in poverty in rural southern India More than 40% of workers surveyed by Action Aid India reported that their average monthly income was in the range of Rs. 2000-5000. (Â£20-Â£50). ""Women are undervalued and underpaid throughout global supply chains,"" said Esther Mariaselvam, the associate director at Action Aid's Chennai office. All of the workers who spoke to the BBC described living in impoverished conditions and said they struggled to survive on their salaries. One woman working at the Ralph Lauren supplier said she supported her entire family on a wage of around 6,000 rs (Â£61 per month), after deductions. Still in her late teens, she became the breadwinner after her father died and now provides for her mother and two sisters. Her salary is within the local legal minimum wage bracket for her job, but labour rights organisations say women like her should be earning more than three times as much. The Asia Floor Wage Alliance organisation which advocates for higher salaries for garment workers in the region, has set a monthly living wage in India of at least 18,727 rs (Â£190). Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have previously made commitments to a living wage. Ralph Lauren has not done so explicitly. But according to payslips seen by the BBC, neither of the factories we investigated appeared to be paying their workers anything close to the Asia Floor Wage Alliance recommended minimum amount. We asked all four brands to comment on the living wage but none of them responded on the specific issue. Charities have called on major brands to do more to protect those in the supply chain feeding their stores Anna Bryher, from the advocacy group Labour behind the Label, said it was the responsibility of brands to ensure fair and safe working conditions. ""If you're a brand and you're making clothing in different countries around the world then you need to look at  whether you're paying your workers enough to live with dignity,"" she said. ""It's your responsibility as the company at the top of the supply chain to know what is happening in your supply chain and to make sure that it's fair."" Local labour laws were not doing enough to address exploitation, the push for change needs to come from the brands themselves,"" argues Vivek Soundararajan, a senior lecturer at Bath University who researches global supply chains. ""Most checks and balances do not include workers voices, they do not include what workers actually need,"" he said. ""I think the brand should take the full responsibility â¦ They may not run the factory, but they get all the benefits."" Photographs by Rextane Nissi S. Additional reporting by Peter Emmerson.

"This video can not be played The changes will make it more expensive for NI dealers to buy cars from Great Britain Brexit-related changes are set to make it more expensive for NI car dealers to source second-hand vehicles from GB. Currently when dealers buy a vehicle in GB and then sell it in Northern Ireland, they only have to pay VAT on the profit. But from January they will have to pay VAT on the full price they paid for the car in GB. This will drastically reduce the profit margins on those vehicles or see price rises for consumers. The VAT bill for a car bought for Â£8,000 and sold for Â£10,000 could rise from Â£333 to Â£1666. GB is a significant source of second-hand cars for NI either from auctions or cars coming off a lease. From January many EU rules will apply on trade from GB to NI including what is known as the VAT margin scheme. The margin scheme is the arrangement which allows VAT to be paid on the profit rather than the full price. From 1 January NI will be part of the EU scheme rather than the UK one. NI drivers will need green card to cross the border What are the rules on driving in the EU after Brexit? NI leaders warn of Brexit threat to food supplies Official guidance from HMRC states: ""In line with EU rules, margin schemes involving goods, such as the second-hand margin schemes, will not usually apply for sales in Northern Ireland where the stock is purchased in Great Britain. ""Margin schemes will remain available for sales of goods that are purchased in Northern Ireland or the EU, whether sold to customers in Northern Ireland, Great Britain or the EU."" It is understood the issue is being raised at the Joint Committee - the UK-EU body which is overseeing the NI part of the Brexit deal.

"The Public Health Agency said uptake of the vaccine has been higher than ever before. There is ""no shortage"" of ordered flu vaccines for Northern Ireland, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. NI's GP committee had said that Northern Ireland was almost 200,000 doses short of the flu vaccine. The chair of NI's GP committee had raised concerns that it would not be possible to complete the vaccination programme for those aged over 65. But the Public Health Agency (PHA) now says that this is not the case. Concerns about a shortage of flu vaccine initially emerged after a meeting of GPs and Public Health Agency representatives last week. Dr Alan Stout, chair of NI's GP committee (NIGPC), then wrote to GPs across Northern Ireland and said he was ""deeply concerned and frustrated"" about a shortfall in flu vaccines. The BBC has also learned that after last week's meeting,  Dr Stout wrote to the chief medical officer highlighting their concerns over the shortfall of about 200,000 vaccine doses. In an email to Dr Michael McBride and seen by BBC News NI Dr Alan Stout said: ""You will see that it is far from satisfactory and puts practices in a very difficult situation and really does put at risk the completion of the flu campaign this year. ""Is this all consistent with your own understanding? ""We have a large number of practices with significant numbers of patients still to be vaccinated. We need to get advice to them ASAP about when they can do this and what vaccine they should give. "" But on Monday Dr Gerry Waldron from the PHA said there was not a shortage and he hoped the confusion would not deter those coming forward. Later on Monday Robin Swann also denied there was a shortage and said Northern Ireland had ordered in total 1,050,300 doses for this year. As of last Friday, 826,890 doses had been delivered into Northern Ireland, with 601,243 doses delivered to GPs and health trusts. Flu vaccine clinics 'frantically cancelled' NI to 'pause' flu vaccinations for under-65s Flu jab 'more important than ever' this winter Mr Swann said two further deliveries had arrived in NI on Monday morning, with the total amount of vaccine delivered now standing at 1,019,590 doses. Thirty thousand doses of childhood vaccine still to be delivered are the ""only remaining order outstanding"", he told the assembly. From the outside looking in, things appear a bit of a mess. Here are two reputable bodies - the Public Health Agency and the NI GP committee - each with their own versions of an important meeting last week. On the one hand GPs have said they were left in no doubt of the shortfall; on Sunday the Public Health Agency confirmed in a statement that postponing clinics would ""inconvenience"" GPs. At no point did the PHA challenge or contradict what GPs had told the BBC. Twenty-four hours on, however, and it is an entirely different story with the PHA adamant that Northern Ireland now has enough vaccine to go around. The British Medical Association has reacted saying it is ""delighted"" with the news. All of this highlights the importance of clear messaging, especially during a pandemic. Communication between health officials and those on the ground needs to be accurate and up to date. All of that will go some way in reassuring the public that when it comes to vaccines, those charged with obtaining and delivering them are in complete control of everything that is going on. The PHA's Dr Gerry Waldron said for those aged over 65, about 296,000 vaccines are in Northern Ireland and this is ""the full amount that was planned"". ""It was always anticipated that stock would arrive in planned batches, and with the initial batch of vaccine for under-65s used up extremely quickly, the decision to pause was purely practical, as it was simply not possible to continue to vaccinate until the next planned tranche of vaccine became available,"" Dr Waldron said. There are two different flu vaccines available for different age groups Following the clarification from Mr Swann and the PHA, Dr Stout said: ""As of 8am when practices opened this morning they did not know that there was additional flu vaccine available in Northern Ireland. ""We've only found that out during the course of the day and the only communication that I have got on that is through the press and through the media. ""It is a good thing that we now know that it is here, but this is part of the confusion, this is part of the problem.""

"SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is demanding another referendum If you can tear yourself away from the counting of votes in the United States, (and I appreciate if you are into politics, that's not easy right now), it is well worth noting what's going on in the warm up to a big political fight on this side of the pond, arguments that we are going to be talking about a lot in the coming months. There is a huge set of elections, straddling many parts of the UK next May, and the most contentious arguments are likely to be in the elections for the Scottish Parliament. In that poll, you guessed it, the central question on the ballot paper is likely to be that of Scottish independence. With a solid trend of polls backing independence in recent months, the SNP is hopeful of another convincing result in the May ballot that will give them a mandate for another referendum on whether Scotland should stay in the UK. Their problem, even if they win convincingly in May, is that the law says it's up to the UK government to decide whether or not there should be another referendum - a vote some Scots are massively eager to have, but which others want like a hole in the head. You can read more about the laws around a referendumhere. Is Scotland moving towards independence? Johnson rejects Sturgeon's indyref2 demand And the SNP themselves said, at the time, that the 2014 referendum was a ""once in a generation opportunity"" for those who want Scotland to be independent. The UK government's problem is that if the SNP does win convincingly in May on a promise of having another referendum, denying that would just amplify the argument that Westminster doesn't listen to what Scots want, and likely increase support for independence. Alister Jack has rejected a referendum for a ""generation"" That's whythe comments from Scottish Secretary Alister Jackthis morning are notable. He said that ""once in a generation"" means there can't be an independence referendum for many, many years. Not surprisingly, the SNP have leapt on his words, even comparing his comments to President Trump's bizarre, sometimes rambling, statements since the US election - so full of claims without evidence about fraud or irregularities in the voting that some of the American TV networks cut him off while he was still talking. One US politician making wild allegations about fraud is obviously not the same as another in the UK hardening their opposition to another kind of poll taking place, which the government has the legal right to permit or not. Yet the UK government does have an acute dilemma, and it knows it. And not everyone in Westminster agrees that the answer to a hypothetical big SNP win in May can be, ""no, not now, and not nearly ever"". To put it mildly, there is a range of opinion in government on how to meet the demands for a referendum in practice. There are concerns among Tories too about Labour's weakness at Holyrood,which you can read about here. At the very least, the UK government intends to be more present, more prominent, in Scotland, to move away from what one government source admits was an attitude of ""devolve and forget"" that has built up over successive UK administrations. But making the argument for the Union more obviously, and more visibly is one thing - there is no guarantee that in the coming months Scottish voters will like what they see.

"Americans should start being vaccinated against coronavirus in the coming days, providing some light at the end of the tunnel for the country with the highest death toll in the world. But the good news about vaccines comes as the US is experiencing its toughest period of the pandemic so far. The number of daily reported deaths is at a record high while both the number of infections and admissions to hospital continue to rise. Robert Redfield, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has warned that the next few months will be ""the most difficult in the public health history of this nation"". So why is the outlook so bleak and what will next year bring? The number of daily reported deaths began to increase substantially in November and it has now passed 3,000 for the first time since the start of the pandemic. The highest number of deaths in one day during the spring outbreak, which was limited to states in the Northeast, was just below 2,800. If you ignore the recent slight drop in the seven-day average, which was caused by the limited reporting of data around the Thanksgiving holiday on 26 November, the trend does not look good. Earlier this week, Dr Redfieldtold,externalthe Council on Foreign Relations think-tank that he expected the daily death toll to be higher than the 3,000 killed in the 9/11 attacks ""probably for the next 60 to 90 days"". At the moment, the US death toll stands at nearly 300,000 - the highest figure in the world and about a fifth of the global total of confirmed coronavirus deaths. How does the US compare to the rest of the world? One of the reasons the death toll is expected to rise at such a fast rate is because the number of infections is also still on the way up. With more than 15 million confirmed cases, the US has the highest number of infections in the world and the spread shows no sign of slowing down. The chart below shows that the current wave is still growing at a faster rate than the previous two - although some of that is down to increased levels of testing. During the spring wave, testing was mostly limited to confirming cases in people who were already in hospital, meaning the true scale of that outbreak wasn't fully captured. The latest data compiled by theCOVID Tracking Project,externalshows the number of cases was up by nearly 30% week on week, while testing was up by just 10%. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, has said we'll have to wait until mid-December to gauge what effect Thanksgiving gatherings have had on the numbers. But hewarned,externalthat Christmas will inevitably bring another increase in travelling and social contacts, which will lead to ""a very challenging period"". Because of the change in the level of testing, a better way to compare waves is to look at the number of people being admitted to hospital because of Covid-19. This data shows that roughly the same number of people across the US were in hospital during the first and second waves of the outbreak. But the current wave has seen far more Covid-19 patients admitted to hospital - more than 100,000 at the moment. The number of patients with coronavirus who are in intensive care units and on ventilators is also rising, which is another worrying sign - although treatments have improved since the spring outbreak. In arecent study,externalin New York, researchers found that the probability of death among coronavirus patients was down 18 percentage points from the spring, in part due to new treatments and better knowledge of the virus among medical staff. But these improvements are dependent on the quality of care being received, which is put at risk when hospitals reach capacity and staffing levels are put under pressure. Recent analysis of hospital admissions databy the New York Times,externalfound that one in 10 Americans lived in an area where intensive care units were either full or fewer than 5% of beds were available. One travel nurse's journey to US Covid hotspots The current wave of infections is the third one to hit the US this year but the one major difference is that it's affecting every region at the same time. The spring wave was predominantly in the Northeast, while the summer one hit the South and West hardest. This time around, it was the Midwest where infections rose fastest - but every region has seen a spike in cases. The Covid Exit Strategygroup,external, which is run by public health experts, ranks the progress each state is making in tackling the outbreak. At the moment, every state but Hawaii is categorised as having an ""uncontrolled spread"". The only region where the numbers are looking somewhat positive is the Midwest, although we'll have to wait another week or so to see whether cases continue to fall once the post-Thanksgiving data stabilises. The mask-wearing US city that bucked the trend Several states have brought in increased measures in recent days in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus, including California and New York. In Pennsylvania, Democratic Governor Tom Wolf banned dining inside restaurants and introduced limits on social gatherings indoors,saying,external: ""We need to slow the spread right now in order to save lives. If we don't, we're going to be in big trouble."" Mr Wolf is himself isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. Dr Fauci has called on Americans to ""hang on"" until the vaccines arrive, saying key public health measures like social distancing and the wearing of face masks are crucial over the next few months. This video can not be played US Covid vaccine: Three key questions answered President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to make tackling the pandemic a top priority when he enters the White House on 20 January. He has set a goal of vaccinating 100 million people - nearly a third of the US population - within the first 100 days of his administration. Dr Fauci, who has accepted a role as Mr Biden's chief medical adviser,said,externallast week that if 75% of Americans can be vaccinated by next summer, the country may be able to return to ""some degree of normality"". However, arecent survey,externalby the Pew Research Center suggests that may be a challenge, with only 60% of people saying they would probably or definitely get the vaccine.

"Boris Johnson has rejected the request from Nicola Sturgeon The UK government has formally rejected a call from Scotland's first minister for a second independence referendum. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a referendum would ""continue the political stagnation Scotland has seen for the past decade"". And he said First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had previously pledged that the 2014 referendum would be a ""once in a generation"" vote. Ms Sturgeon tweeted that the Tories were attempting to ""deny democracy"". She said Mr Johnson's formal refusal of her request for a referendum to be held later this year was ""predictable but also unsustainable and self defeating"", and insisted that ""Scotland will have the right to choose"". The first minister also said the Scottish government would set out its response and ""next steps"" before the end of the month, and that the devolved Scottish Parliament would again be asked to ""back Scotland's right to choose our own future"". Scottish independence: What might happen next? Brian Taylor: PM's move predictable but not subtle What is a section 30 order? Scottish voters backed remaining in the UK by 55% to 45% in the referendum in 2014. Ms Sturgeon says she wants to hold another vote on independence, andmade a formal request last monthfor the UK government to transfer powers - known as a Section 30 order - to the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh that would ensure any referendum is legal. The request came after Ms Sturgeon's SNP, which forms the Scottish government, won 48 of the 59 seats in Scotland in the UK general election. In hiswritten response to Ms Sturgeon,external, the prime minister said he had ""carefully considered and noted"" her arguments. But he said: ""You and your predecessor (Alex Salmond) made a personal promise that the 2014 independence referendum was a""once in a generation"" vote. ""The people of Scotland voted decisively on that promise to keep our United Kingdom together, a result which both the Scottish and UK governments committed to respect in the Edinburgh Agreement."" A large pro-independence march was held in Glasgow at the weekend Mr Johnson said the UK government would ""continue to uphold the democratic decision of the Scottish people and the promise you made to them"". And he said he did not want to see Scotland's schools, hospitals and employment ""again left behind because of a campaign to separate the UK"". The prime minister added: ""For that reason, I cannot agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums"". The formal rejection comes days after the UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, said another victory in next year's Scottish Parliament election would still not give the SNP a mandate to hold a referendum. SNP victory 'will not be mandate for indyref2' Ms Sturgeon has previously warned that a ""flat no"" from Mr Johnson to her request would ""not be the end of the matter"". But she has made clear that she will not hold an unofficial referendum similar to the disputed one in Catalonia in 2017, arguing that it would not actually deliver independence as the result would not be recognised by the EU or wider international community. The first minister said: ""The Tories are terrified of Scotland having the right to choose our own future. They know that given the choice the overwhelming likelihood is that people will choose the positive option of independence. ""The Tories - and their allies in the leaderships of Labour and the Lib Dems - lack any positive case for the union, so all they can do is try to block democracy. ""It shows utter contempt for the votes, views and interests of the people of Scotland and it is a strategy that is doomed to failure."" The prospect of an independence referendum on Nicola Sturgeon's preferred timetable - the second half of 2020 - now looks very remote. The first minister is confident that Mr Johnson's refusal will help make the case for independence in the longer term, but for now her options are limited. In the first instance, she is planning another vote at Holyrood to underline the backing of MSPs for a new referendum. With the SNP and Greens holding a majority between them, this is sure to pass - but this has happened before, to little avail. She has not ruled out going to court, but this would hardly accelerate matters - constitutional lawyers have warned that""there are no legal short cuts"",externalaround the political battlefield. So the next clear opportunity to break the deadlock may be the 2021 Holyrood elections. Ms Sturgeon clearly has one eye on that poll already, talking about the Tories being on a ""road back to political oblivion"". Between now and then, another year of constitutional stalemate beckons.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to announce whether the toughest Covid restrictions are to be imposed in the west of Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said on Monday it was ""likely"" that some areas would be moved from level three to level four. This could include the six councils in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area, including Glasgow itself. There has also been speculation that both North and South Lanarkshire could be moved to the highest tier. Rising numbers of cases have previously been highlighted in Stirling and in both East and South Ayrshire, which are all currently in level three. But the government has also been looking at whether any areas could move down a level, with Ms Sturgeon saying: ""This is not a one-way street"". Any changes, which will be announced by Ms Sturgeon at about 14:20, would come into force from Friday. What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? No part of Scotland has been placed in the top level since the tiered system - which ranges from level zero to level four and is reviewed on a weekly basis - came into force on 2 November. However, there have been concerns that infection rates are not reducing quickly enough - or are continuing to rise - in some of the 22 areas that are currently in level three. Level four restrictions would see the closure of a wide range of premises including non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, barbers, gyms and leisure centres, although schools would remain open. Ms Sturgeon has said that moving to the highest level ""for a limited period in some areas"" could help protect the NHS and pave the way for some easing of restrictions at Christmas. Level four is the closest to a full lockdown, similar to the one introduced in March. Socialising would not be allowed in people's homes, but six people from two households could still meet outdoors and there would be no limit on outdoor exercise. However, people would be advised to minimise the number of meetings with people from other households, and to follow social distancing guidance. Those living under level four restrictions would be advised to avoid any unnecessary travel out of the area, and to keep journeys within the area to an absolute minimum. The premises which would close include: Non-essential shops Pubs, restaurants and cafes, although takeaways can still operate Leisure centres and gyms Hairdressers, barbers, beauticians and any other close contact retail services Indoor visitor attractions and all leisure and entertainment premises. However, schools would remain open full-time. Read more about the level four restrictions The Scottish Retail Consortium has warned of the impact that the highest tier of restrictions would have on shops. Director David Lonsdale said: ""The scientific evidence indicates retail is a safe environment and closing stores will do little to suppress the virus. ""However, the economic impacts of forced closure during the Christmas trading period are severe, which is why it should only be a last resort."" In neighbouring East and West Dunbartonshire, council leaders are split over whether a move to level four is now the right thing to do. Andrew Polson, the Conservative leader of East Dunbartonshire, told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme the Scottish government must show ""extreme caution"" because of the impact on businesses and people's mental health. He said: ""I know the people of East Dunbartonshire are looking for some relaxation of the restrictions. ""We should be continuing with the tier system we've got. We are only two weeks into it and I think we need to let it go."" Rising numbers of cases have previously been highlighted in Stirling Jonathan McColl, the SNP leader of neighbouring West Dunbartonshire Council, said the move to level four would be ""incredibly difficult"" for businesses. However, he insisted the threat to public health was the number one priority. He told Good Morning Scotland: ""It has to be a major consideration for the government of the impact it has on, particularly, small and medium-sized enterprises that don't have the same capacity to be as resilient. ""But you have to look at the whole thing in the round. We are trying to protect people and save lives here. ""The absolute worst-case scenario would be if we were in a lockdown over Christmas. Nobody wants that."" Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute, Borders, and Dumfries and Galloway are currently in level two, with Highland, Moray, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles in level one. Ms Sturgeon's cabinet will decide on any changes on Tuesday morning before she makes a statement in the Scottish Parliament in the afternoon. Talks have been taking place between the Scottish government and the local authorities in the areas which are under threat of being placed into level four. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said on Friday that councils in the west of Scotland had been warned that the move to level four was possible. On Monday, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I think it is likely that we will see some areas go to level four this week. ""But is it inevitable? Until we have taken that final decision, no of course it's not.""

"This video can not be played Hurricane Iota will bring torrential rain to parts of Nicaragua, Honduras, Belize and Guatemala A powerful hurricane has brought torrential rains and strong winds to Nicaragua's Caribbean coast, two weeks after another devastating storm hit. Iota made landfall as a category four storm near the town of Puerto Cabezas, where patients had to be evacuated from a makeshift hospital after its roof was ripped off. Residents are in shelters, and there are fears of food shortages. The storm has weakened and Honduras is expected to be hit later on Tuesday. Before making landfall in Nicaragua, Iota had brought high winds and flooding to Colombia's Caribbean coast The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) saidIota was now a category two storm,,externalbut warned it could bring life-threatening storm surges, catastrophic winds, flash flooding and landslides. Number of named Atlantic storms breaks records Why do storms have names? Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms Iota struck Nicaragua on Monday evening with sustained winds of nearly 155mph (250km/h), the NHC said. It strengthened at sea to a category five storm but it weakened as it made landfall. In Puerto Cabezas, also known as Bilwi, the storm damaged wooden homes, flooded streets and cut off electricity. Residents said the wind ripped away the roofs of houses ""like they were made of cardboard"". ""I haven't eaten. I don't know where I'm going to sleep here,"" 80-year-old Prinsila Glaso told AFP news agency. This video can not be played Heavy rains as Hurricane Iota nears land There were no immediate reports of casualties. Nicaraguan officials said around 40,000 people had been evacuated from areas in the storm's path. ""[Iota] is the strongest hurricane that has touched Nicaraguan soil since records began,"" said Marcio Baca, director of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies. The hurricane is forecast to move inland across the country before hitting southern Honduras. The effect of the rains could be particularly devastating in areas already drenched by Hurricane Eta. Iota made landfall just 15 miles (24km) south of where Eta hit on 3 November. In Honduras, officials said at least 50,000 people had been removed from high-risk areas. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, President Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez warned: ""What's drawing closer is a bomb."" Before reaching Central America the storm moved past the Colombian island of Providencia in the Caribbean, cutting off electricity and killing at least one person, officials said. Colombian President IvÃ¡n Duque said 98% of the infrastructure in Providencia, home to around 5,000 people, had been damaged.

This year's Atlantic hurricane season has broken the record for the number of named storms. For only the second time on record officials have had to start using the letters of the Greek alphabet to start storm names after running out of nameson its traditional alphabetical list. Eta left at least 200 people dead. The worst-hit area was Guatemala's central Alta Verapaz region, where mudslides buried dozens of homes in the village of QuejÃ¡, with some 100 people feared dead.

"This video can not be played Heavy rains as Hurricane Iota nears land Hurricane Iota has strengthened as it roars towards Central America, less than two weeks after another devastating storm struck the region. With winds of up to 160mph (260km/h), it is now a category five storm - the strongest on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Iota made landfall on Nicaragua's remote eastern coast on Monday evening local time. ""What's drawing closer is a bomb,"" said the president of neighbouring Honduras, Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez. Iota is the strongest Atlantic hurricane of the year and only the second November hurricane to reach category five - the last was in 1932. Number of named Atlantic storms breaks records Why do storms have names? Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms In a joint press conference, Mr HernÃ¡ndez and Guatemala's President Alejandro Giammattei said Central America was the worst affected region in the world by climate change, and highlighted the damage caused by Hurricane Eta earlier in the month. Thousands lost their crops when that storm hit, and parts of Central America remain water logged. Before reaching Central America the storm moved past the Colombian island of Providencia in the Caribbean, cutting off electricity. The country's President IvÃ¡n Duque said the island could have been hit badly by the storm and stressed there had been ""very poor"" communication after it struck. The NHC has warned that heavy rainfall from Iota could lead to ""life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding across portions of Central America"". Iota already caused flooding in Cartagena, a popular tourist destination on Colombia's Caribbean coast. This video can not be played Storm Iota heads towards Central America The effect of the rains could be particularly devastating in areas already drenched by Hurricane Eta two weeks ago. Eta left at least 200 people dead. The worst-hit area was Guatemala's central Alta Verapaz region, where mudslides buried dozens of homes in the village of QuejÃ¡, with some 100 people feared dead. At least 50 deaths were reported elsewhere in Guatemala. Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua have evacuated residents living in low-lying areas and near rivers in the Atlantic coastal region which Iota is expected to hit. A resident of Bilwi, a coastal town in Nicaragua, said some locals were refusing to leave their homes for fear of catching coronavirus in shared shelters. ""Some of us prefer to stay and die in our homes. There has never been a repeat hurricane in such a short time, but what can we do against the force of God and nature,"" Silvania Zamora told AFP news agency. ""We are worried, nervous. Psychologically we are not doing well, because losing our things and starting over is not easy. Some of us have old little houses and we risk losing everything,"" she added. In Honduras, the country's second city and its industrial hub, San Pedro Sula, is bracing for major flooding.

"""I am sure 'mum guilt' will be familiar to many parents. Guilt that you are not spending enough time with your family and that you are not giving 100% at work,"" says HR professional Helen Cholmeley. The mum-of-two from Newbury has been juggling part-time work with looking after her daughters for the past decade. Last year, she decided it was time to move on from her previous job at a telecommunications company. But few part-time roles were being advertised, she says. ""It's really hard to progress when you're part-time. If you look at any internal jobs boards, you'll rarely find any part-time roles. I felt it hindered my career and I decided it was time for a change."" Eventually, she spotted a new flexible role at the insurance firm Zurich. The company, which employs 4,500 in the UK, began advertising part-time, job share or flexible options in all job vacancies last year. ""In my first week, my daughter had to have an emergency dentist appointment. I didn't need to worry. I could take the time to be with my daughter without fear. ""Flexibility removes that feeling [of guilt]. I can be a mum and a technology consultant."" How can you find out if you're getting equal pay? Flexible working will be a new normal after virus 'Working from home has made childcare easier' A new a government-backed study for Zurich insurance suggests that women like Helen are 20% more likely to apply for senior roles if they offer flexible hours. Using gender-neutral language in job adverts also generated ""significant change"", it found. The research - which was carried out by the Behavioural Insights Team, a government-backed think tank - found women have struggled to progress in their careers at Zurich in the past. It found there had been a lack of applications from women for senior roles, many of which had not been available on a flexible basis. Female employees reported this had made them less likely to apply. ""We've seen hugely encouraging results, simply by adding six words to our job adverts [offering flexible working arrangements],"" said Steve Collinson, Zurich's head of HR. ""By offering roles that fit flexibly around family life, employers could open the floodgates to a much wider pool of untapped talent. ""This will also help women progress into higher paid jobs whilst fitting other commitments around their careers,"" he added. Since changing its policy on job adverts, the number of women hired for top roles has risen by 33%, it says. Since changing its policy on job adverts, the number of women hired for top roles at Zurich has risen by 33% Alison Martin, the boss of Zurich's Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told the BBC's Today programme that the move was also necessary to tackle the firm's gender pay gap - the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. ""We thought this was probably one of the underlying reasons why we have a gender pay gap. It was just over 20% when we last published it, and that's simply too high."" ""So we tried to make sure there were as many opportunities for [women] because, let's face it, the best thing you can do as a company is have a diverse and inclusive workforce."" According to the research, women are more likely to have caring responsibilities and may struggle to progress into more senior roles if they do not offer flexible working options. Some even end up leaving the labour market. The study, which looked at Zurich job vacancies between March 2019 and February 2020, found many more men also applied for roles when they offered flexible working options, suggesting the issue was ""just as important"" for them. Existing part-time employees also reported a stronger sense of ""belonging"" due to the shift, pointing to the fear some workers have of being judged for not working full-time. Minister for Women Baroness Berridge said: ""The benefits of flexible working have really been emphasised during recent months. ""We want to see more employers embracing practices such as working from home and returners programmes, which can have a positive impact for both men and women.""

"Lodging website Airbnb has filed papers in the US to become a publicly listed company in what is one of the most-anticipated launches of the year. Since its founding as home-sharing site in 2008, the San Francisco tech firm has grown into a global juggernaut. Its rise has challenged traditional hotel rivals and cities coping with an influx of tourists to new areas. And while the pandemic hurt the firm's already loss-making business, Airbnb said its model remains resilient. The company reportedly hopes to raise about $3bn (Â£2.27bn) by selling shares in the listing, which could value the firm at more than $30bn. ""We believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere,"" the company said in its Securities and Exchange Commission filing for its initial public offering (IPO). ""Our platform has proven adaptable to serve these new ways of traveling."" More than 4 million hosts list properties on the platform, 86% of which are located outside of the US. Last year, roughly 54 million people reserved stays through the company, which takes a cut of each booking. But travel was hit hard by the pandemic, prompting the company to slash staff numbers by 25% and raise $2bn in emergency loans from investors to make it through the crisis. The firm said bookings have since recovered somewhat, as people looked to escape locked down cities with long-term rentals.  But they remain down about 20% in recent months compared to last year. In 2019, the firm booked losses of more than $674m - a figure it has already surpassed in the first nine months of this year. The firm, which brought in revenue of $4.8bn last year, also warned potential investors that revenue growth had slowed, a trend likely to continue. Between 2018 and 2019, the firm's revenue grew more than 30%. But it fell more than 30% year-on-year in the first nine months of 2020, to $2.5bn from $3.7bn a year earlier. Separately, shares of electric car maker Tesla jumped 9% in extended trade on Monday after S&P Dow Jones Indices said that the company would join the S&P 500 index. It will join on 21 December.

"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

"A gunman in El Paso, Texas killed 22 people last year at a Walmart Hate crimes in the US rose to the highest level in more than a decade last year, according to an FBI report. Hate-motivated murders also rose to a record high in 2019, with 51 deaths - more than double the 2018 total. Last August, 22 people were killed in a shooting targeting Mexicans at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas. Hate crimes have been increasing in the US almost every year since 2014. Campaign groups warn this comes amid rising bigotry and racist rhetoric. ""The latest rise in hate crime signals a new brutal landscape, where targeted attacks against rotating victim groups not only result in spikes, but increases are also being driven by a more widely dispersed rise in the most violent offenses,"" saidBrian Levin, executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University,external. Charlottesville: 'It's an act of terror, a hate crime' 'I fear my neighbour' - hate crimes in America The 1960s report that told the USA it was racist The FBI's annualHate Crime Statistics Act (HCSA) report,externalsays there were 7,314 hate crimes last year, up from 7,120 the year before - and the highest number since 7,783 were recorded in 2008. A hate crime is defined in the report as offences ""motivated by bias toward race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, and gender identity"". The data showed a nearly 7% rise in religion-based hate crime, with a 14% increase in crimes targeting Jews or Jewish institutions. It also found anti-Latino hate crime rose 8.7% from 485 in 2018 to 527 in 2019 to the highest total since 2010. The killing of 22 people at the El Paso Walmart last year is the worst hate crime attack ever recorded by the FBI, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism. This video can not be played El Paso shooting: 'My heart hurts on every level' Black people were targeted in hate crimes more than any other group in the US. However, the FBI said the number of hate crimes against African Americans dropped slightly to 1,930, from 1,943. Of all 4,930 victims of reported hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity, 48.5% were ""victims of crimes motivated by offenders' anti-Black or African American bias"", compared with 15.7% as ""victims of anti-White bias"", 14.1% as ""victims of anti-Hispanic or Latino bias"" and 4.4% of ""anti-Asian bias"". After the FBI report's release rights groups called for better reporting of and collection of information on hate crimes. A press release from the Jewish civil rights group the Anti-Defamation League,external(ADL) said the data revealed ""a harrowing trend of increasing hate crimes being reported in the United States, even as fewer law enforcement agencies provided data to the FBI"". ""The total severity of the impact and damage caused by hate crimes cannot be fully measured without complete participation in the FBI's data collection process,"" ADL director Jonathan Greenblatt said.
