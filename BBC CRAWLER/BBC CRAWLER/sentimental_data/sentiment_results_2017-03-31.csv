"It is clear that the UK will face a tough divorce from the European Union after European Council President Donald Tusk characterised the forthcoming talks as ""difficult, complex"" and possibly ""confrontational"". From the outset it is clear that the EU side will control the agenda. That was underlined again on Friday in an early skirmish over procedure. Theresa May wanted divorce talks to run in parallel with negotiations about a future trading relationship. That won't happen. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been quick to rule that out and was given swift backing by the French president Francois Hollande. That was reinforced again on Friday with the leak of the European Council's negotiating guidelines. Why is this so important? Europe's leaders want to ensure that Britain agrees to the principles governing the terms of Brexit as a condition for talks continuing. As Mr Tusk said, the UK cannot just walk away without paying debts. Angela Merkel insists the principles of Brexit should be negotiated before a trade deal with the UK can be considered On the EU side there is another calculation: it will be easier to ensure unity among the 27 member states on the terms of the divorce, rather than on trade, when different national interests could come into play. Preserving unity is a fundamental concern and Mr Tusk insisted that the EU ""will act as one"". By insisting that the principles of the divorce bill be settled first, the leaders of the 27 are also stopping Mrs May using payments as a bargaining chip over the future trading relationship. There were, however, some hints at flexibility, with Mr Tusk saying that the EU would monitor the negotiations and determine when ""sufficient progress had been achieved to allow talks to proceed to the next phase of a future relationship"". Of course, it is the EU that will decide what progress has been made but those negotiations on trade could begin as early as the autumn. Key points from the UK's Article 50 letter Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU What is Article 50? A guide to what happens now What will happen to UK trade post-Brexit? EU sets out phased Brexit strategy For the EU there are four priorities in the talks: settling the divorce bill which some in Brussels have estimated at â¬60bn (Â£50bn), establishing the future status of EU citizens living in the UK, keeping open Northern Ireland's borders and agreeing which laws companies will operate under post-Brexit. But EU leaders have opened the door to holding trade talks before Brexit has been completed and some in the UK will see that as a promising gesture. The negotiating guidelines allow for a transition period before a future trading agreement is in place. In Brussels there is an expectation that some kind of transition period will be needed after the divorce talks have been completed. A trade deal can only be formally concluded once the UK has ended its membership. EU leaders are expected to finalise the union's negotiating position on 29 April The EU sees that transitional period as being ""limited"" and will insist that the UK continues to abide by Union rules during this period. That could prove very controversial because it means there is a very real prospect that, come the next UK general election in 2020, some payments to the EU are still being made with a continuing role for the European Court. There are differences among Europe's leaders over how constructive they are willing to be in the talks. Some want to demonstrate that leaving the EU is not easy, that divorce must hurt. The French believe there must be an element of pain to deter others, although the prospect of other countries leaving is currently very remote. Mr Tusk's perspective is that the process of leaving is ""punitive"" enough without further punishment being necessary. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Friday that in calls he had made over the past two days there had been ""lots of goodwill' from European Union ministers. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has emphasised the ""goodwill"" shown by other EU members The wider reaction is that the UK, by triggering Article 50, has stepped into the unknown and taken a huge risk. ""A highly indebted Britain has most to lose from uncertainty,"" was one assessment. The mood in the European press has been generally gloomy, seeing departure as an act of self-harm, of Britain being tied up in Kafkaesque procedures, of British citizens being worse off by â¬5,000 (Â£4,300) a year. Some papers focused on the UK's future isolation, repeating what passes for accepted wisdom in Brussels that in a global world countries are better off in larger blocs. Among some commentators there was the scarcely veiled hope that at some stage the UK will return to the European fold, tail between legs. The British strategy is to be constructive towards the EU project and to deliver on the ""sincere co-operation"" it has promised Angela Merkel. It has accepted that some payments will have to be made to meet existing obligations, that EU citizens will have to retain rights during the negotiating period and that there may be some limited role for the EU's courts in settling trade disputes. Theresa May will have to balance her room for manoeuvre with the demands of her own party The UK has some cards: it can offer help with security and intelligence but, by tying that assistance to the future trading relationship, it prompted German MPs to cry ""blackmail"". Mr Johnson responded by saying that Britain's commitment to EU defence was ""unconditional"". But it is clear that every time the UK tries to play its cards there will be voices, particularly from the European Parliament, in full complaint. Mrs May and her team will have to handle the parliament with great skill, as it will have a say on any eventual deal. Europe will be on alert for any attempt by Britain to divide and rule the remaining 27 EU countries. Mrs Merkel has set out the German interest: despite intensive lobbying from German car manufacturers it is the unity and integrity of the European Union that will be the priority - the EU must not be damaged or weakened by these negotiations. These guidelines will be fleshed out into a more comprehensive negotiating document that will be presented to Europe's leaders at the end of April. Mrs May knows compromises will have to be made to avoid the talks breaking down, but her room for manoeuvre is limited by sections of her own party who are determined to ensure a clean break with the EU.

"She's marched for miles carrying gear that weighs as much as she does, killed animals for food during survival training and practised jumping out of planes to get behind enemy lines. But Jannike, a pony-tailed 19-year-old from northern Norway, will only concede that she's ""pretty tough"". She is part of the Hunter Troop, the world's first all-female special forces training programme. ""I wanted to do something bigger, the toughest the army could offer me,"" Jannike says. ""I wanted to [see] how far I could push myself."" After six months, despite some ""really low moments"", she is determined to get through the course. Next up on the training schedule is close-combat fighting and offensive driving. This video can not be played Norway set up the world's first all-female special forces training programme The Jegertroppen, as it is known in Norwegian, was set up in 2014. Military commanders here say that the war in Afghanistan proved an ""operational need"" existed for highly-trained female soldiers who could gather intelligence and interact with women and children during deployments in conservative societies. Winter patrols are an important part of the course What began as a kind of experimental programme is now seen as a major success. More than 300 women applied in the first year, and about a dozen recruits are now passing the gruelling training annually, providing a pipeline of elite women soldiers that can be deployed at home or abroad. The hardest part so far has been ""hell week"", says Jannike, a test of mental and physical strength involving long marches over several days with little time for rest, and minimum amounts of food and water. ""They just see if you can handle the pressure when you're down,"" she says. Jannike wants to go to officers' school after the Jegertroppen The young women are today practising fighting their way out of an urban ambush. They work in teams of two: taking cover behind burned-out tanks, providing suppressive fire with their H&K MP7 sub-machine guns and throwing smoke grenades so the team can get out safely. Every time they hit one of the metal targets in the snow-covered expanse ahead, a clear ""ding"" rings out, to the approval of Captain Ole Vidar Krogsaeter, who oversees their training. ""To prepare them we try to give them the best training possible, as realistic as possible,"" the veteran special forces operator says. ""We have them go through the exercises so many times that they are comfortable with it."" Ole Vidar, right, had never worked with female soldiers before and admits he was initially sceptical They go through the same training as male paratroopers In between rounds, the women, who are all aged between 19 and 27, rest, and the dynamic changes completely. They sing, and joke around. Three women sprawl out on an equipment box, enjoying the brief downtime. Later they light a fire, and get a barbeque going. Back in the mid-1980s, Norway became one of the first countries in Nato to allow women to serve in all combat roles, although the numbers actually doing so have remained low. Women were allowed to apply for the special forces, but none had got in. The United States and Britain, in comparison, have only recently begun lifting restrictions on women officially enlisting in combat units. The soldiers say they are as close as ""sisters"". Their identities must be protected because they could work undercover in the future Special forces soldiers in the US have shown particular resistance to the changes. A2014 Rand Institute survey,externalof men in the US Special Operations Command found that 85% were against letting women do their specialised jobs, with 71% opposed to women joining their units. The main concerns were that tough standards would fall and team cohesion could be affected. But menalso complained,externalabout the feared effects of pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), dealing with their wives' complaints, and the effects of having segregated living quarters. Magnus, a male Norwegian special forces soldier who has trained the Jegertroppen, doesn't have patience for what he calls ""man-made"" problems. Male and female soldiers mostly share rooms in Norway, and PMS is ""not an issue at all"" in training, he said. He recognises that there are some valid concerns: most pertinently, the ability of a female soldier to quickly carry a wounded male counterpart to safety. The recruits generally come from sport-focused high schools They learn how to fight in close-combat Still, he adds: ""I don't think you should view it as the girls are gonna do the exact same as the guys. ""They are not going to win hand-to-hand combat, but most of the time we use guns and a lot of the time they shoot better than the guys."" Requirements to complete the course: 15km (9 miles) speed march in full gear (22kg backpack, weapon, boots) through forests within two hours and 15 minutes Six pull-ups 50 sit-ups in two minutes 40 push-ups 3km run - maximum time 13 minutes 400m swim, first 25m underwater - maximum time 11 minutes Most of the members of the Jegertroppen were elite high school athletes, but they bring other strengths to the table apart from their physical capability. Venderla, 22, passed the course last year. ""Women think outside the box,"" she says. ""Men just do what they are supposed to do. Maybe we are more capable of seeing another solution, a better solution."" Although gender equality is well-entrenched in the Norwegian military - as it is in the country's society - just 11% of personnel are women, reflecting halting progress in recruiting and retaining females. This compares with 10.2% in the UK and more than 15% in the United States. ""It was the best year of my life,"" Venderla says of the Jegertroppen The women are trained for urban special reconnaissance Conscription was extended to Norwegian women last year and they made up about 25% of the 8,000 youngsters recruited, meaning the share should increase over time. Venderla says she has not experienced sexism in the special forces, but has in another battalion. She was told by some soldiers that she was weaker and less capable as a woman, and one man made sexual comments, she said. The problem stopped after she complained. ""I think he was maybe a little insecure. I knew I was good enough passing the tests so it's his problem."" Norwegian special forces are currently deployed in Jordan, helping to train Syrian rebels in the fight against so-called Islamic State. None of the women who have passed through the Jegertroppen so far have been deployed on a special operation, but the commanders say that the important thing is that they are trained and ready should the need arise. Jannike speaks calmly but with conviction. She says that in a peaceful country like Norway, it's difficult for her to keep in mind during training that they are actually ""learning to kill"". ""But I try to have that perspective, because that's what we're really training for."" Video production by Mohamed Madi Serving side by side.

"Russian hackers have been blamed for hacking the US Democratic National Committee and the German parliament Russia has been accused of trying to interfere in the US presidential election, through hacked Democrat emails and social media. And in a big year of European elections, political leaders in France, Germany and elsewhere are looking over their shoulders too. Across the continent the hand of the Russian state has been perceived in an array of cyber attacks on government and state institutions, in the phenomenon of ""fake news"" and disinformation, and in the targeted funding of opposition groups. So how real is the threat and what form does it take? And is an explanation to be found in the words of Russia's chief of the general staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, who wrote in a military newspaper in 2013 that ""the very rules of war have changed""? Attempting to control information has long been part of the weaponry of many powerful states. But Russia's concerted effort to cultivate techniques of information warfare and non-military intervention over recent years is something new, says Keir Giles of the Conflict Studies Research Centre. ""At various stages in the first and second Chechen wars, the war with Georgia in 2008, Russia found it was not able to influence global opinion or the opinion of its adversaries at an operational or strategic level, and made significant changes to its information warfare apparatus as a result,"" he says. Russia learned lessons from its 2008 campaign in Georgia ""In the Georgia war, they found that to influence world public opinion and to properly exploit the connectivity of the internet they needed to start a massive recruitment campaign to bring in linguists, journalists, anybody who could talk directly to populations in foreign countries en masse"". Numerous cyber attacks in Europe have been blamed on Russian-linked groups - many of them spectacular. In 2015 France's TV5Monde broadcaster was taken off air andits systems nearly entirely destroyed. The same year Russia's APT28 hacking group was accused of amassive data hack of deputiesin Germany's lower house of parliament involving the loss of 16 gigabytes of data. Germany's head of domestic intelligence has since spoken of a ""hybrid"" Russian threat to the September 2017 elections in which Angela Merkel is seeking a fourth term in office. TV5Monde was taken off air in April 2015 Another cyber attack, on Bulgaria in October 2016, wasdescribed by its presidentas the heaviest and most intense to be conducted in south-eastern Europe. These types of attack date back 10 years, when Estonia, a cyber pioneer and former Soviet state, washit by a massive denial-of-service attack,externalrendering websites inaccessible with a barrage of requests. The potential power of attacking a country's internet infrastructure suddenly became clear, with an Estonian defence spokesmancomparing the attacks to those launched against the US on 11 September 2001,external. Hacking is not just an issue in cyber-space, it can have enormous consequences far beyond. An attack on aUkrainian power plant in 2015 led to days of blackout. Read more:Bears with keyboards - Russian hackers snoop on West Senior Russian political figures have long cultivated relationships with nationalist and often anti-EU parties in Europe. President Putin denied trying to influence events in other countries' elections In France, Marine Le Pen's far-right National Front received a â¬9m loan from a Russian bank in 2014 (then Â£7m; $11m). On 24 March, with the French election only a month away and a chance of victory in the race,she met President Putinduring a trip to Moscow. In February, the leader of right-wing nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), Frauke Petry,held talks in Moscowwith MPs close to President Putin and with Russian ultranationalists. And in Austria, the far-right Freedom Party of Austriadenied claims it had received money from Moscow,externalafter signing a co-operation agreement with Mr Putin's United Russia party. Apparently it is not just the right. In France and Germany, leading far-left groups also have key links to the Russian state, according tothis study by the Atlantic Council,external. There is nothing new about disinformation - intentionally spreading false facts. Now there is ""fake news"" too - false or misleading reporting often originating from little-known fringe websites that claim they are providing an alternative to the ""lying"" mainstream media. The US presidential election was notoriously hit by it and many European countries have been too. When Russian forces invaded Crimea in 2014, the leaders that took over from Ukraine's deposed leader were painted as fascists, justifying their intervention. The story contained enough of a kernel of truth to be persuasive. The leadership was neither a ""fascist junta"" nor ""completely fascist-free"", as the BBC's David Stern said at the time. Weeks before an Italian referendum that brought down Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in December 2016, Kremlin-funded TV Russia Today broadcast a rally on Facebook Live from Rome's Piazza del Populo. ""Protests against Italian PM hit Rome,"" it announced to hundreds of thousands of viewers. In reality, it was a rally backing Mr Renzi. Did disinformation help the No vote win in Italy's referendum? In Germany, a 13-year-old girl, ""Lisa"", told police she had been raped by people of ""Mediterranean appearance"" in January 2016. Russian state TV seized on the story, reporting it intensively and triggering anti-migrant protests against Chancellor Angela Merkel. It was later established the story was false, and Berlinhit out at Moscow for making political capital out of the case. Pressing Moscow's case are Russian-backed news organisations such asRT and Sputnik.and, on social media,an army of ""internet trolls"". The EU is so worried that it has establisheda unit of experts,externalexplicitly tasked with tackling ""Russia's ongoing disinformation campaigns"". You might also like: Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake Russia and the West: A century of subversion and suspicion Russia denies it. President Vladimir Putin says US intelligence claims of interference are absurd and irresponsible. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has even accused the CIA of masquerading as Russian hackers. But, according to Keir Giles, Russia ""is becoming less and less interested in covering its tracks"". Its interference in the US election was more or less overt, he argues, and it was happy to permit dozens of Western journalists to visit a notorious St Petersburg troll farm. That is, he says, ""partly because of a sense of urgency that the next conflict is coming"". An EU official told the BBC that disinformation campaigns were not always top-down. ""It's not like every single piece of it is orchestrated by the Kremlin,"" the official said. ""It's about creating this ecosystem that works in significant parts almost independently"", with actors working for financial motives such as clicks or funding from Russian organisations. Thousands of Russian-speakers in Germany took to the streets in response to false Russian TV reports of a rape In the case of the ""Lisa"" rape case in Germany, the story originated on a small blog, not in Moscow. But it is telling, says the official, that journalists behind the propaganda are decorated with state medals - including300 journalists covering Russia's annexation of Crimea,externaland 60 pushing a pro-Kremlin narrative on Syria. For some critics, the answer is simply power. President Putin and his allies have created ""an image of the external enemy from the Westâ¦ this demand was dormant, Putin awakened it,"" says Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center. ""His goal is to be a world leader, but on his own terms."" Others are more nuanced. For Maria Lipman,external, while anti-Western sentiment in Russia has been nurtured by the state, the mindset of a fortress under siege ""is not necessarily unfounded"". She points to the sanctions imposed by the US and EU ""couched in the language of punishing Russia to hurt its economy"". Many chart the decline of Russian relations with Europe from Ukraine's Orange Revolution in 2004-5, seen in Moscow as ""regime change"", through Russia's gas wars with Ukraine, its 2008 conflict with Georgia to the crisis and conflict in Ukraine. It was the 2014 annexation of Crimea that led to the sanctions. For Gonzalo Pozo Martin of Stockholm University, the pain of those sanctions has been felt most intensely in Russia and has coincided with falling oil prices. He argues that Russia's ""cosying up"" to the hard right in Europe is a form of leverage over the sanctions and deadlock in eastern Ukraine. But he also believes the Kremlin is investing long term in a more amenable, less Atlanticist EU. Not only would that boost Russian influence, it ""might afford Russia a freer hand over its former-Soviet neighbours"", he suggests.

"The artwork for Sign O' The Times introduced Prince's new peach and black colour scheme Thirty years ago, Prince was at a turning point in his career. The film Purple Rain and its soundtrack had made him a star in 1984. But the following two years saw, by commercial expectations, three flops: The albums Around The World In A Day and Parade, as well as the ill-conceived, self-directed movie bomb Under The Cherry Moon. He decided to cut loose. He split from his band, The Revolution, and planned a triple album - Crystal Ball. But his label, Warner Bros, put their foot down and the project became the double disc Sign O' The Times, released on 31 March, 1987. It would become one of the most acclaimed albums of the second half of the 20th century, and remains Prince's masterpiece - encompassing all of his musical personas: bedroom balladeer; penitent Christian;  one-track-mind loverman; modern-day Basie-style bandleader; whimsical storyteller; meticulous orchestrator, guitar-wielding axeman and pop craftsman. Prince, then 29 years old, created it in a period of feverish activity, making copious use of a new Linn drum machine, and a state-of-the-art Prophet-5 synthesiser, borrowed from his keyboard player Matt ""Dr"" Fink. ""Just to be clear, he really did a lot of stuff on that album on his own,"" recalls Fink. ""[Two] years later, he did Batman with no help in the studio, as far as I know."" The star released a concert film of the album in 1988, which remains the best document of his powerful live shows Even engineer Susan Rogers, his closest collaborator at the time, was banished to another room when Prince recorded vocals in the basement of his house. ""He may have been feeling a bit constricted and hemmed in by the familial,"" reflects Jill Jones, who sang with Prince from 1982 to 1990. In the recording studio with Prince Hunting for Prince's vault Prince: Sixteen pivotal songs Prince - BBC Music homepage The title track, as well as Housequake, The Ballad of Dorothy Parker, It, Hot Thing, Forever In My Life, U Got The Look, The Cross and Adore ""all emanated from him"", Fink adds. Others were reworked from sessions for a clutch of abandoned albums - Dream Factory, planned as the fourth album by Prince and the Revolution; and Camille, a disc of songs recorded by Prince in the sped-up voice of an androgynous alter-ego. For good measure, while making Sign O' The Times, Prince also wrote and recorded for other people, including The Bangles, George Clinton, Taja Sevelle, Sheila E, Sheena Easton and Jill Jones. This time-frame of his career remains the most exciting to students of The Vault, the collection of hundreds of unreleased songs housed at Paisley Park and the subject of much debate since his untimely death last April. Brent Fischer, who alongside his late father Dr Clare Fischer wrote orchestral accompaniments for Prince's albums from 1985 to 2010, estimates ""about 70 per cent of the songs we worked on with Prince remain unreleased"". Eric Leeds, his saxophonist from 1984 to 2003, reckons the figure is ""over 90 per cent... And those were just the songs with horns"". ""It is as creative a period,"" argues Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor, ""as The Beatles from Rubber Soul to The White Album; or Stevie Wonder from Music of My Mind to Songs in the Key of Life"". Taylor ranks Sign O' The Times in his ""top four favourite"" albums, alongside The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, The Beatles' White Album and Sly & The Family Stone's There's a Riot Going On. ""But I'm not afraid to group it as the best,"" he adds. ""What I like about it is it's a personal-sounding record, quite a dark record. It doesn't have his biggest hits on it and that might not reach out to quite so many people."" Prince spent three days - an uncharacteristically long time - perfecting the Sheena Easton duet U Got The Look The title and opening track was not for faint-hearted radio pluggers. It addressed Aids (""a big disease with a little name""), social inequality, drugs, gun crime and mothers struggling to feed their children. The ""O"" of the title was rendered as a peace sign. Although Fink recalls that ""Prince didn't talk politics very much"", Van Jones, a former special advisor to President Obama and Prince's friend from 2009, reckons otherwise. ""He was incredibly socially aware. You can put on Marvin Gaye's What's Going On and feel like you're living through the late '60s and '70s. Put on Sign O' The Times and you can get a sense of how the '80s and '90s were playing out. It still has that timeless quality."" Sign O' The Times and U Got the Look, recorded with Sheena Easton, laid the commercial groundwork for fans to accept what was, in part, an experimental record. According to notesPrince wrote for his 1993 Hits album,external, the latter track was deliberately written in the style of Robert Palmer's Addicted To Love - as a challenge to a friend who would only dance to his songs when they became popular. Although he laboured for hours over the tempo and structure of the song, ""the friend didn't like the song until it was in the Top 10"". ""This relationship in itself reveals a touch of his business acumen,"" says Jill Jones, hinting at Prince's pragmatism, ""because at that time he managed to parlay himself back into the pop sphere. He also needed a hit record."" Elsewhere, Prince wasn't afraid to use bandmates or even strangers for inspiration. It's Going To Be a Beautiful Night, seen as an affectionate tribute to The Revolution, was ""a live / studio jam"" according to one of its co-writers, Eric Leeds. ""It was rather spontaneously written at the soundcheck before a gig in Paris. We recorded the song live during the concert that evening. Weeks later we added additional parts in the studio."" Prince's dancer and foil Cat Glover appeared on the cover of the single, but many people thought it was the star himself, after shaving his legs One of the album's more enigmatic tracks is The Ballad Of Dorothy Parker, a psychedelic funk track about a waitress who mocks Prince when he orders a fruit cocktail (""Sounds like a real man to me""). Although it borrows the name of the wisecracking journalist, Prince had no idea who she was; telling Tionne ""T-Boz"" Watkins of TLC (who would later cover the album's If I Was Your Girlfriend) it was inspired by a real-life encounter. ""He told me it was about this waitress he met,"" she says. ""He had a crush on her and they were flirting but [Prince] told her he had a girlfriend. ""That's why he said in the song he wanted to have a bath with her - but keep his pants on."" That girlfriend (or even fiancee) for much of recording was Susannah Melvoin, who inspired and took a writing credit on the playful playground song Starfish and Coffee. According to Matt Fink, it originally had a much different title. ""It was basically a story about when she was a schoolgirl and elementary school, she and Wendy (Melvoin, Prince's ex-guitarist and Susannah's sister) had a girl in their class who was mentally challenged and she used to talk about Starfish and Pee-pee. ""She told Prince the story. He was fascinated and felt for her disability and they worked on a song which became Starfish and Coffee."" I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man features one of Prince's most incendiary guitar solos The prodigious inventiveness of Sign O' The Times won Prince five star reviews from Q Magazine and Rolling Stone, which named it one of the top 500 albums of all time. But to this day, the album provokes debate. Jones and Leeds both question Prince's former head of security Gilbert Davison, who claimed in GQ that Prince wrote the first of the two discs ""in a three-and-a-half-hour plane ride."" ""I recognise some of the songs on this album as having been written other times"" maintains Jill Jones. ""Like Strange Relationship, The Cross and others. (A studio version of I Could Never Take The Place of Your Man originates from 1982). Not so sure it all happened in one go."" T-Boz hails it as her favourite record. ""When I first heard If I was Your Girlfriend, I almost lost it. I would play it eight to 10 times a day. My mom was ready to kill me. Or Prince."" Asked about U2 beating Prince in the best album category at 1988's Grammys, she snarls: ""No disrespect to U2, but you don't wanna get me started on thatâ¦"" Jones is more relaxed, calling it ""no skin off Prince's nose"". Sign O' The Times remains Prince's ""high water mark"" among critics and musical commentators, according to both Fischer and Leeds. Leeds claims: ""It displays perhaps more than any other of his albums the range of his musicality. If someone just getting into his music was to ask me for the best place to start, I would direct them to Sign O' The Times."" The Roots' bandleader Questlove, disagrees: ""I never tell Prince newbies to start their listening with it,""he wrote on Instagram,externallast year. ""I tell 'emâ¦ 'Save it for last'. Most come back to let me know I was correct. Man, that's cool.""

With darkness falling, and your parents calling you in for tea, you squeeze in one last penalty to win the FA Cup, one last drop-kick to win the Rugby World Cup, one last putt to win The Masters. Two Yorkshiremen had those same moments growing up around Sheffield in the early part of the century. This time last year, they made one a reality. Danny Willett may have hit the drives and holed the putts that made him the first Englishman since Nick Faldo in 1996 towin the Mastersand don the famous Green Jacket, but his caddie Jonathan Smart is claiming a bit of the credit. In a documentary -When Danny Won The Masters,to be shown on BBC Two at 15:00 BST on Sunday, 2 April - the friends share their memories of an unforgettable Sunday afternoon playing the back nine at Augusta National. Willett, playing with fellow Englishman and friend Lee Westwood, began the final round three shots adrift of defending champion Jordan Spieth, who was four groups behind him on the course. The 29-year-old, who was only playing in the tournament because his son Zachariah was born a week early, takes up the tale on the 10th tee... Danny:We were two under through the first nine but we were still three shots behind Jordan. Jonny:We made an unbelievable par save on the ninth; it was the smelliest nine-footer down the hill and it kept us going. Then we had our funniest moment of the week walking down the 10th fairway. Danny said: ""We're in contention on Sunday at the Masters."" We were like little kids. We were laughing, not in disbelief, but at realising the situation we were in. Danny:I hit two lovely shots on 10 and made par. Danny:Everyone knows how difficult 11, 12 and 13 are with the wind swirling between the trees. I hit two lovely shots on 11 and made par, found the front edge on the par-three 12th and made par. We stepped on to the 13th tee and Jordan had birdied the eighth and ninth and stretched out to a five-shot lead. The scoreboard at 22:10 BST The tee shot on the par-five 13th is really difficult for me because I hit a fade and it needs a draw. We hit three wood all week and almost played it as a three-shotter, but on Sunday Jonny and I said, 'If we're going to do anything we need to try and force it a little bit'. So I stepped up and gunned it. A little five-yard draw with the driver round the corner. Jonny:Dan is adamant that was his best shot of the week. Danny:I then hit five iron to the middle of the green and had a two-putt birdie but while I was doing that, Jordan had bogeyed 10. Danny:I hit a nice drive down the right on 14 and a wedge to four feet and made birdie again. Jordan bogeyed 11. Jonny:It was a four-footer that was straight downhill but I wasn't sure if it was going to break, it wasn't obvious. Nothing is said, we both know we've got to keep pushing. Those two holes were massive for us. Willett improves to -4, Spieth drops to -5 Danny:The next time we see the leaderboard, Lee Westwood has just chipped in for eagle from the back of the 15th green to get within one of us. Jonny:Everything went ballistic. We had another birdie chance but that shot from Westy brought another player into it. I had goosebumps because the fans on the 16th can also see everything and the sound was ridiculous. Danny:I had a 10-12-footer from the back edge. I thought that was to tie the lead. I missed it but tapped in for par. John put the flag in, walked back, said 'that was a good effort' and then we heard all the oohs and aahs from the gallery. This video can not be played Jordan Spieth's calamitous seven at the par-three 12th Jonny:I'll never forget walking to the 16th tee. I saw people in the gallery putting their head in their hands and we turned around and saw they were changing the big scoreboard. Danny:It's just off the back right of 15 and Jordan had gone from five under to one under on the par-three 12th and we were at four under. So we looked at each other and waited for them to change the score because we thought they've got it wrong. After five or 10 steps, we realised we were at four, Westwood at three and Jordan at one. Jonny:That's when things got a little bit more interesting. Danny:I'd been dying for the bathroom so I ran down past the 16th tee and everyone's saying 'look at the leaderboard, you're leading the Masters'. I'm in the bathroom and my hands are shaking and I'm nervous but thinking 'this is what you practise for'. I kept telling myself, five good swings, see if you can hole a couple of putts and we'll see what happens. When I came out, I was in the best frame of mind I'd been in for a long time. Mentally I was seeing everything as it happened and I wasn't getting too far ahead. Jonny:There was no discussion. If we acknowledge the position we're in, we're admitting we're nervous, so how is that going to help? We stick to our routine. We had 181 yards to the flag. An eight iron. We created a picture, just like we do on every shot. This video can not be played Danny Willett & caddie Jonathan Smart relive magical Masters win in 2016 Danny:I hit a lovely eight iron to about 10 feet. Jonny:I walked off ahead as soon as he hit it. I'm pretty excitable and I didn't want him to see any emotion I'm giving off. Walking to the green there was no discussion. Everyone's telling Danny 'this is yours' but he probably didn't hear any of it. He was ridiculously focused. Danny:We rolled in our birdie putt. Jonny:The putt on 16 was all him. When he has a good line, why would he call me in? It only creates doubt. Danny:Westy hit it to 35 feet and three-whacked, so all of a sudden we've opened a bit more of a gap. In the past 45 minutes, we'd gone from five behind to two in front. It was bonkers. The scoreboard at 23:00 BST Jonny:On the 17th tee, I consciously said to Dan that these guys behind us are good and capable of making four birdies in a row. Danny:I hit not a bad tee shot but was a bit hindered by a tree for the second and I hit eight iron long left. Looking back, I left myself a really tricky chip. Jonny:I was thinking 'there's loads of green to work with' and it was a bog-standard chip shot. It got to the top of the hill and I thought 'he's not hit that hard enough' but it rolled over and then I thought 'that's quick' but it finished stiff and I thought that wasn't an easy chip shot! Danny:I chipped it pretty much stone dead, which, round Augusta, you don't do. I'm going to go back this year and put a ball down and just see how difficult it is. Danny:We'd hit a little cut driver off the 18th tee all week but we were pretty pumped with adrenaline and Jonny called three wood. Jonny:My book said 296 yards to reach the bunker, so it's not hard to hit a good drive straight into it. He's got a low ball flight so he couldn't have done what Sandy Lyle did out of that bunker and reach the green. Danny:He said: 'You can hit three wood as good as you like and you're never ever going to reach those bunkers.' Jonny:Everyone was hustling to get a place to stand. Danny:There was a lot of commotion. I stepped off the tee twice because people are moving up the sides, through the leaves, through the trees. Jonny:That tee shot to me looks like hitting down a hotel corridor and I'm thinking it's getting narrower. Third time he's pulled the trigger. Willett hits his final tee shot of the 2016 Masters Danny:I hit it 295 yards, straight down the middle of the fairway. Again, the hands were shaking, everything was shaking, but the walk up to the second shot was pretty enjoyable. Jonny:There's a dip down before you walk up the hill to the green. As we got to the bottom, he took a massive deep breath. I knew he was nervous so I just said to him: 'You don't need to take that deep a breath, it's not that big a hill.' Danny:I'd done 80% of the job I told myself I had to do - to make five good swings. One more to go. I think we had 183 yards, Jonny will still know. Can't miss the green left, can't miss it short, can't miss it long. I've seen it millions of times on the television, where it's impossible to get up and down from, and where you can give yourself a bit more margin. I pushed the seven iron a bit but it pitched on the collar of the green and worked off the bank back down exactly as I'd seen it before. Jonny:The walk up to the green was an unbelievable experience. We were having a little giggle to ourselves, saying 'this is pretty cool'. I wish I'd taken it in more. Danny:It was almost job done. We've got a 13-footer to get to six under, which I thought would be a difficult number for anyone to get to. But we get up on the green and look at the putt and you think it would be nice to get to six but I don't want to drop to four. So I cosied it down there and tapped in for par. Jonny:The walk from the green to the clubhouse was bonkers. It was bizarre, surreal. It's stuff you watch on television and don't do yourself. We're walking off 18 and half-thinking we've won the Masters. Danny:My father-in-law was at the back of the green, giving me a hug. You walk up to the cabin, sign your card [a bogey-free five-under-par 67], making sure you've got all that right and then it's a waiting game. We had 45, 50 minutes of waiting. Jonny:I didn't know what to do with myself. I was half-watching, half-wondering if we should go the practice range in case there's a play-off. Willett and Smart have known each other since amateur days playing for Yorkshire Danny:We sat outside the recorders' hut and I'm trying to call [wife] Nic. The signal's not great, I'm just trying to get through to her. And I'm texting my mum and dad and brothers. But I'm constantly looking at the television to see what Jordan does. Spieth birdies the par-five 15th to go three under with three to play. Danny:You're going over all the scenarios where you can get beat. And then he made bogey on 17. He dropped back to two under and it's a physical impossibility to tie. Jonny:I didn't realise the cameras were there and I just jumped on him. Danny:I was on the phone to Nic, and Jonny jumped on me on the sofa. Everyone's seen that on the TV. That was the moment you realise that's what you've worked for and what you've just achieved. It isn't a dream. It's come true. Masters tradition dictates the defending champion helps the winner put on the Green Jacket Danny:Every major trophy is significant in its own way but the Green Jacket is special. It's having your locker in the champions' locker room. It's your jacket being in there for the rest of your life. It's being able to go back to Augusta forever, until you don't want to play any more. The ceremony in Butler Cabin. You don't get to go inside the places I got to see at Augusta unless you win at Augusta. I'm honoured to be part of that now. Jonny:We were whisked round the back of the clubhouse to Butler Cabin. That was cool. You've watched it on TV and then we're doing it. Dan's putting a Green Jacket on. I remember them fitting it because they've got them all lined up. Before he went in the room he looked across at me, just laughing. It was nuts. We've all had putts as juniors to win the Masters. I always dreamt about doing it but it was mega to be as close as I was to it and have some sort of contribution to Dan winning it. Danny:When you walk through the door at home, you're not Masters champion any more. You're dad, or Dan. You're straight back to changing nappies and you take the jacket off so you don't get anything on it. The only time I've watched it back was that evening. I opened a beer and sat on the sofa with Nic. Watched it for an hour and a half. Highlights of what we'd done two days before. Just a crazy old few days really. Willett relives magical Masters win.

"Ivory is highly prized in China, where items can sell for thousands of dollars There was a time when Liu Fenghai had 25 craftsmen working exclusively on elephant ivory at his factory in the northern city of Harbin. He would buy the raw ivory and then have it turned into the pendants, paperweights and statues that once filled shelf after shelf in his shop, as well as the much larger, elaborately carved whole tusks proudly displayed on plinths of their own. At the height of the market some of them could sell for many thousands of dollars. Now, to the delight of conservationists everywhere, China is calling a halt to this legal, state-sanctioned trade. But Mr Liu, as you might expect, is far from happy. ""I feel sad,"" the 48-year-old said. ""I don't feel good at all. This tradition has been carried on for thousands of years but now it will die in the hands of our generation."" ""I feel like a sinner,"" he added. ""In a few hundred years time, we will be seen as the sinners of history."" Mr Liu says he will mourn the end of the legal ivory trade in China In fact, although ivory carving can indeed be traced back centuries in China, for much of that time it existed only as a niche art form and the Chinese made barely a dent in the global ivory trade. Throughout the 19th and 20th Centuries, the mass slaughter of elephants was carried out at the hands of the European colonial powers and then later North American entrepreneurs. The war on elephants 'Elephant refugee' problem in Africa Does burning actually destroy ivory? Western demand for ivory ornaments, jewellery, piano keys and billiard balls helped reduce the African elephant population from more than 20 million in the year 1800 to just two million by 1960. Then came Japan's post-war economic rise and the slaughter was propelled through the 1970s and '80s, by which time the elephant was teetering on the brink of extinction. It was only with the international ban on the trading of elephant ivory in 1989 that the species was given a brief respite. Once again though, it was another major shift in the global financial order that signalled further disaster - China's emergence as a major economic power. An explosion of wealth coupled with the Communist Party's unique blend of corruption and crony capitalism made ivory the perfect repository of value, both for ostentatious displays of success and discrete gift giving. This video can not be played The facts and figures behind China's ivory trade An art form became an industry and in a few short years China began to account for up to70% of the global demand,externalfor ivory. Today, as a result of the surge in poaching, the elephant is once again facing complete annihilation, with estimates suggesting there arefewer than half a million left,externalin Africa. There may be no more wild populations within a decade. If Mr Liu believes it is a sin to lose an ancient art, how much more of a sin to lose an ancient species in the name of the mass-produced - often machine-carved - ivory tat that makes up the bulk of the products on sale in China today? Not a moment too soon, the Chinese government has decided which side of history it wants to be on. This week, by the end of business hours on Friday, almost half of China's authorised, government-approved ivory factories and shops will have closed their doors for good. A team of officials from the UN Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) will be on hand to witness the shutdown. The rest of China's legal trade will be gone by the end of the year - a total of 34 factories and 138 shops. 'You may as well kill us':Human cost of India's meat 'ban' Vegetable ivory:Could an obscure seed save the elephant? 'Nothing short of miraculous':Rare tigers found in eastern Thailand It is a deeply symbolic moment, a ""game changer"" according to campaigners, with one of the most high profile and vocal, the UK's Prince William, publically applauding the Chinese government's decision as ""an important commitment"". No small irony, perhaps, given the role the prince's own ancestors played in promoting the trade, with more than 1,000 ivory items still held in the royal collection. China's move could put pressure on other markets where ivory is traded, like Hong Kong Estimates suggest poaching has reduced the African elephant population to less than half a million Campaigners say China's move could be a ""game-changer"" for elephants But closing China's carving workshops and retail outlets is so important, it is argued, not only for its own sake, but because this legal business acts as cover for a much bigger black market trade. In 2008 China was allowed, under the Cites system, to buy a 62-tonne stockpile of African ivory. The theory was that, with careful monitoring and a system of certificates, the stockpile would provide a controlled supply to China's factories and therefore dampen demand for illegal ivory by helping to keep prices low. It has had the opposite effect. It appears to have in fact stimulated demand by giving consumers the green light that ivory was ok to buy. Coupled with poor enforcement, corruption and fraudulent certifications a huge amount of illegal, newly poached ivory flooded into China and on to the market, some of itunder the guise of Cites authorised stock,external. Demand rose further and prices, rather than going down, skyrocketed. Research suggests that the illegal stockpile of ivory in China today may stand at1,000 tonnes or more,external, far in excess of that supposedly well regulated and controlled quantity purchased back in 2008. Now, although there are undoubtedly other factors at play - not least the slowing Chinese economy and the crackdown on official graft and gift giving - the announcement of the ban on the legal trade does appear to be helping to bring the speculative frenzy to an end. Consumers and dealers have been sent a strong signal that the game is up and prices of ivory have recently been dropping, from more than $2,000 (Â£1,611) per kg in 2014 to around $700 per kilo today. Despite ivory seizures around the world, like this one in Thailand, smuggling persists Big questions remain, however. As in other markets, like the UK, the Chinese announcement appears to allow for the continued trading of antiques, which campaigners fear may act as a loophole. Meanwhile, the government has not said what it will do with the remaining stockpile of legal ivory and how it will prevent it from leaking on to the black market. And while the new policy may well drive the illegal trade further underground, controlling it will still depend on the resources given to law enforcement agencies. Our own research suggests a less than wholehearted willingness to tackle wildlife crime. For more than two decades, trade in rhino horn has been completely prohibited in China. Selling, purchasing, transporting or mailing it has been punishable by harsh sentences, including life imprisonment for the worst offenders. And yet, via a quick search on the internet, traders can be found openly offering rhino horn for sale as whole pieces, as jewellery or for use in Chinese medicine. The risk attached to both buying and selling appears to be small. ""Trust me, I've never had any problems before,"" one of the online vendors said, after sending us pictures of rhino horn bracelets. Exchange between the BBC and an online rhino horn trader But now, after decades of defending ivory carving as an intangible cultural asset, the Chinese government is finally turning its back on it. It has decided that the diplomatic advantage in joining the growing international consensus far outweighs the relatively small economic value of the industry. Its decision will put pressure on other jurisdictions that continue to allow a regulated, domestic ivory trade to do more, most notably Japan and Hong Kong, but perhaps also countries like the UK. But, however significant, no one believes China's decision will bring an end to elephant poaching. That goal will only be accomplished when there is a shift in the attitude of consumers in China and other countries where the demand remains high. And while there is promising evidence to show thatpublic information campaigns are working,external, it will take time. In his office above his ivory shop in Harbin, complete with a footstool made from a severed elephant leg, I ask Mr Liu if he agrees that elephants are more beautiful alive than dead. ""I don't agree,"" he says. ""Ivory is the best material for carving art. Even if it is as small as a grain of rice, you can carve a poem on it."" ""You cannot say an elephant is beautiful but a piece of ivory is not.""

"The moment you realise that wasn't really the boss who asked you to make the payment The email from the boss looked kosher. He said a new supplier needed paying urgently - Â£50,000 to secure an important contract. He wanted it done as soon as possible because he was on holiday and didn't want to worry anymore about work. This rang true to the finance director because his boss had already posted a photo of his Greek island getaway on Instagram. His email address looked genuine too. But, of course, it wasn't the boss. It was a fraudster who'd done his research and was skilled at psychological manipulation. The small manufacturing firm - that wishes to remain anonymous - ended up losing Â£150,000 to the fraudster in the mistaken belief that he was a legitimate supplier. When the boss found out the bad news, he fired the finance director. This is an all-too-common story, involving business email compromise (BEC) or CEO fraud, as it's known to law enforcement. Three words to look out for in email subject headers that should set alarm bells ringing are ""urgent"", ""payment"" and ""request"". While you're relaxing on a Greek beach, who's sending money on your behalf? It is a relatively lo-tech fraud but phenomenally successful - around 22,000 firms and organisations around the world have lost more than $3bn (Â£2.4bn) to it over the last three years, the FBI says. In March,the US Department of Justice arrested a 48-year-old Lithuanian man, Evaldas Rimasauskas,external, for allegedly stealing more than $100m (Â£80m) from two internet companies in an email fraud between 2013 and 2015. ""Email fraud is the number one attack for our clients,"" says Edward Cowen, chief executive of Remora, a cybersecurity consultancy. ""We're talking Â£100,000 losses typically, but we've had losses in the millions. One guy nearly got away with 7m euros (Â£6m)."" Cybersecurity firm Proofpoint reports that its 5,000 clients saw a 45% rise in BEC fraud in the last three months of 2016. Two-thirds of these attacks used the simple trick of spoofing the email address to make it look like the message came from someone senior within the organisation. But often, if you reply to such emails, the ""To"" address will show a completely different domain name, or a company name that looks very similar but has an extra letter added or two letters flipped around. As our brains are very good at making sense out of words with jumbled up letters, we often don't notice these ""mistakes"". Business email compromise fraud is proving worryingly successful ""People are still the weakest link when it comes to cybersecurity,"" says Rob Holmes, Proofpoint's vice-president of products. ""It's a remarkably unsophisticated type of fraud from a tech perspective, but the bad guys do extensive research into the top executives to make their emails look as plausible as possible."" The usual tactic with BEC fraud is for the fraudster to pose as an authoritarian boss barking orders to subordinates in the accounts department. ""More junior people are more likely to do what they're told without question,"" says Mr Holmes. ""So if your boss is quite authoritarian you are more prone to this type of attack."" Another tactic is to establish a rapport with another member of staff who assumes the emails are coming from a senior executive. Once the fraudster has lulled the target into a false sense of security, he asks for payroll data or other useful information. It's easy to spoof the ""From"" field in an email address and to edit the name label of a sender. So instead of seeing the email address in full, recipients just see the person's name. Firms with authoritarian bosses are more vulnerable to CEO fraud, says Rob Holmes The fraudsters may also include made-up exchanges between senior executives in the email, perhaps discussing the deal or contract that the payment refers to. And if hackers have gained access to the chief executive's travel schedule they can make an email sound even more plausible. ""Make the payment now because after that I'll be in the air for 12 hours and unreachable,"" a typical email might say. Knowing that the boss is away also stops staff being able to verify the payment request in person. Fraudsters have also been known to follow up the email with a telephone call from someone pretending to be a lawyer or accountant ""verifying"" the transaction. All these techniques add credibility to the lie. ""These are very smart people - sometimes hackers will take six months getting all the data they need to make the emails believable,"" says Mr Cowen. And the fact that these attacks typically involve just a single email means that they bypass security systems designed to pick up several emails coming from different IP [internet protocol] addresses. So what should businesses be doing to protect themselves? Cybersecurity firms like Proofpoint say their systems can spot emails pretending to originate from within your company. And verification programs like DMARC [Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance] also help weed out impostors. But there are simpler ways to combat BEC fraud, argues Remora's Mr Cowen. ""About 70% of our frauds could be prevented with a single phone call. It's really that simple,"" he says. In other words, don't just rely on one email from the ""boss""- verify the request in person or over the phone. Tom Kemp, boss of security company Centrify, says: ""I've told the people here that I will never ever send an email asking for a wire transfer or for personally identifiable information to be sent to me. ""If need be, pick up the phone and actually call me."" Firms could also beef up their policies governing who should be authorised to make payments and how many people should approve them, says Michael DeCesare, chief executive of cybersecurity company ForeScout. ""In our company it needs approval from five people before a wire transfer can be made,"" he told the BBC. And Amar Singh, chief executive of the Cyber Management Alliance, an organisation that trains managers on how to plan for and respond to cyber-attacks, calls for ""pragmatic paranoia"".

"Basheer and Kareem had not seen each other for 14 years I've dreamed of going back to Mosul for so long. The city where I was born and grew up has always occupied a special place in my heart and it's full of happy memories. My Mosul was a city of green and shady streets, with beautiful, old houses overlooking the River Tigris. It was a city of books with a famous university where my father taught and I studied. It was a place where Iraqis came for a break, to breathe its cool, fresh air and visit its world-renowned archaeological sites. I hadn't been home for more than a decade, and knew that after two brutal years of occupation by so-called Islamic State (IS), Mosul had suffered much damage. But it was still a shock to see it for real. As we drove through the streets where I played as a child, I found myself fighting back the tears. Familiar places had become almost unrecognisable. Everywhere you looked there were bullet-scarred walls and bombed-out buildings. The roads were littered with twisted metal and burned out cars. It was a heartbreaking homecoming. Basheer (centre left) and his best friend Kareem (centre right) studied at Mosul University in the 1990s The main road into Mosul was full of trucks bringing in supplies, and ambulances, sirens wailing, ferrying out the sick and injured. Eastern Mosul, where I used to live, was freed from IS control in January but a fierce battle continues over the western side of the city. IS militants in the west are sending a daily barrage of mortars and armed drones to disrupt life in the east, and there are frequent suicide bombings. The peace in eastern Mosul is so fragile that we had to travel with an Iraqi army escort. My first stop was the home of my oldest friend, Kareem. We grew up together and had always kept in touch until IS occupation made it too dangerous. We drew up outside Kareem's house and suddenly there he was. We hugged each other and cried - so happy to see each other, but so sad at everything that had been lost since we last met. Basheer as a child with his father, Kasid, who taught Arabic Linguistics at Mosul university Over glasses of tea, Kareem told me what it had been like to live under IS. Like many in the city, he had at first welcomed the militants. It was shocking, but unsurprising to hear. In the chaos and violence of the post-Saddam era, Mosul was rife with corruption and sectarian tension. The largely Sunni local population hated the Shia-dominated central government and army who they blamed for their troubles. ""We thought IS were revolutionaries here to help people and restore social justice and fairness,"" Kareem said. But his support was short-lived as the realities of everyday life in the ""caliphate"" became clear. Hope was soon replaced by fear as arrests, public executions and floggings became a daily occurrence. Eastern Mosul, where Basheer grew up, suffered heavy damage during weeks of fighting The militants took over houses in my and Kareem's old neighbourhood. It was such an eerie feeling for me to know that. Kareem's beloved elder brother, who worked for the Iraqi electoral commission, was detained and executed. ""His last wish was to hug and kiss his five children before he died,"" said Kareem. ""But they didn't let him."" As a journalist, Kareem also feared arrest and he moved many times to keep out of sight. But there were also occasional moments of humour. We remembered another friend of ours, who kept pigeons - a popular pastime in Mosul until it was banned by IS. The friend had apparently used the birds to fly illicit supplies of cigarettes - also banned - to another friend in a different part of the city. We both laughed at the story, but I could see that Kareem was not the same person I used to know. He looked shaky and I could see fear and uncertainty in his eyes. Although he's back in his own home now, like most people he has no electricity, no water and relies on gas canisters to cook and heat water. Many people in Mosul say they won't really feel at ease until the whole city is free. ""Imagine Mosul as a pair of lungs,"" one old man told me. ""It's made up of two parts. You can't be healthy with only one."" Everyone is afraid the militants will come back, and the security forces are on constant look out for sleeper cells. One morning we joined the National Security Service on a raid to arrest suspected IS collaborators. It was a surreal experience. Basheer bumped into an old neighbour while on a police raid The suspects' house turned out to be on the very same street where I lived when I was at school. As we climbed out of the police vehicle, in helmets and body armour, surrounded by heavily-armed police, an old neighbour recognised me and cheerfully waved. It was a reminder of the way violence and ordinary life co-exist in Mosul. We watched the police storm the house, grabbing the suspects in full view of terrified wives and children. They said they'd spent weeks building a case against the men. I hoped they'd got the right people. Restoring security in Mosul is a delicate business and the way the security forces behave now will determine whether they keep or lose the trust of people here. On my last day in Mosul we drove around the city and it was good to see life slowly returning. Women's dress shops and beauty salons are re-opening. Men have started wearing jeans and t-shirts again. But best of all were the schools. Many children are going back to school for the first time since 2014 My visit coincided with the week when hundreds of Mosul children finally went back to school. Many had been kept at home to avoid an IS education. It was uplifting to see crowds of happy, young faces at the school gates. Excited boys and girls, with school books in backpacks, crowded around our camera. Their laughter filled the air, and for a moment, despite all the uncertainty and chaos of life in Mosul, I saw a glimpse of hope for the future.

"""All politics is local,"" was the famed dictum of the legendary House Speaker Tip O'Neill. O'Neill hailed from an age when lawmakers had a more intimate relationship with the voters who sent them to Washington and were also more willing to cut deals with their partisan adversaries. Nowadays, however, it would seem that all politics is oppositional. The Republican healthcare debacle is but another reminder of how a solutions-based politics has given way to a protest-based politics, how for many lawmakers in Washington it has primarily become a negative pursuit. For the best part of a decade, the GOP revelled in its success as the Party of No, obstructing and paralysing Barack Obama's legislative agenda. Rather than paying a penalty at the polls for its blocking strategy, it was rewarded. It retained control of the House of Representatives from 2011 to the present day, and became the majority party in the Senate at the 2014 mid-term elections. Its wrecking tactics also helped create a rubble-strewn path for Donald Trump's insurgent presidential campaign. So badly was Washington broken, became his refrain, only an outsider could fix it. As the new president discovered last week, however, sections of the Party of No remain the Party of No. House Speaker Paul Ryan candidly conceded as much last Friday. ""We were a 10-year opposition party,"" he said, dejectedly. ""Being against things was easy to do."" Representative Tom Rooney of Florida, who before entering Congress in 2009 served as a military lawyer, delivered an even more withering assessment of his own party. ""I've been in this job of eight years,"" he told The Atlantic, ""and I'm wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that's been something positive, that's been something other than stopping something else from happening."" Where the liberal fight goes in the age of Trump How disastrous is the healthcare collapse for Trump? Rather than lash out at the Democrats, as the president did, Paul Ryan put this humiliating defeat down to the GOP making a painful transition from opposition to government. But the problem is not so easily explained away. This is not transitory. The DNA of the GOP has changed. No longer does it operate as a conventional, cohesive party. Rather it is acting more like a protest movement. The inability of the Republican Congress to advance the Trump administration's legislative agenda will be a recurring problem. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows talks to reporters amid the healthcare bill fight Part of the Republican dilemma, obviously, is arithmetic. The Freedom Caucus, this dissident rump of ideological hardliners that neither Trump nor Ryan could corral, has enough members to cancel out the party's 20-plus seat majority in the House. But the problem posed by the Freedom Caucus is also attitudinal and ideological. Being part of government will not automatically alter its obstructionist modus operandi, because the 30 or so lawmakers who comprise its membership are so mistrustful of government. Freedom Caucus: Do these 29 white men run America? Trump declares war on party rebels Many were elected during the 2010 Tea Party rebellion, and arrived in Washington seeking to upend the city. As they showed last week, they are much more than pebble-throwers. They can hurl a wrecking ball at Trump's presidency. It explains Thursday's extraordinary tweet, which doubled as a declaration of war: ""The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018!"" Because of the checks and balances hard-wired into the US system, a well-organised minority has always been able to thwart the majority, especially in the Senate. Just recall the immense power of the Southern Caucus in the Democratic Party for much of the last century. This well-disciplined rump of diehard segregationists kept the Jim Crow system of racial apartheid in place until the mid-1960s. Its members turned the Senate into what William S White of the New York Times memorably described in the mid-1950s as ""the South's unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg"". Senator Strom Thurmond was among the Southern Democrats who tried to block civil rights legislation Civil rights legislation could only overcome southern filibusters with bipartisan support. But that level of bipartisanship, the triumph of patriotism over party, is no longer a feature of Washington life. It ceased to be a long while ago. Nor does the Trump White House and the Republican congressional leadership merely have to contend with the Freedom Caucus. Appeasing hardliners on healthcare meant losing support from Republican moderates. On tax reform, if Paul Ryan pushes a border adjustment tax - a tax on imports combined with a tax break on exports - he will run into problems with free traders in his party. A costly infrastructure bill, not to mention the expense of Trump's border wall with Mexico, will incur the wrath of Republican deficit hawks. However artful the dealmaker, these are hard circles to square. It would be misleading to suggest that oppositional politics is solely a problem of the right. The Democrats have signalled they intend to pursue much the same ""Politics of No"" approach under Trump as the GOP did under Barack Obama. The Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer has already vowed to deploy the filibuster against Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch. Sixty votes in the Senate are required to overcome this blocking device. The Republicans have only 52. The talk is already of what's being called a ""nuclear"" showdown. This video can not be played Supreme Court fight: What's the 'nuclear option'? Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign also underscored the limitations of unrelenting negativity. Her stump speech, rather than offering a vision of what America would look like under her presidency, was primarily an assault on Donald Trump. What was her signature policy proposal? What was her economic message? I covered her campaign closely for 18 months, and honestly could not answer that question. Her uninspiring campaign was centred on taking down the man rather than offering a manifesto. Both healthcare and Hillary point to another failing of oppositional politics: its intellectual and programmatic emptiness. Make America Great Again. Build the Wall. Stronger Together. Take back control, the battle cry of Britain's Brexiteers. Oppositional politics is expressed these days in short slogans rather than big ideas. With political dialogue increasingly expressed in catchphrases, the tendency is for campaign slogans to be superseded by governing slogans: ""Repeal and Replace"" in Washington, ""Brexit Means Brexit"" in Westminster. But what do those mantras actually mean? The Republicans had seven years to come up with an answer, and failed. In Britain, even as Article 50 is triggered, there's still great uncertainty among policy-makers, and still more among voters, as to what precisely Brexit will entail. Republicans rallied together to oppose Obama; now what? Post-referendum Britain also illustrates how a politics defined by opposition can quickly turn winners into losers. UKIP has been in internal disarray since last year's referendum, partly because it does not have the European Union to rail against. In Washington it required the presence in the White House of Barack Obama to unify the Republican Party. Rallying around Donald Trump does not come so easily. And while gridlock is ordinarily the consequence of divided government, the healthcare debacle suggests it has become endemic. Even a party with a monopoly on Washington power could not get a major bill through the House of Representatives, where it commands a comfortable majority. This impasse was decades in the making. It has shown once again that as the Republican Party on Capitol Hill has become more unmanageable, the United States has become more ungovernable. So while the main headline from last week's debacle was Trump's humbling setback, the larger historical take is the chronic dysfunction in Washington. As Governor John Kasich, a former Republican congressman himself, said during a visit to the capital this week. ""There is a fundamental flaw in this place. It does not work anymore.""
