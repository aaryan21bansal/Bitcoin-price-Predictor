"The woman keeps the customers' details hidden under her bed at a house in Southampton An ex-bank worker who has the financial details of 1,600 customers hidden under her bed said her efforts to return them have ""taken over her life"". The woman told the BBC she was sent home with the sensitive data as part of her job selling mortgages for NatWest in Southampton more than 10 years ago. She was sacked in 2009 for failing to return customer information, but claims the bank refused to take it back. NatWest said the situation had resulted in ""no customer detriment"". It added that it believed until 2019 the woman had returned all of the customer data in 2012. The woman said the documents included account details belonging to customers in Hampshire, Dorset, Berkshire, London, Bristol, Surrey, Essex, Herefordshire and the West Midlands. In exchange for the return of the information, the woman ""continues to seek a settlement agreement involving payment from the bank and an uncapped indemnity in relation to any claims against her,"" a spokesperson for NatWest Group said. But the woman said she believed NatWest should compensate her and claimed this was never contingent on her returning the documents. She was employed at a number of NatWest branches in Hampshire before working from home between 2006 and 2009 The woman, who asked to remain anonymous because she fears being targeted by burglars, said she becomes anxious about leaving the data before going on holiday, and feels like the bank ""doesn't care"" about the customers affected. ""To me, that's 1,600 people - if the house got burgled and it fell into the wrong hands... what on earth would happen to them?"" she said. ""The bank have put me in a position that I should never have been in."" She added that shredding the documents would not protect her from any potential future litigation and it ""wasn't the right thing to do"". The woman, who was allowed to work from home in 2006, said while working for NatWest she was generating Â£1m in mortgage business a week. The woman showed the BBC boxes of correspondence with the bank covering a 15-year period This involved handling account and customer identification numbers, names, sort codes, credit card details, direct debits, and addresses. She said she became concerned about holding large quantities of highly sensitive data outside of the bank, and asked the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) for advice while she still worked for NatWest. The woman said she has now reached a stalemate with the bank over the wording of a receipt that would agree conditions for the return of the documents. A letter from the ICO, seen by the BBC, said a receipt signed by both parties would not be ""considered unreasonable... especially as it is understood that the bank has no record of what data it had given to [the woman] to carry out her duties"". The woman was sacked for gross misconduct in 2009. A redacted email she obtained via a subject access request showed a NatWest employee had said of her dismissal: ""That's what I call an achievement."" Alison Rose, chief executive of NatWest Group, has not responded to emails sent to her by the woman However, she said the ongoing decade-long fight to return the documents has ""taken over my life"". ""It's taken me away from my children, it's given me anxiety,"" she said. A spokesperson for NatWest Group, which was branded as Royal Bank of Scotland during much of the dispute, said the woman was dismissed for gross misconduct for ""her repeated refusal to return customer information"". They said they had ""no concerns that this historical documentation has been shared with any other parties"", and had previously believed all of the data was returned in 2012 via the ICO.

"Brexit minister Lord Frosthas resigned from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. In a letter, he tells Mr Johnson they have put the UK onto a new path - but warns about taking ""coercive measures"" to control the spread of coronavirus. Mr Johnson responds to say he is sorry to receive the resignation but that Lord Frost should be ""immensely proud of your historic service"". Dear Boris, I have led our EU exit process for the two and half years since you became Prime Minister. In those years we have restored the UK's freedom and independence as a country and begun the process of building a new relationship with the EU. That will be a long-term task. That is why we agreed earlier this month that I would move on in January and hand over the baton to others to manage our future relationship with the EU. It is disappointing that this plan has become public this evening and in the circumstances I think it is right for me to write to step down with immediate effect. It has been a huge honour and privilege to work with you over the last five years, first in the Foreign Office and then in No.10. You have been an outstanding leader at a moment of grave constitutional crisis for this country. Many said that it would be impossible to deliver what we did: an end to political turbulence by implementing the referendum result, a stunning election victory, an exit from the EU which gave us full freedom about our future choices as a country, and finally putting in place the world's broadest and indeed only zero-tariff free trade deal. You and I have always shared the same approach on Brexit and I do not think we would have achieved so much without that close common understanding of our aims. Brexit is now secure. The challenge for the Government now is to deliver on the opportunities it gives us. You know my concerns about the current direction of travel. I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change. Three hundred years of history show that countries which take that route grow and prosper, and I am confident we will too. We also need to learn to live with Covid and I know that is your instinct too. You took a brave decision in July, against considerable opposition, to open up the country again. Sadly it did not prove to be irreversible, as I wished, and believe you did too. I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere. Together we have put this country onto a new path. I am confident that under your leadership this newly free Britain can succeed and prosper hugely. I wish you and the Government every success in that. David Dear David, Thank you for your letter tendering your resignation as Minister of State at the Cabinet Office. I was very sorry to receive it, given everything you have achieved and contributed to this Government for which I am very grateful. I particularly want to pay tribute to your unique contribution towards getting Brexit done. First, as my EU Sherpa to ensure a smooth withdrawal from  the EU on 31 January  2020. Then, as the chief negotiator to secure the Trade and Cooperation  Agreement, which  fully restored the  UK's sovereignty as we took back control of our laws, borders, money, trade and fisheries. Many said that it would be impossible to secure such a comprehensive agreement â the first zero tariff, zero quota deal the EU had ever agreed â in  such  short  time,  even  before  the  COVID-19  pandemic  struck. It simply would not have been possible without your relentless hard work, resolve and vision. You should be immensely proud of your historic service to this Government and this country. After joining Cabinet as Minister of State at the Cabinet  Office in March, you have helped oversee the implementation of the TCA, guided our relationship with the  EU and pushed this Government to  maximise the economic and political opportunities of Brexit. Crucially you have helped highlight and sought to address the destabilising impact the current operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol is having  on communities in Northern Ireland, which is undermining the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the territorial integrity of this country. Once again, I am grateful for all you have achieved and hope that you will be able to serve this country again in the future.

"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line Britain and its allies are ""highly unlikely"" to send troops to defend Ukraine if Russia invades the country, the UK's defence secretary has said. ""We shouldn't kid people we would,"" Ben Wallace told the Spectator magazine. ""The Ukrainians are aware of that."" Russia has moved thousands of troops near Ukraine's eastern borders, leading Western powers to urge President Vladimir Putin to de-escalate tensions. Moscow has denied plans to attack and has asked for urgent talks with the US. On Friday, Russia demanded strict limits on the activities of the US-led Nato military alliance in countries in Eastern Europe. The alliance was originally set up to defend Europe against possible threats from the former Soviet Union. In an interview with the Spectator,external, Mr Wallace said Ukraine was ""not a member of Nato, so it is highly unlikely that anyone is going to send troops into Ukraine to challenge Russia"". ""That is why we are doing the best diplomatically to say to Putin don't do this,"" he said, adding that ""severe economic sanctions"" were the most likely form of deterrent. Mr Wallace has previously said that the UK stands ""shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine"" and remains determined to support them. Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What would be the fallout if Russia invaded Ukraine? Can a solution be found for war in Ukraine's east? Earlier this week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Mr Putin of ""significant consequences"" of any ""destabilising action"" in the region. Ukraine shares borders with both the EU and Russia, but as a former Soviet republic it has deep social and cultural ties with Russia. The Kremlin has accused Ukraine of provocation with its ambition to join Nato. In proposals announced on Friday,Russia set out a series of radical demands,external- including requiring countries that joined Nato after the fall of the Soviet Union not to deploy troops or weapons in areas where they could be seen as a threat to Russia. Heavy bombers and warships would not be allowed in areas outside their national airspace or waters from which they could launch an attack as part of the proposals. That would mean Nato not playing any role at all in any of the three Baltic republics or Poland, as well as having to abandon any plans for Ukraine and Georgia to eventually join the Western alliance. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said on Saturday that the proposals were an attempt to avoid a possible military conflict. He said Moscow was ready to hold talks with the US in an effort ""to turn a military or a military-technical scenario of confrontation into a political process which will really strengthen military security"", Russia's Interfax news agency reported. The US has said it is open to discussions, but that it would be putting its own concerns on the table too. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki also said on Friday that there would be ""no talks on European security without our European allies and partners"". Russia has long resisted Ukraine's move towards European institutions. It invaded Georgia during a brief war in 2008 and seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, before backing separatists in eastern Ukraine. Conflict in the east began in April 2014 and has claimed more than 14,000 lives, with casualties still being reported.

"This video can not be played Watch time-lapse footage showing the long Eurostar queue at London's St Pancras station on 17 December The Omicron variant is ""spreading at lightning speed"" in Europe and will likely become dominant in France by the start of next year, French Prime Minister Jean Castex has warned. He spoke on Friday, hours before France imposed strict travel restrictions on those entering from the United Kingdom. The UK has so far been the hardest hit in the region, withnearly 25,000 confirmed Omicron cases,externalon Saturday. Across the continent, health officials are bracing for a wave of infections. Additional restrictions were announced in Germany, the Republic of Ireland and the Netherlands on Friday as governments seek to stem the tide. Europe has already seen more than 89 million cases and 1.5 million Covid-related deaths, according to the latest EU figures. But Germany's Health Minister Karl Lauterbach told reporters on Friday the country ""must prepare for a challenge that we have not yet had in this form"", while its public health agencydesignated France, Norway and Denmark as ""high risk"",externaldue to rising infections in those countries. On Saturday Germany's regional health ministers called on the government in Berlin to bring in tougher rules on arrivals from the UK due to the high number of Omicron cases there. In Ireland, where a third of new cases have been due to the new variant, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said they were expecting ""to see infections at a rate that is far in excess of anything we have seen to date"". The warnings came as the UK reported a record number of Covid infections for a third day in a row - more than 93,000 - largely driven by Omicron. What are France's new rules for UK travellers? Ports and Eurostar busy ahead of France travel ban Franceclosed its borders to people travelling from the UK for business or tourism at 23:00 GMT on Friday, with huge queues forming at the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals as people tried to enter before the ban came into effect. It is not the only country tightening its controls. Earlier this week, Italy, Greece and Portugal announced that visitors from the EU will need to present a negative test result on arrival - even those who have been vaccinated. Speaking hours before the new rules came in, Mr Castex said the travel restrictions were part of a series of measures being brought in to stem the tide of infections. They include shortening the gap between the second and third dose of vaccine, and requiring a full vaccination to enter restaurants and long-distance public transport. Additionally, all official New Years Eve celebrations and firework displays have been cancelled. Mr Castex also said the government would announce new steps to tackle vaccine hesitancy next year, saying it was ""not acceptable that the refusal of a few million French people to be vaccinated puts the life of an entire country at risk"". On Saturday France's health minister Olivier Veran said up to 10% of new confirmed infections in the country are thought to be the Omicron variant. According tothe country's coronavirus dashboard,external, France currently has an average of more than 48,000 new daily infections. There were huge queues of vehicles at the Port of Dover on Friday as people tried to enter France before travel restrictions started on Saturday Meanwhile, inthe Netherlands, Dutch health experts have said the country should go into a ""strict"" lockdown, local media has reported. Prime Minister Mark Rutte has said Omicron could be the country's dominant strain by January, similar to France. Since late November, bars, restaurants and most shops have been ordered to close between 17:00 and 05:00 local time. This measure was meant to end before Christmas, but will now continue until 14 January. The Netherlands recorded more than 15,400 infections on Friday - less than previous days, but far higher overall than any other time during the pandemic. As the Dutch healthcare system deals with an influx of Covid patients, routine care and all but urgent operations have been postponed. The hospitality industry in theRepublic of Irelandhas said it will be devastated by new rules from Monday that mean pubs, restaurants, theatres and cinemas must close every night by 20:00 local time. Hospitality venues in Ireland to close early Netherlands further tightens Covid lockdown The move has also been criticised by some politicians from Ireland's governing coalition, who said the new rules would encourage more gatherings in people's homes. Sports venues will have to operate at 50% capacity or have attendance numbers capped at 5,000. Wedding celebrations will be allowed to go on until midnight - with a maximum of 100 guests. There is already a limit of four households allowed to socialise together inside a home. TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) Leo Varadkar said the government would announce financial measures on Monday to support businesses affected by the new rules.

"People went shopping on Saturday before the lockdown was announced The Netherlands has announced a strict lockdown over Christmas amid concerns over the Omicron coronavirus variant. Non-essential shops, bars, gyms hairdressers and other public venues will be closed until at least mid-January. Two guests per household will be allowed - four over the holidays. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the measures were ""unavoidable"". Countries across Europe have been tightening restrictions as the heavily mutated variant spreads. The new rules in the Netherlands - the strictest to have been announced over Omicron so far - come into force on Sunday. ""I stand here tonight in a sombre mood. And a lot of people watching will feel that way too,"" Mr Rutte told a news conference on Saturday. ""To sum it up in one sentence, the Netherlands will go back into lockdown from tomorrow."" Booster at least 80% effective against severe Omicron How can I tell I have Omicron? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Under the new rules,,externalpeople are being urged to stay at home as much as possible. Strict limits will be placed on the number of people who can meet - a maximum of two guests aged 13 and over will be allowed in people's homes, and four on 24-26 December and on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Events are not permitted other than funerals, weekly markets selling groceries and professional sports matches with no spectators. All schools will be closed until at least 9 January, while other lockdown measures will remain in place until at least 14 January. Restaurants can continue to sell takeaway meals, and non-essential shops can offer click and collect services. The BBC's Anna Holligan in The Hague said the announcement was being met with disbelief and dismay. ""I can now hear the whole of the Netherlands sighing. This is exactly one week before Christmas, another Christmas that is completely different from what we would like,"" Mr Rutte said. But, he added, a failure to act now would likely lead to ""an unmanageable situation in hospitals"". Earlier on Saturday, people rushed to do their Christmas shopping amid reports that new measures were about to be introduced. ""It's too busy, but I'm coming before the Christmas holidays to pick up gifts, it seems like a new lockdown is coming,"" Ayman Massori told AFP news agency. For weeks, curfews have been placed on hospitality and cultural venues in the Netherlands in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron. The Dutch National Institute for Public Health has reported more than 2.9m coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, and over 20,000 deaths. It says the Omicron variant currently still accounts for a minority of coronavirus cases in the Netherlands, but is spreading rapidly. Officials say it is expected to become the dominant variant by the New Year. The head of the Dutch outbreak management team, Jaap van Dissel, said the new measures would ""buy time"", allowing more people to get booster shots and for the healthcare system to prepare for a possible rise in infections. ""As a country we are best protected if as many people as possible get a booster vaccination,"" he said. More than 85% of all adults in the Netherlands have been vaccinated, but so far fewer than 9% have had the booster shot. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said all adults would now get an invitation for a booster appointment by 7 January.

"The numbers of people crossing the English Channel has risen sharply this year More than 900 people have crossed the Channel in small boats over two days, the Home Office has confirmed. On Thursday 559 people were picked up off the Kent coast after making the crossing in 19 boats, and on Friday 358 people crossed in 10 boats. Over the two days the French authorities stopped 564 people from setting off. More than 27,700 people have made the crossing in small boats so far this year, compared to 8,400 in 2020.

"This video can not be played ""I can't leave her out there,"" says dog owner Jane Jenkins A woman whose dogs were stolen turned pet detective after spotting one of them for sale almost 200 miles away. Jane Jenkins, from Swansea, believes her labrador and cocker spaniel dogs were stolen for breeding. After combing through online adverts she found her labrador pup, Arthur, but said she's ""broken"" without her other. Research suggests the dog breeding market could be worth nearly half a billion pounds a year. Ms Jenkins said she thinks the thieves who have her cocker spaniel bitch, Bandit, could potentially make tens of thousands from breeding litters and selling them to unsuspecting customers online. The team reuniting lost dogs with their owners Breeders cropping ears to follow social media trend Bandit (left) and Arthur were stolen from Jane Jenkins last January Despite security measures at her licensed kennels, thieves broke in and stole the pair one evening last January. Ms Jenkins and her brother were at home when they noticed a suspicious vehicle approaching. ""It was just like any other evening, we had shut the gates at 17:00,"" she said. But then her brother spotted headlamps coming up the drive on the security camera. Jane Jenkins described her dogs as her life and sees them as part of the family ""And as we were running out, the wheels were spinning on the grass and they were gone."" South Wales Police began an investigation and have been updating her on developments. However, Ms Jenkins who described her dogs as ""her life"", also began her own online search for the microchipped pair. Arthur was found at a home 200 miles away in Merseyside She spent hours every day scouring online ads and making appeals on social media in the hope of finding them. In March, there was a breakthrough when Ms Jenkins received a tip off - texts and photographs of an online advert offering a male labrador puppy for sale in Merseyside. ""I've looked at thousands of black labrador puppies, and that he was the first one that I'd actually thought, yes, that's him,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe he was in Merseyside. And then I slightly panicked on how we were supposed to get him back."" South Wales and Merseyside police discovered it was in fact her pedigree pup, Arthur, and he was returned home. A man, whose home the dog was at was arrested but later released without charge after telling officers he had bought the dog from someone else. Jane describes her cocker spaniel bitch Bandit as ""part of my family"" But almost a year on, Bandit is still missing and Ms Jenkins fears that by now, she may have been forced to have multiple litters by illegal breeders. She described her as having an ""unusual colour"" sable with fawn and the ""sweetest temperament"". ""I don't know which way to go. You think right - I will go to find her, well do you turn left, do you turn right?"" Janes has described struggling after the theft and not having Bandit back home Ms Jenkins said she still feels broken over the theft and has not felt safe in her own home since. ""Bandit is part of my family. I've got no children. So the dogs are what I call my children, my family,"" she added. ""They [the thieves] are not animal lovers. They're purely doing this for money. ""I can't understand how anybody can be cruel to something that's got a beating heart."" Stolen dogs among 59 rescued in south Wales Pet owner's heartbreak as seven pups stolen Jane Jenkins put up hundreds of posters in the hope of finding her dogs Her desperate appeals for Bandit's return have been shared hundreds of thousands of times on social media. ""I'm struggling... I work seven days a week like a robot and look after my elderly ailing mother trying not to show her how heartbroken I really am,"" she wrote. In August, Ms Jenkins thought she may be getting close to finding her after spotting an online advert for a litter of pups in south east England. A bitch with what appeared to be very similar, distinctive markings was photographed with a litter of pups - a short video was also posted by the seller. Bandit is still missing almost one year on from the theft But when Ms Jenkins reported her suspicions to the police, she was subsequently told by officers that the address used by the seller had turned out to be fake. The number of online ads has soared since the start of the pandemic. While there are many licensed and responsible breeders, the online market is beingabused by illegal breeders. Dog owners scared to talk walks as thefts increase What does microchipping your dog involve? Some dog breeds appear to have nearly doubled in value over the past two years Research obtained byBBC Wales Investigatessuggested there was a 71% increase in the number of adverts on two of the most popular pet selling websites. The number of adverts increased from 197,000 ads in 2019 to 337,000 in 2021. Meanwhile, some breeds appear to have nearly doubled in value over the past two years. The total value of dogs advertised - on two popular sites alone - rose from Â£153m on ads placed to Â£486m. On social media, Ms Jenkins continues to make heartfelt appeals and has set up a new Facebook page for information. The hundreds of posters she put up across her home city in the hope of finding Bandit may be fading - but her determination to get her back is not. Allow Facebook content?

"Brexit minister Lord Frost has resigned from the UK government over ""concerns about the current direction of travel"". In a letter to Boris Johnson, the peer, who led Brexit negotiations, said he hoped the PM would ""not be tempted"" by ""coercive measures"" to tackle Covid. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson facedthe largest rebellion of his premiershipfrom Tory MPs over measures to limit the spread of the new Omicron variant. But the UK has seen days of record cases, with 90,418 on Saturday alone. And more than 12,000 confirmed Omicron infections were reported on Sunday. Scientific advisers have also warned England's hospital admissionscould reach 3,000 a day without further restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Lord Frost was an ""outstanding public servant"", telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that while he disagreed with his remarks, the minister had ""resigned out of principle... and we have to respect that"". But Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said the resignation suggested the government was ""in total chaos right when the country faces an uncertain few weeks"". Ministers received a briefing on the latest Covid data on Saturday afternoon and a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee is expected to take place at 17:00 GMT. And Mr Javid warnedthere were ""no guarantees""on whether further restrictions would be brought in. No guarantees on new Covid restrictions - Javid Lord Frost's resignation letter in full Brexit border problem: A simple guide Lord Frost's resignation also comes after amajor by-election defeatfor the Conservatives, losing the formerly safe seat of North Shropshire to the Liberal Democrats. The Mail on Sunday,which first reported the news,external, said he handed in his resignation a week ago, partly in disagreement with Covid curbs. But in his letter to the prime minister, Lord Frost said now the arrangement to exit in January had been made public, he would leave with ""immediate effect"". He wrote that Mr Johnson had been ""an outstanding leader"" during turbulence over Brexit, and the pair had a ""close common understanding"" on their aims in that area. But after saying ""Brexit is now secure"", he added: ""You know my concerns about the current direction of travel. ""I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change."" Lord Frost moved on to his concerns over the government's handling of the virus, saying the country needed to ""learn to live with Covid"". ""I know that is your instinct too,"" he wrote. ""You took a brave decision in July, against considerable opposition, to open up the country again. ""Sadly it did not prove to be irreversible, as I wished, and believe you did too. ""I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere."" In his reply, Mr Johnson did not address the critical elements of the letter, but said the now former minister should be ""immensely proud of your historic service to this government and this country"". Mr Javid told Andrew Marr that Lord Frost was ""entitled to his views,"" but added: ""My own view in terms of the direction of travel, dealing with this pandemic, which is something no-one expected when we won the last general election, but also getting on with the priorities of the British peopleâ¦ this is all a huge part of what the government is getting on with."" He said he did not want ""restrict people's freedoms"" with Covid measures, but added: ""The British people do understand this pandemic requires extraordinary actions and that's what last week was."" Asked if any further measures would be announced after reports of impending circuit breaker lockdowns ahead of Christmas, Mr Javid said: ""There are no guarantees in this pandemic. At this point we have to keep everything under review."" But the health secretary said it ""would be for parliament to decide"" if any additional restrictions came into force. Analysis by Jennifer Scott, BBC political reporter The past few weeks have been torrid for Boris Johnson. From the fallout of the Owen Paterson scandal, to Christmas parties, Tory rebellions and by-election losses, there is no doubt his authority in No 10 has wavered. So the resignation of close ally and Brexit backer Lord Frost cannot have been a welcome early Christmas present. With Omicron cases on the up and fears of what could come next, there are rumours abound that the PM will have to bring in more measures to tackle the variant. But the exit of Lord Frost has also given a certain section of rebellious backbenchers another chance to voice their frustrations with Johnson, and it seems unlikely they would support restrictions, having already rejected Plan B measures in the week. With Health Secretary Sajid Javid saying there are ""no guarantees"" around what moves the government may have to make, Johnson could again be looking to Labour votes to secure any plan he comes up with. But that will be yet another blow to an already-bruised prime minister and increase the volume of those angry MPs in his own party. MPs have had mixed reactions to Lord Frost's exit from government. But some of the 100 rebels who voted against the additional Covid measures that passed through the Commons earlier this week -including the use of Covid passports for some venues- said the resignation should act as a warning to Mr Johnson. On Saturday night, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries was kicked out of a WhatsApp group of Tory MPs - which counts many of the rebels as members - by former Brexit minister Steve Baker, after calling for ""a bit of loyalty"" towards the prime minister. Afterwards, Mr Baker posted: ""Enough is enough."" This video can not be played 'A great loss' - Watch Tory MP Pete Bone describe how Conservative colleagues reacted to Lord Frost's resignation Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said the PM was ""running out of time and out of friends to deliver on the promises and discipline of a true Conservative government"". He added: ""Lord Frost has made it clear, 100 Conservative backbenchers have made it clear, but most importantly so did the people of North Shropshire."" But their Tory colleague Simon Hoare, who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland select committee, said the peer was ""unsuited to the 'doing of politics'"" and ""never understood the need for personal rapport or the importance of trust"". Lord Frost had most recently been engaged in negotiations with the EU over post-Brexit arrangements. This included elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed by the UK and EU in 2019, that allows goods to cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland without checks. The protocolhas been criticised by some businessesfor making it more difficult to send goods to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been a long standing critic of the agreement, said the resignation raised questions about the UK's approach to the protocol. He said Mr Johnson ""must now urgently decide which is more important - the protocol or the stability of the political institutions"". Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, said momentum was needed in negotiations to make the protocol work better. ""The North will not be collateral damage in the Tory chaos,"" she added. It's easy for analysts or journalists to dial-an-EU diplomat following David Frost's resignation as Brexit minister and hear them say something ""not very complimentary"" (if we're being polite). Lord Frost's ""hardball"" manner was not appreciated in Brussels, but it was recognised as a negotiating tactic. However, it would be a mistake to believe his departure will have a massive impact on post-Brexit relations. Mistrust in the UK government will likely remain, long after Lord Frost leaves. Why? Because key EU leaders, like Germany's Angela Merkel (and her successor Olaf Scholz), France's Emmanuel Macron and the Netherlands' Mark Rutte, say they believe successive UK prime ministers - namely David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson - were dishonest with them. The oft-heard Brussels view is that UK governments tried to ""play the EU like fools"" as of setting the Brexit referendum date, with prime ministers speaking to the EU about Brexit in a more collegiate manner, then becoming far more hard-line when addressing the UK domestic audience - in particular, their own Conservative Party. As of now depending on the decisions by Boris Johnson, and the PM that eventually follows him (whenever that may be), rather than Lord Frost's departure, whether cross-Channel relations can improve or deteriorate. This is not about reversing Brexit, or changing a hard Brexit to a soft one. It's more a question of whether or not the two sides can work better together on the Northern Ireland Protocol, wider post-Brexit trade issues, security and defence, and financial services. Brussels is pessimistic, at least in the short-term. But future EU-UK relations are about a lot more than Lord Frost. CHRISTMAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES:What were the festivities like for our ancestors?

"This video can not be played The Ashes: Australia take control of second Test after England collapse Second Ashes Test, Adelaide (day three of five) Australia 473-9-dec & 45-1Harris 21* England 236Malan 80, Root 62; Starc 4-37, Lyon 3-58 Australia lead by 282 Scorecard England's Ashes hopes are in a sorry mess after another dismal batting collapse on day three of the second Test against Australia in Adelaide. Responding to their hosts' 473-9 declared, England fell from 150-2 to 236 all out as a dispiriting tour slumped further. Joe Root and Dawid Malan batted throughout the first session but Root's dismissal, caught at slip off Cameron Green for 62, sparked the loss of four wickets for 19 runs in 36 balls. Malan was also caught at slip for 80 before Ollie Pope and Jos Buttler followed for five and nought respectively in a familiar procession. Ben Stokes hung around for 98 balls for 34 runs and Chris Woakes made a sprightly 24, the only hint of resistance as Mitchell Starc took 4-37 and Nathan Lyon 3-58. Australia, 1-0 up in the series after the first Test, could have enforced the follow-on in the final session but instead opted to bat again. David Warner was run out for 13 as the hosts reached 45-1, already leading by 282 and in complete control of the Test. Latest England batting collapse 'inexcusable', says Agnew TMS podcast: England slump to 'most disappointing day of the series' Reaction to day three in Adelaide This video can not be played The Ashes: Cameron Green removes Joe Root for 62 The only instance of a team coming from 2-0 down to win the Ashes was Australia in 1936-37. England look likely to be facing the same challenge after another miserable day. They collapsed in the first innings of the first Test on a lively, green pitch but on this occasion did so in perfect batting conditions - the skies blue and surface docile. Root and Malan, who also shared a stand of 162 in Brisbane, added 123 without fuss in the first session, scoring more comfortably than the Australians in the previous days, making what followed inexcusable. This video can not be played The Ashes: Jos Buttler caught for nought by David Warner off Mitchell Starc's delivery First the impressive all-rounder Green brought the run-scoring to a halt before he dismissed Root for the second consecutive innings, the England captain poking at a ball he could have left. An England middle-order sapped of confidence tamely and steadily slipped to their demise with the final eight wickets falling for 86 runs. England's total was almost exactly half of Australia's - a further suggestion of the gulf between the sides in a series in which English hope has evaporated after only seven days. Australia could have asked England to face another 70 minutes in perfect, floodlit bowling conditions but, with more than two days remaining, instead opted to pile on more pain with the bat before attempting to bowl the tourists out for a second time. This video can not be played The Ashes: Ollie Pope dismissed for five by Marnus Labuschagne catch England fans have become used to batting subsidence in recent years - Root's side have been bowled out for 112 and 81 in India, 122 against New Zealand and 120 against India at home in 2021 alone. Given the conditions and the fact Australia are without Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, this was up there with the worst. Root fell in the second of six maidens after lunch and, as the tension grew, Malan followed soon after when he tried to cut Starc but flashed an edge to Steve Smith at slip. Pope was once again tormented by spin, as he was in India last winter. He looked erratic in his 19 balls and had to overturn a catch at short leg off Lyon on review two balls before he succumbed to the same duo when rushing down the pitch. Buttler's bleak Test - he dropped two catches on day one - continued as he wafted a drive with minimal foot movement to Starc and edged to slip for a 15-ball duck. Stokes at least showed some fight and summoned memories of his Headingley heroics when he started swinging with the tail. In the end he played onto his stumps trying to smash Green through the off side. This video can not be played Broad dismissed for nine as England all out for 236 Australia had actually been below their best in the first session, run-scoring opportunities provided more regularly than they had been in the previous Test. With Cummins and Hazlewood absent, it was the 22-year-old Green who turned the momentum, bowling with pace and notable bounce from his towering 6ft 5in frame. He was supported by Lyon, who was helped by a change of ends and a hint of turn which will become more relevant when England bat again. With the door now ajar, the previously wayward Starc, the senior seamer alongside Michael Neser and Jhye Richardson, found his range to continue his impressive record with the pink ball. The final wicket of Stuart Broad, caught slashing to cover, is his 50th wicket in nine day-night Tests. Australia's catching was again a class above England's, Smith's sharp grab to see off Malan the highlight. Starc did put down Ollie Robinson at gully, Australia's first drop of the series, but given Robinson still made a duck it was inconsequential. The only Australian blemish was a mix-up with between Marcus Harris and Warner which left the latter stranded late on. Australia will hope Harris - whose series scores to date read three, nine not out and three - can find form on day four against a demoralised England attack. BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""That is the most disappointing day of the series, by a comfortable margin. To collapse as they did, after the way the first session went, made the next two so disappointing."" England batter Dawid Malan:""If we knew why the collapses happened, we would stop them. Hopefully we can put in some performances as a team."" Australia spinner Nathan Lyon to ABC:""It was an outstanding day. England played me pretty well in the first session, but we went back to basics. ""We were leaking both ends, but as soon as we controlled one end, you create opportunities."" Australia bowler Mitchell Starc:""We didn't bowl how we wanted to in that first session, let it slip on the scoreboard and searched for wickets. The way we came out in that second session, Nath [Lyon] and I took it on ourselves a bit being the two experienced ones in the attack.""

"Talks on further support for Scottish businesses are set to take place as firms feel the pinch on what should be their busiest weekend of the year. The UK government is due to hold a Cobra meeting including leaders of the devolved administrations, who want more money for measures to tackle Omicron. The Scottish government has already said bars and restaurants will receive a Â£66m support package. But hospitality bosses say this would not cover even a few days' losses. The sum was a share of a Â£100m package from the Scottish government's budget, which also covered the food and drink supply chain, the cultural sector and the wedding sector. Sunak to hold Omicron crisis talks with businesses Omicron now dominant virus variant in Scotland Music venues warn they will close without bailout Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme he had visited a number of hospitality venues on Friday night, and there was a noticeable drop in footfall. He said: ""It was a bit unreal, it was quieter than what we'd expect for what would traditionally have been 'black Friday' - which we're calling 'bleak Friday'. ""This is the time of year when we would normally take 30-35% of our annual turnover to see us through January-February time and the last reports we've had in since the Public Health Scotland message came out on Thursday of last week, we're probably seeing a big impound of turnover lost in Scotland through this."" On the Â£100m funding from the Scottish government, Mr Montgomery said the hospitality industry's share was ""a lot short"" as they had expected an 80:20 split. He said: ""It wouldn't even cover one or two days of loss of turnover for some people, it certainly wouldn't cover the wages for one week. ""We'll take it, of course we will, but there has got to be some ongoing talks between the UK and Scottish governments - put all political differences aside and get this sorted out."" The Scottish government has made repeated calls for more money from the UK government - a phone call involving Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson took place on Friday. Earlier this week the Treasury announced Â£220m of immediate funding, but Scottish ministers say this had been brought forward from next year and had already been budgeted for. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes told the BBC that ""tentative"" conversations were being held with the Treasury and she was making the case for funds ""on every front"". Kate Forbes delivered the Scottish budget earlier this month before Â£100m was allocated to support businesses hit by the pandemic Ms Forbes said she has quoted Â£500m in the Scottish government's request, a figure based on the monthly costs of furlough and grants. She said: ""The UK government can make the substantial funds available almost over night because they access borrowing from the market and ultimately we need the UK government to deliver on the requests made by the Welsh and Scottish governments. ""Ultimately this is about helping businesses right now that are struggling, but also knowing that when we need more support - because none of us can absolutely for definite know how this variant is going to play out - we know that we can access additional support for businesses."" On Friday, the UK government's ChancellorRishi Sunak met business leadersfor crisis talks, as firms warned of lost bookings. Mr Sunak has said that it is ""a difficult time for the hospitality industry"" but there were existing support measures in place to help the industry. Dr Christine Tait-Burkhard - an expert in infection and immunity at Edinburgh University - told the BBC that Omicron could be slowed down but not stopped. She pointed to advice from the UK government's scientific advisory group, Sage, which said if we want to stop the spread we shouldgo back to limiting indoor hospitality and indoor meetings. She said nightclubs and other large events could be shut down after Christmas to slow the spread. Nightclubs were closed in Scotland for 16 months at the start of the pandemic andreopened in August. Dr Tait-Burkhard said: ""What we've seen with Omicron is it's very good at spreading in close-contact, large settingsâ¦ that means certain businesses such as nightclubs are indeed a really good place where the virus can spread easily. ""We have seen Wales closing down nightclubs after Christmas. It is a good potential that that might happen in Scotland as well alongside large events."" Live music venues have already warned theyrisk permanent closureif no bailout is forthcoming. On Saturday, 5,917 new cases of Covid were reported - accounting for 12.2% of PCR tests - however, Public Health Scotland said results were being reported more slowly due to the high volume of tests being taken, meaning the true number of Covid cases was likely to be higher. Nicola Sturgeon warned on Friday that Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. New guidance for shops, hospitality venues and other businesses wasintroduced on Friday, in a bid to stem the transmission of Covid. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said there were ""early and worrying indications to suggest shopper footfall has plunged even further in Scotland's city centre locations over recent days"" following the first minister's advice for the public to stay at home as much as possible. He said it was a ""crucial"" trading time for shops, and that if the further downturn persisted then the government should be prepared to support the retail sector with further financial aid. ""The sector provides 230,000 jobs directly in Scotland and is vital to the health of our high streets and city centres,"" he added. On Saturday, Braehead shopping centre in Renfrewshire said the malls had been ""busy"", with ""a stream of socially-distanced shoppers"" taking advantage of the last weekend to shop before Christmas.

"Restrictions on gyms will bring back social distancing from 27 December Worried gym owners fear new Covid restrictions could mean they lose their homes. One said they thought they would already be homeless, had they not taken on full-time work as a hospital physiotherapist. Another said they feared losing everything next year if the situation did not improve. The Welsh government said the measures were designed to stop the spread of the virus and protect people's health. Gyms and other businesses will have to reintroduce social distancing, along with other measures including one-way systems from 27 December. Mark Drakeford 'storm' warning prompts nightclub closures Q&A: What are the new Covid rules for Wales? Welsh festive sport verdict on Monday The rules are part ofmeasures being brought in by the Welsh governmentto slow the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus which is spreading rapidly across the UK. James Kempton said he had until about March to break even James Kempton, manager of Energie Fitness in St Mellons, Cardiff, said: ""It's a matter of time now. I have until about March to break even before I run out of money. ""I will probably end up homeless and owing so much money to Lloyds Bank and Hitachi Capital, that even if I pick myself up they will come after me."" The 39-year-old said the new rules were already affecting him. ""As soon as they utter these things it hits my pocket,"" Mr Kempton explained. ""Sales this month and last month are much lower than normal."" Jin Bowring returned to full-time work to make ends meet. Jin Bowring (left), who runs a gym with husband Matthew, returned to full-time work to make ends meet The 39-year-old works as a physiotherapist at Llandough Hospital while running evening ""JinFit"" classes at the Penarth gym she runs with husband Matthew. The mum-of-twins said: ""It's quite a small boutique studio. With social distancing I can only get six or seven people in there, including myself. ""I went to online classes through the pandemic but it has been a nightmare. ""Small businesses are not going to survive."" January is traditionally boom-time for gyms as customers sign up to get rid of the pounds they put on celebrating over Christmas. Smaller businesses need these customers to get them through the quieter parts of the year. People working out longer and later at night Schools to open later than planned after Christmas Nightclubs and restaurants fear New Year losses ""If it was my full-time job I would be struggling to make payments on my house and bills,"" Ms Bowring said. ""I would probably be homeless if I was not able to go back to work. Financially it's not doing great, it would be a struggle. ""I'm just very lucky I had a job to fall back on."" Francesca Ray says it is a matter of making ""the best of a bad situation"" Personal trainer Francesca Ray normally trains clients at Simply Gym, in Llansamlet, Swansea. Business is not the same as it was pre-pandemic, she said, but was ""better than nothing"". ""Being self-employed there is that uncertainty hanging over your head,"" she said, but added it was a matter of making ""the best of a bad situation"". Ms Ray is not planning on getting a different job. ""I'm passionate about the job and the clients, so it's not something I would easily give up. I would never give up on my clients,"" she explained. ""We have got to ride the storm. Lets hope it is a smaller storm than before."" Anna Prince is ""going to go on for as long as I can"" At Hydrofitness Ladies Gym in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, owner Anna Prince said she was living ""month-to-month"". She took out a Bounce Back Loan - a UK government-backed loan scheme to help small businesses stay afloat during Covid - but this was dwindling ""rapidly"", Ms Price said. ""I'm going to go on for as long as I can,"" she said. ""I just hope and pray that they don't close us again. ""Unless they give us financial support, we will not be able to reopen."" Gym boss Wendy Morris says she felt ""lucky"" as she could cope with social distancing Wendy Morris, manager of Energie Fitness in Bridgend, said she felt lucky her gym was quite large at 8,000 sq ft. It is able to cope with social distancing better than many smaller gyms, but has lost 300 members since the start of the pandemic. ""It's extremely stressful. I was relieved on a personal level because two metres is something I can accommodate,"" she said. ""I'm lucky. But I have friends who are not so lucky."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""The omicron variant is a worrying development in the ongoing pandemic. The speed it spreads and its potential to infect large numbers of people is a serious concern. ""Additional measures being brought in from 27 December are there to help stop the spread of the virus and to protect the health of the public. ""Financial support of up to Â£60m will be available to businesses materially affected by these new restrictions. We are working intensively with partners on how that support can most effectively be delivered, and further details will follow as soon as possible."" What are the latest Covid rules for Wales?

"This video can not be played The Ashes: Australia take control of second Test after England collapse Second Ashes Test, Adelaide (day three of five) Australia 473-9-dec & 45-1Harris 21* England 236Malan 80, Root 62; Starc 4-37, Lyon 3-58 Australia lead by 282 Scorecard England's Ashes hopes are in a sorry mess after another dismal batting collapse on day three of the second Test against Australia in Adelaide. Responding to their hosts' 473-9 declared, England fell from 150-2 to 236 all out as a dispiriting tour slumped further. Joe Root and Dawid Malan batted throughout the first session but Root's dismissal, caught at slip off Cameron Green for 62, sparked the loss of four wickets for 19 runs in 36 balls. Malan was also caught at slip for 80 before Ollie Pope and Jos Buttler followed for five and nought respectively in a familiar procession. Ben Stokes hung around for 98 balls for 34 runs and Chris Woakes made a sprightly 24, the only hint of resistance as Mitchell Starc took 4-37 and Nathan Lyon 3-58. Australia, 1-0 up in the series after the first Test, could have enforced the follow-on in the final session but instead opted to bat again. David Warner was run out for 13 as the hosts reached 45-1, already leading by 282 and in complete control of the Test. Latest England batting collapse 'inexcusable', says Agnew TMS podcast: England slump to 'most disappointing day of the series' Reaction to day three in Adelaide This video can not be played The Ashes: Cameron Green removes Joe Root for 62 The only instance of a team coming from 2-0 down to win the Ashes was Australia in 1936-37. England look likely to be facing the same challenge after another miserable day. They collapsed in the first innings of the first Test on a lively, green pitch but on this occasion did so in perfect batting conditions - the skies blue and surface docile. Root and Malan, who also shared a stand of 162 in Brisbane, added 123 without fuss in the first session, scoring more comfortably than the Australians in the previous days, making what followed inexcusable. This video can not be played The Ashes: Jos Buttler caught for nought by David Warner off Mitchell Starc's delivery First the impressive all-rounder Green brought the run-scoring to a halt before he dismissed Root for the second consecutive innings, the England captain poking at a ball he could have left. An England middle-order sapped of confidence tamely and steadily slipped to their demise with the final eight wickets falling for 86 runs. England's total was almost exactly half of Australia's - a further suggestion of the gulf between the sides in a series in which English hope has evaporated after only seven days. Australia could have asked England to face another 70 minutes in perfect, floodlit bowling conditions but, with more than two days remaining, instead opted to pile on more pain with the bat before attempting to bowl the tourists out for a second time. This video can not be played The Ashes: Ollie Pope dismissed for five by Marnus Labuschagne catch England fans have become used to batting subsidence in recent years - Root's side have been bowled out for 112 and 81 in India, 122 against New Zealand and 120 against India at home in 2021 alone. Given the conditions and the fact Australia are without Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, this was up there with the worst. Root fell in the second of six maidens after lunch and, as the tension grew, Malan followed soon after when he tried to cut Starc but flashed an edge to Steve Smith at slip. Pope was once again tormented by spin, as he was in India last winter. He looked erratic in his 19 balls and had to overturn a catch at short leg off Lyon on review two balls before he succumbed to the same duo when rushing down the pitch. Buttler's bleak Test - he dropped two catches on day one - continued as he wafted a drive with minimal foot movement to Starc and edged to slip for a 15-ball duck. Stokes at least showed some fight and summoned memories of his Headingley heroics when he started swinging with the tail. In the end he played onto his stumps trying to smash Green through the off side. This video can not be played Broad dismissed for nine as England all out for 236 Australia had actually been below their best in the first session, run-scoring opportunities provided more regularly than they had been in the previous Test. With Cummins and Hazlewood absent, it was the 22-year-old Green who turned the momentum, bowling with pace and notable bounce from his towering 6ft 5in frame. He was supported by Lyon, who was helped by a change of ends and a hint of turn which will become more relevant when England bat again. With the door now ajar, the previously wayward Starc, the senior seamer alongside Michael Neser and Jhye Richardson, found his range to continue his impressive record with the pink ball. The final wicket of Stuart Broad, caught slashing to cover, is his 50th wicket in nine day-night Tests. Australia's catching was again a class above England's, Smith's sharp grab to see off Malan the highlight. Starc did put down Ollie Robinson at gully, Australia's first drop of the series, but given Robinson still made a duck it was inconsequential. The only Australian blemish was a mix-up with between Marcus Harris and Warner which left the latter stranded late on. Australia will hope Harris - whose series scores to date read three, nine not out and three - can find form on day four against a demoralised England attack. BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""That is the most disappointing day of the series, by a comfortable margin. To collapse as they did, after the way the first session went, made the next two so disappointing."" England batter Dawid Malan:""If we knew why the collapses happened, we would stop them. Hopefully we can put in some performances as a team."" Australia spinner Nathan Lyon to ABC:""It was an outstanding day. England played me pretty well in the first session, but we went back to basics. ""We were leaking both ends, but as soon as we controlled one end, you create opportunities."" Australia bowler Mitchell Starc:""We didn't bowl how we wanted to in that first session, let it slip on the scoreboard and searched for wickets. The way we came out in that second session, Nath [Lyon] and I took it on ourselves a bit being the two experienced ones in the attack.""
