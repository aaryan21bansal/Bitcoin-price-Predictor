" Warning: This article contains details that some people will find very distressing. Jack was the older of the two. He was 12 and he was a musician. “Music ran through his veins like water runs down a stream.” He was a talented trumpet player. His music teachers thought he might go all the way. He dreamed of studying music at university. A lovely, quiet, gentle boy. Paul was cheeky and full of confidence. A good sportsman - a runner,  a sprinter. “I think he ran before he could walk.” Jackwas. Paulwas. Both are now dead. On Wednesday 22 October 2014 the boys were murdered by their father. Claire Throssell’s flat is full of photos and other reminders of her two sons. She will never forget the last time she saw them. Since then she has been fighting. Both to remember them but also to try to prevent a tragedy like this happening again. Claire had lived all of her life in a small market town in South Yorkshire. She met her husband Darren at a work function one evening and the relationship moved quickly. His attentive behaviour seemed to be just part of the intensity of a young relationship. There were regular flowers and phone calls. They married and children followed. The family were living in a house by a viaduct, a river and a park. But Claire began to realise something was wrong. Her husband was too “caring”. He was too interested in what she was up to. His behaviour was too intense. There started to be  something slightly sinister in his character. Claire now knows this wascoercive and controlling behaviour. It’s against the law in England and Wales, and Scotland moved to legislate this year. A law has been drafted in Northern Ireland but is yet to go through. Professionals are trained to look out for manipulative and controlling actions. It’s when a person, typically a partner, repeatedly behaves in a way which makes someone feel dependent, isolated or scared. Claire’s husband completely controlled her life. Repeated phone calls while she was at the supermarket, insults about how she looked, calling her stupid, distancing her from her friends and family, controlling the finances. “It had got to a point where I couldn't even look in the mirror and recognise the person that was looking back at me.  My self-confidence had gone.” The boys were becoming more and more cautious around their father. He imposed heavy discipline. With Paul, the younger, his father became bullying over his food - he was made to eat things he didn’t want to. One time he was forced into a chair to eat. The boys regularly saw their father insulting and shouting at their mother. “Jack in particular would say, 'Stop threatening my mum'.” It was April 2014 and after many years of this difficult life, Claire decided she was leaving for good. “The whole process was made even harder by the fact that he was very controlling and aggressive, and things deteriorated very quickly between us.” Her husband stayed in the marital home, while Claire and the boys moved into her mother’s house. Initially Claire and her husband agreed on shared custody, but her husband’s controlling and aggressive behaviour was escalating. He had a track record, having once been cautioned for assaulting a neighbour. The police were aware that there could be trouble. They put a high priority tag on Claire’s phone and her mother’s address - in the event of an emergency call, they would send an immediate response car. But Claire worried every time her boys went to see their father. In June, Paul became very upset at school. He told his teachers that his dad had hurt him in the past - dragging him along by the throat. This was the final straw. Claire applied for an emergency residency order to stop the shared custody of the boys. As well as Paul’s complaint, Claire’s submission included two remarks her husband had made to her - that “he had nothing to live for and intended to commit suicide” and that “he can understand fathers killing their children”. A court hearing concluded with an interim arrangement for much more limited access to the boys for Claire’s husband. Although he had agreed to this, along with Claire, this angered him further. Things really got out of control, because he'd lost control.” He took Claire’s belongings from the family home and threw them into the front garden of her mother’s house. Abusive texts and messages followed in a torrent. After he threatened to kill himself, Claire called the police. Even then he was trying to control Claire. He told the police that he would only talk to them if she came to the house as well. Claire always had a feeling that her estranged husband was capable of hurting the boys. She still questions whether she could have done more to prevent the contact visits they had with their father. “Things really got out of control, because he'd lost control.” The boys were allowed to see their father for five hours each week on Sunday afternoons and Wednesday after school, from August 2014. This was unsupervised. But Claire knew the boys didn’t want to spend any time with their father. By the middle of October 2014, the divorce had come through. Cafcass - the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service - was involved. Claire had warned the service that her estranged husband was often volatile and aggressive, especially when he was told things he didn’t want to hear. There had already been two hearings. The final one was set for 17 November 2014. A “Section 7” was requested. This report was to include the wishes and feelings of Jack and Paul so the judge could help make the decision about the boys’ contact with their father. It was expected to be ready two weeks before the November hearing. That hearing never happened. The morning of Wednesday 22 October 2014 started off the same as any other morning.  Claire went to drop Jack off at his grammar school.  She said “I love you”, as she always did. He called back, as he always did, with Buzz Lightyear’s line from Toy Story, “To infinity and beyond”. Jack always looked back once. But Claire remembers on that morning he turned and looked back a second time before walking into school. Claire dropped Paul off at his school. He had the exact same ritual as his brother. When she said “I love you”, he said, “To infinity and beyond”. She went to work. The boys were due to see their father after school. He had put a train track in the attic in the old family home. He had texted that morning saying he had two new trains for them, and all he needed was two drivers. Just before 5pm, Claire says she got a call from an officer at Cafcass. The officer later said the call was routine, but Claire gives a slightly different account of it. The boy’s father had come into Cafcass on Monday that week, two days before, and it hadn’t gone well. The Cafcass officer wanted to know - Claire recalls - if the visit between the boys and their father was going ahead. Claire said they were already there. The Cafcass officer suggested Claire keep an eye on them when they returned from the visit. It took 15 minutes for my life to end... and my existence to begin” When she got home from work, Claire felt deeply uneasy. There was a knock at the door. Claire’s mother said it would be the boys, back early. But the boys would never have knocked. They used to rush straight in. Claire found a policeman at the front door. “There's been an incident at the house.” She said: “He's done it hasn't he? He's done something to them.” The officer wouldn’t say more but the look on his face was enough. “I knew, I knew. “It took 15 minutes for my life to end... and my existence to begin” Jack and Paul had gone up into the attic to play with their new trains. Their father had blocked the front and back doors before setting fires all around the home. He joined them up in the loft, closing the hatch and trapping them. The first firefighter found Jack on the landing and picked him up. But he was already badly burned. He had tried to escape and get help for his brother. Despite his condition, he went on to reveal what had happened. “My dad did this and he did it on purpose.” He and his brother were rushed to Sheffield Children’s Hospital - Jack had 56% burns and Paul was unconscious. Their father was taken to another hospital in the city, where he died. A police car sped Claire to the hospital to see her children. “I went into a room and the consultant was drenched in sweat. “There was Paul and they were doing CPR on him. I knew pretty much that there was no hope.” The doctor stopped the CPR and Claire held Paul in her arms.  “My tears were in his hair. And his hair was damp. His eyes closed and it was just as if nothing... was looking back. “I promised him that no other parent would have to do what I did... and hold a child in their arms whilst they died, knowing it's at the hands of somebody who should love and protect them.” Jack was transferred to the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital for specialist burns treatment. Claire stayed by his bedside for the next five days. She finally said goodbye on 27 October. That was the day that Jack had been due to give his views about his father for the Section 7 report. He never got the chance to be heard. Only a very small proportion of abusive spouses go on to commit murder. Each time though, questions are asked as to whether the authorities could have done more. There are serious case reviews. Claire feels that Cafcass let down her children. Claire learned from the police that the boys’ father had blocked the family liaison officer in her office on Monday 20 October - two days before the fire. Claire says that if only she’d been told promptly about that, she would never have allowed her sons to see their father later in the same week. Cafcass does acknowledge the meeting had to be stopped but doesn’t believe there was any indication that the boys' father might cause immediate harm to them. “Cafcass accepted the findings of the coroner and the serious case review, who agreed that the children died due to unlawful killing and that no public authority could have predicted or prevented the tragedy,” a spokesman says. “However, we do regret that some aspects of our work with Ms Throssell’s family did not meet the high standards we set for our staff.” Cafcass says it has now improved the way it assesses risk. “We continuously develop our practice and this year launched a Domestic Abuse Practice Pathway, which provides our staff with a clear, robust framework to assess cases involving domestic abuse.” Theserious case reviewinto Jack and Paul’s deaths at the hands of their father said: “The vast majority of estranged fathers would not consider such actions and... there is no known way of identifying those who will do so.” But while it is only a small minority who murder, there is a great deal of other harm that is done. Could more be done to put the interests of the children at the heart of how we deal with abusive relationships? Claire now spends her time campaigning and working with the charity Women’s Aid to highlight the effects that domestic violence and coercive behaviour have on children. The charity points to statistics that are sobering. Women’s Aid want the authorities to understand domestic abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour. The group says that a joined-up response, early intervention and support are essential. Claire says that when children witness domestic abuse, it ends up “going into their whole being”. Jane (not her real name) knows exactly what Claire is talking about.  Jane has taken her children and left her controlling and physically abusive partner. She put up with nearly five years of terror. She knew this would affect the rest of her children’s lives. One night she fled with them in a taxi. Jane had been trapped in a life of control. The curtains had to remain shut, family days out didn’t exist. She was told what to wear, she was told who to speak to, and she was made to lie to social workers. She was not allowed to show affection to her children. Jane was left on her own, to care for her children as well as those from his extended family, while regularly being insulted. “Yeah I've had black eyes. Like he never outright punched me in the eye. But I've had elbows and knees… or my head would be bashed off something or stuff might be thrown at me. All of this happened while the kids were there.” As Jane recounts the desperate times, tears pour down her face. “You'd be in the middle of having this fight and you'd be looking at your kids, and you could just see the fear. You can't get out of the situation. I hated the fact that they were so confused by it.” Life was never normal. If the children ever expressed interest in a game or an activity, they were always made to feel it was wrong. They were never allowed to make a mistake. Jane’s case isn’t rare. Dame Vera Baird QC, Police and Crime Commissioner for the Northumbria police force area, has long campaigned about domestic abuse. She has been introducing changes. Northumbria Police was the first to carry out force-wide training on how to spot coercive and controlling behaviour. Dame Vera Baird, QC, Police and Crime Commissioner for the Northumbria police force area Now Dame Vera wants to focus on the court system and give more protection and understanding to victims. She believes there is a problem when access arrangements are being made for families where domestic abuse is prevalent. “The perpetrator can pursue them right or wrong through the family court and actually use that court really to carry out abuse and  continue the abuse.” The Ministry of Justice has accepted the law must change. “We will legislate to give family courts the power to stop abusers from cross-examining their victims in family proceedings,” a spokesman says. “And we are investing more than £1bn to modernise our courts system, to make it more sensitive and accessible to victims and witnesses.” Of course, there are those who think it's easy to go too far in criticising the family court system, and who point out their duty to try to make sure children have their parents in their lives. “Obviously there are tragic cases that have been dealt with by the Family Court and one death is too many,” says Chris Fairhurst, a family law specialist at Slater and Gordon, “but if you look at the private law cases alone that Cafcass is dealing with, it is in excess of 40,000 a year and generally the balance appears right, although there's always room for improvement. “The beauty of our family law system is that it is largely discretionary and flexible, treating people as human beings, taking account of their faults. By all means you should have guidance on these types of issues, but once you start tying the hands of judges too much, you can enter dangerous territory.” It’s the effect on the children that still haunts Jane. One of the boys has become very quiet and withdrawn while another struggles to control his anger. With the help of family and a local charity, Jane is rebuilding her life in a different part of the country. The children are settled in school, and she has a light, airy, clean, welcoming house for them all to come home to. Jane is now getting ready for Christmas. She is determined to make special memories for the rest of their childhood. In Northumbria Police’s control room, domestic abuse calls are prioritised. “It’s come in as a domestic, with reports of someone having been stabbed with a screwdriver.” “Has she got any children at the address do you know?” For any ongoing domestic violence call, a response car goes with blue lights and sirens. The caller is kept on the line. Mark has just had a caller hang up. “I rang it back and spoke to the caller. She said that her ex-partner had threatened to beat her and her 12-year-old child up.” He assures her someone is on the way immediately. The following week, PC Jason Parkin and PC Michael Paul are on a late shift in Sunderland the night we join them. A member of the public has rung in, after seeing a woman being treated violently in the street: “There’s a male who’s got tight hold of a female’s arm and has hit her on the back, she was quite distressed and shouted ‘get off me’.” The team switch on their blue lights and they’re off. If children are involved in a domestic violence call, it is flagged on the police computer system. Every morning a special team at Northumbria Police HQ scans a log of calls, ready to pass information on to schools. Steve Dixon, leader of the Protecting Vulnerable People team, recounts a typical case. “Mam has been assaulted by dad, a child has been present during this incident. The child is 11 years old. Mam has been taken to hospital and dad has been arrested at the scene by police.” When that 11-year old comes into school, there will be someone to greet them who will understand what’s happened to them. It’s all down to Operation Encompass. It began in a Devon primary school when head teacher Elisabeth Carney-Haworth noticed a dramatic behavioural change in one of the children. ‘’We didn’t know why. The child couldn’t tell us. We spoke to the child’s mother and she couldn’t tell us either. ‘’ The little boy had been exposed to domestic violence at home. But it took months for Elisabeth to find that out. She was furious that she had not been told earlier, so that the school could have acted faster to help. Operation Encompass's website She knows how devastating domestic abuse can be to children. “MRI scans showthat the bits of their brains that ‘fire up’ are exactly the same as in soldiers exposed to combat with PTSD.” When she told her police sergeant husband, David, of her frustration, he agreed that things had to change.Operation Encompasswas born with the start of a line of communication between the police and seven schools in Devon. For each school, the police are in direct contact with a trained “key adult” - usually the head teacher. Whenever a child is caught up in an incident of domestic abuse the school is told immediately. Elisabeth says: “The first thing we will do is greet that child with a smile. If they’ve not got school uniform on, we can find school uniform. We can check that they’ve had breakfast and that they are all right. “They need school to be a safe, secure, nurturing environment.” Now Operation Encompass has been taken up by more than 22 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. The ambition is to eventually cover the entire UK. Things are changing. In September, new guidance was published for judges and magistrates in child contact cases where domestic abuse has been alleged. Sir James Munby, the president of the Family Division of the High Court for England and Wales,made several changes. Wording now sets out what judges and magistrates are “required” to do rather than what they “should” do in cases where there is domestic abuse. It's now mandatory for the courts to determine whether children and non-abusive parents will be at risk of harm from a contact order. The definitions of domestic abuse, coercive control  and the harms caused to children have been clarified. Judges must carefully consider how domestic abuse affects children, and question whether the “presumption of contact” applies. These all change how the courts and other authorities weigh up risk when it comes to allowing allegedly abusive partners access to their children. But for campaigners like Claire there is still more that needs to be done. We met Melissa in the early hours of a Saturday morning. She was sitting in her sparsely furnished flat in the north-east of England. There had been a fire in the stairwell recently and the blackened peeling paint covered the wall. She was curled up on the sofa. She hadn’t eaten all day. He’s taken everything away from me. I’m in so much pain. It’s ruined my life basically.” We had arrived with the domestic abuse response car - police officer PC Michael Urwin and Gemma Ridley from Wearside Women in Need, who has years of experience supporting women like Melissa. PC Michael Urwin and Gemma Ridley Melissa had been in an abusive relationship for nearly five years. When we spoke to her, the tears came as she thought of the baby taken away by social services. Melissa says she was essentially forced to chose between her abusive partner and her newborn baby. “He’s taken everything away from me. I’m in so much pain. It’s ruined my life basically.” The abusive relationship meant that social services couldn’t let Melissa keep her baby son. “He wasn't bothered. He wanted me more than anything. He controlled us really badly.” Melissa is trying to turn her life around. She has Wearside Women in Need for support and she has a job now, for the first time in a long time. She now realises the cost of the years of her ex-partner’s controlling behaviour and she wants change. Her battle is to rebuild her life. For Claire, there is a wider battle - to change attitudes in courts and council offices and police stations. She will continue to fight. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.026794361
"Boris Johnson will urge Iran to free British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe from jail when he visits Tehran. The foreign secretary is expected to travel to Iran in the next few days. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been in prison since April 2016 after being accused of spying. She denies the claim. Supporters of the 38-year-old from London say that she recently had a health assessment to see if she was fit enough to remain in prison. Mr Johnson's Tehran trip will see him raising the cases of other dual nationals being held in Iran. He will also discuss British concerns over Iranian involvement in conflicts in the Middle East, especially in Syria and Yemen. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle Johnson 'sorry' over jailed mother remarks Medical concern for Briton held in Iran In November Mr Johnson apologised in the Commons after telling a committee of MPs that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Iran. He retracted ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Critics complained that the foreign secretary's initial comments could lead to her five-year jail term being increased. Mr Johnson met her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, in November to discuss calls for her to beprovided with diplomatic protection. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella when she was arrested Mr Ratcliffe told BBC News his wife was due back in court on Sunday to face possible new charges and it was important Mr Johnson would be in Iran around the same time to ""make clear that he thinks Nazanin is innocent and should be home with her family"". He said: ""I don't know if I'm expecting him to be able to unlock it all, and she comes out with him, but it can only be a good thing that he is there"". Mr Ratcliffe said he had wanted to accompany Mr Johnson but the Foreign Office felt his presence would be ""too political"". By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent When Boris Johnson arrives in Tehran this weekend, the foreign secretary will be required to perform some nifty diplomatic footwork even before he comes to address the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. For relations between Britain and the Islamic Republic of Iran are delicate at the best of times. It is only six years since a mob stormed and sacked Britain's embassy in Tehran. And to some in Iran, Britain will always be seen as the ""Little Satan"", a former imperial power that meddles in their country's affairs at America's bidding. Both the UK and Iran have now restored diplomatic relations. But good relations are a work in progress. So this visit, Mr Johnson's first, is designed above all to stabilise what has at times been a difficult relationship, a trip that was planned long before the case of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe became a frontline political issue. Read more of James Landale's analysis here. The mother had been visiting Iran with her daughter Gabriella when she was arrested last year. The child has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran for the last 20 months. Mr Ratcliffe has not seen his daughter during his wife's incarceration. There were concerns about Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's health after lumps in her breasts were discovered butthose were found to be non-cancerous. Richard Ratcliffe and Boris Johnson met at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in November In November Mr Ratcliffe said: ""She talks about being on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I absolutely believe that's true. ""I think it's important I don't exaggerate anything in the media and I'm not melodramatic, but she is in a difficult place.""

"This video can not be played The Israeli army fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live rounds as Palestinian protesters burned tyres and threw stones At least 31 Palestinians have been wounded in clashes in the Gaza Strip and across the occupied West Bank, during protests against US President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. One person is in a critical condition. Mr Trump's announcement - met with worldwide dismay - reversed decades of US policy on the sensitive issue. Israel deployed hundreds of extra troops in the West Bank as Palestinians went on strike and took to the streets. Protesters set tyres alight and threw stones, and Israeli troops fired tear gas, rubber bullets and live bullets. One rocket fired from the Gaza Strip exploded inside southern Israel while others fell short, Israel's army said. In response,an Israeli tank and an aircraft targeted ""two terror posts"",externalin Gaza, the army said without giving further details. This Palestinian man and Israeli soldier were photographed outside Damascus Gate in Jerusalem Many of Washington's closest allies have said they disagree with the move, and both the UN Security Council and the Arab League will meet in the coming days to decide their response. There are fears the announcement could lead to a renewed outbreak of violence. The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas has already called for a new intifada, or uprising. Mr Trump announced the move on Wednesday,external. The US president said: ""I've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians."" He said he was directing the US state department to begin preparations to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace Despite warnings of regional unrest over any such move, the decision fulfils a campaign promise and appeals to Mr Trump's right-wing base. Recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital was ""nothing more or less than a recognition of reality"", he added. ""It is also the right thing to do."" Trump's speech in full Media reacts to 'slap of the century' Five key takeaways from speech How are capital cities chosen? Mr Trump said the US would support a two-state solution - shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel - ""if agreed to by both sides"". The president also refrained from using Israel's description of Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided capital"". The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of any future Palestinian state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was profoundly grateful to Mr Trump, who had ""bound himself forever with the history of the capital"". He also said Israel was ""in touch with other countries to follow suit"". He did not name any of these countries, although the Philippines and the Czech Republic have been mentioned in Israeli media. The White House said it was not aware of any countries planning to follow Mr Trump's lead. The mood has been very different on the Palestinian side. The leader of Hamas, which dominates the Gaza Strip, has called for a ""day of rage"" on Friday and said it should ""be the first day of the intifada against the occupier"". Hamas members would be ""fully ready"" to ""confront this strategic danger"", Ismail Haniya said in a speech in Gaza. This video can not be played Hamas leader Ismail Haniya said the announcement was a ""declaration of war"" Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's rival Fatah movement is seeking to protest through diplomatic means, by filing a complaint to the UN Security Council and pushing for a strong stance by the Arab League. ""We are going to declare the United States disqualified as co-sponsor of any peace process or political process,"" spokesman Dr Nasser Al-Kidwa said. ""In our mind, it has lost its ability to do or perform any efforts in this regard."" Which countries condemned Trump's move? There has also been widespread condemnation across the Arab and wider Muslim world, with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warning Mr Trump that he was ""throwing the region into a ring of fire"". The leaders of the UK, France and Germany have all said they disagree with the US announcement. Jerusalem is of huge importance to both Israel and the Palestinians. It contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. What are the alternatives to a two-state solution? Why settlement issue is so difficult East Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, was annexed by Israel after the Six Day War of 1967, but before now it has not been internationally recognised as part of Israel. According to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks.

"Disagreements remain over how the Irish border should be treated after Brexit Brexit negotiations are continuing into the night in a fresh push to reach agreement over the Irish border. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg has been told there are ""serious ideas"" on the table that the different parties are broadly content with.

What happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been among the key sticking points in Brexit negotiations. On Monday, the DUP - whose support the UK prime minister needs to win key votes in Westminster - objected to draft plans drawn up by the UK and the EU. They included aligning regulations in Northern Ireland with those in the Republic so as to avoid border checks. This video can not be played ""However many times you phrase it, we're not going to be making any comment"" The DUP insists it will not accept any agreement in which Northern Ireland was treated differently from the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland, on the other hand, which is an EU member, wants a guarantee that there will be no hard border between it and Northern Ireland after Brexit. The UK, which is due to leave the EU in March 2019, wants to open talks on a new free trade deal as soon as possible. The EU will only agree to discuss this when it judges that enough progress has been made on the ""separation issues"" - the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border - that have been the subject of negotiations so far.

"Headlines in Arab and Turkish newspapers are crowded with strident criticism and expressions of dismay in response to President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Those in the Israeli press welcome the move, saying it should never have taken decades to happen. ""Thank you Mr President for this brave and historic decision. Thank you for applying your famous common sense to such a critical declaration on such a crucial issue,"" says one commentator in the Israeli newspaper, Yisrael Hayom.Â Â Another, in Maariv, says Trump ""broke the fear barrier"". ""It is time to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,â says Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth ""Trump is right: The world's refusal of 70 years to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has been a stupid mistake,"" says a commentator in Yedioth Ahronoth. ""The claim that the speech harms the peace process is untenable, because there is no peace process."" The paper printed the full text of Mr Trump's speech, dubbing it ""The Jerusalem Declaration"" - echoing the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which expressed the British government's support for a Jewish national home in Palestine and paved the way for Israel's creation. ""Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and in the same breath watered down the American commitment to the two-state solution,"" says an editorial in theÂ broadsheet Haaretz.Â ""It is clear that America will not 'rescue Israel from itself' and will not bring about the end of the occupation."" The view from the Palestinian territories is rather different. A headline in the Palestinian Authority-owned newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadidah calls the US move the ""slap of the century"". Palestinian Al-Hayat al-Jadidah featured the announcement prominently on its front cover AnÂ editorial in the paper warns that ""the gates of hell will be opened in the region"",Â echoing a statement made by the Islamist group Hamas. There are also calls for effective and measured responses. ""Why should we not launch a calm intifada (uprising) and return to long-lasting negotiations?"" asks one commentator in the pro-Fatah Al-Ayyam newspaper. ""It would be better for us to wager on our political achievements and not on a third intifada."" A commentator in the pro-Hamas biweekly Al-Risalah echoes this: ""We should reject the US and Israeli pressure, and move to enhance Palestinian national reconciliation until we achieve national unity. The least we can do is to concentrate all our energies and to overcome our differences in order to protect Jerusalem and reject the new US decision.""Â ""For you, the city of prayer, I pray"" - Al Jazeera responded to the speech by showing the Fairouz song, FlowerÂ Among Cities The main Arab TV news channels are runningÂ special coverage of the announcement, reporting on the international reaction and reflecting on Jerusalem's placeÂ in Arab culture.Â An evocative song by the well-known Lebanese singer Fairouz,Â FlowerÂ Among Cities, has been played by some channels, including Al Jazeera.Â In it Fairouz sings about the loss of Jerusalem, and about the Palestinians' hope that they will one day return to it.Â Al Arabiya TV showed footage of a Christmas tree with its lights turned off in Ramallah At the top of its morning bulletin, the Saudi-funded Al Arabiya TV cited the kingdom's official response expressing its ""deep regret"" over Mr Trump's decision and urging his administration to reconsider.Â It highlighted demonstrations and strikes being held by Palestinians and reported that the lights on Bethlehem's Christmas tree had been switched off in protest. Egypt's Al-Dustur announces ""the death of Arabsâ In Egypt, Al-Dustur's front page says: ""Announcing the death of the Arabs"".

"European Council president Donald Tusk is to make an announcement about Brexit at 06:50 GMT on Friday The core Brexit issues on which Ireland reached agreement earlier this week are not changing, the country's foreign minister has told the Irish parliament. Dublin would look at new proposals but its core position needed to remain intact, said Mr Coveney. Negotiations between the UK government, the European Commission and the Irish government continued on Thursday. European Council president Donald Tusk is now due to make an announcement about Brexit at 06:50 GMT on Friday. On Monday, theUK and EU failed to strike a deal in Brexit talkswhen the DUP objected to the wording of a text on the future operation of the border. How to get out of Brexit linguistic hole? What is 'regulatory alignment?' Ireland 'disappointed' at no deal on Brexit Long read: The hardest border Reality check: How much trade is there between UK and Ireland It is unlikely the current phase of negotiations will be wrapped by the end of Thursday, says the BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg. There is no sense of any real momentum in the talks, despite the hard work of all sides, she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. The real difficulty for UK PM Theresa May is that disagreement on a post-Brexit Irish border has sparked division within the Conservative Party on the differing versions of Brexit that could be tolerated by different parties, she added. The DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds MP left talks with representatives on the Conservative Party in Whitehall earlier on Thursday evening without comment. Dublin's core issues are protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining the integrity of the European single market and the all-island economy. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Mr Coveney told the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) on Thursday morning that sensitive negotiations were ongoing and he would not make any statement that might create difficulties. But he was insistent the Republic would not support anything that might lead to a hard border on the island of Ireland. ""The Irish government's position hasn't changed,"" he said. The Irish government has demanded a written agreement from the UK that there will be no return to a hard border - one involving checkpoints or barriers - after Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, the Irish prime minister said the UK government planned to suggest a new wording for a Brexit deal on the Irish border within the next 24 hours. Leo Varadkar said he had spoken by phone to UK PM Theresa May on Wednesday, adding that he wanted to move things forward and had indicated his willingness ""to consider any proposals that the UK side have"". ""Ultimately, it is up to them to come back to us, given the events that happened on Monday,"" he said. On Monday, Mr Varadkar saidhe was ""surprised and disappointed""a deal had not been reached, after the UK had agreed a text that met Irish concerns. ""I want us to move to phase two - if that is possible - next week, but the absolute red line that has been there for some time remains,"" he said. ""My responsibility as taoiseach (Irish PM) is to protect our fundamental national interest and that is the rights of Irish citizens in Ireland and Britain, and also the avoidance of a return to a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland."" The EU has agreed that Brexit talks cannot proceed to phase two - dealing with trade - until the Republic of Ireland is satisfied with a UK guarantee on the border issue. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said it will not accept any agreement in which Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. Mrs May's Conservative Party currently relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs to keep its minority government in power at Westminster. Earlier, veteran Conservative MP Ken Clark said the government had made a ""pig's ear"" of the border negotiations. ""They agreed this regulatory compliance on both sides, which is what a free trade deal requires, but unfortunately they didn't make it clear that's the whole of the United Kingdom,"" he said. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar had a 15-minute phone call with Theresa May on Wednesday ""I quite understand that in Ulster people don't want a different arrangement from the whole of the United Kingdom and to have new protectionist barriers on the Irish Sea."" He added: ""They should have kept the DUP completely in the loop and discussed it with them and explained it with them as it went along. ""It's no good just reaching agreement with the taoiseach and then present it to the DUP who appear to have got the idea that somehow this was a special arrangement for Ulster."" The chair of Westminster's Brexit committee, Labour MP Hilary Benn, said it was right to describe Monday's deal collapse of as ""a shambles"". He was speaking on a visit to the Irish border as part of a one-day fact-finding mission. A group of 14 cross party MPs are meeting local business leaders in County Armagh as well as representatives from the police, customs, and staff from the North-South Ministerial Council. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's leader north of the border, Michelle O'Neill, said there could not be any ""rollback"" by the Irish government on its position, urging Dublin to be ""very alert"". Mrs O'Neill added that the DUP did not represent the ""majority view"" in Northern Ireland.

"University senior pay will be put under tougher scrutiny by new regulations Universities Minister Jo Johnson says that excessive pay for university bosses will be brought ""under control"" by new regulations, which he told the BBC would appear in the new year. Mr Johnson said he was ""absolutely convinced"" a new regulator, the Office for Students, will tackle pay concerns. The minister promised ""greater restraint... in setting top salaries"". It comes after protests over the former head of Bath Spa University receiving more than Â£800,000 in her final year. Mr Johnson's comments follow a series of protests over vice-chancellors' pay in recent weeks - including at the University of Bath, the University of Southampton andthis week at Bath Spa. ""Has there been a problem? Most definitely,"" said Mr Johnson. But he said universities now recognised the need to answer public concerns about value for money. ""I think they really are starting to get it,"" said the universities minister, who said that a ""new regulatory framework"" would be published by the government in the new year. Jo Johnson says universities have to address value for money for students Mr Johnson said the Office for Students would require universities to ensure their ""governance is fit for purpose"". Universities are autonomous institutions, but the minister said there needed to be an understanding of the ""perception of value for money"" from the public. In the new year, this would mean rules requiring much clearer evidence of the independence of committees deciding vice-chancellors' pay. Universities will also have to explain the pay gap between top earners and the rest of their staff. ""When students are paying for their own tuition fees, there is a greater expectation of greater accountability to students, but also to the taxpayer, who is underwriting the student loan book,"" said Mr Johnson. ""Value for money is at the heart of why we set up the Office for Students,"" he said. But he said he was ""concerned that the proportion of students in England who feel they are not getting value for money is greater than those who feel they are getting good value for money"". The universities minister said that details of the ""major review"" of tuition fees and university funding - promised by Prime Minister Theresa May - would also appear in the ""coming weeks"". But Mr Johnson has defended the structure of the current system as ensuring that more disadvantaged students can go into higher education and that universities are better funded. Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, welcomed Mr Johnson's assurances on pay, but warned that he could become ""the latest in a long line of ministers to have seen previous calls for pay restraint ignored"". ""Put simply, the status quo cannot continue."" In the dispute over pay at Bath Spa University, there have been calls by the UCU lecturers' union for an ""urgent overhaul"" of senior university pay. Accounts for Bath Spa University show Prof Christina Slade was paid Â£429,000 ""for loss of office"" on top of her Â£250,000 salary and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Bath Spa said the sum represented ""value for money"".

"Crews took an hour to free the man An internet ""prankster"" had to be freed by firefighters after cementing his head inside a microwave oven. West Midlands Fire Service said it took an hour to free the man after they were called to a house in Fordhouses, Wolverhampton.

""The oven was being used as a mould and wasn't plugged in. The mixture quickly set hard and, by the time we were called, they'd already been trying to free him for an hour and a half.""

"The winning city was announced in the current UK City of Culture, Hull Coventry has been chosen to be the UK's City of Culture for 2021. The bid team said their plans were ""about changing the reputation of a city"" as well as hosting a year of cultural celebration. The title is awarded every four years and Coventry will hope to emulate the success of Hull, which is UK City of Culture this year. The other places in the running for the title were Swansea, Paisley, Stoke-on-Trent and Sunderland. Left-right: Philip Larkin, Delia Derbyshire and The Specials Famous sons and daughters Coventry is the birthplace of Philip Larkin, one of England's finest poets, electronic music pioneer Delia Derbyshire and best-selling author Lee Child. It's also the home of the Two Tone ska movement through bands like The Specials and The Selecter. Cultural claims to fame Venues will include Warwick Arts Centre, the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum and the Belgrade Theatre, which launched the Theatre In Education movement in 1965. It's also the home of the UK's first Shop Front Theatre and boasts the UK's largest free family music festival with the Coventry Godiva Festival. Coventry's bid team said the city had ""constantly reinvented itself to survive"". It has suffered from the decline of its status as the heart of the British motor industry, and it was devastated by bombing during the World War Two. It will hope to learn from Hull, whose status as UK City of Culture has boosted the local economy by an estimated Â£60m. Hull has also seen more than Â£1bn of investment since being chosen to hold the 2017 title four years ago, and the year's artistic programme has been a hit with both residents and critics.

"The Chancellor has been criticised by a disabled charity for saying high levels of disabled people in the workforce may have had an impact on productivity.

""I am proud that during my time in the Senate that I have used my power to be a champion of women,"" the Minnesota senator said from the US Senate floor. His speech came a day after nearly 30 Democrats called on him to resign. He would be the most prominent lawmaker to resign amid a wave of misconduct claims against high-profile figures. Meanwhile, the US House of Representatives Ethics Committee launched sexual harassment investigations into two Republican congressmen. Trent Franks of Arizona announced he was resigning as the inquiry was announced. Mr Franken arrived at the Capitol holding hands with his wife He acknowledged having made two female congressional aides ""uncomfortable"" by asking them about surrogacy when he and his wife faced infertility. The committee also said it would investigate Blake Farenthold, who used $84,000 (Â£62,000) oftaxpayers' money to settle a sexual harassment lawsuitwith his former spokeswoman. Over in the Senate, Mr Franken told his colleagues on Thursday: ""Today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as a member of the United States Senate. ""I may be resigning my seat but I am not giving up my voice."" The former Saturday Night Live comic and two-term senator has apologised to several women who have accused him of groping and sexual harassment, but he faced mounting pressure to step aside after a new allegation surfaced on Wednesday. Democrats desert senator in grope claims Mr Franken said some of the claims against him ""are simply are not true"", but added that women ""deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously"". He also referenced the sexual misconduct allegations that have been levelled against President Donald Trump and Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. ""I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.""

""Nothing is easy or pleasant about this,"" she wrote, ""but we all must recognise that our workplace cultures - and the way we treat each other as human beings - must change."" The decision to fill the vacancy left by Mr Franken will fall to Democratic Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, who said in a statement he has not determined who will replace him.

"Uber has had its licence suspended in Sheffield after it failed to respond to official requests about its management, the city council has said. The firm, also fighting a ban in London, can still operate in Sheffield until 18 December and can appeal against the decision, the council said. If it decides not to appeal, the suspension will come into force. Uber said that an ""administrative error"" by the council was to blame and hoped to resolve the issue soon. Uber is still fighting its ban in London after it lost its licence there in September. Transport for London, which has criticised the firm's record over reporting criminal offences and carrying out driver background checks, decided not to renew Uber's London licence after it deemed the firm ""unfit"" to run a taxi service. A Sheffield City spokesperson said: ""Uber's licence was suspended last Friday (29 November) after the current licence holder failed to respond to requests, made by our licensing team, about the management of Uber. ""We received a new application, for a licence to operate taxis in Sheffield, from Uber Britannia Limited, on 18 October 2017 which we are currently processing."" The council said an operator's licence could not be transferred and that the new application would be dealt with by the council's licensing department. An Uber spokesperson said: ""We informed Sheffield City Council on 5 October that we would need to change the name on our licence as the named individual would soon be leaving the company. ""The council told us they couldn't change the name on the licence, as most other councils have done, and that we would instead have to apply for a new one."" Uber said it had submitted an application for a new licence which was still being processed. ""While we are in regular contact with the council, we did not receive the correspondence the council refers to as they sent the letters to an incorrect address,"" the spokesperson said. ""We hope this administrative error can be quickly resolved so we can continue serving tens of thousands of riders and drivers in Sheffield."" Uber added that if the new application could not be approved by 18 December, the firm would of course appeal against its suspension.

"This video can not be played Wildfires devastate southern California Nearly 200,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes in California as firefighters battle several raging wildfires. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego on Thursday after a new blaze spread from 10 acres to 4,100 acres in just a few hours. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. One death has been reported - a woman's body was found in a burned-out area in Ventura County. But an official told the Ventura Country Star newspaper that the death, in the town of Ojai, may have been the result of a car crash not related to the fire. California wildfire flames seen from space On Friday, US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in California, which will free up funding to ""help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population"". About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the brushfires, officials have said, with firefighters drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County remains the largest, burning 180 square miles so far The Thomas fire in Ventura County to the north of Los Angeles remains the largest of the blazes and has spread as far as the Pacific coast. It has consumed 180 square miles (466 sq km) since it broke out on Monday, and destroyed more than 430 buildings, fire officials said. A BBC correspondent in Ojai says the blaze is burning in the hills all around and more than 100 fire engines have been seen driving through the town centre. Allow Twitter content?

The gangway between the Safe Boreas and the Mariner platform east of Shetland automatically disconnected due to worsening weather conditions. Statoil said no-one was injured, but it did leave 36 workers, who were on the neighbouring Noble Lloyd Noble rig unable to get back to the accommodation vessel. They made the short journey on Thursday morning by helicopter.

"Seven people were killed when a tram derailed near to Sandilands in November 2016 The driver of a tram which derailed in Croydon had probably dozed off moments before the fatal crash,an official report has found.,external Seven people died and more than 50 were injured in the derailment in south London in November last year. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch also found action was not taken following a similar speeding incident just days before the tragedy. The 174-page report has made 15 recommendations to improve tram safety. These include the creation of a dedicated safety body for UK tramways, a better understanding of risk of trams and the introduction of stronger windows and doors on trams. Investigators say all the fatalities and many of the serious injuries were caused by passengers being thrown out of carriage windows. 'Tram crash preventable,' says widow Drivers 'fell asleep' on fatal tram line Bosses were warned of 'speeding trams' Who were the victims? Tram crash memorial unveiled The tram was running from New Addington to Wimbledon via Croydon, and was on the approach to Sandilands tram stop soon after 06:00 on 9 November 2016. A previous report said although the speed limit approaching the junction was 12mph, the tram had been travelling at an estimated speed of 45mph. Investigators found the tram derailed while travelling at three-and-a-half times the speed limit The report said the most likely cause for the driver not applying the brakes was ""a temporary loss of awareness of the driving task during a period of low workload, which possibly caused him to micro-sleep"". It adds: ""It is also possible that when regaining awareness, the driver became confused about his location and direction of travel."" Tests found no drugs or alcohol in the driver's system and no medical abnormalities were identified in him. Simon French, RAIB's chief inspector of rail accidents, added: ""There is no direct evidence of the driver closing his eyes or being asleep."" When interviewed as part of the investigation, the driver said he had ""no recollection"" and ""couldn't explain what happened"", according to Mr French. A criminal investigation is being led by the British Transport Police (BTP) who arrested the driver on suspicion of manslaughter. The 43-year-old man, from Beckenham, remains on bail, a BTP spokesman said. The RAIB report also found management were not aware of previous incidents involving late braking on the approach to Sandilands. Some of this was down to a ""reluctance of some drivers to report their own mistakes"", the report said. On 31 October a passenger raised concerns about a tram which went ""too fast"" round a bend near Sandilands. The driver of that tram applied the hazard brake, but the driver did not report the incident. The RAIB said on Thursday, that tram ""came close to coming off the tracks."" Automatic braking and systems to monitor driver alertness Better understanding of risks associated with tramway operations - particularly when the tramway is not on a road Improve the strength of doors and windows Encourage a culture in which individual mistakes and other safety issues are reported Review how tramways are regulated Set-up a dedicated safety body for UK tramways People were ""ejected"" from the carriageand some became trapped and crushed as the speeding tram ground to a halt, the report found. The RAIB is advising tram operators throughout the UK to make sure windows are fitted with stronger glass. London's Transport Commissioner Mike Brown said: ""Since the incident we have introduced a wide range of additional safety measures to make sure such a tragedy can never happen again. A stone plinth has been built as a memorial to the victims ""These include new signage and warning systems for drivers, additional speed restrictions, enhanced speed monitoring and an upgrade of the CCTV recording system. ""An in-cab driver protection device has been trialled and is now fitted to every tram, meaning that any sign of driver distraction or fatigue results in the driver being alerted immediately. Work to install a system to automatically reduce tram speeds if required is also underway."" The Croydon tram service is run on behalf of TfL by Tram Operations Limited, a subsidiary of FirstGroup. Tim O'Toole, FirstGroup's chief executive officer, extended his condolences to the victims and added: ""The RAIB concluded that management of fatigue was not a factor in the incident, nor did a speeding culture contribute to it. ""Nevertheless, over the past year we have taken a series of actions, working closely with TfL on whose behalf we operate the system, to implement additional measures including enhanced speed monitoring and restrictions, improved signage and renewed guidance on fatigue management."" What is totally damning is how fundamentally broken the reporting and complaints process was at the tram operator run by First Group. Drivers were afraid to report for fear of recriminations and when passengers complained - such as after a speeding incident on 31 October just 10 days before the crash - the investigation was glacial. The families of those who died are heartbroken and outraged that opportunities to stop speeding incidents were missed. In fact, the complaints procedure has been deemed so broken, TfL has taken it away from FirstGroup and brought it back in house. Again this will raise huge questions about the fragmentation of the transport industry and I'm sure questions about the role of privatisation and companies operating concessions on behalf of public bodies. Despite the RAIB publishing its findings, there are still other separate investigations being carried out in parallel with each other. TfL has commissioned its own probe into the disaster, while the Office for Road and Rail (ORR) is looking at whether there were any health and safety breaches which contributed to the crash. In response to the report, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""This was a preventable accident, seven people lost their lives and they shouldn't have done so. It's really important we learn lessons."" The driver's union ASLEF's Finn Brennan said tram drivers still have a ""fear"" of being sacked if they ""report being tired or sick"". He added ""management culture"" at Tram Operations Ltd meant mistakes were not listened to and acted on properly. Sarah Jones, MP for Croydon Central, said: ""Our first thoughts will always be for the victims' families. ""They will be reliving this tragedy yet again, and it will be another difficult day for them. The most important thing we can do for them is show that lessons have been learned and make sure this never happens again.""

"This video can not be played Brexit: Boris Johnson defends 'go whistle' remark Boris Johnson has been defending his much quoted jibe that the EU could ""go whistle"" over the Brexit bill. The UK and EU are widely believed to have now agreed a deal which will see the UK paying up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). But the foreign secretary said he had been referring, in July, to reports the UK could face a 100bn euro bill. He spoke as talks continue about the remaining sticking point in the initial phase of Brexit talks - what happens at the Northern Ireland border. Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit discussion looming for PM Reality Check: Why border arguments delay Brexit deal Brexit protests and new mural in Belfast The foreign secretary said - at a question and answer session after a speech on global terrorism - that whatever was agreed must be ""consistent with taking back control of our laws, of our borders and our cash"". His ""go whistle"" comment was made in a response in the House of Commons to Conservative backbencher Philip Hollobone: This video can not be played Boris Johnson's message to the EU: ""Go whistle seems to me to be an entirely appropriate expression"" Mr Johnson said he had been ""teased"" about it since, but at the time he had been ""asked my reaction to some of the very extortionate sums that I had heard, in the region of Â£80bn or Â£100bn"". He said that on detailed examination of financial obligations ""the British government is absolutely punctilious in wanting to meet our friends more than halfway and to be useful. ""The financial offer we are making is very good but it is nowhere near the sums that I was first invited to comment on, in a musical way."" The government says it is ""optimistic"" about finding a solution to the key sticking point - an agreement on the Irish border. The government needs to get everyone onside on the issue in the coming days for Brexit negotiations to move forwards. This video can not be played Chris Grayling: I'm optimistic about deal The UK, which is due to leave the EU in March 2019, wants to open talks on a new free trade deal as soon as possible. But the EU will only agree to this when enough progress has been made on the ""separation issues""  - the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border - that have been the subject of negotiations so far. So the UK is trying to settle the Northern Ireland border issue before EU leaders meet next week. This video can not be played Arlene Foster claimed the Irish government prevented the DUP seeing the wording of the text On Monday, the DUP - whose support Prime Minister Theresa May needs to win key votes at Westminster - objected to draft plans drawn up by the UK and the EU. The DUP said the proposals, which aimed to avoid border checks by aligning regulations on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, were not acceptable. The party has said it will not accept any agreement in which Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member - says it wants a guarantee that a hard border will not be put up after Brexit. A European Commission spokesman said there was ""no white smoke yet"" on Brexit negotiations. Disagreements remain over how the Irish border should be treated after Brexit With Brexit, the UK is leaving the EU's customs union - but Transport Secretary Chris  Grayling said this did not mean there would need to be a physical border with people carrying out border checks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the transport secretary said people had misunderstood the key term ""regulatory alignment"" which has been the focus of the debate. Some Eurosceptics who do not want to keep close ties to Brussels fear this could hamper the UK's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. But Mr Grayling, a key Leave campaigner in the 2016 referendum, said: ""We don't have to have, and we've never said we will, and we don't want, to have a situation where in future our laws are identical to the European Union. ""There will be areas where we do do things in a very similar way, there will be areas in which we don't do things in the a very similar way and that's all the PM was seeking to ensure - to make sure trade flows as freely as possible across the border."" He added: ""I remain absolutely optimistic that we will reach  a successful point, we will move on to the trade talks, because ultimately it is in everybody's interests for that to happen."" The BBC's Adam Fleming said that following an update from chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday, EU member states agreed there must be clarity within 48 hours for them to have enough time to consult with their capitals about draft guidelines for phase two of the talks. At the 14-15 December summit, European leaders will decide whether enough progress has been made in the negotiations on Ireland, the UK's ""divorce bill"" and citizens' rights so far to open trade talks. On Wednesday the Republic of Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he expected Theresa May to come up with a new wording aimed at satisfying all parties, adding: ""I expressed my willingness to consider that."" A European Commission spokesman said on Thursday that things have to be sorted this week, adding: ""Our week includes Sunday."" As well as trying to appease the DUP, Dublin and Brussels, Theresa May also needs Conservative MPs to back whatever solution she puts forward. But not all of them agree - and the pressure on the prime minister was underlined on Wednesday when 19 Tory MPs who back a ""soft Brexit"" wrote to her saying it was ""highly irresponsible"" for anyone to dictate terms which may scupper a deal. This followed Eurosceptic MPs urging her to lay down new red lines before agreeing to hand over any money. Don't bow to Brexit conditions, May urged Brexit: All you need to know In the latest letter, the 19 MPs - who largely backed Remain in the 2016 referendum - say they support the PM's handling of the negotiations, in particular the ""political and practical difficulties"" relating to the Irish border. But they hit out at what they say are attempts by some in their party to paint a no-deal scenario in which the UK failed to agree a trade agreement as ""some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt"". The MPs included former cabinet ministers Stephen Crabb, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan. That's the suggestion from a House of Lords committee, which says a ""time-limited extension of the UK's EU membership"" would ""buy time"" for a deal to be reached. The committee doubts exit negotiations will be completed by the scheduled departure date of March 2019. The UK is due to leave the EU at this point because Theresa May formally triggered a two-year countdown to Brexit in March 2017. The government does not agree, and says it is confident negotiations can be completed by March 2019. But the Lords committee says: ""The overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that this will be impossible. ""If buying a bit more time means that we get a better outcome, which benefits businesses and citizens on both sides, a short extension of EU membership may be a price worth paying.""

"The Â£5 Christmas candle began to burn an hour after it was first lit A picture of a Primark candle bursting into flames has gone viral, after a mother-of-three took to Facebook to raise awareness of the potential hazard. Jenny Ferneyhough purchased the Â£5 candle - which she said developed into ""massive flames"" after an hour of burning - in Manchester on Saturday. The 33-year-old's Facebook post has been shared 145,000 times. Primark said it is removing the product from sale and investigating the matter. Mrs Ferneyhough, a Manchester City Council benefits officer, said she lit the candle - in the shape of a Christmas tree - after putting her three children to bed. She said the flame had spread from the wick to the whole candle within an hour. Jenny Ferneyhough, left, was with her husband Evan when the candle burst into flames She said: ""Obviously everyone knows not to leave a flame unattended, but if you went to the loo, a couple of seconds later it could have burst into flames. ""If it [develops into] a massive flame when anything else is around it, it could be very dangerous."" Speaking to the BBC, she added that she was especially concerned about people lighting the candle ""around neighbouring decorations"" during the festive period. Mrs Ferneyhough sent the pictures to Primark, who replied to say they were ""very concerned"" about the discovery. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A company spokesperson has since said the product is being removed from sale, while the complaint is investigated ""as a matter of urgency"". Mrs Ferneyhough said she was ""reassured"" by the massive response she had received to her post, less than 24 hours after posting the picture. She added the main reason for sharing the pictures was to raise awareness of the potential issue with the candle, and to stop people from lighting it unattended. ""My husband went into the Manchester store to take a picture of the packaging, and a mum and her daughter said they'd seen the photo I shared of it in flames,"" she added.

"Mohammed Abdallah will be sentenced on Friday A British man has been found guilty of travelling to join so-called Islamic State in Syria. Mohammed Abdallah received help from his brother Abdalraouf, who set up a ""hub"" of communication for would-be fighters from his home in Manchester. The Old Bailey heard the 26-year-oldintended to meet three fellow jihadisin Syria. Abdallah, of Westerling Way, Moss Side, Manchester, was convicted following a trial lasting more than four weeks. He was found guilty of possessing an AK47 gun, receiving Â£2,000 for terrorism purposes and membership of IS. Leaked IS document helps convict fighter Abdallah was remanded into custody until his sentencing on Friday. The jury heard the defendant was assisted by his disabled younger brother Abdalraouf, who waspreviously jailedfor helping other members of the same network. Mohammed Abdallah, who has dual Libyan-British citizenship, denied joining Islamic State Abdalraouf Abdallah has been in a wheelchair since he was injured in Libya at the age of 18 Abdalraouf was left paralysed after he was shot while taking part in the 2011 Libyan uprising. His brother was outed as an IS fighter last year when an IS registration document listing him as a ""specialist sniper"" was leaked to Sky News by a defector. The court heard how the defendant arrived in Britain as a refugee at the age of three after his family fled the Gaddafi regime in Libya. Abdallah went to Burnage High School in Manchester and also attended Didsbury Mosque, where Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi was also known to have worshipped, it can now be reported. Abdallah previously said he failed to pass any exams and was ""not particularly religious"", preferring to spend time drinking and smoking cannabis. Abdallah's IS registration document was translated into English and analysed by detectives In 2011 the brothers joined the ""Tripoli Brigade"" and during a bloody battle against the Gaddafi regime, Abdalraouf was shot and paralysed from the waist down. Jurors were shown video footage of both siblings handling heavy Russian-made machine guns on vehicles in Libya. In the summer of 2014, Abdallah headed to Syria via Libya with fellow Libyan Nezar Khalifa, 27, the jury heard. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said they planned to join IS with former RAF serviceman Stephen Gray, 34, and Raymond Matimba, 28, who were also from Manchester. Gray was turned away in Turkey, but Matimba eventually caught up with the others and recently appeared in footage with the late IS killer Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John. In 2016, Sky News received files from an IS defector which listed Abdallah as a specialist sniper with expertise with the ""Dushka"", a Russian heavy machine gun, and fighting experience in Libya. Former RAF serviceman Stephen Gray also tried to enter Syria but was turned away in Turkey His record, which had the IS flag in the top right-hand corner, listed his former occupation as ""supermarket vendor"", although jobless Abdallah told jurors he got by in Britain by stealing and selling cannabis. The form listed Manchester recruiter Raphael Hostey, aka Abu Al-qaqa Al Britani, as a reference for Abdallah, as well as a ""family friend"", the Libyan narrator of an IS video entitled Demolishing Borders. Giving evidence, Abdallah denied swearing allegiance to the jihadist group, claiming he went to Syria to help deliver $5,000 to the poor. He said someone else must have filled out the registration form without his knowledge. ""It's true I refused to swear allegiance. They did send me to prison,"" Abdallah told the court. ""I was threatened with being beheaded. I was shot at. I was hit. I had bruises and a black eye."" Mohammed Abdallah is thought to be the man on the back of this truck in TV footage taken during fighting in Libya Abdalraouf Abdallah, then aged 18, is also thought to have appeared in TV footage showing fighting in Libya He denied knowing the man behind the Demolishing Borders IS video but admitted he knew Hostey through the Didsbury mosque. Abdalraouf Abdallah and Gray were arrested in Manchester in November 2014. In 2016, Abdalraouf Abdallah was found guilty of assisting others in committing acts of terrorism, and terror funding and jailed for five and a half years. Gray, of Whitnall Street in Manchester, admitted three terrorism offences, including his attempts to travel to Syria, and was jailed for five years. Fellow Mancunian Hostey, described as an ""inspirational figure"" for would-be jihadis, left the UK in 2013 and is believed to have been killed in a drone strike in 2016. It can now be reported that Abdallah's trial was delayed in the wake of the attack on the Manchester Arena over reported links with Abedi, who attended the same mosque as the defendant and Hostey. He too had Libyan parents, lived in Manchester, and had travelled to Libya before returning to the city to plan the May 22 attack on an Ariana Grande concert that killed 22 people.

"This video can not be played The Queen commissions aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth The Queen has officially welcomed the UK's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, at a ceremony to commission it into the Royal Navy fleet. The monarch boarded her namesake ship in Portsmouth to see the Royal Navy White Ensign raised on the vessel for the first time. Princess Anne, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones also attended. The ceremony took place on the giant hangar deck of the Â£3.1bn carrier. HMS Queen Elizabeth and its sister ship HMS Prince of Wales are the most expensive in the Royal Navy's history. HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed into Portsmouth in August following extensive preparations at the naval base. The navy initially estimated both ships would cost Â£3.5bn to build butthe total figure was revised to Â£6.2bn. Latest updates as HMS Queen Elizabeth enters service About 3,700 guests attended the event, which came more than three years after the vessel's official naming ceremony in Rosyth when the Queen broke a bottle of whisky on its hull. During the ceremony, the commissioning warrant was read, and the Blue Ensign, which has been flying from the ship until it is formally handed over to the Royal Navy, was replaced with the White Ensign, raised by 20-year-old Able Seaman Ellie Smith from Hull. Addressing the assembled guests and ship's company, The Queen described the ship as ""the most powerful and capable ship ever to raise the White Ensign"". ""At the forefront of these responsibilities will be the men and women of the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, supported by the Army, Royal Air Force and by coalition partners. ""As the daughter, wife and mother of naval officers, I recognise the unique demands our nation asks of you and I will always value my special link to HMS Queen Elizabeth, her ship's company and their families,"" she said. The White Ensign was raised to symbolised the ship's commissioning into the fleet Admiral Sir Philip Jones, said: ""We have been on a long, complicated - but committed - journey to get to this point and commissioning the ship is a key milestone. ""The point of the big grey ship is it's enormously big, flexible, capable and adaptable."" As part of the ceremony, a8ft-long (2.44m) cake replica of the shipwas cut. As is traditional, it was carried out by the youngest member of the ship's company - Callum Hui, 17 - and the captain's wife Dr Karen Kyd. Callum Hui and Dr Karen Kyd cut the cake at the commissioning of HMS Queen Elizabeth. By Jonathan Beale, Defence Correspondent This is a big day for the Royal Navy. A chance to look to the future and, at least for a moment, forget about recent defence cuts and fears of even more. After successfully completing her sea trials HMS Queen Elizabeth will be commissioned into service. For the first time she'll raise the White Ensign - officially becoming a Royal Navy Warship.  But, this is still another milestone not the end of her journey. Flight trials will begin next year and her first proper deployment with jets on board isn't planned until 2021. It's also still not clear how many of the new F35 jets she'll carry. Certainly fewer than the 36 she was built for, with each jet costing around Â£100m. The Royal Navy believes the carrier - the first of two - will be a potent symbol of British military power.  But it's already struggling with limited resources. Capt Jerry Kyd called the ceremony the ""culmination of a number of years of real excitement"". He said: ""The first sailing from Rosyth was only nine months ago, we have come a long way.

"The Â£5 Christmas candle began to burn an hour after it was first lit A picture of a Primark candle bursting into flames has gone viral, after a mother-of-three took to Facebook to raise awareness of the potential hazard. Jenny Ferneyhough purchased the Â£5 candle - which she said developed into ""massive flames"" after an hour of burning - in Manchester on Saturday. The 33-year-old's Facebook post has been shared 145,000 times. Primark said it is removing the product from sale and investigating the matter. Mrs Ferneyhough, a Manchester City Council benefits officer, said she lit the candle - in the shape of a Christmas tree - after putting her three children to bed. She said the flame had spread from the wick to the whole candle within an hour. Jenny Ferneyhough, left, was with her husband Evan when the candle burst into flames She said: ""Obviously everyone knows not to leave a flame unattended, but if you went to the loo, a couple of seconds later it could have burst into flames. ""If it [develops into] a massive flame when anything else is around it, it could be very dangerous."" Speaking to the BBC, she added that she was especially concerned about people lighting the candle ""around neighbouring decorations"" during the festive period. Mrs Ferneyhough sent the pictures to Primark, who replied to say they were ""very concerned"" about the discovery. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A company spokesperson has since said the product is being removed from sale, while the complaint is investigated ""as a matter of urgency"". Mrs Ferneyhough said she was ""reassured"" by the massive response she had received to her post, less than 24 hours after posting the picture. She added the main reason for sharing the pictures was to raise awareness of the potential issue with the candle, and to stop people from lighting it unattended. ""My husband went into the Manchester store to take a picture of the packaging, and a mum and her daughter said they'd seen the photo I shared of it in flames,"" she added.

"Mohammed Abdallah will be sentenced on Friday A British man has been found guilty of travelling to join so-called Islamic State in Syria. Mohammed Abdallah received help from his brother Abdalraouf, who set up a ""hub"" of communication for would-be fighters from his home in Manchester. The Old Bailey heard the 26-year-oldintended to meet three fellow jihadisin Syria. Abdallah, of Westerling Way, Moss Side, Manchester, was convicted following a trial lasting more than four weeks. He was found guilty of possessing an AK47 gun, receiving Â£2,000 for terrorism purposes and membership of IS. Leaked IS document helps convict fighter Abdallah was remanded into custody until his sentencing on Friday. The jury heard the defendant was assisted by his disabled younger brother Abdalraouf, who waspreviously jailedfor helping other members of the same network. Mohammed Abdallah, who has dual Libyan-British citizenship, denied joining Islamic State Abdalraouf Abdallah has been in a wheelchair since he was injured in Libya at the age of 18 Abdalraouf was left paralysed after he was shot while taking part in the 2011 Libyan uprising. His brother was outed as an IS fighter last year when an IS registration document listing him as a ""specialist sniper"" was leaked to Sky News by a defector. The court heard how the defendant arrived in Britain as a refugee at the age of three after his family fled the Gaddafi regime in Libya. Abdallah went to Burnage High School in Manchester and also attended Didsbury Mosque, where Manchester Arena suicide bomber Salman Abedi was also known to have worshipped, it can now be reported. Abdallah previously said he failed to pass any exams and was ""not particularly religious"", preferring to spend time drinking and smoking cannabis. Abdallah's IS registration document was translated into English and analysed by detectives In 2011 the brothers joined the ""Tripoli Brigade"" and during a bloody battle against the Gaddafi regime, Abdalraouf was shot and paralysed from the waist down. Jurors were shown video footage of both siblings handling heavy Russian-made machine guns on vehicles in Libya. In the summer of 2014, Abdallah headed to Syria via Libya with fellow Libyan Nezar Khalifa, 27, the jury heard. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said they planned to join IS with former RAF serviceman Stephen Gray, 34, and Raymond Matimba, 28, who were also from Manchester. Gray was turned away in Turkey, but Matimba eventually caught up with the others and recently appeared in footage with the late IS killer Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John. In 2016, Sky News received files from an IS defector which listed Abdallah as a specialist sniper with expertise with the ""Dushka"", a Russian heavy machine gun, and fighting experience in Libya. Former RAF serviceman Stephen Gray also tried to enter Syria but was turned away in Turkey His record, which had the IS flag in the top right-hand corner, listed his former occupation as ""supermarket vendor"", although jobless Abdallah told jurors he got by in Britain by stealing and selling cannabis. The form listed Manchester recruiter Raphael Hostey, aka Abu Al-qaqa Al Britani, as a reference for Abdallah, as well as a ""family friend"", the Libyan narrator of an IS video entitled Demolishing Borders. Giving evidence, Abdallah denied swearing allegiance to the jihadist group, claiming he went to Syria to help deliver $5,000 to the poor. He said someone else must have filled out the registration form without his knowledge. ""It's true I refused to swear allegiance. They did send me to prison,"" Abdallah told the court. ""I was threatened with being beheaded. I was shot at. I was hit. I had bruises and a black eye."" Mohammed Abdallah is thought to be the man on the back of this truck in TV footage taken during fighting in Libya Abdalraouf Abdallah, then aged 18, is also thought to have appeared in TV footage showing fighting in Libya He denied knowing the man behind the Demolishing Borders IS video but admitted he knew Hostey through the Didsbury mosque. Abdalraouf Abdallah and Gray were arrested in Manchester in November 2014. In 2016, Abdalraouf Abdallah was found guilty of assisting others in committing acts of terrorism, and terror funding and jailed for five and a half years. Gray, of Whitnall Street in Manchester, admitted three terrorism offences, including his attempts to travel to Syria, and was jailed for five years. Fellow Mancunian Hostey, described as an ""inspirational figure"" for would-be jihadis, left the UK in 2013 and is believed to have been killed in a drone strike in 2016. It can now be reported that Abdallah's trial was delayed in the wake of the attack on the Manchester Arena over reported links with Abedi, who attended the same mosque as the defendant and Hostey. He too had Libyan parents, lived in Manchester, and had travelled to Libya before returning to the city to plan the May 22 attack on an Ariana Grande concert that killed 22 people.

"Prince Charles visited County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland in May 2015 A dissident republican leader who plotted a bomb attack during Prince Charles' visit to Ireland has been jailed for more than 11 years. Seamus McGrane 63, from Little Road, Dromiskin in County Louth was found guilty of directing terrorism and membership of an illegal organisation. McGrane had pleaded not guilty at Dublin's Special Criminal Court. He was secretly recorded discussing explosives and a target of ""military significance"" in a Dublin pub. Passing a sentence of 11-and-a-half years in prison, the judge said McGrane's previous conviction for IRA membership was an aggravating factor. His case is linked to that of Donal Ã Coisdealbha, who was sentenced to five-and-a-half years last December. Seamus McGrane was found guilty of directing terrorism and membership of an illegal organisation He was convicted of possession of explosives in the run-up to Prince Charles' May 2015 state visit to the Republic. McGrane met Ã Coisdealbha a number of times in the Coachman's Inn pub near Dublin airport early in 2015 to plan a bomb attack. Police had installed listening devices and McGrane was recorded discussing strategy and experiments with explosives, as well as his involvement in training people in the dissident movement, whom he had sworn in as members. Detectives heard McGrane instructing Ã Coisdealbha to ""reactivate"" a man he called ""the science graduate"" so as to get advice on explosives. McGrane was sentenced at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin He told him to contact somebody whom he called the ""motorbike man"" to collect the explosives, to clean out the cylinder and return the bike, but not to dispose of it. McGrane also told Ã Coisdealbha the target was to have ""military significance"" and he referred to someone ""coming on the 19th"" - the same day Prince Charles arrived in Ireland. The recordings heard him refer to an attack on Palace Barracks - the MI5 headquarters in Northern Ireland - on 12 April, 2010, and to a bomb on a railway line. The presiding judge said that there was ""the clearest evidence of directing an illegal organisation"". The judge said that police had discovered ""a veritable arsenal of weapons and explosives substances"" in hides on land adjoining McGrane's house, which included ammunition, a revolver, mortar parts and bomb making components. Only one other man has been convicted for directing terrorism in the Republic of Ireland -Michael McKevitt who was jailed for 20 years in 2003. In a landmark civil case in 2009, the High Court in Belfast ruled McKevitt and three other men were responsible for the 1998 Omagh bomb that killed 29 people and unborn twins. McKevitt did not face criminal charges in relation to the Omagh bombing.

"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""We want to drive them out of Iraq and Syria"" The UK will ""bring destruction"" to those who fight for so-called Islamic State, the defence secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said British armed forces were ""making sure terrorists have nowhere to hide"" across the globe. Speaking at the commissioning of theaircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabethin Portsmouth, he said UK forces were driving IS out of Iraq and Syria. He earlier told theDaily Mail,external: ""Quite simply, my view is a dead terrorist can't cause any harm to Britain."" Mr Williamson had said no British citizen who has fought for so-called Islamic State should be allowed back into the UK. At least 800 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for IS and 130 of those have been killed in conflict. British IS fighters must be killed, minister says British jihadist Jones 'killed by drone' Who are Britainâs jihadists? Mr Williamson, who took over as defence secretary last month, said the Â£3.1bn carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was ""part of our armoury"" in dealing with terrorism. ""We will be able to deploy her any place in the globe,"" he said. ""We will destroy and bring destruction to these evil death corps such as Daesh and that's what British forces have continuously been doing."" He said it was important for the UK to tackle terrorism in ""ungoverned spaces"" abroad, after forces had spent the last few years driving jihadists from Iraq and Syria. ""We've also got to be realistic, as where we have taken territory from them: Where are they going to go? Where are they going to try and strike Britain next?"" he said. Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, was killed by an RAF airstrike in Syria Speaking to the Mail, Mr Williamson said British fighters who had fled to other countries would be found and stopped from returning to the UK, adding that there would be no ""safe space"" abroad for them either. ""We have got to make sure that as (they) splinter and as they disperse across Iraq and Syria and other areas, we continue to hunt them down,"" he said. This video can not be played Killing all jihadists is ""not a serious grown up policy response"", says Lord Macdonald Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, said suggesting dead terrorists could not cause any harm to Britain was a ""juvenile response"". ""We can't simply say that everyone who has gone to Iraq will be hunted down and killed,"" he told BBC Radio 4'sThe World at Oneprogramme. Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Mr Williamson's predecessor Sir Michael Fallon said in October that British IS fighters in Syria and Iraq had made themselves ""a legitimate target"" who could end up on ""the wrong end of an RAF or USAF missile"". His comments came after it was reported that British IS recruiter Sally-Anne Jones had been killed in a US drone strike in Syria in June. And Rory Stewart, the minister for international development, said the ""only way"" to deal with British IS fighters in Syria is ""in almost every case"" to kill them. He said they can expect to be killed because of the ""serious danger"" they pose to the UK's security. Max Hill QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, said there should be some allowance for ""young and naive"" individuals who were ""simply brainwashed"", for example as teenagers, but insisted that even these people should be prosecuted if they committed serious criminal offences. Reyaad Khan, pictured left, appeared in IS propaganda videos By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Under British and international law, an aspiration to eliminate all known British IS recruits will take a little more consideration than simply launching a drone laden with fire-and-forget missiles. In war, soldiers have immunity from prosecution for killing on the battlefield, unless they have committed a war crime. But the UK is not at war with the IS network - so the same immunity is not automatically available for counter-terrorism purposes. There has to be some other legal basis for justifying the killing. Two years ago, the government sent a three-paragraph letter to the United Nations Security Council setting outthe case for killing Cardiff extremist Reyaad Khan. That strike was legal under the ""inherent right of self-defence"", it said, because the 21-year-old had been directing ""imminent armed attacks"". MPs have pushed for more information on the decision-making process, that some critics say could amount to an unreviewable secret power to launch ""extra-judicial executions.""

"Marie Brown and Noel Brown were found dead on 4 December A father who was found strangled along with his adult daughter at his London home was a convicted sex offender, police have said. Noel Brown, 69, and Marie Brown, 41, were found in Deptford on Monday. Police said a link to the 1999 sex attack was an ""obvious line of inquiry"" but they had no evidence that revenge was the motive for the murders. They also revealed Mr Brown's attacker had tried to dismember his body. No arrests have been made. Police have stepped up patrols in the area following the murders. Police say Noel Brown had been to a betting shop on the last day he was seen alive The bodies were found after Ms Brown's family reported her missing when she failed to come home after going to check on her father. Police said Mr Brown had served a long prison sentence for the sex attack. Det Supt Paul Monk said there were ""no signs of forced entry to the property"" and police were trying to establish ""if the suspects or suspects were known to Noel and if Marie disturbed them."" Post-mortem examinations found she and her father died as a result of strangulation. Det Supt Paul Monk said it was ""a deeply distressing time for Noel and Marie's family as they come to terms with their loss."" He said Mr Brown was ""well known and liked locally"" and was last seen alive on 30 November in his local betting shop, Paddy Power, in Deptford High Street. ""There has been speculation that his murder was as a result of a large gambling win, however at this time there is no evidence to suggest this was the case,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Trump says his Jerusalem decision is in the best interest of peace US President Donald Trump announced in a speech on Wednesday that Washington was officially recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Here is the full transcript of what he said, as released by the White House. When I came into office, I promised to look at the world's challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking. We cannot solve our problems by making the same failed assumptions and repeating the same failed strategies of the past. Old challenges demand new approaches. My announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. In 1995, Congress adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act, urging the federal government to relocate the American embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise that that city - and so importantly - is Israel's capital. This act passed Congress by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and was reaffirmed by a unanimous vote of the Senate only six months ago. Yet, for over 20 years, every previous American president has exercised the law's waiver, refusing to move the US embassy to Jerusalem or to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital city. Presidents issued these waivers under the belief that delaying the recognition of Jerusalem would advance the cause of peace. Some say they lacked courage, but they made their best judgments based on facts as they understood them at the time. Nevertheless, the record is in. After more than two decades of waivers, we are no closer to a lasting peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It would be folly to assume that repeating the exact same formula would now produce a different or better result. Therefore, I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering. Interpreting Donald Trump's announcement World reacts to Trump move on Jerusalem I've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement. Israel is a sovereign nation with the right like every other sovereign nation to determine its own capital. Acknowledging this as a fact is a necessary condition for achieving peace. It was 70 years ago that the United States, under President Truman, recognised the State of Israel. Ever since then, Israel has made its capital in the city of Jerusalem - the capital the Jewish people established in ancient times. Today, Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government. It is the home of the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, as well as the Israeli Supreme Court. It is the location of the official residence of the prime minister and the president. It is the headquarters of many government ministries. For decades, visiting American presidents, secretaries of state, and military leaders have met their Israeli counterparts in Jerusalem, as I did on my trip to Israel earlier this year. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Jerusalem is not just the heart of three great religions, but it is now also the heart of one of the most successful democracies in the world. Over the past seven decades, the Israeli people have built a country where Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and people of all faiths are free to live and worship according to their conscience and according to their beliefs. Jerusalem is today, and must remain, a place where Jews pray at the Western Wall, where Christians walk the Stations of the Cross, and where Muslims worship at al-Aqsa Mosque. However, through all of these years, presidents representing the United States have declined to officially recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. In fact, we have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital at all. But today, we finally acknowledge the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel's capital. This is nothing more, or less, than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It's something that has to be done. That is why, consistent with the Jerusalem Embassy Act, I am also directing the state department to begin preparation to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This will immediately begin the process of hiring architects, engineers, and planners, so that a new embassy, when completed, will be a magnificent tribute to peace. What makes Jerusalem so holy? What are the alternatives to a two-state solution? How are capital cities chosen? In making these announcements, I also want to make one point very clear: This decision is not intended, in any way, to reflect a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace agreement. We want an agreement that is a great deal for the Israelis and a great deal for the Palestinians. We are not taking a position on any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders. Those questions are up to the parties involved. The United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate a peace agreement that is acceptable to both sides. I intend to do everything in my power to help forge such an agreement. Without question, Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive issues in those talks. The United States would support a two-state solution if agreed to by both sides. In the meantime, I call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem's holy sites, including the Temple Mount, also known as Haram al-Sharif. Above all, our greatest hope is for peace, the universal yearning in every human soul. With today's action, I reaffirm my administration's longstanding commitment to a future of peace and security for the region. There will, of course, be disagreement and dissent regarding this announcement. But we are confident that ultimately, as we work through these disagreements, we will arrive at a peace and a place far greater in understanding and co-operation. This sacred city should call forth the best in humanity, lifting our sights to what it is possible; not pulling us back and down to the old fights that have become so totally predictable. Peace is never beyond the grasp of those willing to reach. So today, we call for calm, for moderation, and for the voices of tolerance to prevail over the purveyors of hate. Our children should inherit our love, not our conflicts. This video can not be played Palestinians and Israelis react to US plan to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital I repeat the message I delivered at the historic and extraordinary summit in Saudi Arabia earlier this year: the Middle East is a region rich with culture, spirit, and history. Its people are brilliant, proud, and diverse, vibrant and strong. But the incredible future awaiting this region is held at bay by bloodshed, ignorance, and terror. Vice-President Pence will travel to the region in the coming days to reaffirm our commitment to work with partners throughout the Middle East to defeat radicalism that threatens the hopes and dreams of future generations. It is time for the many who desire peace to expel the extremists from their midst. It is time for all civilised nations, and people, to respond to disagreement with reasoned debate - not violence. And it is time for young and moderate voices all across the Middle East to claim for themselves a bright and beautiful future. So today, let us rededicate ourselves to a path of mutual understanding and respect. Let us rethink old assumptions and open our hearts and minds to possible and possibilities. And finally, I ask the leaders of the region - political and religious; Israeli and Palestinian; Jewish and Christian and Muslim - to join us in the noble quest for lasting peace. Thank you. God bless you. God bless Israel. God bless the Palestinians. And God bless the United States. Thank you very much. Thank you. Concern to alarm - global reaction How are capital cities chosen?

"University senior pay will be put under tougher scrutiny by new regulations Universities Minister Jo Johnson says that excessive pay for university bosses will be brought ""under control"" by new regulations, which he told the BBC would appear in the new year. Mr Johnson said he was ""absolutely convinced"" a new regulator, the Office for Students, will tackle pay concerns. The minister promised ""greater restraint... in setting top salaries"". It comes after protests over the former head of Bath Spa University receiving more than Â£800,000 in her final year. Mr Johnson's comments follow a series of protests over vice-chancellors' pay in recent weeks - including at the University of Bath, the University of Southampton andthis week at Bath Spa. ""Has there been a problem? Most definitely,"" said Mr Johnson. But he said universities now recognised the need to answer public concerns about value for money. ""I think they really are starting to get it,"" said the universities minister, who said that a ""new regulatory framework"" would be published by the government in the new year. Jo Johnson says universities have to address value for money for students Mr Johnson said the Office for Students would require universities to ensure their ""governance is fit for purpose"". Universities are autonomous institutions, but the minister said there needed to be an understanding of the ""perception of value for money"" from the public. In the new year, this would mean rules requiring much clearer evidence of the independence of committees deciding vice-chancellors' pay. Universities will also have to explain the pay gap between top earners and the rest of their staff. ""When students are paying for their own tuition fees, there is a greater expectation of greater accountability to students, but also to the taxpayer, who is underwriting the student loan book,"" said Mr Johnson. ""Value for money is at the heart of why we set up the Office for Students,"" he said. But he said he was ""concerned that the proportion of students in England who feel they are not getting value for money is greater than those who feel they are getting good value for money"". The universities minister said that details of the ""major review"" of tuition fees and university funding - promised by Prime Minister Theresa May - would also appear in the ""coming weeks"". But Mr Johnson has defended the structure of the current system as ensuring that more disadvantaged students can go into higher education and that universities are better funded. Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, welcomed Mr Johnson's assurances on pay, but warned that he could become ""the latest in a long line of ministers to have seen previous calls for pay restraint ignored"". ""Put simply, the status quo cannot continue."" In the dispute over pay at Bath Spa University, there have been calls by the UCU lecturers' union for an ""urgent overhaul"" of senior university pay. Accounts for Bath Spa University show Prof Christina Slade was paid Â£429,000 ""for loss of office"" on top of her Â£250,000 salary and other benefits. A spokeswoman for Bath Spa said the sum represented ""value for money"".

"This video can not be played Brexit: Boris Johnson defends 'go whistle' remark Boris Johnson has been defending his much quoted jibe that the EU could ""go whistle"" over the Brexit bill. The UK and EU are widely believed to have now agreed a deal which will see the UK paying up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). But the foreign secretary said he had been referring, in July, to reports the UK could face a 100bn euro bill. He spoke as talks continue about the remaining sticking point in the initial phase of Brexit talks - what happens at the Northern Ireland border. Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit discussion looming for PM Reality Check: Why border arguments delay Brexit deal Brexit protests and new mural in Belfast The foreign secretary said - at a question and answer session after a speech on global terrorism - that whatever was agreed must be ""consistent with taking back control of our laws, of our borders and our cash"". His ""go whistle"" comment was made in a response in the House of Commons to Conservative backbencher Philip Hollobone: This video can not be played Boris Johnson's message to the EU: ""Go whistle seems to me to be an entirely appropriate expression"" Mr Johnson said he had been ""teased"" about it since, but at the time he had been ""asked my reaction to some of the very extortionate sums that I had heard, in the region of Â£80bn or Â£100bn"". He said that on detailed examination of financial obligations ""the British government is absolutely punctilious in wanting to meet our friends more than halfway and to be useful. ""The financial offer we are making is very good but it is nowhere near the sums that I was first invited to comment on, in a musical way."" The government says it is ""optimistic"" about finding a solution to the key sticking point - an agreement on the Irish border. The government needs to get everyone onside on the issue in the coming days for Brexit negotiations to move forwards. This video can not be played Chris Grayling: I'm optimistic about deal The UK, which is due to leave the EU in March 2019, wants to open talks on a new free trade deal as soon as possible. But the EU will only agree to this when enough progress has been made on the ""separation issues""  - the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border - that have been the subject of negotiations so far. So the UK is trying to settle the Northern Ireland border issue before EU leaders meet next week. This video can not be played Arlene Foster claimed the Irish government prevented the DUP seeing the wording of the text On Monday, the DUP - whose support Prime Minister Theresa May needs to win key votes at Westminster - objected to draft plans drawn up by the UK and the EU. The DUP said the proposals, which aimed to avoid border checks by aligning regulations on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, were not acceptable. The party has said it will not accept any agreement in which Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member - says it wants a guarantee that a hard border will not be put up after Brexit. A European Commission spokesman said there was ""no white smoke yet"" on Brexit negotiations. Disagreements remain over how the Irish border should be treated after Brexit With Brexit, the UK is leaving the EU's customs union - but Transport Secretary Chris  Grayling said this did not mean there would need to be a physical border with people carrying out border checks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the transport secretary said people had misunderstood the key term ""regulatory alignment"" which has been the focus of the debate. Some Eurosceptics who do not want to keep close ties to Brussels fear this could hamper the UK's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. But Mr Grayling, a key Leave campaigner in the 2016 referendum, said: ""We don't have to have, and we've never said we will, and we don't want, to have a situation where in future our laws are identical to the European Union. ""There will be areas where we do do things in a very similar way, there will be areas in which we don't do things in the a very similar way and that's all the PM was seeking to ensure - to make sure trade flows as freely as possible across the border."" He added: ""I remain absolutely optimistic that we will reach  a successful point, we will move on to the trade talks, because ultimately it is in everybody's interests for that to happen."" The BBC's Adam Fleming said that following an update from chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday, EU member states agreed there must be clarity within 48 hours for them to have enough time to consult with their capitals about draft guidelines for phase two of the talks. At the 14-15 December summit, European leaders will decide whether enough progress has been made in the negotiations on Ireland, the UK's ""divorce bill"" and citizens' rights so far to open trade talks. On Wednesday the Republic of Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he expected Theresa May to come up with a new wording aimed at satisfying all parties, adding: ""I expressed my willingness to consider that."" A European Commission spokesman said on Thursday that things have to be sorted this week, adding: ""Our week includes Sunday."" As well as trying to appease the DUP, Dublin and Brussels, Theresa May also needs Conservative MPs to back whatever solution she puts forward. But not all of them agree - and the pressure on the prime minister was underlined on Wednesday when 19 Tory MPs who back a ""soft Brexit"" wrote to her saying it was ""highly irresponsible"" for anyone to dictate terms which may scupper a deal. This followed Eurosceptic MPs urging her to lay down new red lines before agreeing to hand over any money. Don't bow to Brexit conditions, May urged Brexit: All you need to know In the latest letter, the 19 MPs - who largely backed Remain in the 2016 referendum - say they support the PM's handling of the negotiations, in particular the ""political and practical difficulties"" relating to the Irish border. But they hit out at what they say are attempts by some in their party to paint a no-deal scenario in which the UK failed to agree a trade agreement as ""some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt"". The MPs included former cabinet ministers Stephen Crabb, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan. That's the suggestion from a House of Lords committee, which says a ""time-limited extension of the UK's EU membership"" would ""buy time"" for a deal to be reached. The committee doubts exit negotiations will be completed by the scheduled departure date of March 2019. The UK is due to leave the EU at this point because Theresa May formally triggered a two-year countdown to Brexit in March 2017. The government does not agree, and says it is confident negotiations can be completed by March 2019. But the Lords committee says: ""The overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that this will be impossible. ""If buying a bit more time means that we get a better outcome, which benefits businesses and citizens on both sides, a short extension of EU membership may be a price worth paying.""

"The number of long A&E waits across the UK has more than doubled in the past four years as hospitals struggle to cope with demand, BBC analysis shows. Northern Ireland has the worst performance, although England has seen the fastest deterioration, the figures show. Over 3m patients who visited UK A&Es waited over four hours in the past 12 months - up by 120% since 2012-13. By comparison the number of visits has only risen by just over 7% to 26.9m.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Doctors and nurses said the findings showed the NHS could no longer cope with what was being asked of it and patients were being put at risk. And Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the A&E system had been ""stretched to its very limits"". ""Staff are working really hard. But we've reached a point where we cannot meet demand. ""Life-threatening cases are prioritised. But a crowded emergency department adds risk. We get delays to assessment, pain relief and antibiotics."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies agreed, describing the situation as ""intolerable"" and A&E units as ""full to bursting"". ""Nursing staff in A&E units have been telling us it's hard for them to do more than firefight,"" she added. The data compiled by the BBC shows a significant difference in performance against the four-hour target for treating or admitting patients. In Northern Ireland, which has seen the biggest rise in people coming to A&E units, just 75% of patients were seen in four hours in 2016-17, whereas Scotland saw 93.9% - only marginally lower than the 95% target. In fact Scotland is the only part of the UK performing better than it was four years ago. England has seen the biggest rise in long waiters - a 155% increase. In Scotland the number of long waiters actually fell by 9%. Regionally in England the West Midlands has the worst performance followed by the North West - patients visiting A&Es in those areas are more than twice as likely to wait over four hours than those in the North East, the best-performing region. There are minor variations in the way the target is measured across the four nations, although they are considered broadly comparable. NI emergency departments among slowest Scottish A&E bucks trend on long waits A&E visits top one million a year mark in Wales The BBC has been speaking to a number of hospital staff this week about their experiences. Many wanted to remain anonymous given the political sensitivity about the performance of the health service. But all agreed the pressures were as great as they had ever experienced. One nurse, who works in an A&E unit in south Wales, said his department faced relentless ""24/7"" pressure. ""I know of colleagues who leave a shift and then come back the next day and find the patient is still there. We have seen them in A&E but there are not beds in hospital. It causes overcrowding and all sorts of delays. ""Ambulances queue outside A&Es as the staff are too busy to take patients off them. I've worked in A&Es for over 10 years and this is as bad as I can remember."" Another nurse, from London, said: ""You feel you are failing patients. This is not the sort of care we want to provide, or patients deserve. ""We obviously prioritise the most serious cases, but when it is this busy there is always a risk you miss something. I sometimes finish my shift and end up worrying about my patients."" Patients have also been contacting the BBC. One of those was Hayley Hughes, who waited over five-and-a-half hours at an A&E unit in Wales after sustaining a head injury. ""I kept falling asleep, which worried my partner. ""There was another couple we were speaking to who had got to A&E about an hour before we did, and they were still waiting when we left. I'd say they were there for about six-and-a-half, maybe seven hours. ""It's ridiculous. Whilst I was being assessed you could see the strain on the faces of the staff."" Unless the NHS can get its existing network of hospitals to see patients more quickly, the health service would need another 20 A&Es staffed by at least 170 consultants to hit the target again. But each nation believes the answer to the problem lies in trying to control the numbers turning up at A&E and ensuring they pass through hospital more quickly when they do need treatment by freeing up beds. This is done by making sure there are spare beds in care homes and care services in the community, to hand over frail patients to. In Scotland, for example, NHS budgets have been pooled with council funds to create a closer working relationship between hospitals and care in the community, which is one of the reasons why ministers there believe they have performed better than the rest of the UK. In England an extra Â£1bn is being invested in social care this year, while Â£435m has been freed up to help with winter planning, including putting GPs in A&Es to deal with the more minor cases. A Department of Health spokesman said ministers acknowledge the NHS was ""under pressure due to the ageing population"", but he pointed out that despite the deterioration, nine in 10 patients were still dealt with in four hours.

"This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace The BBC's Barbara Plett Usher looks at key takeaways of US President Donald Trump's policy shift on the status of Jerusalem. Less than a month ago the Palestinians' top diplomat in Washington was telling me he thought President Trump might succeed at peacemaking where others had failed. In every meeting Trump confirmed he would ""give his heart and soul"" to this process, said Husam Zomlot, the Palestine Liberation Organisation's (PLO) representative. It was an optimistic reading of a frequently rocky process. But there was enough in the efforts of Mr Trump's peace envoys to give the Palestinians a sense that their relationship with the White House was on an upward trajectory. Palestinian officials have now dropped the idea to live-stream Bethlehem Christmas celebrations on Capitol Hill Building off the momentum, Mr Zomlot organised a Christmas party on Capitol Hill with a guest list that included members of congress and government officials. The idea was to live-stream Bethlehem Christmas celebrations into the political heart of America. When the PLO mission got a late-breaking heads up about the decision on Jerusalem it cancelled the event,saying it would be unsuitable after an ""announcement that runs counter to the message of peace"",external. The fact that the Palestinians, and reportedly Arab leaders, were largely taken by surprise is only one sign that the decision was not part of a wider Middle East strategy. There's been speculation that Mr Trump was trying to shake things up as a tactic to prepare the ground for peace talks. But there's far more evidence he was simply focused on keeping a campaign promise to pro-Israel American Jews and evangelical Christians in his political base. According to multiple reports, Mr Trump was frustrated by continued opposition from his national security team, which gathered last Monday to discuss options on the embassy waiver. That comes up every six months when the US is required by law to either move the American embassy from Tel Aviv or waive the congressional demand on security grounds. US officials said he agreed to sign the waiver only with the promise of recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and launching a process to move the embassy. ""While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise,"" Mr Trump declared triumphantly in his speech, ""they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering."" World reacts to Trump move on Jerusalem Mike Pence watches (right), as Donald Trump holds up his proclamation on Jerusalem's policy The face of Mike Pence beaming over Mr Trump's shoulder during the announcement said it all. The vice-president was an influential voice in convincing Mr Trump to follow through on his campaign promise, and this illustrates the political power of hardline Christian evangelicals who fervently support Israel. That was not lost on Palestinian legislator and Christian Hanan Ashrawi. ""My god did not tell me what his god tells him,"" she spat out in an interview with the BBC. ""We are the original Christians, we are the owners of the land, we are the people who've been here for centuries. How dare they come here and give me biblical treatises and absolutist positions!"" Incidentally, the enterprising Mr Zomlot tried to play the Christian card with his Bethlehem-themed Capitol Hill reception, and has told activists the motto ""Jesus is a gift from Palestine"" might help translate the Palestinian message to Christian America. Mr Trump's announcement has triggered a strong reaction from Arab allies. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Jerusalem is holy land, not simply a disputed capital, meaning that Arab leaders will be less inclined to take pragmatic approaches they might ultimately adopt on other core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As custodians of Islam's holy sites, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have issued warnings that this move could inflame the Muslim world. Why settlement issue is so difficult But the Arab revolutions have shifted priorities away from the Palestinian cause towards containing Iran, especially among the Gulf states. For that they have formed a quiet intelligence co-operation with Israel, and need Mr Trump onside. If the Gulf Arab leaders make a lot of noise over Jerusalem but take no action, it will be further proof of a new Middle East. At the end of the day the question is not really whether Israel's capital is West Jerusalem, but whether occupied East Jerusalem will be the capital of a Palestinian state. Mr Trump left open that possibility by saying the administration was not taking a position on the final status of the holy city, ""including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders"". That seemed to imply the Palestinian claim to East Jerusalem would still be on the table in any negotiations. But he didn't spell that out, nor did he clearly state that the end goal was two states. Instead, he said the US would support such a solution if agreed to by both sides: not the unequivocal endorsement the Palestinians were looking for. Ultimately he didn't offer the Palestinians anything, and the speech came across as an endorsement of Israel. The alternatives to a two-state solution Mr Trump has claimed that recognising Jerusalem will advance the peace process. But it is far more likely that he has sabotaged his own peace initiative. This will almost certainly embolden those on the Israeli right adamantly opposed to a Palestinian state and territorial concessions in Jerusalem. And it will make it much harder for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to enter negotiations. Trump administration officials indicated they would continue working on the peace plan and wait for the dust to settle - it's not ready yet, so there's time for the Palestinians to reject the process and then reconsider. But Mr Trump has also plunged the US into the dispute over Jerusalem. That's an uncomfortable, perhaps untenable, position for a mediator to hold.

"Headlines in Arab and Turkish newspapers are crowded with strident criticism and expressions of dismay in response to President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Those in the Israeli press welcome the move, saying it should never have taken decades to happen. ""Thank you Mr President for this brave and historic decision. Thank you for applying your famous common sense to such a critical declaration on such a crucial issue,"" says one commentator in the Israeli newspaper, Yisrael Hayom.Â Â Another, in Maariv, says Trump ""broke the fear barrier"". ""It is time to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,â says Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth ""Trump is right: The world's refusal of 70 years to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel has been a stupid mistake,"" says a commentator in Yedioth Ahronoth. ""The claim that the speech harms the peace process is untenable, because there is no peace process."" The paper printed the full text of Mr Trump's speech, dubbing it ""The Jerusalem Declaration"" - echoing the 1917 Balfour Declaration, which expressed the British government's support for a Jewish national home in Palestine and paved the way for Israel's creation. ""Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and in the same breath watered down the American commitment to the two-state solution,"" says an editorial in theÂ broadsheet Haaretz.Â ""It is clear that America will not 'rescue Israel from itself' and will not bring about the end of the occupation."" The view from the Palestinian territories is rather different. A headline in the Palestinian Authority-owned newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadidah calls the US move the ""slap of the century"". Palestinian Al-Hayat al-Jadidah featured the announcement prominently on its front cover AnÂ editorial in the paper warns that ""the gates of hell will be opened in the region"",Â echoing a statement made by the Islamist group Hamas. There are also calls for effective and measured responses. ""Why should we not launch a calm intifada (uprising) and return to long-lasting negotiations?"" asks one commentator in the pro-Fatah Al-Ayyam newspaper. ""It would be better for us to wager on our political achievements and not on a third intifada."" A commentator in the pro-Hamas biweekly Al-Risalah echoes this: ""We should reject the US and Israeli pressure, and move to enhance Palestinian national reconciliation until we achieve national unity. The least we can do is to concentrate all our energies and to overcome our differences in order to protect Jerusalem and reject the new US decision.""Â ""For you, the city of prayer, I pray"" - Al Jazeera responded to the speech by showing the Fairouz song, FlowerÂ Among Cities The main Arab TV news channels are runningÂ special coverage of the announcement, reporting on the international reaction and reflecting on Jerusalem's placeÂ in Arab culture.Â An evocative song by the well-known Lebanese singer Fairouz,Â FlowerÂ Among Cities, has been played by some channels, including Al Jazeera.Â In it Fairouz sings about the loss of Jerusalem, and about the Palestinians' hope that they will one day return to it.Â Al Arabiya TV showed footage of a Christmas tree with its lights turned off in Ramallah At the top of its morning bulletin, the Saudi-funded Al Arabiya TV cited the kingdom's official response expressing its ""deep regret"" over Mr Trump's decision and urging his administration to reconsider.Â It highlighted demonstrations and strikes being held by Palestinians and reported that the lights on Bethlehem's Christmas tree had been switched off in protest.

"Some capitals - like Nay Pyi Taw in Myanmar - feel quite distant from their people All eyes are on Jerusalem, which US President Donald Trump has officially recognised as Israel's capital despite warnings not to do so from within and beyond the Arab world. The city - home to holy sites for Jews, Christians and Muslims - is a unique and symbolic place, and its status is one of the key issues that divide Israel and the Palestinians. Jerusalem is Israel's declared capital and seat of government, but no other country has recognised it officially as so until now. But the discord over the US decision raises questions about what capital cities represent, and why they are located where they are. Here are four reasons: The word ""capital"" originates from the Latin capitalis, meaning ""of the head"". As the city at the head of the territory, it is linked to the state and hosts the seat of government and, if they exist, usually royalty too. The capital needs to be protected, but also able to exert control and project unity. For that reason many capitals are built in the centre of countries - they need to be seen as representative and accessible. Madrid is located at almost the dead centre of the Iberian peninsula, while Abuja, which became Nigeria's official capital in 1991, was built as a brand new, geographically central city to signify the unity of a nation divided along religious and geographic lines. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Likewise, Brazil moved its capital from coastal, crowded Rio de Janeiro to inland Brasilia in 1961 - the idea being to build a brand new capital ""to bring progress to the interior of Brazil"", as architect Oscar Niemeyer described it. Brasilia: Does it work as a city? Unlike the deeply divided Washington of today, the founding of the US capital in Washington DC in 1790 was grounded in political compromise. Alexander Hamilton and the northern states wanted the federal government to take on states' debts and struck a deal with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who wanted the capital in the South. George Washington chose the exact spot on the Potomac River and the rest is history. Canberra is Australia's 'Bush Capital' - as the licence plates will tell you In Australia, curious tourists are often shocked to find Sydney is not actually the capital city, and usually told the inland city of Canberra was built as the ""bush capital"" as a compromise somewhere between Australia's largest city and its competitor to the south, Melbourne. Some historians say, however, that this is not exactly true, and that the scorching heat in Sydney and Melbourne in summer is one of major reasons that cool Canberra was chosen. Australia debates 'city to visit' Canberra ""The most significant reason, which all politicians agreed with at the time, was that whites could only really thrive and lead by living in a cold climate,"" historian David Headon told the Australian Geographic. Berlin or Bonn? That was the question when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 and Germany reunified and had to decide on a capital. During the years of Cold War division, Bonn was the capital of West Germany and east Berlin was the capital of East Germany (the German Democratic Republic). Today, few of the travellers thronging Berlin's nightclubs and taking pictures of the wall's colourful remnants may know about Bonn - but the decision on which two cities became the capital actually came down to just a few votes in the Bundestag on 20 June 1991. Berlin triumphed with 337 votes to Bonn's 320. They could all be in Bonn... And while Germans fought over two prospective capitals, South Africa actually has three. The branches of government are split between Cape Town (legislative), Pretoria (administrative) and Bloemfontein (judiciary), though the Constitutional Court is in Johannesburg. This dates back to the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910 after four British colonies were unified and agreement could not be reached on where the capital would be located. In 1994, after apartheid ended, there was a movement for a new capital to be created Ã  la Canberra or Brasilia - to allow a fresh start, but this never happened. Astana - which became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997 - is a gleaming futuristic playground and a totem to the ambitions of authoritarian president Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled since 1991. Among the landmarks are the Palace of Peace and Harmony - a concrete and glass pyramid designed by Norman Foster that boasts a 1,500-seat opera venue. This windswept city in the frozen steppe was briefly called Akmola but changed to Astana because the former means ""white grave"". The pyramid that reveals Kazakhstan's ambitions Astana - one man's dream city Another country - Myanmar (formerly Burma) - also has a remote capital city, and its one is four times the size of London. Nay Pyi Taw was built in 2005 as an isolated refuge for the paranoid military government, at a time before the country began its rocky transition to democracy. The huge capital has everything - huge roads, a zoo and golf courses - but few people. Why Jerusalem matters. Video, 00:02:03Why Jerusalem matters Brasilia: Does it work as a city?

"Marie Brown and Noel Brown were found dead on 4 December A father who was found strangled along with his adult daughter at his London home was a convicted sex offender, police have said. Noel Brown, 69, and Marie Brown, 41, were found in Deptford on Monday. Police said a link to the 1999 sex attack was an ""obvious line of inquiry"" but they had no evidence that revenge was the motive for the murders. They also revealed Mr Brown's attacker had tried to dismember his body. No arrests have been made. Police have stepped up patrols in the area following the murders. Police say Noel Brown had been to a betting shop on the last day he was seen alive The bodies were found after Ms Brown's family reported her missing when she failed to come home after going to check on her father. Police said Mr Brown had served a long prison sentence for the sex attack. Det Supt Paul Monk said there were ""no signs of forced entry to the property"" and police were trying to establish ""if the suspects or suspects were known to Noel and if Marie disturbed them."" Post-mortem examinations found she and her father died as a result of strangulation. Det Supt Paul Monk said it was ""a deeply distressing time for Noel and Marie's family as they come to terms with their loss."" He said Mr Brown was ""well known and liked locally"" and was last seen alive on 30 November in his local betting shop, Paddy Power, in Deptford High Street. ""There has been speculation that his murder was as a result of a large gambling win, however at this time there is no evidence to suggest this was the case,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Brexit: Boris Johnson defends 'go whistle' remark Boris Johnson has been defending his much quoted jibe that the EU could ""go whistle"" over the Brexit bill. The UK and EU are widely believed to have now agreed a deal which will see the UK paying up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). But the foreign secretary said he had been referring, in July, to reports the UK could face a 100bn euro bill. He spoke as talks continue about the remaining sticking point in the initial phase of Brexit talks - what happens at the Northern Ireland border. Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit discussion looming for PM Reality Check: Why border arguments delay Brexit deal Brexit protests and new mural in Belfast The foreign secretary said - at a question and answer session after a speech on global terrorism - that whatever was agreed must be ""consistent with taking back control of our laws, of our borders and our cash"". His ""go whistle"" comment was made in a response in the House of Commons to Conservative backbencher Philip Hollobone: This video can not be played Boris Johnson's message to the EU: ""Go whistle seems to me to be an entirely appropriate expression"" Mr Johnson said he had been ""teased"" about it since, but at the time he had been ""asked my reaction to some of the very extortionate sums that I had heard, in the region of Â£80bn or Â£100bn"". He said that on detailed examination of financial obligations ""the British government is absolutely punctilious in wanting to meet our friends more than halfway and to be useful. ""The financial offer we are making is very good but it is nowhere near the sums that I was first invited to comment on, in a musical way."" The government says it is ""optimistic"" about finding a solution to the key sticking point - an agreement on the Irish border. The government needs to get everyone onside on the issue in the coming days for Brexit negotiations to move forwards. This video can not be played Chris Grayling: I'm optimistic about deal The UK, which is due to leave the EU in March 2019, wants to open talks on a new free trade deal as soon as possible. But the EU will only agree to this when enough progress has been made on the ""separation issues""  - the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border - that have been the subject of negotiations so far. So the UK is trying to settle the Northern Ireland border issue before EU leaders meet next week. This video can not be played Arlene Foster claimed the Irish government prevented the DUP seeing the wording of the text On Monday, the DUP - whose support Prime Minister Theresa May needs to win key votes at Westminster - objected to draft plans drawn up by the UK and the EU. The DUP said the proposals, which aimed to avoid border checks by aligning regulations on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, were not acceptable. The party has said it will not accept any agreement in which Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member - says it wants a guarantee that a hard border will not be put up after Brexit. A European Commission spokesman said there was ""no white smoke yet"" on Brexit negotiations. Disagreements remain over how the Irish border should be treated after Brexit With Brexit, the UK is leaving the EU's customs union - but Transport Secretary Chris  Grayling said this did not mean there would need to be a physical border with people carrying out border checks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the transport secretary said people had misunderstood the key term ""regulatory alignment"" which has been the focus of the debate. Some Eurosceptics who do not want to keep close ties to Brussels fear this could hamper the UK's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. But Mr Grayling, a key Leave campaigner in the 2016 referendum, said: ""We don't have to have, and we've never said we will, and we don't want, to have a situation where in future our laws are identical to the European Union. ""There will be areas where we do do things in a very similar way, there will be areas in which we don't do things in the a very similar way and that's all the PM was seeking to ensure - to make sure trade flows as freely as possible across the border."" He added: ""I remain absolutely optimistic that we will reach  a successful point, we will move on to the trade talks, because ultimately it is in everybody's interests for that to happen."" The BBC's Adam Fleming said that following an update from chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday, EU member states agreed there must be clarity within 48 hours for them to have enough time to consult with their capitals about draft guidelines for phase two of the talks. At the 14-15 December summit, European leaders will decide whether enough progress has been made in the negotiations on Ireland, the UK's ""divorce bill"" and citizens' rights so far to open trade talks. On Wednesday the Republic of Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he expected Theresa May to come up with a new wording aimed at satisfying all parties, adding: ""I expressed my willingness to consider that."" A European Commission spokesman said on Thursday that things have to be sorted this week, adding: ""Our week includes Sunday."" As well as trying to appease the DUP, Dublin and Brussels, Theresa May also needs Conservative MPs to back whatever solution she puts forward. But not all of them agree - and the pressure on the prime minister was underlined on Wednesday when 19 Tory MPs who back a ""soft Brexit"" wrote to her saying it was ""highly irresponsible"" for anyone to dictate terms which may scupper a deal. This followed Eurosceptic MPs urging her to lay down new red lines before agreeing to hand over any money. Don't bow to Brexit conditions, May urged Brexit: All you need to know In the latest letter, the 19 MPs - who largely backed Remain in the 2016 referendum - say they support the PM's handling of the negotiations, in particular the ""political and practical difficulties"" relating to the Irish border. But they hit out at what they say are attempts by some in their party to paint a no-deal scenario in which the UK failed to agree a trade agreement as ""some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt"". The MPs included former cabinet ministers Stephen Crabb, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan. That's the suggestion from a House of Lords committee, which says a ""time-limited extension of the UK's EU membership"" would ""buy time"" for a deal to be reached. The committee doubts exit negotiations will be completed by the scheduled departure date of March 2019. The UK is due to leave the EU at this point because Theresa May formally triggered a two-year countdown to Brexit in March 2017. The government does not agree, and says it is confident negotiations can be completed by March 2019. But the Lords committee says: ""The overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that this will be impossible. ""If buying a bit more time means that we get a better outcome, which benefits businesses and citizens on both sides, a short extension of EU membership may be a price worth paying.""

"Lavinia Woodward had ambitions to become a surgeon An ""extraordinary"" University of Oxford student who avoided jail for stabbing her boyfriend is trying to appeal against her suspended sentence. Lavinia Woodward, 24, pleaded guilty to unlawful wounding at Christ Church college after drinking heavily. Judge Ian Pringle QCsuspended her 10-month jail sentenceand at an earlier hearing said he believed immediate custody would damage her career. She has now applied for permission to take her case to the Court of Appeal. The case prompted a debate about inequality in the criminal justice system after Judge Pringle deferred her sentence to give her a chance to prove she was no longer addicted to drugs and alcohol. He had described Woodward as ""an extraordinarily able young lady"" and said sending her to prison would damage her hopes of becoming a surgeon. Inhis sentencing remarks,externalhe said there were ""many mitigating features"" of the case, and she had shown ""a strong and unwavering determination"" to rid herself of her addictions. Woodward has voluntarily suspended her studies at Oxford until the end of her sentence, when she will face a disciplinary procedure if she decides to return. Woodward stabbed her then boyfriend in the leg with a breadknife Oxford Crown Court heard Woodward attacked her then boyfriend, whom she met on dating app Tinder, while he was visiting in December 2016. She became angry when he contacted her mother on Skype when he realised she had been drinking. She threw a laptop at him and stabbed him in the lower leg with a breadknife, also injuring two of his fingers. Woodward then tried to stab herself with the knife before he disarmed her. Judge Pringle said Woodward faced a possible maximum sentence of three years in prison for a ""category two"" offence of unlawful wounding. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office (JCIO)rejected three complaintsagainst Judge Pringle in connection with the case. A judge must now look at Woodward's application and decide whether to grant her permission to appeal.

"This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace Traditional US allies are among a growing chorus condemning President Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Saudi Arabia called it ""unjustified and irresponsible"", while France and the UK said they did not support the decision. But Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hailed it as ""historic"" and said he was sure more countries would follow suit. President Trump's move reversed decades of US policy on one of the thorniest issues between Israel and Palestinians. Hundreds of Israeli troops have been deployed to the West Bank amid a day of protests and strikes by Palestinians. The Islamist group Hamas has called for a new intifada, or uprising. This video can not be played Clashes broke out in Bethlehem Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called for support from the UN Security Council and the Arab League, both of which will hold emergency sessions in the coming days. The US president said on Wednesday that he had ""determined it is time to officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel"".,external ""I've judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians,"" he said. Mr Trump said he was directing the US state department to begin preparations to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Palestinians defaced a picture of Donald Trump painted on the Israeli separation wall in Bethlehem Despite warnings of regional unrest over any such move, the decision fulfils a campaign promise and appeals to Mr Trump's right-wing base. Recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital was ""nothing more or less than a recognition of reality"", he added. ""It is also the right thing to do."" Trump's speech in full Five key takeaways from speech How are capital cities chosen? Mr Trump said the US would support a two-state solution - shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel - ""if agreed to by both sides"". The president also refrained from using Israel's description of Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided capital"". The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of any future Palestinian state. Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was profoundly grateful to Mr Trump, who had ""bound himself forever with the history of the capital"". He also said Israel was ""in touch with other countries to follow suit. I have no doubt other embassies will move to Jerusalem - the time has come."" He did not name any of these countries, although the Philippines and the Czech Republic have been singled out in Israeli media. The Republican Jewish Coalition thanked the president in a New York Times ad.,external The mood was very different on the Palestinian side, with a day of strikes and protests planned. The leader of the Islamist movement Hamas, which dominates Gaza, called for a ""day of rage"" on Friday and said it should ""be the first day of the intifada against the occupier"". ""We have given instructions to all Hamas members and to all its wings to be fully ready for any new instructions or orders that may be given to confront this strategic danger,"" Ismail Haniya said. This video can not be played Palestinians and Israelis react to US plan to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital Meanwhile, Mr Abbas' rival Fatah movement is seeking to protest through diplomatic means, by filing a complaint to the UN Security Council and pushing for a strong stance by the Arab League.

""What do you want to do Mr Trump? What kind of an approach is this? Political leaders exist not to create struggles but to make peace,"" he said. Top Iraqi Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani said the move ""hurt the feelings of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims"". Which countries condemned Trump's move? The Saudi royal court said it ""represents a significant decline in efforts to push a peace process and is a violation of the historically neutral American position on Jerusalem"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said it was ""a moment of great anxiety"". ""There is no alternative to the two-state solution,"" he stressed. In other reaction: British Prime Minister Theresa May said she disagreed with the US decision, which was ""unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region"" French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both said their countries did not support the move EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini voiced ""serious concern"" Mr Trump's announcement puts the US at odds with the rest of the international community's view on Jerusalem's status.

"This video can not be played Gavin Williamson: ""We want to drive them out of Iraq and Syria"" The UK will ""bring destruction"" to those who fight for so-called Islamic State, the defence secretary has said. Gavin Williamson said British armed forces were ""making sure terrorists have nowhere to hide"" across the globe. Speaking at the commissioning of theaircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabethin Portsmouth, he said UK forces were driving IS out of Iraq and Syria. He earlier told theDaily Mail,external: ""Quite simply, my view is a dead terrorist can't cause any harm to Britain."" Mr Williamson had said no British citizen who has fought for so-called Islamic State should be allowed back into the UK. At least 800 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight for IS and 130 of those have been killed in conflict. British IS fighters must be killed, minister says British jihadist Jones 'killed by drone' Who are Britainâs jihadists? Mr Williamson, who took over as defence secretary last month, said the Â£3.1bn carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth was ""part of our armoury"" in dealing with terrorism. ""We will be able to deploy her any place in the globe,"" he said. ""We will destroy and bring destruction to these evil death corps such as Daesh and that's what British forces have continuously been doing."" He said it was important for the UK to tackle terrorism in ""ungoverned spaces"" abroad, after forces had spent the last few years driving jihadists from Iraq and Syria. ""We've also got to be realistic, as where we have taken territory from them: Where are they going to go? Where are they going to try and strike Britain next?"" he said. Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, was killed by an RAF airstrike in Syria Speaking to the Mail, Mr Williamson said British fighters who had fled to other countries would be found and stopped from returning to the UK, adding that there would be no ""safe space"" abroad for them either. ""We have got to make sure that as (they) splinter and as they disperse across Iraq and Syria and other areas, we continue to hunt them down,"" he said. This video can not be played Killing all jihadists is ""not a serious grown up policy response"", says Lord Macdonald Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, said suggesting dead terrorists could not cause any harm to Britain was a ""juvenile response"". ""We can't simply say that everyone who has gone to Iraq will be hunted down and killed,"" he told BBC Radio 4'sThe World at Oneprogramme. Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? Mr Williamson's predecessor Sir Michael Fallon said in October that British IS fighters in Syria and Iraq had made themselves ""a legitimate target"" who could end up on ""the wrong end of an RAF or USAF missile"". His comments came after it was reported that British IS recruiter Sally-Anne Jones had been killed in a US drone strike in Syria in June. And Rory Stewart, the minister for international development, said the ""only way"" to deal with British IS fighters in Syria is ""in almost every case"" to kill them. He said they can expect to be killed because of the ""serious danger"" they pose to the UK's security. Max Hill QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, said there should be some allowance for ""young and naive"" individuals who were ""simply brainwashed"", for example as teenagers, but insisted that even these people should be prosecuted if they committed serious criminal offences. Reyaad Khan, pictured left, appeared in IS propaganda videos By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent Under British and international law, an aspiration to eliminate all known British IS recruits will take a little more consideration than simply launching a drone laden with fire-and-forget missiles. In war, soldiers have immunity from prosecution for killing on the battlefield, unless they have committed a war crime. But the UK is not at war with the IS network - so the same immunity is not automatically available for counter-terrorism purposes. There has to be some other legal basis for justifying the killing. Two years ago, the government sent a three-paragraph letter to the United Nations Security Council setting outthe case for killing Cardiff extremist Reyaad Khan. That strike was legal under the ""inherent right of self-defence"", it said, because the 21-year-old had been directing ""imminent armed attacks"". MPs have pushed for more information on the decision-making process, that some critics say could amount to an unreviewable secret power to launch ""extra-judicial executions.""

"Ian Paterson is serving a 20-year sentence for wounding patients An independent inquiry is to be held into the malpractice of breast surgeon Ian Paterson, who carried out hundreds of botched operations. It will aim to learn lessons from the case and improve care, the Department of Health said. Paterson was found guilty of 17 counts of wounding with intent in April after a trial at Nottingham Crown Court. Hehad his initial 15-year jail term increased to 20 years in August. The inquiry will begin in January. Midlands Live: Police boss admits Official Secrets Act charge; GE cuts 1,000 jobs The DoH said the scope of the inquiry was likely to consider: The responsibility for the quality of care in the independent sector Information sharing, reporting of activity and raising concerns between the independent sector and the NHS The role of insurers of independent sector healthcare providers, including how data it holds about the scope and volume of work carried out by doctors is shared with the sector Health Minister Philip Dunne said: ""Ian Paterson's malpractice sent shockwaves across the health system due to the seriousness and extent of his crimes, and I am determined to make sure lessons are learnt from this.""

His sentence was increased by Court of Appeal judges who found his initial sentence was unduly lenient. One of Paterson's victims, James Fernihough, welcomed news of the inquiry, but said: ""I think it's a bit late, it should have been looked into a long time ago."" Mr Fernihough, 43, of Wall Heath, West Midlands,who had three lumpectomies in 12 months but later learned the procedures were unnecessary, added: ""This should never happen again.""

"This video can not be played The Queen commissions aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth The Queen has officially welcomed the UK's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, at a ceremony to commission it into the Royal Navy fleet. The monarch boarded her namesake ship in Portsmouth to see the Royal Navy White Ensign raised on the vessel for the first time. Princess Anne, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones also attended. The ceremony took place on the giant hangar deck of the Â£3.1bn carrier. HMS Queen Elizabeth and its sister ship HMS Prince of Wales are the most expensive in the Royal Navy's history. HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed into Portsmouth in August following extensive preparations at the naval base. The navy initially estimated both ships would cost Â£3.5bn to build butthe total figure was revised to Â£6.2bn. Latest updates as HMS Queen Elizabeth enters service About 3,700 guests attended the event, which came more than three years after the vessel's official naming ceremony in Rosyth when the Queen broke a bottle of whisky on its hull. During the ceremony, the commissioning warrant was read, and the Blue Ensign, which has been flying from the ship until it is formally handed over to the Royal Navy, was replaced with the White Ensign, raised by 20-year-old Able Seaman Ellie Smith from Hull. Addressing the assembled guests and ship's company, The Queen described the ship as ""the most powerful and capable ship ever to raise the White Ensign"". ""At the forefront of these responsibilities will be the men and women of the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, supported by the Army, Royal Air Force and by coalition partners. ""As the daughter, wife and mother of naval officers, I recognise the unique demands our nation asks of you and I will always value my special link to HMS Queen Elizabeth, her ship's company and their families,"" she said. The White Ensign was raised to symbolised the ship's commissioning into the fleet Admiral Sir Philip Jones, said: ""We have been on a long, complicated - but committed - journey to get to this point and commissioning the ship is a key milestone. ""The point of the big grey ship is it's enormously big, flexible, capable and adaptable."" As part of the ceremony, a8ft-long (2.44m) cake replica of the shipwas cut. As is traditional, it was carried out by the youngest member of the ship's company - Callum Hui, 17 - and the captain's wife Dr Karen Kyd. Callum Hui and Dr Karen Kyd cut the cake at the commissioning of HMS Queen Elizabeth. By Jonathan Beale, Defence Correspondent This is a big day for the Royal Navy. A chance to look to the future and, at least for a moment, forget about recent defence cuts and fears of even more. After successfully completing her sea trials HMS Queen Elizabeth will be commissioned into service. For the first time she'll raise the White Ensign - officially becoming a Royal Navy Warship.  But, this is still another milestone not the end of her journey. Flight trials will begin next year and her first proper deployment with jets on board isn't planned until 2021. It's also still not clear how many of the new F35 jets she'll carry. Certainly fewer than the 36 she was built for, with each jet costing around Â£100m. The Royal Navy believes the carrier - the first of two - will be a potent symbol of British military power.  But it's already struggling with limited resources. Capt Jerry Kyd called the ceremony the ""culmination of a number of years of real excitement"". He said: ""The first sailing from Rosyth was only nine months ago, we have come a long way. ""The first entry into Portsmouth was in the summer and here we are today accepting the ship into Her Majesty's fleet formally.

"Tiririca has been in the Chamber of Deputies since 2011 A professional clown in Brazil who ran for congress and won by a huge margin says he will not stand again in 2018. Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, better known as Tiririca, is coming to the end of his second term in the Chamber of Deputies. He complained that he was one of only eight out of more than 500 lawmakers who regularly turned up to sessions. Tiririca said he was ""ashamed"" of his colleagues' behaviour and would return to being a full-time clown.

Campaigning under the slogan ""It can't get any worse"", he won 1.3 million votes in 2010, more than any other candidate in that election. Tiririca's campaign slogan was ""Vote Tiririca, it can't get worse!"" His win was not without controversy, with newspapers claiming he could not read or write, a legal requirement for holding office.

His sentence was increased by Court of Appeal judges who found his initial sentence was unduly lenient. One of Paterson's victims, James Fernihough, welcomed news of the inquiry, but said: ""I think it's a bit late, it should have been looked into a long time ago."" Mr Fernihough, 43, of Wall Heath, West Midlands,who had three lumpectomies in 12 months but later learned the procedures were unnecessary, added: ""This should never happen again.""

"This video can not be played Wildfires devastate southern California Nearly 200,000 residents have been evacuated from their homes in California as firefighters battle several raging wildfires. Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in San Diego on Thursday after a new blaze spread from 10 acres to 4,100 acres in just a few hours. Three firefighters have been injured and about 500 buildings destroyed. One death has been reported - a woman's body was found in a burned-out area in Ventura County. But an official told the Ventura Country Star newspaper that the death, in the town of Ojai, may have been the result of a car crash not related to the fire. California wildfire flames seen from space On Friday, US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency in California, which will free up funding to ""help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict on the local population"". About 5,700 firefighters have been battling the brushfires, officials have said, with firefighters drafted in from neighbouring states to help. The Thomas fire in Ventura County remains the largest, burning 180 square miles so far The Thomas fire in Ventura County to the north of Los Angeles remains the largest of the blazes and has spread as far as the Pacific coast. It has consumed 180 square miles (466 sq km) since it broke out on Monday, and destroyed more than 430 buildings, fire officials said. A BBC correspondent in Ojai says the blaze is burning in the hills all around and more than 100 fire engines have been seen driving through the town centre. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Brexit: Boris Johnson defends 'go whistle' remark Boris Johnson has been defending his much quoted jibe that the EU could ""go whistle"" over the Brexit bill. The UK and EU are widely believed to have now agreed a deal which will see the UK paying up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). But the foreign secretary said he had been referring, in July, to reports the UK could face a 100bn euro bill. He spoke as talks continue about the remaining sticking point in the initial phase of Brexit talks - what happens at the Northern Ireland border. Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit discussion looming for PM Reality Check: Why border arguments delay Brexit deal Brexit protests and new mural in Belfast The foreign secretary said - at a question and answer session after a speech on global terrorism - that whatever was agreed must be ""consistent with taking back control of our laws, of our borders and our cash"". His ""go whistle"" comment was made in a response in the House of Commons to Conservative backbencher Philip Hollobone: This video can not be played Boris Johnson's message to the EU: ""Go whistle seems to me to be an entirely appropriate expression"" Mr Johnson said he had been ""teased"" about it since, but at the time he had been ""asked my reaction to some of the very extortionate sums that I had heard, in the region of Â£80bn or Â£100bn"". He said that on detailed examination of financial obligations ""the British government is absolutely punctilious in wanting to meet our friends more than halfway and to be useful. ""The financial offer we are making is very good but it is nowhere near the sums that I was first invited to comment on, in a musical way."" The government says it is ""optimistic"" about finding a solution to the key sticking point - an agreement on the Irish border. The government needs to get everyone onside on the issue in the coming days for Brexit negotiations to move forwards. This video can not be played Chris Grayling: I'm optimistic about deal The UK, which is due to leave the EU in March 2019, wants to open talks on a new free trade deal as soon as possible. But the EU will only agree to this when enough progress has been made on the ""separation issues""  - the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border - that have been the subject of negotiations so far. So the UK is trying to settle the Northern Ireland border issue before EU leaders meet next week. This video can not be played Arlene Foster claimed the Irish government prevented the DUP seeing the wording of the text On Monday, the DUP - whose support Prime Minister Theresa May needs to win key votes at Westminster - objected to draft plans drawn up by the UK and the EU. The DUP said the proposals, which aimed to avoid border checks by aligning regulations on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, were not acceptable. The party has said it will not accept any agreement in which Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member - says it wants a guarantee that a hard border will not be put up after Brexit. A European Commission spokesman said there was ""no white smoke yet"" on Brexit negotiations. Disagreements remain over how the Irish border should be treated after Brexit With Brexit, the UK is leaving the EU's customs union - but Transport Secretary Chris  Grayling said this did not mean there would need to be a physical border with people carrying out border checks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the transport secretary said people had misunderstood the key term ""regulatory alignment"" which has been the focus of the debate. Some Eurosceptics who do not want to keep close ties to Brussels fear this could hamper the UK's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. But Mr Grayling, a key Leave campaigner in the 2016 referendum, said: ""We don't have to have, and we've never said we will, and we don't want, to have a situation where in future our laws are identical to the European Union. ""There will be areas where we do do things in a very similar way, there will be areas in which we don't do things in the a very similar way and that's all the PM was seeking to ensure - to make sure trade flows as freely as possible across the border."" He added: ""I remain absolutely optimistic that we will reach  a successful point, we will move on to the trade talks, because ultimately it is in everybody's interests for that to happen."" The BBC's Adam Fleming said that following an update from chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday, EU member states agreed there must be clarity within 48 hours for them to have enough time to consult with their capitals about draft guidelines for phase two of the talks. At the 14-15 December summit, European leaders will decide whether enough progress has been made in the negotiations on Ireland, the UK's ""divorce bill"" and citizens' rights so far to open trade talks. On Wednesday the Republic of Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he expected Theresa May to come up with a new wording aimed at satisfying all parties, adding: ""I expressed my willingness to consider that."" A European Commission spokesman said on Thursday that things have to be sorted this week, adding: ""Our week includes Sunday."" As well as trying to appease the DUP, Dublin and Brussels, Theresa May also needs Conservative MPs to back whatever solution she puts forward. But not all of them agree - and the pressure on the prime minister was underlined on Wednesday when 19 Tory MPs who back a ""soft Brexit"" wrote to her saying it was ""highly irresponsible"" for anyone to dictate terms which may scupper a deal. This followed Eurosceptic MPs urging her to lay down new red lines before agreeing to hand over any money. Don't bow to Brexit conditions, May urged Brexit: All you need to know In the latest letter, the 19 MPs - who largely backed Remain in the 2016 referendum - say they support the PM's handling of the negotiations, in particular the ""political and practical difficulties"" relating to the Irish border. But they hit out at what they say are attempts by some in their party to paint a no-deal scenario in which the UK failed to agree a trade agreement as ""some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt"". The MPs included former cabinet ministers Stephen Crabb, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan. That's the suggestion from a House of Lords committee, which says a ""time-limited extension of the UK's EU membership"" would ""buy time"" for a deal to be reached. The committee doubts exit negotiations will be completed by the scheduled departure date of March 2019. The UK is due to leave the EU at this point because Theresa May formally triggered a two-year countdown to Brexit in March 2017. The government does not agree, and says it is confident negotiations can be completed by March 2019. But the Lords committee says: ""The overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that this will be impossible. ""If buying a bit more time means that we get a better outcome, which benefits businesses and citizens on both sides, a short extension of EU membership may be a price worth paying.""

"This video can not be played 'We're preparing for the worst', says Standard Chartered boss Bill Winters The UK's ability to attract talent is already suffering, following the vote to leave the EU, according to the boss of the UK's fifth-largest bank. Standard Chartered is ""preparing for the worst"" from Brexit, chief executive Bill Winters told the BBC. The UK-headquartered bank is in the process of turning its Frankfurt branch into a subsidiary requiring additional capital, licences and staff. He said this was ""inconvenient and expensive"" and will damage London. ""London will take hits in the context of Brexitâ¦ I think big parts of the euro-denominated corporate banking business will be forced into Europe. ""It's possible that through the Brexit negotiations that there is some sort of extended passporting rule [ability of banks to sell services across Europe from a UK base] but none of us are expecting that quite frankly, or preparing for that. ""We have to prepare for the worstâ¦ let's hope for the best, but we're prepared for the worst."" Mr Winters said he would be happy to take the tens of millions of pounds he has spent on Brexit contingency planning and ""flush it down the toilet"" if it meant he could carry on as before and maintain the bank's current structure. The mood music from the UK has already affected the bank's ability to attract the best and brightest talent according to Mr Winters. ""We have already had some setbacks for the talent pool in London through the restriction on student visas. That's already a problem. ""Some of the best talent that we can have in the UK marketplace is coming from students that have chosen to study here and then stayed for some extended period afterwardsâ¦ We've noticed that's been impacted already. ""More through a sense from non-UK [people] that this might not be such a hospitable place any longer - it's more psychological than contractual."" Official numbers bear this out. After a decade of uninterrupted growth, applications from EU students for places at UK universities dropped by more than 7% last year, according to UCAS, even though their right to stay on and work is, as yet, unaffected. A Department for Education spokesperson said it was taking action to provide certainty for students. ""We have confirmed that EU students starting their courses in the academic year 18/19 or before will continue to be eligible for student loans and home fee status and will have a right to remain in the UK to complete their course,"" they added. Bill Winters says US President Donald Trump is wrong to allow China to grow its economic influence Standard Chartered is not a High Street bank here in the UK. It is probably best known here as Liverpool FC's shirt sponsor but it is a well-known financial brand in Asia, the Middle East and Africa and has a front row seat when it comes to financing global trade and investment. It provides advice and cash to grease the wheels of commerce within and between some of the world's fastest-growing markets. Former Wall Street banker Mr Winters is convinced the US under Donald Trump is making a big mistake in allowing China to grow its global economic influence in areas from which the US is retreating - as demonstrated when it dropped out of a trade mega deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. ""They're creating effectively a multi-regional trading bloc creating these markets in much the same way that the US and UK created markets in Europe after the Second World War during a period of so much devastation. ""They are creating markets where they will be less dependent on Europeâ¦the US is taking itself out of some of the key discussions for them and then actual trade agreements where the US could continue to have an extremely benevolent influence that it has had for decades. I think we have got to be extremely careful about that - and the UK does as well."" This video can not be played Bill Winters discusses the growing influence of China Mr Winters understands risk. He was part of a major report into the stability of the UK financial system commissioned by the government after the financial crisis. He believes the banks are much more secure than they were a decade ago but that has presented another type of risk. A lot of banks have seen their profitability, their earning power reduced. They have been forced to hold more shock-absorbing money in reserve and that has meant their earning power per pound of the capital they set aside has diminished. Meanwhile, technology companies are coming along and doing lots of the things banks like to charge for - like foreign exchange and making payments - and doing them more cheaply and conveniently. Many experts think banking's next crisis is the competition from nimble tech firms that don't have all the expense associated with being a bank. This is one reason why many banks' shares (including Standard Chartered) - are trading at roughly half the price they appear to be worth on paper. The idea that banks can't make enough money may seem perverse but any business that can't earn a sufficient return on the capital provided by investors is ultimately doomed as investors will take their capital away. Mr Winters, however, is confident that banks are here to stay. ""For my thirty five years in banking I've started every year with people saying there is some enormous competitive threat looming - and they are right - there always is. But if you serve your customers as best you can you will stay relevant"" 'We're preparing for the worst' Video, 00:03:05'We're preparing for the worst' Bank boss: US losing global influence.

"This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace The BBC's Barbara Plett Usher looks at key takeaways of US President Donald Trump's policy shift on the status of Jerusalem. Less than a month ago the Palestinians' top diplomat in Washington was telling me he thought President Trump might succeed at peacemaking where others had failed. In every meeting Trump confirmed he would ""give his heart and soul"" to this process, said Husam Zomlot, the Palestine Liberation Organisation's (PLO) representative. It was an optimistic reading of a frequently rocky process. But there was enough in the efforts of Mr Trump's peace envoys to give the Palestinians a sense that their relationship with the White House was on an upward trajectory. Palestinian officials have now dropped the idea to live-stream Bethlehem Christmas celebrations on Capitol Hill Building off the momentum, Mr Zomlot organised a Christmas party on Capitol Hill with a guest list that included members of congress and government officials. The idea was to live-stream Bethlehem Christmas celebrations into the political heart of America. When the PLO mission got a late-breaking heads up about the decision on Jerusalem it cancelled the event,saying it would be unsuitable after an ""announcement that runs counter to the message of peace"",external. The fact that the Palestinians, and reportedly Arab leaders, were largely taken by surprise is only one sign that the decision was not part of a wider Middle East strategy. There's been speculation that Mr Trump was trying to shake things up as a tactic to prepare the ground for peace talks. But there's far more evidence he was simply focused on keeping a campaign promise to pro-Israel American Jews and evangelical Christians in his political base. According to multiple reports, Mr Trump was frustrated by continued opposition from his national security team, which gathered last Monday to discuss options on the embassy waiver. That comes up every six months when the US is required by law to either move the American embassy from Tel Aviv or waive the congressional demand on security grounds. US officials said he agreed to sign the waiver only with the promise of recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and launching a process to move the embassy. ""While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise,"" Mr Trump declared triumphantly in his speech, ""they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering."" World reacts to Trump move on Jerusalem Mike Pence watches (right), as Donald Trump holds up his proclamation on Jerusalem's policy The face of Mike Pence beaming over Mr Trump's shoulder during the announcement said it all. The vice-president was an influential voice in convincing Mr Trump to follow through on his campaign promise, and this illustrates the political power of hardline Christian evangelicals who fervently support Israel. That was not lost on Palestinian legislator and Christian Hanan Ashrawi. ""My god did not tell me what his god tells him,"" she spat out in an interview with the BBC. ""We are the original Christians, we are the owners of the land, we are the people who've been here for centuries. How dare they come here and give me biblical treatises and absolutist positions!"" Incidentally, the enterprising Mr Zomlot tried to play the Christian card with his Bethlehem-themed Capitol Hill reception, and has told activists the motto ""Jesus is a gift from Palestine"" might help translate the Palestinian message to Christian America. Mr Trump's announcement has triggered a strong reaction from Arab allies. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Jerusalem is holy land, not simply a disputed capital, meaning that Arab leaders will be less inclined to take pragmatic approaches they might ultimately adopt on other core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As custodians of Islam's holy sites, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have issued warnings that this move could inflame the Muslim world. Why settlement issue is so difficult But the Arab revolutions have shifted priorities away from the Palestinian cause towards containing Iran, especially among the Gulf states. For that they have formed a quiet intelligence co-operation with Israel, and need Mr Trump onside. If the Gulf Arab leaders make a lot of noise over Jerusalem but take no action, it will be further proof of a new Middle East. At the end of the day the question is not really whether Israel's capital is West Jerusalem, but whether occupied East Jerusalem will be the capital of a Palestinian state. Mr Trump left open that possibility by saying the administration was not taking a position on the final status of the holy city, ""including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders"". That seemed to imply the Palestinian claim to East Jerusalem would still be on the table in any negotiations. But he didn't spell that out, nor did he clearly state that the end goal was two states. Instead, he said the US would support such a solution if agreed to by both sides: not the unequivocal endorsement the Palestinians were looking for. Ultimately he didn't offer the Palestinians anything, and the speech came across as an endorsement of Israel. The alternatives to a two-state solution Mr Trump has claimed that recognising Jerusalem will advance the peace process. But it is far more likely that he has sabotaged his own peace initiative. This will almost certainly embolden those on the Israeli right adamantly opposed to a Palestinian state and territorial concessions in Jerusalem. And it will make it much harder for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to enter negotiations. Trump administration officials indicated they would continue working on the peace plan and wait for the dust to settle - it's not ready yet, so there's time for the Palestinians to reject the process and then reconsider. But Mr Trump has also plunged the US into the dispute over Jerusalem. That's an uncomfortable, perhaps untenable, position for a mediator to hold.

"There is a ""stark"" increase between the ages of seven and 11 in the proportion of children in the UK who are overweight or obese, new data suggests. The study of nearly 12,000 children found 25% were overweight or obese at age seven, rising to 35% at 11. Between 11 and 14, there was little change, however, which researchers say may be because children of this age are making more of their own food choices. Campaigners are calling for more action on weight issues in younger children. Researchers from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) at the UCL Institute of Education analysed information on nearly 12,000 of the children taking part inthe Millennium Cohort Study,,externalwho were born in 2000 and 2001 and have had their weight and height measured at the ages of three, five, seven, 11 and 14. Rates of excess weight varied by nation, with nearly 40% of young people in Northern Ireland obese or overweight compared with 38% in Wales and 35% in both Scotland and England. The levels showed little change up to the age of seven, but then made a big jump in the next four years. At the age of seven, 25.5% of the boys were overweight or obese - but this proportion rose to 36.7% four years later. With the girls, 23.7% were carrying excess weight at seven - but 33.9% were overweight or obese at 11. However, at 14 the boys' proportion had dropped to 34.1%, while the girls' had risen slightly to 36.3%. The data, which was collected between January 2014 and March 2015, also revealed a link between young people's weight and their mothers' level of education. Nearly 40% of 14-year-olds whose mothers had no qualifications above GCSE level were overweight or obese, while the proportion was 26% among those whose mum had a degree or higher qualifications. Also, children who were breastfed as infants, and those whose parents owned their own home, had lower odds of carrying excess weight at 14. Reality Check: Why ban fast food within 400m of schools? Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads on family shows UK most overweight country in Western Europe, says OECD Child and teen obesity spreading across the globe Is UK among worst in Western Europe for child obesity? Dr Benedetta Pongiglione, co-author of the study, told the BBC that while it did not investigate the reasons for the levelling off in rising obesity in 11- to 14-year-olds, trends suggested why this had occurred. ""We know that that age of early to mid adolescence is a time where children start to make more decisions on their own, which can imply different... physical activity, diet and other choices,"" she said. ""Peer pressure also plays a bigger role in their lives. ""From what we observe, maybe the time between seven and 11 is when parents take most of the decisions."" Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, both called for restrictions or a 21:00 watershed on junk-food advertising. Prof Fewtrell said a range of measures should be considered, including ""statutory school-based health education in all schools and robust evaluation of the soft drinks and sugar reduction programme"". What is obesity (NHS Choices website)?,external Check your BMI (body mass index) Ms Cerny said it had to be made ""easier for families to make healthier choices"". She added: ""Children can see up to nine junk-food adverts in just 30 minutes while watching their favourite shows, and we know this influences their food choices and how much they eat."" Prof Emla Fitzsimons, another co-author of the study, said: ""Children who are overweight or obese face an increased risk of many health problems later in life, including cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. ""There is still a worryingly high proportion of young people in this generation who are an unhealthy weight."" The government has plans to try to cut childhood obesity, with a tax on sugary drinks coming into force on 1 April 2018. Independent think tank the Centre for Social Justice has suggested it follows the example of Amsterdam, which is the only European city to have lowered obesity rates in the past five years with a variety of programmes - mainly through schools. Childhood obesity rates have also fallen in New York after a poster campaign on the subway system.

"There is a ""stark"" increase between the ages of seven and 11 in the proportion of children in the UK who are overweight or obese, new data suggests. The study of nearly 12,000 children found 25% were overweight or obese at age seven, rising to 35% at 11. Between 11 and 14, there was little change, however, which researchers say may be because children of this age are making more of their own food choices. Campaigners are calling for more action on weight issues in younger children. Researchers from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) at the UCL Institute of Education analysed information on nearly 12,000 of the children taking part inthe Millennium Cohort Study,,externalwho were born in 2000 and 2001 and have had their weight and height measured at the ages of three, five, seven, 11 and 14. Rates of excess weight varied by nation, with nearly 40% of young people in Northern Ireland obese or overweight compared with 38% in Wales and 35% in both Scotland and England. The levels showed little change up to the age of seven, but then made a big jump in the next four years. At the age of seven, 25.5% of the boys were overweight or obese - but this proportion rose to 36.7% four years later. With the girls, 23.7% were carrying excess weight at seven - but 33.9% were overweight or obese at 11. However, at 14 the boys' proportion had dropped to 34.1%, while the girls' had risen slightly to 36.3%. The data, which was collected between January 2014 and March 2015, also revealed a link between young people's weight and their mothers' level of education. Nearly 40% of 14-year-olds whose mothers had no qualifications above GCSE level were overweight or obese, while the proportion was 26% among those whose mum had a degree or higher qualifications. Also, children who were breastfed as infants, and those whose parents owned their own home, had lower odds of carrying excess weight at 14. Reality Check: Why ban fast food within 400m of schools? Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads on family shows UK most overweight country in Western Europe, says OECD Child and teen obesity spreading across the globe Is UK among worst in Western Europe for child obesity? Dr Benedetta Pongiglione, co-author of the study, told the BBC that while it did not investigate the reasons for the levelling off in rising obesity in 11- to 14-year-olds, trends suggested why this had occurred. ""We know that that age of early to mid adolescence is a time where children start to make more decisions on their own, which can imply different... physical activity, diet and other choices,"" she said. ""Peer pressure also plays a bigger role in their lives. ""From what we observe, maybe the time between seven and 11 is when parents take most of the decisions."" Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, both called for restrictions or a 21:00 watershed on junk-food advertising. Prof Fewtrell said a range of measures should be considered, including ""statutory school-based health education in all schools and robust evaluation of the soft drinks and sugar reduction programme"". What is obesity (NHS Choices website)?,external Check your BMI (body mass index) Ms Cerny said it had to be made ""easier for families to make healthier choices"". She added: ""Children can see up to nine junk-food adverts in just 30 minutes while watching their favourite shows, and we know this influences their food choices and how much they eat."" Prof Emla Fitzsimons, another co-author of the study, said: ""Children who are overweight or obese face an increased risk of many health problems later in life, including cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. ""There is still a worryingly high proportion of young people in this generation who are an unhealthy weight."" The government has plans to try to cut childhood obesity, with a tax on sugary drinks coming into force on 1 April 2018. Independent think tank the Centre for Social Justice has suggested it follows the example of Amsterdam, which is the only European city to have lowered obesity rates in the past five years with a variety of programmes - mainly through schools. Childhood obesity rates have also fallen in New York after a poster campaign on the subway system.

"Gambling giant Ladbrokes Coral is in ""detailed"" talks over a takeover by online rival GVC over a deal that could value the group at up to Â£3.9bn. Under the proposals, GVC - which owns the Bwin and Sportingbet brands - would hold 53.5% of the combined group. Ladbrokes Coral became the UK's biggest High Street bookmaker following last year's merger of Ladbrokes and Coral. The maximum price GVC will pay will depend on the outcome of the government's review of gaming machines. Ladbrokes Coral shares jumped 23% on news of the talks, while GVC's were up by 4%. Ladbrokes, Coral, Gala Casino, Gala Bingo, Eurobet, Betdaq, Sportium Bwin, Sportingbet, Betboo, Gamebookers, Partypoker, Partycasino, CasinoClub, Gioco Digitale, Foxy Bingo, Foxy Casino The Department of Culture, Media and Sport has said it will cap the size of stakes gamblers can make on fixed-odds betting terminals, amid concerns they may harm vulnerable people. Ministers proposed that bets on the machines be cut from a maximum of Â£100 a spin to somewhere between Â£2 and Â£50. GVC and Ladbrokes Coral said that the review could impact on the profitability of Ladbrokes Coral's UK business. Bookies brace for possible sales hit Under the proposed takeover deal, GVC will pay 160.9p for each Ladbrokes Coral share, which would value the company at Â£3.1bn. However, if the outcome of the government's review of gaming terminals is favourable to the gambling industry, and imposes a higher limit on fixed odds bets, then GVC will pay Ladbrokes Coral shareholders a so-called ""contingent value right"" (CVR) of up to 42.8p per share. When added to the original payment, this could value the company at up to Â£3.9bn. The takeover of Ladbrokes Coral could go ahead before the government announces the result of its review. Following the outcome, GVC would then pay the CVR to Ladbrokes Coral shareholders. GVC and Ladbrokes Coral have previously held talks about a takeover, but they broke down. ""GVC got lucky at the third attempt and Ladbrokes Coral shareholders can count their winnings,"" said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. ""Whilst this deal was always likely, most had thought GVC would wait until the government's triennial review of fixed odds betting terminals was finished before it would happen."" The ""tie-up has always made sense"", he added. Isle of Man-based GVC ""has little debt and has the global and fast-growing online presence, Ladbrokes Coral has the physical footprint, High Street name and sports book"". Under takeover rules GVC now has until 4 January to decide whether to make a firm offer for Ladbrokes Coral or to withdraw.

"This video can not be played Cheers and a sing-song: Australian MPs back gay marriage Same-sex marriage will become legal in Australia after a historic bill was passed in the House of Representatives. An overwhelming majority of MPs voted to change the Marriage Act, eight days after a similarly decisive result in the Senate. The vote set off immediate celebrations in parliament, prompting cheers, applause and even a song. The result brings an end to more than a decade of robust and often bitter debate on the issue. ""What a day for love, for equality, for respect,"" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. ""Australia has done it."" The legislation sailed through parliament without amendments afterAustralians overwhelmingly supported the reform in a voluntary national poll. Australia's governor-general is expected to approve the bill in the coming days, marking its official passage into law. Australians decisively back gay marriage How the campaign became heated 'Too old for all the fuss' Emotional MPs hugged each other before supporters in the public gallery began singing ""I am, you are, we are Australian"".

MPs Warren Entsch and Linda Burney, from opposite sides of politics, embrace after the vote Earlier, many supporters had gathered on the lawn outside parliament. They included prominent same-sex marriage advocates, including former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe and local comedian Magda Szubanski. More than 100 MPs had spoken on the legislation after it was tabled in the House of Representatives. Many senators and MPs related personal stories in explaining why they supported the bill. One MP's speech ended with a marriage proposal - a first for the lower house. This video can not be played Will you marry me? Australian politician proposes to his partner in parliament However, other politicians expressed their opposition. ""It is a special relationship between man and a woman for the purposes, if you are so lucky, for bringing children into the world,"" Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Thursday. Australian senator's tearful speech Lawmaker's relief after national vote Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent This is a big moment for Australian politics - the culmination of more than a decade of debate and indecision. For a long time the issue of same-sex marriage was seen as too difficult and too divisive, and so it was hit into the long grass. Campaigners watched with frustration as other countries, not least neighbouring New Zealand, made gay marriage legal. There was a feeling, confirmed by the results of the postal survey, that Australia's lawmakers had failed to keep up with public opinion. Today's vote won't end the debate, or silence opponents of same-sex marriage - but it does mark the beginning of a new chapter. The bill to amend the Marriage Act was first introduced in the Senate last month, immediately after a national poll showed 61.6% of Australians favoured change. This video can not be played Last month's national poll: The moment the country said yes The bill includes exemptions for registered religious celebrants, who can refuse to marry same-sex couples on the basis of their faith. Some conservative politicians had sought to extend exemptions to others, such as non-religious celebrants and businesses, but those proposals failed. The bill will require royal assent from Governor-General Peter Cosgrove, in what is considered a formality. Same-sex couples will then be allowed to register to marry. Like heterosexual couples, they must wait 30 days after registration before a ceremony can take place. 'Too old for all the fuss' Was Australia's marriage poll worth it? UK helps Australian couples marry Couples who wed overseas, or have already done so, will automatically have their marriages recognised in Australia. Yes. The national vote, a voluntary postal survey, followed two failed attempts by the government to hold a compulsory poll that was twice voted down by the Senate. Senators who opposed the compulsory vote did not necessarily oppose legalisation, but said the vote would be costly and fuel hate campaigns. They argued the matter should be put to a parliamentary vote. Many same-sex marriage advocates levelled the same criticism at the voluntary vote, which did not require legislative approval. During the eight-week survey, both supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage were accused of bullying and conducting misleading campaigns. Australia's heated same-sex marriage debate The controversy included frequent claims of vilification, whileformer Prime Minister Kevin Rudd blamed the survey for an assault on his godson. More than 12.7 million people - about 79.5% of eligible voters - took part in the vote. It prompted jubilant scenes when the result was made public last month.

"The incident sparked outrage and a debate over the quality of private healthcare A premature baby who was ""mistakenly"" declared dead by doctors in India's capital Delhi has died in another hospital where he was being treated. The doctors at the privately run Max Hospital had pronounced the baby dead hours after his twin, who was stillborn on 30 November, at 22 weeks. The parents said the baby was alive while on their way to his funeral. Their father told reporters that he would not take the child's body home unless the two doctors were arrested. The incident sparked outrage and a debate over the quality of private healthcare which is often costly. The two doctors were fired by the hospital on Sunday after an inquiry. The hospital also sent its condolences to the parents after hearing that the baby had died. Doctors fired for mistaking baby for dead Anger as doctor 'mistakes' baby for dead How did 100 children die in this India hospital? Anger over $25,000 bill in India hospital ""Our deepest condolences are with the parents and other family members. While we understand that survival in extreme preterm births is rare, it is always painful for the parents and family. We wish them the strength to cope with their loss,"" it said. The state health minister, Satyender Jain, has said the hospital's licence could be cancelled if a probe found it guilty of medical negligence. The Delhi police said on Wednesday that it had transferred the case to its crime unit. The incident came to light when the parents noticed one of the babies squirming inside the plastic bag that doctors had placed the infants in. According to the twins' grandfather, the stunned family rushed the newborn to a nearby hospital where they were told that their baby was still alive, local media reported. This was the second instance in recent months where a private hospital in India has been called out for negligent care. Last month, a girl died of dengue fever in another hospital and the parents allege they were overcharged for her treatment.

"The number of long A&E waits across the UK has more than doubled in the past four years as hospitals struggle to cope with demand, BBC analysis shows. Northern Ireland has the worst performance, although England has seen the fastest deterioration, the figures show. Over 3m patients who visited UK A&Es waited over four hours in the past 12 months - up by 120% since 2012-13. By comparison the number of visits has only risen by just over 7% to 26.9m.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Doctors and nurses said the findings showed the NHS could no longer cope with what was being asked of it and patients were being put at risk. And Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the A&E system had been ""stretched to its very limits"". ""Staff are working really hard. But we've reached a point where we cannot meet demand. ""Life-threatening cases are prioritised. But a crowded emergency department adds risk. We get delays to assessment, pain relief and antibiotics."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies agreed, describing the situation as ""intolerable"" and A&E units as ""full to bursting"". ""Nursing staff in A&E units have been telling us it's hard for them to do more than firefight,"" she added. The data compiled by the BBC shows a significant difference in performance against the four-hour target for treating or admitting patients. In Northern Ireland, which has seen the biggest rise in people coming to A&E units, just 75% of patients were seen in four hours in 2016-17, whereas Scotland saw 93.9% - only marginally lower than the 95% target. In fact Scotland is the only part of the UK performing better than it was four years ago. England has seen the biggest rise in long waiters - a 155% increase. In Scotland the number of long waiters actually fell by 9%. Regionally in England the West Midlands has the worst performance followed by the North West - patients visiting A&Es in those areas are more than twice as likely to wait over four hours than those in the North East, the best-performing region. There are minor variations in the way the target is measured across the four nations, although they are considered broadly comparable. NI emergency departments among slowest Scottish A&E bucks trend on long waits A&E visits top one million a year mark in Wales The BBC has been speaking to a number of hospital staff this week about their experiences. Many wanted to remain anonymous given the political sensitivity about the performance of the health service. But all agreed the pressures were as great as they had ever experienced. One nurse, who works in an A&E unit in south Wales, said his department faced relentless ""24/7"" pressure. ""I know of colleagues who leave a shift and then come back the next day and find the patient is still there. We have seen them in A&E but there are not beds in hospital. It causes overcrowding and all sorts of delays. ""Ambulances queue outside A&Es as the staff are too busy to take patients off them. I've worked in A&Es for over 10 years and this is as bad as I can remember."" Another nurse, from London, said: ""You feel you are failing patients. This is not the sort of care we want to provide, or patients deserve. ""We obviously prioritise the most serious cases, but when it is this busy there is always a risk you miss something. I sometimes finish my shift and end up worrying about my patients."" Patients have also been contacting the BBC. One of those was Hayley Hughes, who waited over five-and-a-half hours at an A&E unit in Wales after sustaining a head injury. ""I kept falling asleep, which worried my partner. ""There was another couple we were speaking to who had got to A&E about an hour before we did, and they were still waiting when we left. I'd say they were there for about six-and-a-half, maybe seven hours. ""It's ridiculous. Whilst I was being assessed you could see the strain on the faces of the staff."" Unless the NHS can get its existing network of hospitals to see patients more quickly, the health service would need another 20 A&Es staffed by at least 170 consultants to hit the target again. But each nation believes the answer to the problem lies in trying to control the numbers turning up at A&E and ensuring they pass through hospital more quickly when they do need treatment by freeing up beds. This is done by making sure there are spare beds in care homes and care services in the community, to hand over frail patients to. In Scotland, for example, NHS budgets have been pooled with council funds to create a closer working relationship between hospitals and care in the community, which is one of the reasons why ministers there believe they have performed better than the rest of the UK. In England an extra Â£1bn is being invested in social care this year, while Â£435m has been freed up to help with winter planning, including putting GPs in A&Es to deal with the more minor cases. A Department of Health spokesman said ministers acknowledge the NHS was ""under pressure due to the ageing population"", but he pointed out that despite the deterioration, nine in 10 patients were still dealt with in four hours. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said the money had come too late. ""We are not where we would want to be as we head into winter. We cannot say with certainty how tough this winter will be, but the likelihood is that services will be sorely tested."" A spokesman for the Welsh Government said there were signs performance was improving when you compared this year to last year instead of four years ago. But he admitted winter would be ""challenging"".

"There is a ""stark"" increase between the ages of seven and 11 in the proportion of children in the UK who are overweight or obese, new data suggests. The study of nearly 12,000 children found 25% were overweight or obese at age seven, rising to 35% at 11. Between 11 and 14, there was little change, however, which researchers say may be because children of this age are making more of their own food choices. Campaigners are calling for more action on weight issues in younger children. Researchers from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) at the UCL Institute of Education analysed information on nearly 12,000 of the children taking part inthe Millennium Cohort Study,,externalwho were born in 2000 and 2001 and have had their weight and height measured at the ages of three, five, seven, 11 and 14. Rates of excess weight varied by nation, with nearly 40% of young people in Northern Ireland obese or overweight compared with 38% in Wales and 35% in both Scotland and England. The levels showed little change up to the age of seven, but then made a big jump in the next four years. At the age of seven, 25.5% of the boys were overweight or obese - but this proportion rose to 36.7% four years later. With the girls, 23.7% were carrying excess weight at seven - but 33.9% were overweight or obese at 11. However, at 14 the boys' proportion had dropped to 34.1%, while the girls' had risen slightly to 36.3%. The data, which was collected between January 2014 and March 2015, also revealed a link between young people's weight and their mothers' level of education. Nearly 40% of 14-year-olds whose mothers had no qualifications above GCSE level were overweight or obese, while the proportion was 26% among those whose mum had a degree or higher qualifications. Also, children who were breastfed as infants, and those whose parents owned their own home, had lower odds of carrying excess weight at 14. Reality Check: Why ban fast food within 400m of schools? Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads on family shows UK most overweight country in Western Europe, says OECD Child and teen obesity spreading across the globe Is UK among worst in Western Europe for child obesity? Dr Benedetta Pongiglione, co-author of the study, told the BBC that while it did not investigate the reasons for the levelling off in rising obesity in 11- to 14-year-olds, trends suggested why this had occurred. ""We know that that age of early to mid adolescence is a time where children start to make more decisions on their own, which can imply different... physical activity, diet and other choices,"" she said. ""Peer pressure also plays a bigger role in their lives. ""From what we observe, maybe the time between seven and 11 is when parents take most of the decisions."" Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, both called for restrictions or a 21:00 watershed on junk-food advertising. Prof Fewtrell said a range of measures should be considered, including ""statutory school-based health education in all schools and robust evaluation of the soft drinks and sugar reduction programme"". What is obesity (NHS Choices website)?,external Check your BMI (body mass index) Ms Cerny said it had to be made ""easier for families to make healthier choices"". She added: ""Children can see up to nine junk-food adverts in just 30 minutes while watching their favourite shows, and we know this influences their food choices and how much they eat."" Prof Emla Fitzsimons, another co-author of the study, said: ""Children who are overweight or obese face an increased risk of many health problems later in life, including cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. ""There is still a worryingly high proportion of young people in this generation who are an unhealthy weight."" The government has plans to try to cut childhood obesity, with a tax on sugary drinks coming into force on 1 April 2018. Independent think tank the Centre for Social Justice has suggested it follows the example of Amsterdam, which is the only European city to have lowered obesity rates in the past five years with a variety of programmes - mainly through schools.

"Gambling giant Ladbrokes Coral is in ""detailed"" talks over a takeover by online rival GVC over a deal that could value the group at up to Â£3.9bn. Under the proposals, GVC - which owns the Bwin and Sportingbet brands - would hold 53.5% of the combined group. Ladbrokes Coral became the UK's biggest High Street bookmaker following last year's merger of Ladbrokes and Coral. The maximum price GVC will pay will depend on the outcome of the government's review of gaming machines. Ladbrokes Coral shares jumped 23% on news of the talks, while GVC's were up by 4%. Ladbrokes, Coral, Gala Casino, Gala Bingo, Eurobet, Betdaq, Sportium Bwin, Sportingbet, Betboo, Gamebookers, Partypoker, Partycasino, CasinoClub, Gioco Digitale, Foxy Bingo, Foxy Casino The Department of Culture, Media and Sport has said it will cap the size of stakes gamblers can make on fixed-odds betting terminals, amid concerns they may harm vulnerable people. Ministers proposed that bets on the machines be cut from a maximum of Â£100 a spin to somewhere between Â£2 and Â£50. GVC and Ladbrokes Coral said that the review could impact on the profitability of Ladbrokes Coral's UK business. Bookies brace for possible sales hit Under the proposed takeover deal, GVC will pay 160.9p for each Ladbrokes Coral share, which would value the company at Â£3.1bn. However, if the outcome of the government's review of gaming terminals is favourable to the gambling industry, and imposes a higher limit on fixed odds bets, then GVC will pay Ladbrokes Coral shareholders a so-called ""contingent value right"" (CVR) of up to 42.8p per share. When added to the original payment, this could value the company at up to Â£3.9bn. The takeover of Ladbrokes Coral could go ahead before the government announces the result of its review. Following the outcome, GVC would then pay the CVR to Ladbrokes Coral shareholders. GVC and Ladbrokes Coral have previously held talks about a takeover, but they broke down. ""GVC got lucky at the third attempt and Ladbrokes Coral shareholders can count their winnings,"" said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. ""Whilst this deal was always likely, most had thought GVC would wait until the government's triennial review of fixed odds betting terminals was finished before it would happen."" The ""tie-up has always made sense"", he added. Isle of Man-based GVC ""has little debt and has the global and fast-growing online presence, Ladbrokes Coral has the physical footprint, High Street name and sports book"". Under takeover rules GVC now has until 4 January to decide whether to make a firm offer for Ladbrokes Coral or to withdraw.

"The number of long A&E waits across the UK has more than doubled in the past four years as hospitals struggle to cope with demand, BBC analysis shows. Northern Ireland has the worst performance, although England has seen the fastest deterioration, the figures show. Over 3m patients who visited UK A&Es waited over four hours in the past 12 months - up by 120% since 2012-13. By comparison the number of visits has only risen by just over 7% to 26.9m.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Doctors and nurses said the findings showed the NHS could no longer cope with what was being asked of it and patients were being put at risk. And Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the A&E system had been ""stretched to its very limits"". ""Staff are working really hard. But we've reached a point where we cannot meet demand. ""Life-threatening cases are prioritised. But a crowded emergency department adds risk. We get delays to assessment, pain relief and antibiotics."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies agreed, describing the situation as ""intolerable"" and A&E units as ""full to bursting"". ""Nursing staff in A&E units have been telling us it's hard for them to do more than firefight,"" she added. The data compiled by the BBC shows a significant difference in performance against the four-hour target for treating or admitting patients. In Northern Ireland, which has seen the biggest rise in people coming to A&E units, just 75% of patients were seen in four hours in 2016-17, whereas Scotland saw 93.9% - only marginally lower than the 95% target. In fact Scotland is the only part of the UK performing better than it was four years ago. England has seen the biggest rise in long waiters - a 155% increase. In Scotland the number of long waiters actually fell by 9%. Regionally in England the West Midlands has the worst performance followed by the North West - patients visiting A&Es in those areas are more than twice as likely to wait over four hours than those in the North East, the best-performing region. There are minor variations in the way the target is measured across the four nations, although they are considered broadly comparable. NI emergency departments among slowest Scottish A&E bucks trend on long waits A&E visits top one million a year mark in Wales The BBC has been speaking to a number of hospital staff this week about their experiences. Many wanted to remain anonymous given the political sensitivity about the performance of the health service. But all agreed the pressures were as great as they had ever experienced. One nurse, who works in an A&E unit in south Wales, said his department faced relentless ""24/7"" pressure. ""I know of colleagues who leave a shift and then come back the next day and find the patient is still there. We have seen them in A&E but there are not beds in hospital. It causes overcrowding and all sorts of delays. ""Ambulances queue outside A&Es as the staff are too busy to take patients off them. I've worked in A&Es for over 10 years and this is as bad as I can remember."" Another nurse, from London, said: ""You feel you are failing patients. This is not the sort of care we want to provide, or patients deserve. ""We obviously prioritise the most serious cases, but when it is this busy there is always a risk you miss something. I sometimes finish my shift and end up worrying about my patients."" Patients have also been contacting the BBC. One of those was Hayley Hughes, who waited over five-and-a-half hours at an A&E unit in Wales after sustaining a head injury. ""I kept falling asleep, which worried my partner. ""There was another couple we were speaking to who had got to A&E about an hour before we did, and they were still waiting when we left. I'd say they were there for about six-and-a-half, maybe seven hours. ""It's ridiculous. Whilst I was being assessed you could see the strain on the faces of the staff."" Unless the NHS can get its existing network of hospitals to see patients more quickly, the health service would need another 20 A&Es staffed by at least 170 consultants to hit the target again. But each nation believes the answer to the problem lies in trying to control the numbers turning up at A&E and ensuring they pass through hospital more quickly when they do need treatment by freeing up beds. This is done by making sure there are spare beds in care homes and care services in the community, to hand over frail patients to. In Scotland, for example, NHS budgets have been pooled with council funds to create a closer working relationship between hospitals and care in the community, which is one of the reasons why ministers there believe they have performed better than the rest of the UK. In England an extra Â£1bn is being invested in social care this year, while Â£435m has been freed up to help with winter planning, including putting GPs in A&Es to deal with the more minor cases. A Department of Health spokesman said ministers acknowledge the NHS was ""under pressure due to the ageing population"", but he pointed out that despite the deterioration, nine in 10 patients were still dealt with in four hours. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said the money had come too late. ""We are not where we would want to be as we head into winter. We cannot say with certainty how tough this winter will be, but the likelihood is that services will be sorely tested."" A spokesman for the Welsh Government said there were signs performance was improving when you compared this year to last year instead of four years ago. But he admitted winter would be ""challenging"".

"This video can not be played 'We're preparing for the worst', says Standard Chartered boss Bill Winters The UK's ability to attract talent is already suffering, following the vote to leave the EU, according to the boss of the UK's fifth-largest bank. Standard Chartered is ""preparing for the worst"" from Brexit, chief executive Bill Winters told the BBC. The UK-headquartered bank is in the process of turning its Frankfurt branch into a subsidiary requiring additional capital, licences and staff. He said this was ""inconvenient and expensive"" and will damage London. ""London will take hits in the context of Brexitâ¦ I think big parts of the euro-denominated corporate banking business will be forced into Europe. ""It's possible that through the Brexit negotiations that there is some sort of extended passporting rule [ability of banks to sell services across Europe from a UK base] but none of us are expecting that quite frankly, or preparing for that. ""We have to prepare for the worstâ¦ let's hope for the best, but we're prepared for the worst."" Mr Winters said he would be happy to take the tens of millions of pounds he has spent on Brexit contingency planning and ""flush it down the toilet"" if it meant he could carry on as before and maintain the bank's current structure. The mood music from the UK has already affected the bank's ability to attract the best and brightest talent according to Mr Winters. ""We have already had some setbacks for the talent pool in London through the restriction on student visas. That's already a problem. ""Some of the best talent that we can have in the UK marketplace is coming from students that have chosen to study here and then stayed for some extended period afterwardsâ¦ We've noticed that's been impacted already. ""More through a sense from non-UK [people] that this might not be such a hospitable place any longer - it's more psychological than contractual."" Official numbers bear this out. After a decade of uninterrupted growth, applications from EU students for places at UK universities dropped by more than 7% last year, according to UCAS, even though their right to stay on and work is, as yet, unaffected. A Department for Education spokesperson said it was taking action to provide certainty for students. ""We have confirmed that EU students starting their courses in the academic year 18/19 or before will continue to be eligible for student loans and home fee status and will have a right to remain in the UK to complete their course,"" they added. Bill Winters says US President Donald Trump is wrong to allow China to grow its economic influence Standard Chartered is not a High Street bank here in the UK. It is probably best known here as Liverpool FC's shirt sponsor but it is a well-known financial brand in Asia, the Middle East and Africa and has a front row seat when it comes to financing global trade and investment. It provides advice and cash to grease the wheels of commerce within and between some of the world's fastest-growing markets. Former Wall Street banker Mr Winters is convinced the US under Donald Trump is making a big mistake in allowing China to grow its global economic influence in areas from which the US is retreating - as demonstrated when it dropped out of a trade mega deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. ""They're creating effectively a multi-regional trading bloc creating these markets in much the same way that the US and UK created markets in Europe after the Second World War during a period of so much devastation. ""They are creating markets where they will be less dependent on Europeâ¦the US is taking itself out of some of the key discussions for them and then actual trade agreements where the US could continue to have an extremely benevolent influence that it has had for decades. I think we have got to be extremely careful about that - and the UK does as well."" This video can not be played Bill Winters discusses the growing influence of China Mr Winters understands risk. He was part of a major report into the stability of the UK financial system commissioned by the government after the financial crisis. He believes the banks are much more secure than they were a decade ago but that has presented another type of risk. A lot of banks have seen their profitability, their earning power reduced. They have been forced to hold more shock-absorbing money in reserve and that has meant their earning power per pound of the capital they set aside has diminished. Meanwhile, technology companies are coming along and doing lots of the things banks like to charge for - like foreign exchange and making payments - and doing them more cheaply and conveniently. Many experts think banking's next crisis is the competition from nimble tech firms that don't have all the expense associated with being a bank. This is one reason why many banks' shares (including Standard Chartered) - are trading at roughly half the price they appear to be worth on paper. The idea that banks can't make enough money may seem perverse but any business that can't earn a sufficient return on the capital provided by investors is ultimately doomed as investors will take their capital away. Mr Winters, however, is confident that banks are here to stay. ""For my thirty five years in banking I've started every year with people saying there is some enormous competitive threat looming - and they are right - there always is. But if you serve your customers as best you can you will stay relevant"" 'We're preparing for the worst' Video, 00:03:05'We're preparing for the worst' Bank boss: US losing global influence.

"This video can not be played Cheers and a sing-song: Australian MPs back gay marriage Same-sex marriage will become legal in Australia after a historic bill was passed in the House of Representatives. An overwhelming majority of MPs voted to change the Marriage Act, eight days after a similarly decisive result in the Senate. The vote set off immediate celebrations in parliament, prompting cheers, applause and even a song. The result brings an end to more than a decade of robust and often bitter debate on the issue. ""What a day for love, for equality, for respect,"" said Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. ""Australia has done it."" The legislation sailed through parliament without amendments afterAustralians overwhelmingly supported the reform in a voluntary national poll. Australia's governor-general is expected to approve the bill in the coming days, marking its official passage into law. Australians decisively back gay marriage How the campaign became heated 'Too old for all the fuss' Emotional MPs hugged each other before supporters in the public gallery began singing ""I am, you are, we are Australian"".

MPs Warren Entsch and Linda Burney, from opposite sides of politics, embrace after the vote Earlier, many supporters had gathered on the lawn outside parliament. They included prominent same-sex marriage advocates, including former Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe and local comedian Magda Szubanski. More than 100 MPs had spoken on the legislation after it was tabled in the House of Representatives. Many senators and MPs related personal stories in explaining why they supported the bill. One MP's speech ended with a marriage proposal - a first for the lower house. This video can not be played Will you marry me? Australian politician proposes to his partner in parliament However, other politicians expressed their opposition. ""It is a special relationship between man and a woman for the purposes, if you are so lucky, for bringing children into the world,"" Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Thursday. Australian senator's tearful speech Lawmaker's relief after national vote Hywel Griffith, BBC News Sydney correspondent This is a big moment for Australian politics - the culmination of more than a decade of debate and indecision. For a long time the issue of same-sex marriage was seen as too difficult and too divisive, and so it was hit into the long grass. Campaigners watched with frustration as other countries, not least neighbouring New Zealand, made gay marriage legal. There was a feeling, confirmed by the results of the postal survey, that Australia's lawmakers had failed to keep up with public opinion. Today's vote won't end the debate, or silence opponents of same-sex marriage - but it does mark the beginning of a new chapter. The bill to amend the Marriage Act was first introduced in the Senate last month, immediately after a national poll showed 61.6% of Australians favoured change. This video can not be played Last month's national poll: The moment the country said yes The bill includes exemptions for registered religious celebrants, who can refuse to marry same-sex couples on the basis of their faith. Some conservative politicians had sought to extend exemptions to others, such as non-religious celebrants and businesses, but those proposals failed. The bill will require royal assent from Governor-General Peter Cosgrove, in what is considered a formality. Same-sex couples will then be allowed to register to marry. Like heterosexual couples, they must wait 30 days after registration before a ceremony can take place. 'Too old for all the fuss' Was Australia's marriage poll worth it? UK helps Australian couples marry Couples who wed overseas, or have already done so, will automatically have their marriages recognised in Australia. Yes. The national vote, a voluntary postal survey, followed two failed attempts by the government to hold a compulsory poll that was twice voted down by the Senate. Senators who opposed the compulsory vote did not necessarily oppose legalisation, but said the vote would be costly and fuel hate campaigns. They argued the matter should be put to a parliamentary vote. Many same-sex marriage advocates levelled the same criticism at the voluntary vote, which did not require legislative approval.

"The number of long A&E waits across the UK has more than doubled in the past four years as hospitals struggle to cope with demand, BBC analysis shows. Northern Ireland has the worst performance, although England has seen the fastest deterioration, the figures show. Over 3m patients who visited UK A&Es waited over four hours in the past 12 months - up by 120% since 2012-13. By comparison the number of visits has only risen by just over 7% to 26.9m.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Doctors and nurses said the findings showed the NHS could no longer cope with what was being asked of it and patients were being put at risk. And Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the A&E system had been ""stretched to its very limits"". ""Staff are working really hard. But we've reached a point where we cannot meet demand. ""Life-threatening cases are prioritised. But a crowded emergency department adds risk. We get delays to assessment, pain relief and antibiotics."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies agreed, describing the situation as ""intolerable"" and A&E units as ""full to bursting"". ""Nursing staff in A&E units have been telling us it's hard for them to do more than firefight,"" she added. The data compiled by the BBC shows a significant difference in performance against the four-hour target for treating or admitting patients. In Northern Ireland, which has seen the biggest rise in people coming to A&E units, just 75% of patients were seen in four hours in 2016-17, whereas Scotland saw 93.9% - only marginally lower than the 95% target. In fact Scotland is the only part of the UK performing better than it was four years ago. England has seen the biggest rise in long waiters - a 155% increase. In Scotland the number of long waiters actually fell by 9%. Regionally in England the West Midlands has the worst performance followed by the North West - patients visiting A&Es in those areas are more than twice as likely to wait over four hours than those in the North East, the best-performing region. There are minor variations in the way the target is measured across the four nations, although they are considered broadly comparable. NI emergency departments among slowest Scottish A&E bucks trend on long waits A&E visits top one million a year mark in Wales The BBC has been speaking to a number of hospital staff this week about their experiences. Many wanted to remain anonymous given the political sensitivity about the performance of the health service. But all agreed the pressures were as great as they had ever experienced. One nurse, who works in an A&E unit in south Wales, said his department faced relentless ""24/7"" pressure. ""I know of colleagues who leave a shift and then come back the next day and find the patient is still there. We have seen them in A&E but there are not beds in hospital. It causes overcrowding and all sorts of delays. ""Ambulances queue outside A&Es as the staff are too busy to take patients off them. I've worked in A&Es for over 10 years and this is as bad as I can remember."" Another nurse, from London, said: ""You feel you are failing patients. This is not the sort of care we want to provide, or patients deserve. ""We obviously prioritise the most serious cases, but when it is this busy there is always a risk you miss something. I sometimes finish my shift and end up worrying about my patients."" Patients have also been contacting the BBC. One of those was Hayley Hughes, who waited over five-and-a-half hours at an A&E unit in Wales after sustaining a head injury. ""I kept falling asleep, which worried my partner. ""There was another couple we were speaking to who had got to A&E about an hour before we did, and they were still waiting when we left. I'd say they were there for about six-and-a-half, maybe seven hours. ""It's ridiculous. Whilst I was being assessed you could see the strain on the faces of the staff."" Unless the NHS can get its existing network of hospitals to see patients more quickly, the health service would need another 20 A&Es staffed by at least 170 consultants to hit the target again. But each nation believes the answer to the problem lies in trying to control the numbers turning up at A&E and ensuring they pass through hospital more quickly when they do need treatment by freeing up beds. This is done by making sure there are spare beds in care homes and care services in the community, to hand over frail patients to. In Scotland, for example, NHS budgets have been pooled with council funds to create a closer working relationship between hospitals and care in the community, which is one of the reasons why ministers there believe they have performed better than the rest of the UK. In England an extra Â£1bn is being invested in social care this year, while Â£435m has been freed up to help with winter planning, including putting GPs in A&Es to deal with the more minor cases. A Department of Health spokesman said ministers acknowledge the NHS was ""under pressure due to the ageing population"", but he pointed out that despite the deterioration, nine in 10 patients were still dealt with in four hours. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said the money had come too late. ""We are not where we would want to be as we head into winter. We cannot say with certainty how tough this winter will be, but the likelihood is that services will be sorely tested."" A spokesman for the Welsh Government said there were signs performance was improving when you compared this year to last year instead of four years ago. But he admitted winter would be ""challenging"".

"This video can not be played 'Homeless Jesus' in Glasgow A sculpture depicting Jesus as a homeless man sleeping on a bench has been installed in Glasgow city centre. Castings of the life-size statue have been placed in cities worldwide since 2013, although some churches have refused to display it. Church and homeless charity representatives hope the sculpture will help raise awareness of homelessness. Scottish artist Peter Howson has made a painting of a homeless Jesus that will be shown alongside the statue. The world-famous sculpture, created by Canadian sculptor Timothy Schmalz, has been placed at Nelson Mandela Place, near Glasgow's St George's Tron Church, after planning permission was granted earlier this year. Although the shrouded figure is fairly anonymous, the wounds in the feet signal it is meant to be Jesus. Pope Francis once blessed a smaller version of the statue in Rome Glasgow priest Father Willy Slavin helped bring the sculpture to Scotland. He was contacted by Mr Schmalz in 2015, and took the idea to the Glasgow Churches Together association. The cost of the project was Â£25,000, with money raised through local churches and pro bono work. Catholic sculptor Tim Schmalz met Pope Francis to show him the statue Christian sculptor Timothy Schmalz was inspired when he saw a homeless person on a bench in Toronto. He named the statue Matthew 25, in reference to a quote from that gospel - ""Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me."" Castings of the statue are placed near churches around the world, including in Madrid, Singapore and the Vatican. A smaller version of the statue has been blessed by the Pope. The first churches Mr Schmalz offered his statue to refused to display it. Others see the bench as controversial because it explicitly depicts Jesus as homeless. Permission to install the UK's first version of the statue on a pavement outside a Westminster church wasrejected by the council,externalthere in 2016. Peter Howson hopes to make prints of Homeless Jesus 2017 to raise money for homelessness charities Scottish artist Peter Howson, who was awarded an OBE in 2009, painted a canvas interpreting Jesus as homeless man when he first heard about the efforts to bring Mr Schmalz's work to Glasgow. Mr Howson said he hoped his painting,Homeless Jesus 2017,external, would ""aid in awareness whilst highlighting the plight of the homeless, and homelessness issue"". ""The sculpture is extremely powerful and its message is universal"" he said about Mr Schmalz's work. The Christ figure in Mr Howson's painting, as in the statue, is only known to be Jesus through the wounds on his feet. ""I wanted to ensure that his face remained anonymous to highlight that this figure (although Jesus) could, in fact, be any one of us, at any given time,"" he said. Mr Howson, who has struggled with addiction in the past, created many paintings of Glasgow's homeless population during the early years of his career. He converted to Christianity about 20 years ago, and since many of his works have depicted biblical scenes. The painting of homeless Jesus took him six weeks to complete. About the process, he said: ""It moved me in a way I wasn't expecting and I was drawn to the lonely isolation and helpless situation of the figure depicted."" After being displayed at the same church as the statue, Mr Howson's painting will tour across Scotland at events that ""promote and highlight the plight of homelessness"". ""I want people to look and think and understand its message. The Bronze [sculpture] speaks volumes. I hope my canvas will too"" he said.

"The overall pupil absence rate is 4.5%, according to the latest figures from the Department for Education.  One in 10 of those school children are classed as ""persistently absent"". A persistently absent child is one who misses school for at least 10% of the time. Secondary schools had a higher rate of persistent absence than primary schools. And overall, unauthorised absence, whether persistent or not, also increased. Such statistics are just one of the reasons the BBC Stories team decided to look behind the numbers to make a series of films about why children don't attend school. Taking to the streets in cities across the country, the team asked children themselves why they skipped classes. They gave a range of reasons including anxiety, depression, bullying and having little interest in the subjects they are taught. Many said they wanted more support at school and some wished they could go back and ""just start all over again"". This video can not be played 'School's dead man, it's the same lessons every day' According to the Department for Education's latest statistics, sickness was the main reason for absence in the autumn 2016 and spring 2017 terms. But illness rates remained the same as the previous year at 2.7%. Unauthorised absences, however, rose, including unauthorised family holidays. It is important to note that overall school absences in England declined since the same period a decade earlier, as did the percentage of pupils who were persistently absent. Bath and North East Somerset is one of England's wealthiest local authorities But what's most surprising is where truancy was at its highest. While high deprivation indicators based on health, crime, education and crucially income are commonly linked to high truancy, a closer look shows this isn't necessarily the case. Bath and North East Somerset is one of England's wealthiest local authorities, according to deprivation indices, but it had one of the highest levels of truancy in 2015 to 2016. At the other end of the scale Manchester, a city which ranks highly on deprivation levels, had one of the lowest levels of truancy. Manchester had one of the lower levels of truancy If you compare middle income areas, again there are contrasts. Norfolk and Herefordshire are very similar overall when you look at health, crime, education and income but the truancy rate in Norfolk in 2015 to 2016 was much higher than in Herefordshire. So, how reliable is the data? Pupil absence in England is measured at local authority level and deprivation by district so we can only look at the picture as an average with variation within each area. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland record pupil absence in different ways. In Wales, overall absence increased in 2016 to 2017 from the previous year - unauthorised absence and persistent absence also increased. However, persistent absenteeism in Wales was less than half of what is was eight years earlier. In Scotland, attendance rates are recorded only once every two years. In 2014 to 2015, the overall attendance rate improved since the previous report but the unauthorised absence rate also increased. In Northern Ireland, the overall attendance rate in 2015 to 2016 remained unchanged from the previous year at 94.6%. Neither Scotland nor Northern Ireland measure persistent absence.

"This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace The BBC's Barbara Plett Usher looks at key takeaways of US President Donald Trump's policy shift on the status of Jerusalem. Less than a month ago the Palestinians' top diplomat in Washington was telling me he thought President Trump might succeed at peacemaking where others had failed. In every meeting Trump confirmed he would ""give his heart and soul"" to this process, said Husam Zomlot, the Palestine Liberation Organisation's (PLO) representative. It was an optimistic reading of a frequently rocky process. But there was enough in the efforts of Mr Trump's peace envoys to give the Palestinians a sense that their relationship with the White House was on an upward trajectory. Palestinian officials have now dropped the idea to live-stream Bethlehem Christmas celebrations on Capitol Hill Building off the momentum, Mr Zomlot organised a Christmas party on Capitol Hill with a guest list that included members of congress and government officials. The idea was to live-stream Bethlehem Christmas celebrations into the political heart of America. When the PLO mission got a late-breaking heads up about the decision on Jerusalem it cancelled the event,saying it would be unsuitable after an ""announcement that runs counter to the message of peace"",external. The fact that the Palestinians, and reportedly Arab leaders, were largely taken by surprise is only one sign that the decision was not part of a wider Middle East strategy. There's been speculation that Mr Trump was trying to shake things up as a tactic to prepare the ground for peace talks. But there's far more evidence he was simply focused on keeping a campaign promise to pro-Israel American Jews and evangelical Christians in his political base. According to multiple reports, Mr Trump was frustrated by continued opposition from his national security team, which gathered last Monday to discuss options on the embassy waiver. That comes up every six months when the US is required by law to either move the American embassy from Tel Aviv or waive the congressional demand on security grounds. US officials said he agreed to sign the waiver only with the promise of recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and launching a process to move the embassy. ""While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise,"" Mr Trump declared triumphantly in his speech, ""they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering."" World reacts to Trump move on Jerusalem Mike Pence watches (right), as Donald Trump holds up his proclamation on Jerusalem's policy The face of Mike Pence beaming over Mr Trump's shoulder during the announcement said it all. The vice-president was an influential voice in convincing Mr Trump to follow through on his campaign promise, and this illustrates the political power of hardline Christian evangelicals who fervently support Israel. That was not lost on Palestinian legislator and Christian Hanan Ashrawi. ""My god did not tell me what his god tells him,"" she spat out in an interview with the BBC. ""We are the original Christians, we are the owners of the land, we are the people who've been here for centuries. How dare they come here and give me biblical treatises and absolutist positions!"" Incidentally, the enterprising Mr Zomlot tried to play the Christian card with his Bethlehem-themed Capitol Hill reception, and has told activists the motto ""Jesus is a gift from Palestine"" might help translate the Palestinian message to Christian America. Mr Trump's announcement has triggered a strong reaction from Arab allies. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Jerusalem is holy land, not simply a disputed capital, meaning that Arab leaders will be less inclined to take pragmatic approaches they might ultimately adopt on other core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As custodians of Islam's holy sites, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have issued warnings that this move could inflame the Muslim world. Why settlement issue is so difficult But the Arab revolutions have shifted priorities away from the Palestinian cause towards containing Iran, especially among the Gulf states. For that they have formed a quiet intelligence co-operation with Israel, and need Mr Trump onside. If the Gulf Arab leaders make a lot of noise over Jerusalem but take no action, it will be further proof of a new Middle East. At the end of the day the question is not really whether Israel's capital is West Jerusalem, but whether occupied East Jerusalem will be the capital of a Palestinian state. Mr Trump left open that possibility by saying the administration was not taking a position on the final status of the holy city, ""including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem, or the resolution of contested borders"". That seemed to imply the Palestinian claim to East Jerusalem would still be on the table in any negotiations. But he didn't spell that out, nor did he clearly state that the end goal was two states. Instead, he said the US would support such a solution if agreed to by both sides: not the unequivocal endorsement the Palestinians were looking for. Ultimately he didn't offer the Palestinians anything, and the speech came across as an endorsement of Israel. The alternatives to a two-state solution Mr Trump has claimed that recognising Jerusalem will advance the peace process. But it is far more likely that he has sabotaged his own peace initiative. This will almost certainly embolden those on the Israeli right adamantly opposed to a Palestinian state and territorial concessions in Jerusalem. And it will make it much harder for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to enter negotiations. Trump administration officials indicated they would continue working on the peace plan and wait for the dust to settle - it's not ready yet, so there's time for the Palestinians to reject the process and then reconsider. But Mr Trump has also plunged the US into the dispute over Jerusalem. That's an uncomfortable, perhaps untenable, position for a mediator to hold.

"This video can not be played Brexit: Boris Johnson defends 'go whistle' remark Boris Johnson has been defending his much quoted jibe that the EU could ""go whistle"" over the Brexit bill. The UK and EU are widely believed to have now agreed a deal which will see the UK paying up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn). But the foreign secretary said he had been referring, in July, to reports the UK could face a 100bn euro bill. He spoke as talks continue about the remaining sticking point in the initial phase of Brexit talks - what happens at the Northern Ireland border. Laura Kuenssberg: Brexit discussion looming for PM Reality Check: Why border arguments delay Brexit deal Brexit protests and new mural in Belfast The foreign secretary said - at a question and answer session after a speech on global terrorism - that whatever was agreed must be ""consistent with taking back control of our laws, of our borders and our cash"". His ""go whistle"" comment was made in a response in the House of Commons to Conservative backbencher Philip Hollobone: This video can not be played Boris Johnson's message to the EU: ""Go whistle seems to me to be an entirely appropriate expression"" Mr Johnson said he had been ""teased"" about it since, but at the time he had been ""asked my reaction to some of the very extortionate sums that I had heard, in the region of Â£80bn or Â£100bn"". He said that on detailed examination of financial obligations ""the British government is absolutely punctilious in wanting to meet our friends more than halfway and to be useful. ""The financial offer we are making is very good but it is nowhere near the sums that I was first invited to comment on, in a musical way."" The government says it is ""optimistic"" about finding a solution to the key sticking point - an agreement on the Irish border. The government needs to get everyone onside on the issue in the coming days for Brexit negotiations to move forwards. This video can not be played Chris Grayling: I'm optimistic about deal The UK, which is due to leave the EU in March 2019, wants to open talks on a new free trade deal as soon as possible. But the EU will only agree to this when enough progress has been made on the ""separation issues""  - the ""divorce bill"", expat citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland border - that have been the subject of negotiations so far. So the UK is trying to settle the Northern Ireland border issue before EU leaders meet next week. This video can not be played Arlene Foster claimed the Irish government prevented the DUP seeing the wording of the text On Monday, the DUP - whose support Prime Minister Theresa May needs to win key votes at Westminster - objected to draft plans drawn up by the UK and the EU. The DUP said the proposals, which aimed to avoid border checks by aligning regulations on both sides of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, were not acceptable. The party has said it will not accept any agreement in which Northern Ireland is treated differently from the rest of the UK. The Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member - says it wants a guarantee that a hard border will not be put up after Brexit. A European Commission spokesman said there was ""no white smoke yet"" on Brexit negotiations. Disagreements remain over how the Irish border should be treated after Brexit With Brexit, the UK is leaving the EU's customs union - but Transport Secretary Chris  Grayling said this did not mean there would need to be a physical border with people carrying out border checks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the transport secretary said people had misunderstood the key term ""regulatory alignment"" which has been the focus of the debate. Some Eurosceptics who do not want to keep close ties to Brussels fear this could hamper the UK's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. But Mr Grayling, a key Leave campaigner in the 2016 referendum, said: ""We don't have to have, and we've never said we will, and we don't want, to have a situation where in future our laws are identical to the European Union. ""There will be areas where we do do things in a very similar way, there will be areas in which we don't do things in the a very similar way and that's all the PM was seeking to ensure - to make sure trade flows as freely as possible across the border."" He added: ""I remain absolutely optimistic that we will reach  a successful point, we will move on to the trade talks, because ultimately it is in everybody's interests for that to happen."" The BBC's Adam Fleming said that following an update from chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Wednesday, EU member states agreed there must be clarity within 48 hours for them to have enough time to consult with their capitals about draft guidelines for phase two of the talks. At the 14-15 December summit, European leaders will decide whether enough progress has been made in the negotiations on Ireland, the UK's ""divorce bill"" and citizens' rights so far to open trade talks. On Wednesday the Republic of Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said he expected Theresa May to come up with a new wording aimed at satisfying all parties, adding: ""I expressed my willingness to consider that."" A European Commission spokesman said on Thursday that things have to be sorted this week, adding: ""Our week includes Sunday."" As well as trying to appease the DUP, Dublin and Brussels, Theresa May also needs Conservative MPs to back whatever solution she puts forward. But not all of them agree - and the pressure on the prime minister was underlined on Wednesday when 19 Tory MPs who back a ""soft Brexit"" wrote to her saying it was ""highly irresponsible"" for anyone to dictate terms which may scupper a deal. This followed Eurosceptic MPs urging her to lay down new red lines before agreeing to hand over any money. Don't bow to Brexit conditions, May urged Brexit: All you need to know In the latest letter, the 19 MPs - who largely backed Remain in the 2016 referendum - say they support the PM's handling of the negotiations, in particular the ""political and practical difficulties"" relating to the Irish border. But they hit out at what they say are attempts by some in their party to paint a no-deal scenario in which the UK failed to agree a trade agreement as ""some status quo which the UK simply opts to adopt"". The MPs included former cabinet ministers Stephen Crabb, Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan. That's the suggestion from a House of Lords committee, which says a ""time-limited extension of the UK's EU membership"" would ""buy time"" for a deal to be reached. The committee doubts exit negotiations will be completed by the scheduled departure date of March 2019. The UK is due to leave the EU at this point because Theresa May formally triggered a two-year countdown to Brexit in March 2017. The government does not agree, and says it is confident negotiations can be completed by March 2019. But the Lords committee says: ""The overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that this will be impossible. ""If buying a bit more time means that we get a better outcome, which benefits businesses and citizens on both sides, a short extension of EU membership may be a price worth paying.""

"Bath Spa University said Prof Christina Slade's pay-off was ""value for money"" A university vice-chancellor was handed more than Â£800,000 in her final year, including a hefty departure payment,it has been revealed.,external Accounts for Bath Spa University showProf Christina Slade was paid Â£429,000 ""for loss of office"" on top of her Â£250,000 salary,externaland other benefits. The University and College Union (UCU) has called for an ""urgent overhaul"" of senior pay at British universities. A spokeswoman for Bath Spa said the sum represented ""value for money"". Prof Slade, who served as vice-chancellor until August, was also given a housing allowance of Â£20,000 and another Â£20,000 for ""other benefits-in-kind"". There were also pension contributions of Â£89,000. In total, she received a pay package, including benefits and pensions, worth Â£808,000, after she decided to leave the job. Lord Adonis, who is pushing the issue of vice-chancellor pay in the House of Lords, said: ""If Â£800,000 represents value for money for a vice-chancellor, then I am the emperor of China."" Bath Spa University charged Â£9,250 a year for an undergraduate degree starting in 2017. That is Â£27,750 for a three-year course. Prof Slade's Â£808,000 pay was equivalent to 87 students' fees for a year or 29 students' entire degrees. The whole pay package, including compensation for loss of office, was also almost double the amount earned by Dame Glynis Breakwell, who is standing down from the nearby University of Bath following a row over her pay. The median annual salary in the UK is Â£23,474. In Bath it is Â£23,082. It means in her final year Prof Slade earned 35 times more than theaverage worker in the local area,external. University vice-chancellors in the UKearn an average of Â£249,000. Bath Spa University has not yet given details of the circumstances of her departure, but an interim vice-chancellor, Prof Nick Foskett, is running the university until January. An incoming vice-chancellor, Prof Sue Rigby will be taking over on 22 January. She is due to be paid 20% less than Prof Slade received in 2015-16. A spokeswoman for the university said: ""Having taken legal advice, the university paid Prof Slade a sum which reflected her contractual and statutory entitlements, and was considered to represent value for money."" She said that the vice-chancellor's salary was decided by a pay committee, which did not include the vice-chancellor or staff. The committee was ""mindful of the need to respond to concerns about excessive salaries and take into account the performance of the university"", she added. Lord Adonis said such high rates of pay were not acceptable when students could potentially be racking up debts of Â£100,000 because of the way interest was stacking up. He added that it was not the case that England was losing vice-chancellors to the US, it was simply that universities had seen an explosion in income through higher fees. He is calling for a independent investigation into the pay of vice-chancellors. Bath Spa University describes itself as a creative university with about 7,000 students and 1,000 staff. It was awarded university status in 2005 after seven colleges joined together to make the new institution. Dame Glynis Breakwell agreed to stand down as University of Bath's vice-chancellor after a row over her pay The new revelations came on the day it emerged the retirement terms of Britain's highest paid vice-chancellorare being investigated by a watchdog. Prof Dame Glynis Breakwell announced she was resigning from the University of Bath after a row over her Â£468,000 salary. UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said that when it came to senior pay in universities ""many vice-chancellors and senior staff look like they are living on a different planet"". She called for greater transparency into how senior pay awards were decided, with staff and students included on remuneration committees. ""We are seeing what happens when decisions are taken in secret without proper checks and balances,"" she added. ""This simply cannot be allowed to continue; we need an urgent overhaul of how senior pay and perks are determined, and how our universities are governed."" But Bath Spa said the former vice-chancellor had led the university during a during a turbulent time for UK higher education and it had ""flourished"" during her tenure. It was now widely recognised as a centre of excellence for creativity, culture and enterprise, it said. A spokesman said: ""During her leadership, Bath Spa University has been transformed from a regional British university to a truly global institution, ranked eighth best modern university in the UK by the Sunday Times in 2016. ""As well as major campus developments, Prof Slade has overseen a transformation in teaching and research, with additional professorial posts created and a significant increase in research activity and income."" She had also internationalised the university, giving students greater opportunities for outward mobility across the world, the spokesman said.

"There is a ""stark"" increase between the ages of seven and 11 in the proportion of children in the UK who are overweight or obese, new data suggests. The study of nearly 12,000 children found 25% were overweight or obese at age seven, rising to 35% at 11. Between 11 and 14, there was little change, however, which researchers say may be because children of this age are making more of their own food choices. Campaigners are calling for more action on weight issues in younger children. Researchers from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) at the UCL Institute of Education analysed information on nearly 12,000 of the children taking part inthe Millennium Cohort Study,,externalwho were born in 2000 and 2001 and have had their weight and height measured at the ages of three, five, seven, 11 and 14. Rates of excess weight varied by nation, with nearly 40% of young people in Northern Ireland obese or overweight compared with 38% in Wales and 35% in both Scotland and England. The levels showed little change up to the age of seven, but then made a big jump in the next four years. At the age of seven, 25.5% of the boys were overweight or obese - but this proportion rose to 36.7% four years later. With the girls, 23.7% were carrying excess weight at seven - but 33.9% were overweight or obese at 11. However, at 14 the boys' proportion had dropped to 34.1%, while the girls' had risen slightly to 36.3%. The data, which was collected between January 2014 and March 2015, also revealed a link between young people's weight and their mothers' level of education. Nearly 40% of 14-year-olds whose mothers had no qualifications above GCSE level were overweight or obese, while the proportion was 26% among those whose mum had a degree or higher qualifications. Also, children who were breastfed as infants, and those whose parents owned their own home, had lower odds of carrying excess weight at 14. Reality Check: Why ban fast food within 400m of schools? Children 'bombarded by junk food' ads on family shows UK most overweight country in Western Europe, says OECD Child and teen obesity spreading across the globe Is UK among worst in Western Europe for child obesity? Dr Benedetta Pongiglione, co-author of the study, told the BBC that while it did not investigate the reasons for the levelling off in rising obesity in 11- to 14-year-olds, trends suggested why this had occurred. ""We know that that age of early to mid adolescence is a time where children start to make more decisions on their own, which can imply different... physical activity, diet and other choices,"" she said. ""Peer pressure also plays a bigger role in their lives. ""From what we observe, maybe the time between seven and 11 is when parents take most of the decisions."" Prof Mary Fewtrell, nutrition lead at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, and Caroline Cerny, from the Obesity Health Alliance, both called for restrictions or a 21:00 watershed on junk-food advertising. Prof Fewtrell said a range of measures should be considered, including ""statutory school-based health education in all schools and robust evaluation of the soft drinks and sugar reduction programme"". What is obesity (NHS Choices website)?,external Check your BMI (body mass index) Ms Cerny said it had to be made ""easier for families to make healthier choices"". She added: ""Children can see up to nine junk-food adverts in just 30 minutes while watching their favourite shows, and we know this influences their food choices and how much they eat."" Prof Emla Fitzsimons, another co-author of the study, said: ""Children who are overweight or obese face an increased risk of many health problems later in life, including cardiovascular disease and type-2 diabetes. ""There is still a worryingly high proportion of young people in this generation who are an unhealthy weight."" The government has plans to try to cut childhood obesity, with a tax on sugary drinks coming into force on 1 April 2018. Independent think tank the Centre for Social Justice has suggested it follows the example of Amsterdam, which is the only European city to have lowered obesity rates in the past five years with a variety of programmes - mainly through schools. Childhood obesity rates have also fallen in New York after a poster campaign on the subway system.

"This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace President Donald Trump has announced that the US now recognises Jerusalem as Israel's capital, overturning decades of official US policy. Mr Trump described the move as ""a long overdue step"" to advance the Middle East peace process. The fate of the ancient city is one of the thorniest issues between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel called Mr Trump's move ""historic"" but there has been sharp international criticism. Mr Trump said the US still supported a two-state solution to the longstanding conflict, if approved by both sides, which would essentially see the creation of an independent Palestinian state living alongside Israel. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Mr Trump's announcement ""deplorable"", saying the US could no longer be a peace broker. Eight of the 15 nations who are currently members of the United Nations Security Council have called for the body to hold an urgent meeting on the US decision by the end of the week. The decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital puts the US at odds with the rest of the international community's view on Jerusalem's status. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Reaction to speech World reacts to Trump move on Jerusalem The alternatives to a two-state solution Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and until now all countries have maintained their embassies in Tel Aviv. Jerusalem contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity. East Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, was annexed by Israel after the Six Day War of 1967, but is not internationally recognised as part of Israel. Speaking at the White House, the US president said he had ""judged this course of action to be in the best interests of the United States of America, and the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians"". He said he was directing the US state department to begin preparations to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Despite warnings of regional unrest over any such move, the decision fulfils a campaign promise and appeals to Mr Trump's right-wing base. ""Today, I am delivering,"" the US leader said, referencing the campaign pledge. Recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital was ""nothing more or less than a recognition of reality"", he added. ""It is also the right thing to do."" The Republican Jewish Coalition have already thanked the president in a New York Times ad.,externalThe group is backed by Republican and Trump campaign mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. Why settlement issue is so difficult How are capital cities chosen? Analysis, by Barbara Plett-Usher, BBC News, Washington The president emphasised several times that he was delivering on a campaign promise, signalling that domestic politics was largely what motivated this controversial decision. The announcement would have made more sense as part of a peace plan, but the White House is still drafting one. So the president spent much of the speech pushing back against criticism that he was prejudging his own peace initiative. He insisted that the US was still deeply committed to facilitating a deal acceptable to both sides, and was not taking a position on the final status of the holy city. That seemed to imply the Palestinian claim to occupied East Jerusalem would still be on the table in any negotiations. But his argument would have been more convincing to them if he had spelled that out, and if he had clearly stated that the end goal was two states. Instead he said the US would support such a solution if agreed to by both sides - not the unequivocal endorsement the Palestinians were looking for. He didn't offer the Palestinians anything, and the speech came across as an endorsement of Israel. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a historic day, and Israel was profoundly grateful to President Trump. ""Jerusalem has been the focus of our hopes, our dreams, our prayers for three millennia,"" he tweeted. Mr Abbas, the Palestinian leader, said in a pre-recorded TV speech that the city was the ""eternal capital of the state of Palestine"". He earlier warned of ""dangerous consequences"" through a spokesman, a sentiment echoed by other Arab leaders, who said there could be unrest. This video can not be played Palestinians and Israelis react to US plan to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital There were demonstrations in Gaza against the decision before it was announced in response to a call from the Islamist Hamas movement that runs the Gaza strip, local pro-Hamas media reported. Hamas said that Mr Trump's decision would ""open the doors of hell"" on US interests in the region. The US decision comes despite vocal opposition in the Muslim world, even among US allies. On Tuesday Saudi Arabia's King Salman had said that the move ""would constitute a flagrant provocation of Muslims, all over the world"". Demonstrations have already taken place in Gaza and outside the US consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said it was ""a moment of great anxiety"". ""There is no alternative to the two-state solution. There is no Plan B,"" he said. In other reaction: Prime Minister Theresa May said she disagreed with the US decision, which was ""unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region"" French President Emmanuel Macron said France did not support the move and called for calm EU chief diplomat Federica Mogherini voiced ""serious concern"" Concern to alarm - global reaction How are capital cities chosen?

Saudi Arabia called it ""unjustified and irresponsible"", while France and the UK said they did not support the decision. But Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu hailed it as ""historic"" and said he was sure more countries would follow suit. President Trump's move reversed decades of US policy on one of the thorniest issues between Israel and Palestinians.

Trump's speech in full Five key takeaways from speech How are capital cities chosen? Mr Trump said the US would support a two-state solution - shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel - ""if agreed to by both sides"". The president also refrained from using Israel's description of Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided capital"". The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of any future Palestinian state. Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was profoundly grateful to Mr Trump, who had ""bound himself forever with the history of the capital"". He also said Israel was ""in touch with other countries to follow suit. I have no doubt other embassies will move to Jerusalem - the time has come."" He did not name any of these countries, although the Philippines and the Czech Republic have been singled out in Israeli media. The Republican Jewish Coalition thanked the president in a New York Times ad.,external The mood was very different on the Palestinian side, with a day of strikes and protests planned. The leader of the Islamist movement Hamas, which dominates Gaza, called for a ""day of rage"" on Friday and said it should ""be the first day of the intifada against the occupier"".

""We are going to declare the United States disqualified as co-sponsor of any peace process or political process,"" spokesman Dr Nasser al-Kidwa said. ""In our mind, it has lost its ability to do or perform any efforts in this regard."" The Arab and the wider Muslim world - including a number of US allies - condemned Mr Trump's announcement. Demonstrations broke out outside the US consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, and in Jordan's capital Amman.

""What do you want to do Mr Trump? What kind of an approach is this? Political leaders exist not to create struggles but to make peace,"" he said. Top Iraqi Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani said the move ""hurt the feelings of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims"". Which countries condemned Trump's move? The Saudi royal court said it ""represents a significant decline in efforts to push a peace process and is a violation of the historically neutral American position on Jerusalem"". UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said it was ""a moment of great anxiety"". ""There is no alternative to the two-state solution,"" he stressed. In other reaction: British Prime Minister Theresa May said she disagreed with the US decision, which was ""unhelpful in terms of prospects for peace in the region"" French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel both said their countries did not support the move EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini voiced ""serious concern"" Mr Trump's announcement puts the US at odds with the rest of the international community's view on Jerusalem's status. Because of its importance to both Israel and the Palestinians, its final status, according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. What are the alternatives to a two-state solution? Why settlement issue is so difficult Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. Jerusalem contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity.

"Labour's chief whip in the House of Lords is to stand down in the New Year following criticism of his expenses. Lord Bassam has referred himself to the standards watchdog and agreed to repay the cost of travel to and from his Brighton home since 2010. The peer, who also had a Â£36,366 allowance for staying overnight in London, says he has not been told he has broken any rules. But he said it would have been ""more appropriate"" not to claim the money. Labour said Lord Bassam, who is a member of Jeremy Corbyn's shadow cabinet, would make way once a successor had been elected in January or February. A spokesman said the peer had already referred himself to the Lords standards commissioner to determine whether he had broken the peers' code of conduct. After theMail On Sunday reported,externalLord Bassam claimed the Â£6,400 annual cost of travelling to and from his home in Brighton, the former leader of Brighton Council said he would not submit such claims again. According to the paper, Lord Bassam is one of a small number of front bench peers also entitled to theLords office holders allowance,external. This is because of his role as chief whip and because his main home is not in London. The payment is included in his salary and designed to cover ""expenses in staying overnight away from their main or only residence"". In a statement, Lord Bassam said: ""With my home outside of London, I have been in receipt of the relevant office holders allowance for the opposition chief whip in the Lords. ""At the same time, in accordance with rules laid down by the House, I have claimed costs for my regular travel to and from Parliament. ""While I have not been advised that any breach of the rules has taken place, waiving the right to such travel claims would perhaps have been a more appropriate response on my part. ""I will not be submitting any further claims in this way, and instead use the office holders allowance to cover those additional costs. I will also discuss with House officials the steps necessary to repay previous travel claims.""

"The number of long A&E waits across the UK has more than doubled in the past four years as hospitals struggle to cope with demand, BBC analysis shows. Northern Ireland has the worst performance, although England has seen the fastest deterioration, the figures show. Over 3m patients who visited UK A&Es waited over four hours in the past 12 months - up by 120% since 2012-13. By comparison the number of visits has only risen by just over 7% to 26.9m.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. Doctors and nurses said the findings showed the NHS could no longer cope with what was being asked of it and patients were being put at risk. And Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the A&E system had been ""stretched to its very limits"". ""Staff are working really hard. But we've reached a point where we cannot meet demand. ""Life-threatening cases are prioritised. But a crowded emergency department adds risk. We get delays to assessment, pain relief and antibiotics."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies agreed, describing the situation as ""intolerable"" and A&E units as ""full to bursting"". ""Nursing staff in A&E units have been telling us it's hard for them to do more than firefight,"" she added. The data compiled by the BBC shows a significant difference in performance against the four-hour target for treating or admitting patients. In Northern Ireland, which has seen the biggest rise in people coming to A&E units, just 75% of patients were seen in four hours in 2016-17, whereas Scotland saw 93.9% - only marginally lower than the 95% target. In fact Scotland is the only part of the UK performing better than it was four years ago. England has seen the biggest rise in long waiters - a 155% increase. In Scotland the number of long waiters actually fell by 9%. Regionally in England the West Midlands has the worst performance followed by the North West - patients visiting A&Es in those areas are more than twice as likely to wait over four hours than those in the North East, the best-performing region. There are minor variations in the way the target is measured across the four nations, although they are considered broadly comparable. NI emergency departments among slowest Scottish A&E bucks trend on long waits A&E visits top one million a year mark in Wales The BBC has been speaking to a number of hospital staff this week about their experiences. Many wanted to remain anonymous given the political sensitivity about the performance of the health service. But all agreed the pressures were as great as they had ever experienced. One nurse, who works in an A&E unit in south Wales, said his department faced relentless ""24/7"" pressure. ""I know of colleagues who leave a shift and then come back the next day and find the patient is still there. We have seen them in A&E but there are not beds in hospital. It causes overcrowding and all sorts of delays. ""Ambulances queue outside A&Es as the staff are too busy to take patients off them. I've worked in A&Es for over 10 years and this is as bad as I can remember."" Another nurse, from London, said: ""You feel you are failing patients. This is not the sort of care we want to provide, or patients deserve. ""We obviously prioritise the most serious cases, but when it is this busy there is always a risk you miss something. I sometimes finish my shift and end up worrying about my patients."" Patients have also been contacting the BBC. One of those was Hayley Hughes, who waited over five-and-a-half hours at an A&E unit in Wales after sustaining a head injury. ""I kept falling asleep, which worried my partner. ""There was another couple we were speaking to who had got to A&E about an hour before we did, and they were still waiting when we left. I'd say they were there for about six-and-a-half, maybe seven hours. ""It's ridiculous. Whilst I was being assessed you could see the strain on the faces of the staff."" Unless the NHS can get its existing network of hospitals to see patients more quickly, the health service would need another 20 A&Es staffed by at least 170 consultants to hit the target again. But each nation believes the answer to the problem lies in trying to control the numbers turning up at A&E and ensuring they pass through hospital more quickly when they do need treatment by freeing up beds. This is done by making sure there are spare beds in care homes and care services in the community, to hand over frail patients to. In Scotland, for example, NHS budgets have been pooled with council funds to create a closer working relationship between hospitals and care in the community, which is one of the reasons why ministers there believe they have performed better than the rest of the UK. In England an extra Â£1bn is being invested in social care this year, while Â£435m has been freed up to help with winter planning, including putting GPs in A&Es to deal with the more minor cases. A Department of Health spokesman said ministers acknowledge the NHS was ""under pressure due to the ageing population"", but he pointed out that despite the deterioration, nine in 10 patients were still dealt with in four hours. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said the money had come too late. ""We are not where we would want to be as we head into winter. We cannot say with certainty how tough this winter will be, but the likelihood is that services will be sorely tested."" A spokesman for the Welsh Government said there were signs performance was improving when you compared this year to last year instead of four years ago. But he admitted winter would be ""challenging"".

"Google says its AlphaGo Zero artificial intelligence program has triumphed at chess against world-leading specialist software within hours of teaching itself the game from scratch. The firm's DeepMind division says that it played 100 games against Stockfish 8, and won or drew all of them. Theresearch has yet to be peer reviewed,external. But experts already suggest the achievement will strengthen the firm's position in a competitive sector. ""From a scientific point of view, it's the latest in a series of dazzling results that DeepMind has produced,"" the University of Oxford's Prof Michael Wooldridge told the BBC. ""The general trajectory in DeepMind seems to be to solve a problem and then demonstrate it can really ramp up performance, and that's very impressive."" DeepMind has previously won a series of Go games against some of the world's top human players DeepMind has previously defeated several of the world's top human players of the Chinese board game Go, as well as teaching itself how to play video games including Pong and Space Invaders. The London-based team is currently trying to develop a system that can beat humansat the space strategy game Starcraft,external, which is seen as being an even more complex challenge. Google is not commenting on the research until it is published in a journal. However, details published onCornell University's Arxiv site,externalstate that an algorithm dubbed AlphaZero was able to outperform Stockfish just four hours after being given the rules of chess and being told to learn by playing simulations against itself. In the 100 games that followed, each program was given one minute's worth of thinking time per move. DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis was previously involved in making computer games, including Theme Park AlphaZero won 25 games in which it played with white pieces, giving it the first move, and a further three in which it played with black pieces. The two programs drew the remaining 72 games. DeepMind described the level of performance achieved as being ""superhuman"". Google highlighted that Stockfish 8 had previously won 2016's Top Chess Engine Championship. The software was first released in 2008 and has been built on by volunteers in the years since. The open source project has been beaten by another program, Komodo, in two major computer chess challenges this year. Even so, one human chess grandmaster was still hugely impressed by DeepMind's victory. ""I always wondered how it would be if a superior species landed on earth and showed us how they played chess,"" Peter Heine Nielsen told the BBC. ""Now I know."" AlphaGo Zero's latest achievements do not rest on chess alone. The paper says it was also triumphant in the Japanese board game Shogi versus a leading artificial intelligence program named Elmo, after two hours of self-training. The AlphaZero algorithm won 90 games, drew two and lost eight. Furthermore, after eight hours of self-training it was also able to beat the previous version of itself at Go - winning 60 games and losing 40. Shogi is sometimes known as Japanese chess Prof Wooldridge noted that all three games were fairly ""closed"" in the sense they had limited sets of rules to contend with. ""In the real world we don't know what is round the corner,"" he explained. ""Coping when you don't know what is coming is much more complicated, and things will get even more exciting when DeepMind moves on to more open problems."" The University of Bath's AI expert Prof Joanna Bryson added that people should be cautious about buying too deeply into the firm's hype. But she added that its knack for good publicity had put it in a strong position against challengers. ""It's not only about hiring the best programmers,"" she said. ""It's also very political, as it helps makes Google as strong as possible when negotiating with governments and regulators looking at the AI sector.""

The magazine illustrates the ubiquitous nature of sexual harassment by showcasing women from markedly different backgrounds on its cover.,external Two celebrities are featured - Ashley Judd, one of the first to speak out against Mr Weinstein, and pop singer Taylor Swift, who won a civil case against an ex-DJ who she said had grabbed her bottom. They are shown alongside Isabel Pascual, a 42-year-old strawberry picker from Mexico (not her real name); Adama Iwu, a 40-year-old corporate lobbyist in Sacramento; and Susan Fowler, 26, a former Uber engineer whose allegation brought down Uber's CEO. But many more people are identified as part of the movement behind the cover shot. BBC Trending: How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo This ""moment"", the magazine says, ""doesn't have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #MeToo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it... ""The women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe."" But, it says, collectively they have helped turn shame into outrage and fear into fury, put thousands of people on to the streets demanding change, and seen a slew of powerful men held accountable for their behaviour. Those featured include Tarana Burke, the activist who created the #MeToo hashtag more than a decade ago, the actor Alyssa Milano who helped it explode on social media last October,actor Terry Crews, a group of hotel workers who have filed a lawsuit against their employer, State Senator Sara Gelser, an anonymous hospital worker who fears losing her job if she speaks openly, and Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News journalist whom Donald Trump accused of having ""blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever"" after she moderated a debate during the presidential campaign. Ironically, President Trump - whose election Ms Kelly said was a ""setback for women"" that helps explain the #MeToo movement - was named as runner-up for Person of the Year this year, having been given the title last year. In 2006, the Person of the Year was simply ""You"", reflecting the importance of user-generated internet content. The magazine's tradition - begun in 1927 as ""Man of the Year"" - recognises the person who ""for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year"". The great majority of people selected have been individuals - but by no means all. In 2014, ""Ebola fighters"" were recognised while in 2011 ""The Protester"" acknowledged the significance of the so-called Arab Spring. It was in 1950, the magazine explains, that the ""mould was broken"" and ""The American fighting-man"" was chosen,external, to be followed by Hungarians in 1956 and later on Scientists, Americans under 25 and Mr and Mrs Middle America. In 2006, the Person of the Year was simply ""You"", with a mirror cover design, reflecting the importance of user-generated internet content.
