"Alfie Lamb was described in court as a ""smiley"" boy A three-year-old boy was fatally crushed by a car passenger seat pushed back by his mother's boyfriend who felt he was being too noisy, a court heard. Alfie Lamb, 3, cried out ""mummy"" before going ""ominously quiet"" in the footwell of the car, the Old Bailey was told. His mother, Adrian Hoare, 23, allegedly lied to police, telling them Alfie was in a taxi when he became unresponsive after falling asleep, in February 2018. She and her boyfriend Stephen Waterson deny manslaughter at the Old Bailey. Front passenger Mr Waterson, 25, allegedly pushed his seat back twice in anger at the ""noise and fuss"" Alfie was making in the rear footwell of an Audi being driven by acquaintance Marcus Lamb. Ms Hoare, who lives with Mr Waterson in Adams Way, Croydon, was in the rear seat, sitting above her son. Audi driver Mr Lamb, 22, told police Alfie collapsed during the journey back from shops with his then-girlfriend Emilie Williams, 19, and the defendants. He described how Hoare had been shouting at Alfie, who was screaming and crying. The witness alleged he heard Hoare slap her child before the front passenger seat moved back as Alfie called ""Mummy"". Mr Lamb claimed he only realised there was a problem when they arrived at Adams Way in Croydon, south London. Ms Hoare said ""what have you done?"", when Mr Waterson pulled Alfie from the car, Mr Lamb claimed. Duncan Atkinson QC, prosecuting, said a pathologist found the ""smiley boy"" died from crush asphyxia. ""It was caused by the front passenger seat of the Audi vehicle, Waterson's seat, being moved back further into the rear passenger side footwell at a time when, as was known, Alfie was in that footwell,"" Mr Atkinson said. ""In effect, he was squashed by the car seat and suffocated. This movement of the seat was a deliberate action by Waterson, who knew that Alfie was there and was angered by the noise and fuss that the three-and-a-half-year-old was making during the fateful car journey. ""The deliberate movement of the seat, by electrical operation by the touch of a button and involving the application of considerable force to Alfie, took place not once but twice."" Three charged over death of three-year-old boy in Croydon News and updates from across London Mr Atkinson said Mr Waterson moved the seat forward when others in the car realised it was causing Alfie to have breathing difficulties. ""However, when Alfie made noise again, Waterson deliberately moved his seat back again, and kept it in that reversed position, squashing Alfie, as he again showed signs of breathing problems until he went ominously quiet,"" he said. Ms Hoare had a duty of care to Alfie but did ""nothing"" to help him, Mr Atkinson added. Despite Mr Lamb trying to resuscitate the child, it was obvious to police and medics that Alfie had been dead for some time when they were called to Adams Way on the evening of 1 February, Mr Atkinson said. Alfie was found in cardiac arrest and was taken to hospital but his life support machine was switched off days later. Ms Hoare allegedly told paramedics Alfie had fallen asleep in a taxi, but was unresponsive when she tried to wake him. Mr Atkinson said this was ""only the beginning of the lies that she, and others, were to tell"". Police found CCTV footage of Ms Hoare, Mr Waterson, Mr Lamb and his ex Emilie Williams in a dark Audi car. Since then, Miss Williams had been attacked by Ms Hoare, and Mr Lamb intimidated by Mr Waterson, the court heard. Mr Lamb, 22, and Miss Williams, 19, are due to give evidence against the defendants. Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty, and common assault on Miss Williams. Mr Waterson denies manslaughter, and intimidation of Mr Lamb. The couple and Miss Williams have admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making false statements to police. The trial is expected to last four weeks.

"Gina Martin celebrated with her lawyer Ryan Whelan A woman who launched a campaign against upskirting after being targeted at a festival 18 months ago has said ""we did it!"" after legislation was passed to make it a crime in England and Wales. The new legislation, approved in the House of Lords and now only awaiting the formality of Royal Assent, will see offenders face up to two years in jail. Gina Martin, 26, said the decision was ""politics and society at its best"". Upskirting has been covered by legislation in Scotland since 2010. Speaking after the bill was approved,  Gina said: ""Eighteen months ago I was upskirted at a music festival and I decided I wasn't going to brush it off. ""I was tired of 'ignoring it'. I felt this was wrong and I was astounded to learn that upskirting wasn't a sexual offence. I wanted to change this for everyone, because the least we deserve is to be able to wear what we want without non-consensual photos being taken of us."" Gina was waiting to watch The Killers perform at British Summer Time music festival in London's Hyde Park when a man put his phone between her legs and took pictures of her crotch. Gina Martin could not believe that, when she caught a man taking an upskirting photo, there was nothing that could be done After informing the police, she was shocked to discover upskirting was not a specific offence. I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block Upskirting ban 'also protects men in kilts' A few days later she posted a status update on Facebook detailing her experience. Her post went viral with other women sharing similar experiences. Soon an online petition to get her case reopened with the police had received 50,000 signatures andshe wrote a feature for the BBC News website explaining her battle.It recalled the dramatic moment when she chased after the man who had taken the unwanted photo. This video can not be played Gina Martin campaigned for the law to be changed after a man took a picture up her skirt It wasn't long before the campaign was picked up by Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse. Encouraged by government ministers, she brought a private members' bill backing the creation of an upskirting offence. Her bill was expected to sail through the Commons, but parliamentary rules meant it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. And one MP did just that. Conservative MP Sir Christopher Chope had a track record of objecting to private members' bills on a point of principle, because he does not agree with legislation being brought before Parliament on a Friday without enough time for a full debate. By shouting ""Object"", he stopped this bill in its tracks - even though he later insisted he actually backed what Gina Martin was doing, This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill The Christchurch MP's intervention was immediately met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs and a few days later an anonymous protester showed a more visible sign of dissent by hanging four pairs of knickers across the MP's office door at the Commons.

But there was still hope for Gina and her campaign. Theresa May said she was ""disappointed"" and vowed that the government would take on the job of pushing the law change through parliament. She said it was necessary, describing upskirting as a ""hideous invasion of privacy which leaves victims feeling degraded and distressed"". Gina's campaign secured government backing on 15 July last year and the Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill was put before Parliament only days later. For Gina, it has been a ""steep learning curve"" in how the political system works. She said: ""To the outsider, the ordinary person, law and politics are complex and daunting. But both are penetrable if you believe in yourself and find the right support."" This video can not be played ""He was laughing"": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting Until the law is passed specifically naming and banning upskirting, victims and police in England and Wales are currently only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism. Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private while outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved. Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have automatic right to anonymity. Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010 when it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism. Nine years later, the actions of one woman have ensured that England will soon be following suit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Miss Millane had been travelling alone in New Zealand A 27-year-old man has denied murdering British backpacker Grace Millane in New Zealand. Miss Millane, 22, from Wickford, Essex, was last seen at a hostel in Auckland on 1 December. Her body was found a week later on the outskirts of the city.

"This video can not be played Romeo (L) is to meet Juliet (R) A frog believed to be the last of his kind in the world has been granted a reprieve from solitude. Romeo, known as the world's loneliest frog, has spent 10 years in isolation at an aquarium in Bolivia. Scientists say they have found him a Juliet after an expedition to a remote Bolivian cloud forest. Five Sehuencas water frogs found in a stream were captured, with the goal of breeding and re-introducing the amphibians back into the wild. Teresa Camacho Badani is chief of herpetology at the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide d'Orbigny in Cochabamba City and the expedition leader. She is optimistic that opposites will attract, even in frogs: ""Romeo is really calm and relaxed and doesn't move a whole lot,"" she told BBC News. ""He's healthy and likes to eat, but he is kind of shy and slow."" Juliet: A female Sehuencas water frog Juliet, however, has a very different personality. ""She's really energetic, she swims a lot and she eats a lot and sometimes she tries to escape."" The five frogs - three males and two females - are the first Seheuncas water frogs to be seen in the wild for a decade, despite previous searches in the Bolivian wilderness. Romeo was collected 10 years ago when biologists knew the species was in trouble, but was not expected to remain alone for so long. He attracted international attention a year ago over his search for a mate, and was even given a dating profile. Race to find mate for 'lonely' frog The newly discovered frogs are now in quarantine at the museum's conservation centre, where the race is on to stop the species from becoming extinct. Juliet with Teresa Camacho Badani An aquatic frog (Telmatobius yuracare) that was once abundant in the small streams, rivers and ponds of the montane cloud forest of Bolivia Water frogs are declining rapidly in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru They face a combination of threats, including climate change, habitat destruction and the introduction of invasive trout Chris Jordan of Global Wildlife Conservation, which is supporting conservation efforts, said there is risk to taking animals into captivity. However, there are too few of the frogs in the wild to maintain a viable population in the long term, he said. ""We have a real chance to save the Sehuencas water frog - restoring a unique part of the diversity of life that is the foundation of Bolivia's forests, and generating important information on how to restore similar species at grave risk of extinction."" More frogs were found on an expedition The re-discovered frogs will be treated to protect against an infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, which is wiping out amphibians around the world. Romeo will then meet Juliet, in an attempt to produce offspring that can eventually be put back into their natural habitat. In Bolivia, 22% of amphibian species face some degree of extinction threat, from habitat loss, pollution and climate change. Searching the streams for frogs Teresa Camacho Badani says Romeo's story is important to draw attention to the plight of amphibians. They did not find any other water frogs in adjacent streams, raising worrying questions about the health of the ecosystem. ""It's a really good opportunity to use Romeo to help understand those threats, help understand how to bring those species back from the brink but also at the same time to take advantage of the global profile that Romeo and his species has now,"" she said. BBC World Service - The Inquiry, Can We Stop a Mass Extinction Other amphibians such as the Mallorcan midwife toad in Spain and the Kihansi spray toad of Tanzania have been bred and reintroduced from just a few individuals in the past. ""They provide hope in the context of this sixth mass extinction that there are solutions to maintain our wonderful biodiversity, to protect endangered and even extinct-in-the-wild species and bring them back and restore some of the beauty of these ecosystems,"" said Chris Jordan. All species are important and should not be underestimated as their DNA represents millions and millions of years of evolution, he added. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"William Barr is Mr Trump's nominee to lead the justice department President Donald Trump's nominee to be US attorney general has vowed he will not be bullied by the president. William Barr also told his confirmation hearing the US inquiry into Russia's alleged 2016 election meddling is not a witch hunt, as Mr Trump labels it. As top US law officer, Mr Barr would lead the Department of Justice, which is meant to be politically independent. But Democrats asked why he wrote in a legal memo last year that an aspect of the probe was ""fatally misconceived"". Mr Barr sought to assure senators on the Senate judiciary committee in Tuesday's hearing that he is no Trump loyalist. Democrats on the committee wanted to know if Mr Barr - who was also attorney general under President George HW Bush - could stand up to Mr Trump. ""I will not be bullied into doing anything I think is wrong by anybody whether it be editorial boards or Congress or the president,"" he said. ""I am going to do what I think is right."" He repeatedly said special counsel Robert Mueller must be allowed to complete his inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with an alleged Russian plot to influence the 2016 US presidential election. ""I think the Russians interfered or attempted to interfere in the election and we have to get to the bottom of it,"" he said. ""On my watch, Bob [Mueller] will be allowed to complete his work,"" Mr Barr said of the inquiry, which has cast a cloud over the Republican president's two years in office. ""I don't believe Mr Mueller would be involved in a witch hunt,"" he also said in a remark that contradicts Mr Trump's own statements. The nominee also told senators he had been a personal friend of Mr Mueller for 30 years. You may also be interested in: Did Trump fire Comey as part of a cover-up? The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words All you need to know about Trump Russia story Democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy asked if a US president could pardon someone on condition that person agreed not to incriminate him. ""No, that would be a crime,"" Mr Barr responded. Mr Trump's critics have speculated he might offer clemency to two former aides who fell foul of the Mueller inquiry. Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn were convicted of crimes including bank fraud and lying to federal agents. In another key moment, Mr Barr was asked about former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' self-recusal from the Russia inquiry, a decision that infuriated Mr Trump. Mr Barr said his predecessor ""did the right thing"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington The US attorney general sets the government's criminal justice policies, oversees an army of investigators and prosecutors, and provides administration guidance on a wide range of legal issues. He or she is both the nation's top prosecutor and law enforcement officer. Confirmation hearings for the post would involve close scrutiny at any time and in any situation. At the moment, however, nominee William Barr's views on the ongoing Russia investigation are all that seem to matter. Mr Barr is saying the right things so far. He assured senators he has the highest respect for special counsel Robert Mueller and will not interfere with his probe. He said he will not be bullied or influenced by anybody, including the president. Set against this testimony is Mr Barr's past written criticism of the special counsel's conduct. Democrats will have to decide whether his recent promises are enough to overcome their concerns. Given Mr Barr's long history of government service and the fact that Republicans hold a majority in the Senate, successful confirmation seems fairly certain. Democrats will do their best to lock Mr Barr into supporting the Russia probe, but the only remaining question is how many will eventually vote for him. Democrats suggested a critical 20-page memo that Mr Barr wrote last year to the justice department was a ""job interview"" to impress Mr Trump. But the nominee called that suggestion ""ludicrous"". He defended his ""entirely proper"" decision to criticise Mr Mueller's investigation into whether the president had sought to obstruct justice. Mr Barr had written that the special counsel should not be able to interview the president about his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey. On Tuesday the nominee told senators former senior officials often gave their views on significant matters. He said he would consult ethics officials on whether he would need to recuse himself because of the memo, but made clear the final decision would be his. Mr Barr stopped short of promising to release Mr Mueller's report. He said he hoped to disclose ""as much"" of the findings as was ""consistent with the rules and regulations"".

"This video can not be played Rahaf Mohammed told Canadian media she'll work in support of women's freedom around the world A Saudi teenager given asylum in Canada after fleeing her family has said the journey was ""worth the risk"" so she could live a more independent life. Rahaf Mohammed, 18, made headlines when she flew to Thailand and barricaded herself in a hotel while appealing on Twitter for help to avoid deportation. She said she feared being killed if she was sent back to her family. ""It's something that is worth the risk I took,""she told the Toronto Star,externaland CBC News. ""I had nothing to lose."" ""We are treated as an object, like a slave,"" she said. ""I wanted to tell people my story and about what happens to Saudi women."" This video can not be played Rahaf Mohammed: 'I can't believe what has happened to me' Under Saudi Arabia's guardianship system, women must obtain permission from a male relative to travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married or even leave prison. 'I needed consent to leave the house' Arrested for disobeying your father #SaveRahaf: How Twitter saved a Saudi woman Ms Mohammed - who has dropped her surname, al-Qunun - alleged that her family had subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. ""In the beginning they locked me up for six months after I cut my hair... because it is forbidden in Islam for a woman to dress like a man,"" she told reporters at the office of an immigrant settlement agency in Toronto. ""But I was mostly exposed to violence by my mother and my brother,"" she added. ""They were beating me and there was corporal violence."" This video can not be played The #SaveRahaf campaign went viral after Rahaf started tweeting about her plight for asylum While she was in Thailand, Ms Mohammed also told the BBC that she had renounced Islam - a crime that is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. She had been on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight to Bangkok on 5 January, saying she intended to take a connecting flight to Australia and had an Australian visa. But she says her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight, leaving her stranded. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""During this time, I was thinking about what kind of goodbye messages I would write, because I was not going to allow them to take me. I was prepared to end my life before they kidnapped me,""she told CBC,external. Her case was picked up by Human Rights Watch and numerous journalists. Thailand eventually allowed her to stay and the UN assessed her claim for asylum. On Tuesday, Ms Mohammed gave a statement to media in Toronto and called herself ""one of the lucky ones"". She said that she wants ""to be independent, travel, make my own decisions on education, a career, or who, and when I should marry"". ""I had no say in all this,"" she said in Arabic. ""Today I proudly say I am capable of making all those decisions."" Ms Mohammed was met at Toronto's airport by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland Last Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that his country would accept Ms Mohammed as a refugee. The following day she was met at Toronto's international airport by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland. Ms Freeland and her ministry enraged the Saudi government in Augustwhen they called for the release of several women's rights activists campaigning for the male guardianship system to be abolished who were detained as part of an apparent crackdown on dissent. Riyadh responded by freezing all new trade with Canada and expelling its ambassador over its ""interference"" in the kingdom's domestic affairs. The Saudi government has not commented since Ms Qanun's arrival, but the head of the state-funded National Society for Human Rights said on Monday that he had been ""surprised by some countries' incitement of some Saudi female delinquents to rebel against the values of their families"".

""I feel very safe in Canada, a country that respects human rights,"" Ms Mohammed said. She added: ""I feel born again from feeling the love coming from everyone waiting for my arrival."" Ms Mohammed said that, although the Canadian weather may take some getting used to, she was excited for the new experiences ahead. ""I will try things I haven't tried,"" she said. ""I will learn things I didn't learn. I will explore life.... I will have a job and live a normal life."" Like a typical 18-year-old, one of the first things Ms Mohammed did upon her arrival, after getting clothing appropriate for the Canadian winter, was purchasing a smart phone, an official at the immigrant settlement agency said. The Canadian government offers refugees financial support for up to a year,external, as well as help with finding housing and registering for federal and provincial programmes, and English lessons. Mario Calla, executive director with Costi Immigrant Services, which is assisting Ms Mohammed in Canada, said they have temporarily hired a private security guard for the Saudi teen because of the threats she has received on social media. He said that because of the possible risks they are considering settling her - at least for the foreseeable future - with a family to ensure she is not living alone. Her fast-tracked refugee claim has not been received entirely without criticism and Mr Trudeau was asked this week what message it sent to the many other refugee claimants hoping for Canadian asylum. The prime minister said her asylum was granted on a ""specific and precise request"" by the UNHCR, adding ""we know that this is quite an exceptional case but Canada will always be there for people who are in difficulty"". Mr Calla said her case is not without precedent, and that his organisation alone receives about two ""urgent protection"" cases a year.

"The court ruled that McDonald's had not proven genuine use of the trademark as a burger or a restaurant name An Irish fast food company has won a case against McDonald's to prevent it trademarking the terms ""Big Mac"" and ""Mc"" in some instances in Europe. The European Union Intellectual Property Office ruled McDonald's had not proven genuine use of ""Big Mac"" as a burger or restaurant name. Galway-based Supermac's said it opened the door to register its brand in Europe as a trademark. Supermac's managing director hailed the ""end of the McBully"". This is not the first time McDonald's has gone to the courts over prefixes. A European court previously upheld a ruling that aSingaporean company - MacCoffee - had unfairly benefited from the branding of the US burger giantdue to its use of the ""Mac"" prefix. Supermac's had previously attempted to expand operations into UK and Europe. However this move was brought to a halt after McDonald's won a battle over the similarity between the name Supermac's and Big Mac. Supermac's managing director Pat McDonagh told Irish broadcaster RTÃ it had been a ""David versus Goliath scenario"" ""But just because McDonald's has deep pockets and we are relatively small in context, doesn't mean we weren't going to fight our corner,"" he added. ""We've been saying for years that they (McDonald's) have been using trademark bullying. ""This is the end of the McBully.""

"Former Mexican president Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto (L) and JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n (R) Former Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto accepted a $100m (Â£77m) bribe from drug cartel kingpin JoaquÃ­n ""El Chapo"" GuzmÃ¡n, a witness has testified. Alex Cifuentes, who says he was a close associate of GuzmÃ¡n for years, told a New York City courtroom that he had told authorities of the bribe in 2016. GuzmÃ¡n is accused of being behind the Sinaloa drug cartel, which prosecutors say was the largest US drug supplier. Mr PeÃ±a Nieto served as the president of Mexico from 2012 to 2018. GuzmÃ¡n, 61, has been on trial in Brooklyn since November after he was extradited from Mexico to face charges of trafficking cocaine, heroin and other drugs as leader of what the US has called the world's largest drug cartel. ""El Chapo"" (right) is the highest-ranking alleged drug lord to face trial in the US so far According to reporters in the Brooklyn courthouse, Mr PeÃ±a Nieto had requested $250m before settling on $100m. Cifuentes claimed the delivery was made to Mexico City in October 2012 by a friend of El Chapo. Crazy moments from El Chapo's trial Mexico's most-wanted: A guide to the drug cartels Cifuentes, a Colombian drug lord who has described himself as El Chapo's ""right-hand man"", worked as his secretary and spent two years hiding from authorities with him in the Mexican mountains, according to prosecutors. He was arrested in Mexico in 2013 and was later extradited to the United States where he pleaded guilty to drug trafficking in a deal with prosecutors. Mr PeÃ±a Nieto has not responded to the latest claim, but has previously rejected allegations of corruption that have surfaced during the trial since it began in November. What to expect from El Chapo's trial Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Brooklyn The trial in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn is a security circus - with guards everywhere and metal detectors set up in different areas of the building, leading to the courtroom on the eighth floor. Outside of the building, part of the street is blocked off. The trial itself has offered macabre details about assassinations carried out by drug traffickers and stunning allegations about state officials. After the a former top lieutenant for El Chapo testified of an alleged bribe to the former Mexican president, reporters rushed out of the courtroom, heading to file their stories. It's hard to know what to believe when former drug traffickers testify, but one thing is clear: the tight security makes sense in a place where the stakes are so high. GuzmÃ¡n's lawyer, Jeffrey Lichtman, has argued that the real leader of the Sinaloa cartel is Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada. He claims Mr Zambada has survived prosecution by bribing the ""entire"" Mexican government, including Mr PeÃ±a Nieto and former president Felipe CalderÃ³n. President PeÃ±a Nieto and Mr CalderÃ³nimmediately rejected the accusation, with the latter calling it ""absolutely false and reckless"". In November another cartel member testified that an aide to current Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador was allegedly paid a bribe in 2005. Cifuentes testified earlier on Friday that El Chapo had ordered a $10m bribe be paid to a general, but later decided to have him killed instead. The hit was never carried out.

"A Gillette advert which references bullying, the #MeToo movement and toxic masculinity has split opinion online. The razor company's short film, called Believe, plays on their famous slogan ""The best a man can get"", replacing it with ""The best men can be"". The company says it wants men to hold each other ""accountable"". Some have praised the message of the advert, which aims to update the company's 30-year-old tagline, but others say Gillette is ""dead"" to them. The ad has been watched more than 2 million times on YouTube in 48 hours. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It then shows examples of more positive behaviour - such as stepping into prevent these behaviours when they happen in public. In the advert, one man stops his friend from harassing a woman in the street Comments on the video are largely negative, with viewers saying they will never buy Gillette products again or that the advert was ""feminist propaganda"". ""In less than two minutes you managed to alienate your biggest sales group for your products. Well doneï»¿,"" wrote one angry viewer. Twitter users are also sharing their disappointment with Gillette's new campaign. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There have also been calls for Gillette, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, topost an apology video.,external But the brand believes the new advert aligns with its slogan and says it believes in ""the best in men."" ""By holding each other accountable, eliminating excuses for bad behaviour, and supporting a new generation working toward their personal 'best,' we can help create positive change that will matter for years to come,"" says its president, Gary Coombe. The advert was directed by Kim Gehrig from the UK-based production company Somesuch, who also directed the 2015 campaign for Sport England, This Girl Can. The advert encourages men to act with more respect and to set a positive example to young boys Gillette has partnered with the Building A Better Man project, which seeks to reduce violent behaviour in men, and The Boys and Girls Club of America, which helps young men develop better social and communication skills. It's also donating $1m (around Â£778,000) a year for the next three years to US charities aimed at supporting men. But while the response to the ad has been largely negative, as the old saying goes, there's no such thing as bad publicity. ""Their next steps are very important but it shouldn't necessarily be widespread panic yet,"" Rob Saunders, an account manager at UK advertising company the Media Agency Group, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Their ad is getting them good publicity and good numbers and causing a debate - which they must have known when they put out this ad. Rob says Gillette will have anticipated a negative reaction to the advert from some people. ""This ad would have been approved by many people high up at Gillette,"" he adds. ""So they must have known that there may have been a backlash."" Rob believes the strong reaction is because the ad is such a shift from how Gillette was previously promoted and that has surprised people. ""It's such a change in stance for Gillette and it's happening overnight, particularly with the social commentary and that's why it's done such huge numbers."" But alongside the negative reaction to the brand's new message, there has also been widespread praise for its attempt to join the debate on what it means to be a modern man. Allow Twitter content?

"After days of debate MPs have decisively rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal by 432 votes to 202. Nearly 120 Conservative MPs voted against their leader.

Only three Labour MPs supported the prime minister's deal: Ian Austin (Dudley North), Sir Kevin Barron (Rother Valley) and John Mann (Bassetlaw). The vote marks the largest defeat of a government motion in 100 years. Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Reality Check: What are the biggest government defeats? Please upgrade your browser A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"This video can not be played MP delays C-section for Brexit vote Among those crowded into the House of Commons in the picture above, for the crunch Brexit vote, is one participant who really did have somewhere else to be - heavily-pregnant Labour MP Tulip Siddiq. That's her in the blue dress, sitting in a wheelchair, turning up to take part in the democratic process. She has revealed that she haddelayed giving birth until later this week so she could voteon the deal. Her actions have reignited the debate over proxy voting in Parliament. The UK does not have a system in place where an MP can nominate a proxy to vote on their behalf, even if they have recently become a parent - or are just about to give birth. There is a system in Parliament for MPs who cannot make a vote called ""pairing"" - where an MP on either side of an issue agree to not vote, so cancelling each other out. However, Ms Siddiq said she did not trust the systemafter Tory chairman Brandon Lewis was accused of breaking the system when he voted on a Trade Bill, despite being paired with Lib Dem Jo Swinson, who was on maternity leave. He later apologised for making an ""honest mistake"". Ms Siddiq, who endured a difficult first pregnancy with her daughter two years ago, had been advised by doctors to have a Caesarean section on Monday or Tuesday this week, but agreed to postpone the procedure until Thursday so she could vote. She said: ""If my son enters the world even one day later than the doctors advised, but it's a world with a better chance of a strong relationship between Britain and Europe, then that's worth fighting for.""

Commons Speaker John Bercow said that a proxy vote for Ms Siddiq would be his ""preference"", but it was not in his power to grant it. However, he was happy for her to be ""nodded through"". This process normally means an MP's vote can be counted if they are anywhere on the parliamentary estate, rather than going through the voting lobby. After the Brexit vote, SNP health spokeswoman Philippa Whitford raised the issue in the Commons. She said Ms Siddiq was due to have a Caesarean section because she has a ""high risk"" pregnancy and gestational diabetes. Dr Whitford told the Commons on a point of order after the Brexit vote: ""I have to say, as a doctor, to put our colleague at risk - and her baby at risk - because we cannot have a method of allowing those who are sick or pregnant (to vote) is disgraceful.""

"The markets were prepared for her to lose - but the scale of her defeat took most by surprise. But more surprising still was the fact that the pound - the first financial responder to political events - gained in value after the vote - despite many, most, confidently predicting a crushing defeat would send it down. So what to make of it? Using the benefit of hindsight, some are saying that the recent display of animosity in the House of Commons to the idea of a no-deal Brexit, something markets are most wary of - has convinced them that outcome is very unlikely. The other new line is that this crushing defeat for her Brexit deal, makes no Brexit - at least not on 29 March - a growing possibility. That's financial markets, which respond in seconds. Real businesses are not so sure. With 72 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU another milestone has come and gone with the future no clearer and planning for no deal more urgent. As one exasperated business group said tonight, politicians are playing a ""high stakes game of political poker"" with the future of the UK economy.

That is a legal attempt to push the government to collapse into a general election. On the runes tonight, it seems unlikely that it will force her into that, but she can't be absolutely sure. PMâs Brexit deal rejected by huge margin LIVE: Updates as MPs reject May's deal Brexitcast: Laura, Katya and the gang on the next steps One of the reasons No 10 has found themselves in this desperate position is because their judgements have been the wrong ones on so many occasions so far. She promised MPs tonight that if she survives the confidence vote, then there will be an attempt to listen to what MPs really want - an effort, at this very late stage, to find common cause in Parliament. But her team has been quick tonight to suggest that, while she is promising to listen, she has no inkling at this stage of dropping her own firm commitments - making it clear that she wants to stick to setting an independent trade policy, which so far shuts down a chance of moving to a Labour-friendly customs union. It doesn't sound tonight like she has any enthusiasm for junking her deal. Indeed, a source that was on a conference call with business leaders - hosted by the chancellor and other cabinet ministers - was told they could not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement. The plan instead was for a ""shake down"" of MPs in the next few days to find out what they would tolerate in terms of promises for the longer term future relationship. As we've discussed here before, the Cabinet doesn't even have a clear view itself on how she should proceed. Today, the leader of the House of Commons told me it would be Brussels that has to move. But some others are crystal clear that the PM will have to soften her offer, because that's what Parliament will tolerate. Pound rises after Brexit vote Reality Check: What are the biggest government defeats? History was made tonight with the scale of this defeat - a higher figure than the wildest of numbers that were gossiped about before the vote. But the prime minister's dilemma is a more serious version of the same it's always been. She has no majority of her own in Parliament to make her middle way through stick. And her many critics don't agree on the direction she should take - a more dramatic break with the EU, or a tighter, softer version. Those two fundamental and clashing positions have always threatened to pull her and the government apart. Even the PM's allies would acknowledge that the government has made plenty of mistakes. But that widespread disagreement across the spectrum is Mrs May's nightmare that, right now, is a bad dream without end.

"This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said the prime minister had suffered a defeat of historic proportions Scotland's first minister has said another referendum on Brexit is now the ""only credible option"" after MPs rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking after MPs voted by 432 to 202 against the deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on 29 March. Labour immediately lodged a vote of no confidence in Mrs May's government following the defeat. Ms Sturgeon is due in London to meet SNP MPs ahead of the confidence vote. She said it was time to ""stop the clock"" on Brexit and ""put this issue back to the electorate"". But Mrs May has signalled her intention to carry on despite suffering the largest defeat for any sitting UK government in history, and has offered cross-party talks in a bid to find a way forward from the current stalemate if she wins the no confidence vote on Wednesday. In a statement released immediately after the vote, the prime minister said: ""The House has spoken and this government will listen."" PMâs Brexit deal rejected by 230 votes Live reaction to May's defeat How did Scottish MPs vote? Ms Sturgeon, whose SNP MPs voted against Mrs May's deal, confirmed her party would back the no confidence motion - which Labour hopes will spark a general election. And she said the ""historic"" scale of the defeat for the prime minister meant the country has now ""reached the point where it would be unconscionable to kick the can any further down the road."" Ms Sturgeon added: ""What must happen now is clear. Firstly, and most urgently, the clock must be stopped on the Article 50 process. This is the only way to avoid any possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU on 29 March without a deal. ""Secondly, legislation must be brought forward to put this issue back to the electorate in another referendum. ""The government has had more than two and a half years to deliver a workable Brexit plan and it has completely failed to do so. The notion that it can do so now in a matter of weeks is farcical."" This video can not be played The prime minister's Brexit deal is backed by 202 MPs but 432  vote against. Ms Sturgeon said another EU referendum with Remain as an option was now the ""only credible option to avoid untold damage to the economy and the prospects of future generations"". And she said it was ""also the only option, within the UK, that would allow Scotland's democratic wish to remain in Europe to be respected"". Mrs May spoke to Ms Sturgeon on the phone late on Tuesday evening as the prime minister started to reach out to other parties. In a post on Twitter following their conversation, Ms Sturgeon said it was ""not obvious that she [Mrs May] has any real idea what to do next"". Allow Twitter content?

The 35 SNP MPs were joined by every Scottish Labour and Liberal Democrat MP in rejecting the deal, as well as three Scottish Conservatives - John Lamont, Ross Thomson and Douglas Ross. But it was backed by the other 10 Scottish Conservatives, including Scottish Secretary David Mundell. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Lamont, Mr Thomson and Mr Ross are expected to back the prime minister in the no confidence vote - as are the vast majority of the 115 other Conservative rebels and the DUP, which strongly opposes Mrs May's Brexit deal but says it wants a change of policy rather than a change of government. Responding to the Commons vote, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird said the prime minister had now lost all authority, and that there was now a ""clear need for a general election to break the deadlock"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who backs another referendum on Brexit, said the ""historic and devastating defeat"" for the prime minister meant her deal and her credibility were now in tatters. But the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, said the prime minister's proposals were the ""only substantial deal on the table"" that would ""avoid No Deal and deliver an orderly Brexit"". Mr Carlaw also challenged Mrs May's opponents to ""set out, quite specifically, how their own alternatives might work, how they would respect the referendum, and how they will secure a majority in parliament"". The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said he regretted the outcome of the vote and has urged the UK government to ""clarify its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible"". By the BBC's head of political research Peter Barnes Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years. The next one is due in 2022. But a vote of no confidence lets MPs vote on whether they want the government to continue. The motion must be worded: ""That this House has no confidence in HM Government."" If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown. If during that time the current government or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called. That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days.

"As MPs on both sides of the Brexit divide battled it out in the Commons ahead of the vote on Theresa May's deal, an even noisier and more passionate debate was going on across the road. With fancy dress, lurid floats and colourful banners, there was something approaching a carnival atmosphere, as the usual ranks of pro and anti-Brexit demonstrators outside Parliament were swollen by people who had travelled to London for the big vote. The two sides mostly kept a respectful distance from each other, as a low-key police presence tried to keep a right of way open for pedestrians. The protest was at times loud - with a group of pro-Brexit demonstrators ringing a ""liberty bell"" and beating a bass drum, with tensions escalating as the MPs' vote approached. Live: MPs debate Brexit deal May facing crunch vote on Brexit deal What voters want MPs to do about Brexit Everyone - with the notable exception of a man wielding a ""leave, then negotiate"" placard - appeared to be united in their disdain for Theresa May's Brexit agreement. ""It's a rubbish deal,"" said retired cab driver Colin Grostate, a card-carrying Conservative Party member, and prospective council candidate. ""Everybody in the country knows, except Theresa May. The lights are on but nobody's home. ""The woman's a nutcase. She's just in denial."" Colin Grostate: ""I am willing to die for the vote"" Mr Grostate, like some of the other pro-Brexit demonstrators, was wearing a yellow vest, in solidarity, he said, with ""working class"" protesters in France. He was angry about what he saw as a betrayal of the result of the 2016 referendum by MPs. ""We voted for freedom, not for money. We didn't say we wanted to be richer or poorer. We voted for freedom."" Mr Grostate, who lives in Ramsgate, has booked himself into a London hotel for four days to protest outside Parliament. ""I am willing to die for the vote. If they don't leave on the 30 March, there's thousands like me up and down the country that is willing to stand their ground. ""We lost 7 million British, Commonwealth and Americans fighting for this country to be free. We are not handing it over to the Europeans, that's for sure."" Peter Hayden, a Labour Party member, was equally angry, albeit in a more understated way, with his party leader. Peter Hayden: ""Labour will be sidelined on this whole issue"" He says he joined Labour because of Jeremy Corbyn's socialist policies - ""I was a Corbynite"" -  but has become disillusioned with Mr Corbyn's refusal to get behind calls for another EU referendum, which is what, he says, the vast majority of Labour members want and what they voted for at their party conference. ""He needs to come off the fence because otherwise the initiative will be taken by the Tories, so Labour will be sidelined on this whole issue."" Like Mr Grostate, the retired author, from Warwickshire, is in London for the week to make his voice heard. ""This is fanatics' alley,"" he says, surveying the protests going on around him. ""Everyone who is here, I suppose you could say including me, they are coming out because they feel fanatical, so you can't gauge opinion. The polls say there is a drift towards Remain and I hope they are right."" One of the more colourful floats touring the streets of Westminster Alena Useinviz is part of a group of EU citizens, In Limbo, protesting against what they believe is the reduction in rights that will flow from Mrs May's deal. ""I have lived here for 10 years legally. I have always paid tax. I have worked all my life. I now have to apply for the right to remain here. And I do not like that."" In Limbo protesters are angry at losing rights She added: ""As a British citizen with a German passport I think it's a bad deal. I would like to see it returned to the people. I would also like it to be inclusive of the European citizens here as well as the British citizens in Europe."" Victor Zanchi had dressed up as a ""plague doctor"" because, ""Brexit is taking us back to the Middle Ages"". The Italian citizen, who says he could not vote in the 2016 referendum, has since taken British citizenship, and is down for the day from York to make his voice heard, ahead of the vote. ""Ideally I would like Brexit completely stopped but I understand why that is not a straightforward thing to happen and a second referendum is the most reasonable way towards that."" Mark Day, a planning officer from Horsham, West Sussex, who was draped in an EU flag, said he would never have expected to take to the streets in protest at Brexit or join a political party - the Liberal Democrats - before the 2016 referendum. ""I wasn't really active and I feel ashamed about that in many ways. Because basically I thought the country's not that stupid,"" he said. He now feels he has to act, he says, because Brexit is ""the most disastrous thing that can ever happen to us in peacetime"". Marietta King: ""I would rather go with no deal"" A contingent from UKIP was also out in force, waving their Leave Means Leave placards at motorists, eliciting the occasional supportive honk of the horn. One of them shook his head, as a bright yellow anti-Brexit bus cruised past for the umpteenth time. ""It's not very civil is it?"" he said, gazing at the rude slogan emblazoned across it. ""We are trying to say don't pass this withdrawal bill,"" said Marietta King, a member of UKIP's national executive committee, down for the day from the Midlands. She said she voted to stay in the EEC, as it was then called, in the 1975 referendum, but that was when it was purely a trading arrangement, she says, before it ""took control"" of so many laws. ""I would rather go with no deal, save the money, put it to better use here, and then teach our own MPs to rule. They haven't done it in a long time.""

Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Reality Check: What are the biggest government defeats? Please upgrade your browser A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon - pictured in 2014 - have not spoken since July 2018 MSPs are to hold an inquiry at Holyrood into the Scottish government's handling of the Alex Salmond investigation. The government admitted in court on 8 January that the way it dealt with sexual harassment complaints against the former first minister was unlawful. On Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon said she would refer herself to parliament over claims she broke the ministerial code. And in a new development on Tuesday it was decided that a full Holyrood inquiry would be held. A special committee will be set up to conduct the probe, which will focus on how the complaints were handled and the circumstances surrounding meetings between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond during the investigation. The first minister told BBC Scotland that she would ""cooperate with all and any inquiries"", and this was echoed by Mr Salmond. A police inquiry into the complaints themselves, which Mr Salmond denies, is ongoing. The Information Commissioner's Office is also looking into a complaint from Mr Salmond about how information about the investigation made its way into the press. The five Salmond row inquiries Timeline: The Alex Salmond investigation Q&A: Alex Salmond's legal victory An internal investigation was set up in January 2018 after two government employees made allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Salmond. However, after Mr Salmondquit the SNPand launched a judicial review complaining that the probe had been ""unfair"", the government wasforced to concede that rules had been brokenas its investigating officer had prior knowledge of the case and had spoken to the two complainers before being appointed to the role. The government insists that its complaints handling and investigation process is ""robust"", but was let down during the Salmond probe by a ""single procedural flaw"" when an investigating officer was appointed to the case who had previously had contact with the women making the complaints. The former first minister claimed the case at the Court of Session could cost the government up to Â£500,000. This video can not be played Alex Salmond: ""While I am glad about the victory that has been achieved today I am sad it was necessary to take this action."" Attention at Holyrood has subsequently turned to the involvement of Ms Sturgeon, who told MSPs that she had spoken with her predecessor five times during the course of the investigation. Shereferred herself to the independent adviserson the ministerial code after Labour claimed she may have broken it in the course of these meetings. Members on the parliament's business bureau, which manages the running of Holyrood, were unanimous in agreeing that an additional public inquiry should be held. A parliament spokeswoman said officials had been ""asked to prepare options on its remit and membership"", and said these would be discussed at future meetings. The idea was proposed by the Scottish Conservatives, and interim party leader Jackson Carlaw said he was pleased that MSPs had backed the plan. He said: ""An investigation has been botched, two complainants have been let down, and hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money has been wasted. These are clearly matters for the Scottish parliament to investigate, and the inquiry must be able to examine what went wrong and why this was allowed to happen."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard added that ""full transparency in this matter is essential in order for he public to have confidence in the first minister and the Scottish government"". MSPs are to hold a Holyrood inquiry into what went wrong with the government's investigation Ms Sturgeon told MSPs last week that she was ""perfectly happy for parliament to hold an inquiry"", saying that she would ""ensure that all parts of the Scottish government cooperate fully with it"". She said: ""If there is a parliamentary inquiry, we will, of course, make all appropriate information available. ""I am satisfied that I conducted myself appropriately and in line with all the rules, but parliament will perform its scrutiny role in the best way that it considers necessary."" A spokesman for Mr Salmond said the former first minister would be ""happy to cooperate, in principle and if asked, with a parliamentary inquiry"". He added that Scotland's top civil servant, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, ""should already have accepted the responsibility for the expensive farce"" of the collapsed investigation. The collapse of the government investigation and questions over Ms Sturgeon's involvement in it have sparked a row between her team and supporters of Mr Salmond, with a spokesman hitting out at""an attempt to smear"" the first ministerin the press. This continued on Tuesday, with the first minister's spokesman accusing ""the other side"" of pursuing a ""vendetta"" against Ms Sturgeon's chief of staff, Liz Lloyd. Questions have been raised about when Ms Lloyd learned of the complaints against Mr Salmond, with the former first minister's team insisting she was aware of them ""some time"" in advance of a meeting at Ms Sturgeon's house in April 2018. On Tuesday, Geoff Aberdein - Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, who helped set up the meetings between the two politicians -said,externalMs Lloyd met with him twice in March. He said she ""suspected"" that an official complaint had been made about Mr Salmond, although ""she made clear she did not know the full details and had not alerted the first minister to her suspicions"". A spokesman said Ms Sturgeon had full confidence in her chief of staff.

"The markets were prepared for her to lose - but the scale of her defeat took most by surprise. But more surprising still was the fact that the pound - the first financial responder to political events - gained in value after the vote - despite many, most, confidently predicting a crushing defeat would send it down. So what to make of it? Using the benefit of hindsight, some are saying that the recent display of animosity in the House of Commons to the idea of a no-deal Brexit, something markets are most wary of - has convinced them that outcome is very unlikely. The other new line is that this crushing defeat for her Brexit deal, makes no Brexit - at least not on 29 March - a growing possibility. That's financial markets, which respond in seconds. Real businesses are not so sure. With 72 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU another milestone has come and gone with the future no clearer and planning for no deal more urgent. As one exasperated business group said tonight, politicians are playing a ""high stakes game of political poker"" with the future of the UK economy.

"This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said the prime minister had suffered a defeat of historic proportions Scotland's first minister has said another referendum on Brexit is now the ""only credible option"" after MPs rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking after MPs voted by 432 to 202 against the deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on 29 March. Labour immediately lodged a vote of no confidence in Mrs May's government following the defeat. Ms Sturgeon is due in London to meet SNP MPs ahead of the confidence vote. She said it was time to ""stop the clock"" on Brexit and ""put this issue back to the electorate"". But Mrs May has signalled her intention to carry on despite suffering the largest defeat for any sitting UK government in history, and has offered cross-party talks in a bid to find a way forward from the current stalemate if she wins the no confidence vote on Wednesday. In a statement released immediately after the vote, the prime minister said: ""The House has spoken and this government will listen."" PMâs Brexit deal rejected by 230 votes Live reaction to May's defeat How did Scottish MPs vote? Ms Sturgeon, whose SNP MPs voted against Mrs May's deal, confirmed her party would back the no confidence motion - which Labour hopes will spark a general election. And she said the ""historic"" scale of the defeat for the prime minister meant the country has now ""reached the point where it would be unconscionable to kick the can any further down the road."" Ms Sturgeon added: ""What must happen now is clear. Firstly, and most urgently, the clock must be stopped on the Article 50 process. This is the only way to avoid any possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU on 29 March without a deal. ""Secondly, legislation must be brought forward to put this issue back to the electorate in another referendum. ""The government has had more than two and a half years to deliver a workable Brexit plan and it has completely failed to do so. The notion that it can do so now in a matter of weeks is farcical."" This video can not be played The prime minister's Brexit deal is backed by 202 MPs but 432  vote against. Ms Sturgeon said another EU referendum with Remain as an option was now the ""only credible option to avoid untold damage to the economy and the prospects of future generations"". And she said it was ""also the only option, within the UK, that would allow Scotland's democratic wish to remain in Europe to be respected"". Mrs May spoke to Ms Sturgeon on the phone late on Tuesday evening as the prime minister started to reach out to other parties. In a post on Twitter following their conversation, Ms Sturgeon said it was ""not obvious that she [Mrs May] has any real idea what to do next"". Allow Twitter content?

The 35 SNP MPs were joined by every Scottish Labour and Liberal Democrat MP in rejecting the deal, as well as three Scottish Conservatives - John Lamont, Ross Thomson and Douglas Ross.

Mr Lamont, Mr Thomson and Mr Ross are expected to back the prime minister in the no confidence vote - as are the vast majority of the 115 other Conservative rebels and the DUP, which strongly opposes Mrs May's Brexit deal but says it wants a change of policy rather than a change of government. Responding to the Commons vote, Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird said the prime minister had now lost all authority, and that there was now a ""clear need for a general election to break the deadlock"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie, who backs another referendum on Brexit, said the ""historic and devastating defeat"" for the prime minister meant her deal and her credibility were now in tatters. But the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Jackson Carlaw, said the prime minister's proposals were the ""only substantial deal on the table"" that would ""avoid No Deal and deliver an orderly Brexit"". Mr Carlaw also challenged Mrs May's opponents to ""set out, quite specifically, how their own alternatives might work, how they would respect the referendum, and how they will secure a majority in parliament"". The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said he regretted the outcome of the vote and has urged the UK government to ""clarify its intentions with respect to its next steps as soon as possible"". By the BBC's head of political research Peter Barnes Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years. The next one is due in 2022. But a vote of no confidence lets MPs vote on whether they want the government to continue. The motion must be worded: ""That this House has no confidence in HM Government."" If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown. If during that time the current government or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called. That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days.

"The Future Circular Collider is four times the circumference and ten times the power of the current collider Cern has published its ideas for a Â£20bn successor to the Large Hadron Collider, given the working name of Future Circular Collider (FCC). The  Geneva based particle physics research centre is proposing an accelerator that is almost four times longer and ten times more powerful. The aim is to have the FCC hunting for new sub-atomic particles by 2050. Critics say that the money could be better spent on other research areas such as combating climate change. But Cern's Director-General, Prof  Fabiola Gianotti described the proposal as ""a remarkable accomplishment"". ""It shows the tremendous potential of the FCC to improve our knowledge of fundamental physics and to advance many technologies with a broad impact on society,"" she said. An artists impression of what the FCC beam line will look like. Cern's plans have been submitted in aconceptual design report,external. These will be considered by an international panel of particle physicists, along with other submissions, as they draw up a newEuropean strategy for particle physics,externalfor publication in 2020. Prof Jon Butterworth of University College, London is among those drawing up the strategy. He told BBC News that, although he was keeping an open mind, he was particularly attracted to Cern's proposal. It entails gradually building up to a 100km ring that is almost ten times more powerful than the LHC. ""This programme is very ambitious, very exciting and would be my plan A,"" he said. Cern engineers are already building and testing prototype components capable of working at the FCC's higher energies. The proposal involves digging a new tunnel under Cern and then installing a ring that would initially collide electrons with their positively charged counterparts, positrons. Stage two would involve colliding protons with electrons. Stages one and two would lay the ground for the final step of colliding protons together nearly ten times harder than they have been by the LHC. Physicists hope that such collisions at these unprecedented high energies will reveal a new realm of particles that really make the Universe tick, rather than the sub-atomic pretenders we know of, which play only a part in mediating the forces of nature. The current theory of sub-atomic physics, called the Standard Model, has been one of the great triumphs of the 20th century. It neatly explains the behaviour of matter and forces through the interaction of a family of 17 particles. The last of these, the Higgs Boson, was discovered by the Large Hadron Collider in 2012. But observations by astronomers indicated that there was more to the Universe than could be explained by the Standard Model. Galaxies were rotating faster than they should be and the expansion of the Universe is accelerating rather than slowing down. On top of that, the Standard Model cannot explain gravity. So there must be a deeper process going on, involving yet to be discovered particles. Uncovering them would provide physicists with their much sought after theory of everything, one that would tie together all the forces of nature and unify the twin pillars on which modern physics rests:  general relativity and quantum mechanics. When physicists first proposed the construction of the LHC they knew that if the Standard Model was correct it would be capable of discovering the Higgs. They had hoped that it might also discover particles beyond the standard model. So farit has failed to do so. The difficulty with Cern's proposals for a larger Large Hadron Collider is that no one knows what energies will be needed to crash hadrons together to discover the enigmatic, super particles that hold the keys to the new realm of particles. Cern hopes that its step-by-step proposal, first using electron-positron and then electron-large hadron collisions will enable its physicists to look for the ripples created by the super particles and so enable them to determine the energies that will be needed to find the super particles. New, more powerful magnets capable of bending the FCC's more powerful beam are being developed at Cern. Perhaps because of media hype, nationalgovernments and taxpayers had expected the LHC to have already found particles beyond the standard model.So a new request for a larger accelerator risks creating the impression that the physics community's desire for ever larger, more expensive accelerators to solve the mysteries of the Universe is potentially as limitless as the Universe itself. The UK's former Chief Scientific Advisor, Prof Sir David King, has advised the UK government and the European Commission on large funding requests. He told BBC News that he believed that the escalating costs of conducting basic research in particle physics means that it is now time to carry out a cost-benefit analysis, especially when it was unclear whether the Â£20bn machine would discover any new particles. ""We have to draw a line somewhere otherwise we end up with a collider that is so large that it goes around the equator. And if it doesn't end there perhaps there will be a request for one that goes to the Moon and back."" ""There is always going to be more deep physics to be conducted with larger and larger colliders. My question is to what extent will the knowledge that we already have be extended to benefit humanity?"" A simulation of the high energy collisions that will take place in the FCC. Prof King believes that governments should consider if the money could be better spent on research into other, more pressing priorities. ""We are rattling towards a high temperature planet in which the current global economy will cease to operate. More than 150 million people will be displaced. So if we had a pot of Â£20bn and we were discussing what to do with it, we would be faced with people in the medical sciences community coming up to us with ideas to improve human health and wellbeing."" ""But I'm going to say a new high priority for human beings is now dealing with climate change."" However Cern's director for accelerators and technology, Dr FrÃ©dÃ©rick Bordry, said that he did not think that Â£20bn was expensive for a cutting edge project, the cost of which would be spread among several international partners over 20 years. He added that spending on Cern had led to many technological benefits, such as the World Wide Web and the real benefits were yet to be realised. ""When I am asked about the benefits of the Higgs Boson, I say 'bosonics'. And when they ask me what is bosonics, I say 'I don't know'. ""But if you imagine the discovery of the electron by JJ Thomson in 1897, he didn't know what electronics was. But you can't imagine a world now without electronics.""

"Marks and Spencer has named the next wave of stores earmarked for closure in its reorganisation plan, including those in Huddersfield, Hull and Luton. The 17 proposed closures are part of the clothing, homeware and food retailer's five-year plan to shut more than 100 stores by 2022. The latest plans will affect 1,045 staff, who will now be involved in a consultation process. So far, 30 stores have closed and another eight have already been named. The company wants to move a third of its sales online and plans to have fewer stores in better locations. The company says it will now consult staff and listen to any alternative suggestions from them for how to keep the stores open. No stores will close until this process has been completed and, in a statement, the company said it had ""the intention of retaining as many people as possible"". The 17 stores which M&S proposes to close are: Ashford, Barrow, Bedford, Boston, Buxton, Cwmbran, Deal, Felixstowe, Huddersfield, Hull, Junction One Antrim Outlet, Luton Arndale, Newark, Northwich, Rotherham, Sutton Coldfield and Weston-super-Mare. The closure programme has already affected 1,891 people, with 1,591 of them being redeployed to other parts of the business. Sacha Berendji, M&S's retail, operations and property director, said ""Proposing to close stores is never easy, for our colleagues, customers or the local community, but it is vital for the future of M&S. ""Where we have closed stores, we are continuing to see an encouraging number of customers choosing other nearby locations and shopping on M&S.com."" Gary Carter, national officer of the GMB Union, said: ""Employees across the sector will be very worried about their job security and wondering which retailer will be next to shed jobs or close down. ""This government has done nothing to help retailers and the low-paid, hard-working employees who are at the sharp end."" The latest proposals are part of the M&S's store estate programme, which it first announced in November 2016. The 30 stores that have already closed are: Andover, Basildon, Birkenhead, Bournemouth, Bridlington, Clacton, Covent Garden, Crewe (relocation), Darlington, Dover, Durham, Falkirk, Fareham, Fforestfach, Greenock (relocation), Keighley, Kettering, New Mersey Speke Shopping Park, Newmarket, Newry (relocation), Northampton, Portsmouth, Putney, Redditch, Slough, Stockport, Stockton, Walsall, Warrington and Wokingham. The eight stores that have previously been announced as set to close are: East Kilbride, Edgware Broadwalk, Falmouth, Holloway Road, Kirkcaldy, Llandudno (relocation), St Helens (relocation) and Wigan (Food hall opening at Robin Retail Park). M&S saw its sales dropover the Christmas holiday period. In a trading statement published last week, it said like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, were down 2.2% in the 13 weeks to 29 December. Food sales fell 2.1% and its clothing and home sales division slid 2.4%. M&S to close 100 stores by 2022 How can M&S get back in fashion?

"Cotton sprouts seen close-up under a protective cover on board the Moon lander Seeds taken up to the Moon by China's Chang'e-4 mission have sprouted, says China National Space Administration. It marks the first time any biological matter has grown on the Moon, and is being seen as a significant step towards long-term space exploration. The Chang'e 4 is the first mission to land on and explore the Moon's far side, facing away from Earth. It touched down on 3 January, carrying instruments to analyse the region's geology. What does China want to do on the Moon's far side? Why China has its eye on space China Moon probes take snaps of each other Plants have been grown on the International Space Station before but never on the Moon. The ability to grow plants on the Moon could proveuseful for long-term space missions,external, like a trip to Mars which would take about two-and-a-half years. It would mean that astronauts could potentially harvest their own food in space, reducing the need to come back down to Earth to resupply. Raw images made the lunar surface appear red; the new images have been calibrated The Chinese Moon lander was carrying among its cargo soil containing cotton and potato seeds, yeast and fruit fly eggs. The plants are in a sealed container on board the lander. The crops will try to form a mini biosphere - an artificial, self-sustaining environment. Will the Moon be contaminated? By Paul Rincon, Science editor, BBC News website The lunar mini biosphere experiment on the Chang'e-4 lander is designed to test photosynthesis and respiration - processes in living organisms that result in the production of energy. The whole experiment is contained within an 18cm tall, 3kg canister that was designed by 28 Chinese universities. The organisms inside have a supply of air, water and nutrients to help them grow. But one of the challenges, say Chinese scientists, is to keep the temperature favourable for growth when conditions on the Moon swing wildly between -173C and 100C or more. They also have to control the humidity and nutrients. Some have raised the question of whether the experiment risks ""contaminating"" the Moon with biological material, but scientists generally think this is of little concern. And it's worth reiterating that there are already containers of human waste on the Moon left behind by the Apollo astronauts. On Tuesday, Chinese state media said the cotton seeds had now grown buds. The ruling Communist Party's official mouthpiece the People's Daily tweeted an image of the sprouted seed, saying it marked ""the completion of humankind's first biological experiment on the Moon"". Fred Watson, Australian Astronomical Observatory's astronomer-at-large, told the BBC the development was ""good news"". ""It suggests that there might not be insurmountable problems for astronauts in future trying to grow their own crops on the moon in a controlled environment."" Seeds in the Chang'e-4 have begun sprouting after landing on the moon ""I think there's certainly a great deal of interest in using the Moon as staging post, particularly for flights to Mars, because it's relatively near the Earth,"" Mr Watson said. Prof Xie Gengxin, the experiment's chief designer,was quoted as saying in the South China Morning Post,external: ""We have given consideration to future survival in space. ""Learning about these plants' growth in a low-gravity environment would allow us to lay the foundation for our future establishment of space base."" He said cotton could eventually be used for clothing while the potatoes could be a food source for astronauts and the rapeseed for oil. China'sXinhua news agency,externalsaid that the seeds were rendered dormant using ""biological technology"" during the 20-day journey from Earth to the Moon. They only began growing once ground control centre sent a command to the probe to water the seeds. Xinhua said the probe had taken about 170 pictures so far which have been sent back to Earth. On Friday, the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program (CLEP)released several images,externaltaken by the probe including panoramic images of the landing site as well as video of the vehicles touching down.

"The pound has risen after MPs voted to reject Theresa May's Brexit deal by 230 votes. The voteopens up a range of outcomes, including no deal, a renegotiation of Mrs May's deal, or a second referendum. Sterling rose 0.05% to $1.287 after declines of more than 1% earlier in the day. The currency slumped 7% in 2018 reflecting uncertainty about the terms of the UK's exit from the European Union. MPs voted by 432 votes to 202 to reject the deal, the heaviest defeat for a sitting government in history. ""A defeat has been broadly anticipated in markets since the agreement with the EU was closed in November 2018 and caused several members of the government to resign,"" said Richard Falkenhall, senior FX strategist at SEB. But business groups said their members' patience was wearing thin. ""There are no more words to describe the frustration, impatience, and growing anger amongst business after two and a half years on a high-stakes political rollercoaster ride that shows no sign of stopping,"" said Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce. He implored MPs to come to an agreement, and was joined in this plea by business groups including the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry. Some investors see the chances of a no-deal Brexit diminishing as parliament exerts more authority over the process. ""The probability of a no deal has diminished while the chances of a delay in Article 50, a second referendum or even, at the margin, no Brexit at all, have all increased. The consequence of those scenarios has encouraged sterling to rally despite the PM suffering the worst parliamentary result in a century,"" said Jeremy Stretch of CIBC Capital Markets. On Friday, hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a major donor to the Brexit campaign, said he now expected the project to be abandoned altogether and that he is positioning for the pound to strengthen. The markets were prepared for her to lose - but the scale of her defeat took most by surprise. But more surprising still was the fact that the pound - the first financial responder to political events - gained in value after the vote - despite many, most, confidently predicting a crushing defeat would send it down. So what to make of it? Using the benefit of hindsight, some are saying that the recent display of animosity in the House of Commons to the idea of a no-deal Brexit, something markets are most wary of - has convinced them that outcome is very unlikely. The other new line is that this crushing defeat for her Brexit deal, makes no Brexit - at least not on 29 March - a growing possibility. That's financial markets, which respond in seconds. Real businesses are not so sure.  With 72 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU another milestone has come and gone with the future no clearer and planning for no deal more urgent. Read more here But others are concerned the rejection of Mrs May's plan makes a no-deal Brexit more likely as other options become fewer in number. ""A no-deal Brexit means the public will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves,"" said Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. ""British businesses desperately need certainty about the UK's future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. The time for Parliamentary games is over."" While there is speculation that Britain's exit from the EU must now be suspended as the most-developed plan has been scrapped, businesses may not be counting on this, particularly complicated ones like banks. ""Firms in the finance industry have put contingency plans in place to minimise disruption for their customers in a 'no deal' scenario but critical cliff-edge risks remain, including on the transfer of personal data and the operation of cross-border contracts,"" said Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance. Omar Ali, UK financial services leader at accountants EY, added: ""Firms have no choice but to fully implement their no-deal plans.""

"Theresa May's Brexit deal has been rejected in the House of Commons by 230 votes. Reality Check has been looking back at some of the biggest government defeats. Defeats in the order of 100-plus votes are very rare. The three biggest government losses, according to the Institute for Government think tank, all occurred in 1924 when the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald was defeated by margins of 166, 161 and 140. The defeats of 166 and 161 votes both occurred on 8 October 1924 and related to the response to the government's decision to drop criminal proceedings against John Ross Campbell, editor of the Communist newspaper Workers' Weekly. A few weeks afterwards, a general election was held - following a motion of no confidence in the government. That election saw the Conservatives gain more than 150 seats with Stanley Baldwin returning to power. The third biggest defeat also happened in 1924 when the government suffered a 140-vote defeat on its Housing Bill on 3 June. Ramsay MacDonald's minority government was defeated by a margin of 166 in 1924 There may be special circumstances around certain votes, so it's not always easy to compare each one - says Alice Lilly from the Institute for Government. Governments, she says, have, on occasion, chosen not to take part in certain votes - meaning the scale of defeat was much larger than it otherwise would have been. For example, in March 1977 Labour lost a vote by 293-0 on public spending cuts to pay for a 1976 loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  In that instance, party managers instructed Labour MPs not to take part. Other votes might be ""free"", meaning that MPs are not put under pressure to vote a certain way by their party leaders. Usually such votes happen on ethical issues that are seen as a matter of conscience, such as the same-sex marriage vote.

"Theresa May to publish her new Brexit plan to Parliament on 21 January Full debate and key vote on that plan on 29 January PM holding talks with MPs and urges people to ""work constructively together"" Jeremy Corbyn refuses to take part unless the PM rules out a no-deal Brexit Mrs May has held meetings with the Lib Dems, SNP and Plaid Cymru Government paper suggests new EU referendum would take ""in excess of a year"" Paul Gribben, Dulcie Lee and Becky Morton Details on post Brexit trading tariffs in the event of a no-deal are set to be published later. Reports last week suggestedthey could be drastic with cuts on between 80% and 90% of goods, with some tariffs being scrapped completely. If you need a refresher on what tariffs are and what they aim to do, here's a handy explanation. BBC Radio 5 Live Sally Jones, Deloitte UKâs director for International Trade Policy, has been speaking about the UK's trading arrangements after Brexit and expectations that more information will be released today. She told Wake Up To Money that industries such as steel, ceramics and agriculture were concerned their products would be ""less competitive"". This is because they are already operating in markets where there are already high tariffs under the World Trade Organization rules and also where there is a lot of international competition. Taking cars as an example, tariffs here can be as high as 25% for component parts, and 10% for finished cars under WTO rules, she said. ""If we chose to set a zero tariff  on those components and finished cars for import into the UK then you would see competition for our plants in Sunderland and similar would be increased"". BBC News Channel Labour MP Stephen Kinnock says he had ""constructive talks"" with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove and the prime minister's chief of staff Gavin Barwell. He says he raised the need for the prime minister to take no deal off the table, as well as discussing his preferred option of a Norway-style agreement, which would see a close relationship with the European Union. He told BBC News: âItâs time for all parties to come together in the national
interest."" Former attorney general Dominic Grieve has rejected government claims that it would take more than a year to organise another referendum. The Conservative MP, who is a supporter of the People's Vote campaign, said: ""The timetable put forward by the government is simply wrong and they must be aware of it themselves."" He says another referendum could be carried out ""swiftly and within a limited extension of Article 50"".

Find out who has been involved in talks from ourtimeline. The prime minister has written to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to say his call for a no deal Brexit to be ruled out before he meets her is an ""impossible condition"". Theresa May says it is ""not within the government's power"" to rule out a no deal. However, she says her ""door remains open"" and she would be ""happy to discuss"" Mr Corbyn's own proposals on Brexit.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid has criticised a tweet from a Guardian columnist which references calculations that the Leave vote has been declining - in part due to older Leave supporters dying. Polly Toynbee was tweeting about her column, which discusses estimates that the Leave vote has been shrinking by about 1,350 a day. Mr Javid retweeted her along with the comment: ""How utterly disrespectful"". The calculation, conducted on behalf of the People's Vote campaign, takes into account the number of mainly Leave voters who have died, and mainly Remain voters who have reached voting age. The survey predicted that - assuming no voters changed their mind - demographic factors alone were causing the Leave majority to shrink by almost half a million a year. The Scottish government's Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said planning for Brexit has been a ""game-changer"" for the country's police force. More officers will be recruited this year ""to ensure capacity and resilience is in place to prepare against a range of contingencies associated with Brexit"". Mr Yousaf was speaking about budget plans at the justice sub-committee on policing at Holyrood. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The prime minister will not attend the annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos next week. Downing Street said ""sheâll be focused on matters here"". Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The government has produced ""a very short
paper setting out the factual detail on the number of months required"" to hold
another referendum, Downing Street has said. This was ""produced to inform the expected discussion"" with the MPs who have been to see the PM and other ministers. A government source told me it suggests ""in excess of a

Sky News reporter Aubrey Allegretti has tweeted a letter from Jeremy Corbyn, in which the Labour leader urges MPs not to contact the government until the no-deal option is taken off the table. Mr Corbyn said he personally would not meet with Mrs May to talk about the future of Brexit until she ruled out the prospect of a ""disastrous"" no-deal exit. In his letter, he wrote: ""The Prime Minister has offered to open talks with Opposition Parties, however, I have been absolutely clear that any starting point for talks about breaking the Brexit deadlock must be on the provision that the threat of a disastrous 'no deal' outcome is ruled out."" He goes on to write: ""I urge colleagues to respect that condition and refrain from engagement with the government until 'no deal' is taken off the table.""

The Republic of Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said a no-deal Brexit would have to become ""an exercise in damage limitation"". Speaking in the Irish parliament, Simon Coveney said: ""It would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors, which is currently facilitated by our common EU membership."" Mr Coveney said the EU would continue to seek to be as helpful as possible but that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation. ""The backstop is an essential part of the Withdrawal Agreement,"" he added. ""It acts as an insurance policy, to ensure that there is no hard border on this island following Brexit. It is essential."" Tory MP John Whittingdale says he and other senior MPs have had a ""constructive meeting"" with Theresa May - adding that he feels optimistic a deal that appeals to Conservatives and the DUP can be reached.

Norman SmithAssistant political editor Senior Tory MP Nick Boles is seeking to secure parliamentary backing for a bill that would force the government to delay Article 50. The measure would kick in if Mrs May was unable to get a Brexit deal through the Commons by the end of February. Mr Boles said he believed a number of Cabinet ministers  - including the chancellor - support his plan. He also said ministers outside the Cabinet had told him they would resign if forced to oppose the measure. Mr Boles has decided to drop his previous plan to give the Liaison Committee the power to introduce a new draft bill after it was widely criticised by members of the committee. It's thought Mr Boles' proposal - if accepted by the speaker - would be voted on ahead of Mrs May's statement to MPs on her Brexit plans on 29 January. Mr Boles made his comments in an interview with the Political Thinking podcast - published tomorrow. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Playing the numbers game is dangerous - one seasoned politician who's been tracking every single move guessed at 90 against the deal this afternoon. Other wilder claims of up to 200 against are doing the rounds too. What you won't find today is anyone in Westminster who thinks the numbers are going to flip towards the government enough. And that's why, although the speculation is enough to drive some people round the twist, much of the whispering today isn't about the vote itself, but about what happens next. As I wrote last night, the meaningful votewill have multiple meanings. But it seems clearer now what the prime minister's intentions will be in its immediate aftermath. And guess what? Plan B is likely to be a tweaked version of Plan A. For weeks cabinet ministers have been saying privately they expect Theresa May to try to hold broadly to her compromise. It is not just the government's deal, but the EU's deal, a deal that has the backing of most of the big business groups, and indeed the product of more than two years of work.

It's very unlikely therefore that we are about to see immediately any dramatic pivot from the prime minister, even if the defeat is a resounding one. MPs inside the chamber who are demanding that she switch course, and protesters on both sides who have turned Parliament into a ghoulish carnival (complete with a model of the Titanic, an Irish leprechaun and more union jacks and EU flags that you can count), are very unlikely to get their way tonight.

Mrs May is no stranger of course to sudden changes of heart. These sentences may not age well. But I wouldn't bet much on today's undoubted drama provoking a major change of direction. What's the point then holding this vote at all? You'd be forgiven for asking. At some point Parliament's actual view had to be tested, and determined, not just discussed. Some in government hope that a defeat today will allow MPs to get that need to express concern out of their system, then they will in time shift to back the deal. But it may be a forlorn hope.

"On Tuesday, members of parliament in the UK are expected to hold their all-important vote on Prime Minister Theresa May's plan for the UK's withdrawal and future relationship with the European Union. The key vote - delayed from 11 December last year - comes with the clock continuing to tick on Britain's departure from the EU on 29 March. Spoiler alert: I don't think anyone knows for sure how Brexit will end and we may not have much more certainty even by the end of next week. But here's what we might learn: first, the extent of parliamentary opposition to Theresa May's deal and second, an idea of whether she has a Plan B. That's not certain because if, as expected, she loses the big vote on Tuesday, technically she has until the following Monday to let MPs know what she intends to do. Options include trying her deal again, a different deal, no deal, a second referendum and delaying Brexit. Theresa May's deal involves two parts, a legally binding Withdrawal Treaty on the terms of Britain's departure from the EU, and a non-binding Political Declaration setting out hopes for the future relationship after Brexit. Many pro-Brexit MPs in Mrs May's Conservative Party feel the Treaty leaves the UK too close to the EU, while most pro-Remain Conservatives and all the opposition parties feel the Declaration is far too vague. The BBC is predicting Mrs May faces the biggest defeat any government has suffered in 100 years. Much pressure will be exerted by Mrs May and her ministers until the very last second to reduce the size of the defeat. Please upgrade your browser Even her closest aides don't seem to know if she has one. Both in public and apparently in private too, she insists her plan is the best and only way of delivering on the referendum result without destroying the economy. But here are some suggestions as to what she might do: return to the EU to try to make her deal more attractive to MPs, challenge MPs to unite around an alternative to her deal, threaten MPs with a no-deal Brexit or another referendum on her plan or ask Brussels for a delay to the whole process. That Mrs May has to come up with a Plan B sooner rather than later is, by the way, thanks to a massive row this week between John Bercow (the Speaker of the House of Commons) on one side and the government and pro-Brexit MPs on the other. Amidst bitter allegations against the Speaker of being biased against leaving the EU, he basically ruled that he intends to help Parliament have more of a role in managing Brexit. That matters because so far Parliament is against no deal and Mrs May's deal. Brexit has fractured and divided not just the governing Conservative Party but the main opposition Labour Party too. Its leadership under the left-wing lifelong Eurosceptic Jeremy Corbyn is committed to some kind of Brexit, but most of its members and voters want a second referendum to stop Britain leaving. Labour is committed to voting against Mrs May's deal on Tuesday, but what the party might do in future parliamentary votes, when push comes to shove closer to 29 March, is impossible to say. No-one knows. Put simply, more than two-and-a-half years on, MPs still can't agree what to do about the result of the referendum. It's that basic and explains why Britain is experiencing its most profound political crisis since 1945. But if nothing else happens, it's worth remembering the default position is for the UK to leave without a deal. If Mrs May is not in the end prepared to risk a no-deal Brexit and if Parliament is determined to try to stop it anyway, something needs to happen. What, if anything, that something might be is still uncertain. If you can't see the chatbot abovetap on this link,external.

"MPs will soon decide the fate of Theresa May's Brexit deal. There are many views about why they should back or reject the deal, which was struck late last year with the European Union. But what do voters want MPs to do? And what do they think should happen if the deal is rejected? Polls suggest the deal has not proved popular with the public. YouGov has asked people whether they support or oppose it on no fewer than 11 occasions since it wasfirst unveiled in mid-November. Never have more than 27% said that they support the deal, while at least 42% have always said they are against it. Other polls show a similar pattern. Opinium found only one in 10 thinks the deal is good for the UK, while as many as half believe it is bad. Ipsos MORI has reported only a quarter think it would be a good thing for the UK to leave the EU on the terms of the deal. More than six in 10 believe it would be a bad thing. It is perhaps unsurprising then that many more voters say MPs should reject the deal than believe they should back it. More like this What British people think about Brexit now How young and old would vote on Brexit now Not only do Remain supporters seem inclined to reject the deal, but Leave voters do as well. In its recent polls, YouGov has found an average of 30% of Leave voters back the deal, while 47% are opposed to it. This arguably makes it harder for the PM to say that her deal fulfils the expectations of those who voted Leave in the referendum. That said, many voters have not made up their mind about the deal on offer. YouGov is still finding that about three in 10 still do not know whether they support it or not, well after the deal was revealed. This suggests some voters could yet be won round to Mrs May's proposal. While Remain and Leave voters appear to oppose the Brexit deal, they are split over what should be done instead. Opinium has repeatedly asked voters which of five possible options should be pursued if Parliament were to reject the current deal. None of the options comes close to being backed by a majority. The most popular every time - backed on average by just over a quarter - has been to leave without a deal at all. Meanwhile, the second most popular option each time - supported by just over a fifth - has been to hold a ""public vote"" on whether to accept the deal or to stay in the EU. While these options enjoy similar levels of support, they come from very different voter groups. Leaving without a deal is easily the single most popular option among those who voted Leave, chosen by an average of 46%. Holding a ""public vote"" on the deal, with an option to stay in the EU, is favoured among backers of Remain, 38% of whom pick this option. However, other courses of action also gain support. Fifteen per cent of all voters prefer attempting to negotiate a better deal, while 12% back Labour's preferred option of holding a general election. A further 9% support a different ""public vote"" in which the choice would be either Mrs May's deal or leaving the EU without one. Please upgrade your browser The idea of a second Brexit vote has attracted particular interest in recent weeks, thanks not least to a high-profile campaign. However, public support for the idea depends on how the poll question is worded. Polls asking whether there should be a ""public"" or ""people's vote"" - without specifying what the options would be - typically find that the idea is relatively popular. For example, Survation found that 48% support holding a ""people's vote"" to gauge the public's reaction to the deal, while 34% are opposed. Similarly, Populus reported that 44% believe the public should have the ""final say"" on the deal via a ""people's vote"", while just 30% are against this. However, when voters are asked about holding another referendum that might have the effect of reversing Brexit, the proposal attracts less support. ComRes has reported as many as 50% oppose ""holding a second referendum on whether to Remain or Leave"", with only 40% in favour. Similarly, according to polling commissioned by Lord Ashcroft, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, 47% are against holding a ""second referendum"", while 38% are in favour. In that scenario, voters would choose between leaving the EU under the terms of Mrs May's deal and remaining in the EU. The wording of the poll question seems to make a significant difference, particularly to Leave voters. Putting ""the people"" in charge of Brexit appeals to some Leavers, but a ballot which could potentially reverse the decision does not. Broadly, the idea of another referendum appears as controversial to voters as Brexit itself continues to be. When it comes to how people say they would vote if there were another referendum, the country still appears quite evenly divided. Remain, with an average score of 53% is enjoying just a narrow lead over Leave, which scored 47% in the most recent polls.

"As MPs on both sides of the Brexit divide battled it out in the Commons ahead of the vote on Theresa May's deal, an even noisier and more passionate debate was going on across the road. With fancy dress, lurid floats and colourful banners, there was something approaching a carnival atmosphere, as the usual ranks of pro and anti-Brexit demonstrators outside Parliament were swollen by people who had travelled to London for the big vote. The two sides mostly kept a respectful distance from each other, as a low-key police presence tried to keep a right of way open for pedestrians. The protest was at times loud - with a group of pro-Brexit demonstrators ringing a ""liberty bell"" and beating a bass drum, with tensions escalating as the MPs' vote approached. Live: MPs debate Brexit deal May facing crunch vote on Brexit deal What voters want MPs to do about Brexit Everyone - with the notable exception of a man wielding a ""leave, then negotiate"" placard - appeared to be united in their disdain for Theresa May's Brexit agreement. ""It's a rubbish deal,"" said retired cab driver Colin Grostate, a card-carrying Conservative Party member, and prospective council candidate. ""Everybody in the country knows, except Theresa May. The lights are on but nobody's home. ""The woman's a nutcase. She's just in denial."" Colin Grostate: ""I am willing to die for the vote"" Mr Grostate, like some of the other pro-Brexit demonstrators, was wearing a yellow vest, in solidarity, he said, with ""working class"" protesters in France. He was angry about what he saw as a betrayal of the result of the 2016 referendum by MPs. ""We voted for freedom, not for money. We didn't say we wanted to be richer or poorer. We voted for freedom."" Mr Grostate, who lives in Ramsgate, has booked himself into a London hotel for four days to protest outside Parliament. ""I am willing to die for the vote. If they don't leave on the 30 March, there's thousands like me up and down the country that is willing to stand their ground. ""We lost 7 million British, Commonwealth and Americans fighting for this country to be free. We are not handing it over to the Europeans, that's for sure."" Peter Hayden, a Labour Party member, was equally angry, albeit in a more understated way, with his party leader. Peter Hayden: ""Labour will be sidelined on this whole issue"" He says he joined Labour because of Jeremy Corbyn's socialist policies - ""I was a Corbynite"" -  but has become disillusioned with Mr Corbyn's refusal to get behind calls for another EU referendum, which is what, he says, the vast majority of Labour members want and what they voted for at their party conference. ""He needs to come off the fence because otherwise the initiative will be taken by the Tories, so Labour will be sidelined on this whole issue."" Like Mr Grostate, the retired author, from Warwickshire, is in London for the week to make his voice heard. ""This is fanatics' alley,"" he says, surveying the protests going on around him. ""Everyone who is here, I suppose you could say including me, they are coming out because they feel fanatical, so you can't gauge opinion. The polls say there is a drift towards Remain and I hope they are right."" One of the more colourful floats touring the streets of Westminster Alena Useinviz is part of a group of EU citizens, In Limbo, protesting against what they believe is the reduction in rights that will flow from Mrs May's deal. ""I have lived here for 10 years legally. I have always paid tax. I have worked all my life. I now have to apply for the right to remain here. And I do not like that."" In Limbo protesters are angry at losing rights She added: ""As a British citizen with a German passport I think it's a bad deal. I would like to see it returned to the people. I would also like it to be inclusive of the European citizens here as well as the British citizens in Europe."" Victor Zanchi had dressed up as a ""plague doctor"" because, ""Brexit is taking us back to the Middle Ages"". The Italian citizen, who says he could not vote in the 2016 referendum, has since taken British citizenship, and is down for the day from York to make his voice heard, ahead of the vote. ""Ideally I would like Brexit completely stopped but I understand why that is not a straightforward thing to happen and a second referendum is the most reasonable way towards that."" Mark Day, a planning officer from Horsham, West Sussex, who was draped in an EU flag, said he would never have expected to take to the streets in protest at Brexit or join a political party - the Liberal Democrats - before the 2016 referendum. ""I wasn't really active and I feel ashamed about that in many ways. Because basically I thought the country's not that stupid,"" he said. He now feels he has to act, he says, because Brexit is ""the most disastrous thing that can ever happen to us in peacetime"". Marietta King: ""I would rather go with no deal"" A contingent from UKIP was also out in force, waving their Leave Means Leave placards at motorists, eliciting the occasional supportive honk of the horn. One of them shook his head, as a bright yellow anti-Brexit bus cruised past for the umpteenth time. ""It's not very civil is it?"" he said, gazing at the rude slogan emblazoned across it. ""We are trying to say don't pass this withdrawal bill,"" said Marietta King, a member of UKIP's national executive committee, down for the day from the Midlands. She said she voted to stay in the EEC, as it was then called, in the 1975 referendum, but that was when it was purely a trading arrangement, she says, before it ""took control"" of so many laws. ""I would rather go with no deal, save the money, put it to better use here, and then teach our own MPs to rule. They haven't done it in a long time.""

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"After five days of debate on Theresa May's Brexit agreement, MPs will finally vote on the deal later. The final day of debate will end with a speech from the prime minister at about 18:20 GMT. But before the vote on the Brexit agreement happens, MPs will get a chance to reshape, or reject, the deal by voting on a series of amendments to it, from about 19:00 GMT. This will start with votes on three or four backbench amendments that could reshape the deal. Each amendment will take about 15 minutes.

"This video can not be played 'I carry my heart in a rucksack' A woman who carries an artificial heart in a rucksack after her own organ was removed because of cancer has been added to the transplant list. Becca Henderson, 24, has been given the green light to receive a donor heart after scans showed she has been clear of cancer for a year. Now she is on the list, the Oxford University post-graduate student could get a new heart in weeks. ""At no point did it ever occur to me to give up,"" she told the BBC. ""No matter how hard it is for me, even if it is hard for me, it will then be easier for the next person. ""I had my sister's wedding and I had to get to that, I have other friends' weddings, I've got my mum, my dad, and I'm not going to be outlived by the dog."" Becca Henderson relies on the artificial heart to pump blood around her body In October she returned to study at Oxford - along with her parents, who are on standby in case the 7kg machine stops and the batteries need changing. Ms Henderson said: ""If anything goes wrong with the machine, they are the ones who can do the changeover in four minutes and save my life."" How an artificial heart works Mechanical heart patient's 'revolutionary' treatment Woman carries her heart in a rucksack Ms Henderson is one of two people in the UK with an artificial heart. Heart surgeon Stephen Westaby said Ms Henderson ""must be the most courageous young woman"". He congratulated her on the news there had been no sign the cancer had spread.

"Forget what might happen when the tellers read out the numbers on Tuesday night, let's think about what's at stake. With Brexit, it's nearly always subjective, but according to MPs and ministers of different flavours, these are some of the factors that matter and that the result might influence. Disagree at will of course - you may read these and scoff, or you may even have your own. But the meaningful vote may well end up having multiple meanings... Don't let British people down, May tells MPs Possible amendments to PM's Brexit deal Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit 1)Let's start with the least likely outcome. A miracle could take place overnight and scores of MPs might suddenly find themselves swinging behind the prime minister's plan. The vote goes through, she shouts hurray, and the process moves on smoothly. We leave the EU as planned in less than three months, and Theresa May's place in history is secure (no laughing at the back). 2)The defeat is disastrous and a combination of pressure from some ministers and MPs forces the PM to reach across the aisle. Depending on the scale of the defeat, and the reaction of Labour front and backbenchers, Westminster might be ushered into a different phase of bargaining across the benches. One Labour MP told me today: ""At some stage I will vote for the deal, but I will need something specific to show for it. We are about to enter an era of transactional politics."" Cross-party working may not be some kind of high-minded pursuit. 3)The scale of the likely loss might prompt the kind of parliamentary takeover that's been much discussed in the last couple of days. Arguably this might be one of the most long-lasting impacts. Rewriting the parliamentary rulebook may inevitably be largely of interest to nerds like me, but the kind of suggestions these extraordinary times are prompting might reshape the relationship between the government and MPs for years to come - and that matters. 4)Given that the balance in Parliament is definitely for a softer Brexit with closer ties to the EU, (arguably) the defeat on Tuesday might lead to a less dramatic break with the EU than the deal on the table promises. One member of the cabinet tonight told me: ""The longer this goes on, the softer Brexit gets."" Before you scream, I know that is not a view that is shared universally. But it is sincerely held by plenty of people around the place who point rather frustratedly to the irony. As another member of cabinet said: ""The hardline Brexiteers will push us toward a softer Brexit by digging in their resistance."" 5)Technically speaking, if you don't assume (and assumptions are dangerous) that Parliament can and would block no deal, the rejection of the plan would move us closer to leaving without a deal. That's not just because Eurosceptics are showing very little sign of budging, but remember the process is on a clock. Article 50 has to come to a conclusion by the end of March and, as the law currently stands, we are leaving with or without an agreement. Some other ministers in the cabinet believe very firmly once the vote is lost the PM has not much choice other than to up no-deal prep again in the hope, not of going that way, but of trying for another EU concession. One told me it is the ""only logical conclusion"" to keep going steadily and hope the EU will break - a continuation of the high-stakes poker game. 6)Jeremy Corbyn will either delight or disappoint his ranks by having the bottle to force a confidence vote, or delaying again, waiting for a magic moment. But he seems unlikely to take the bold step many of his members want and to move to offering another referendum. 7)For those campaigning for another European referendum, too, the scale of the defeat, and Tuesday night's front bench responses to it, are vital. The outcome of the vote will affect whether we leave the EU on time, and less likely, whether we could be given another say on whether we leave at all. And when those truths eventually reveal themselves, they in turn could have an impact on the fabric of the UK itself. What happens in Northern Ireland, or to the case for Scottish independence, are part of what is at stake in the long term. 8)Lastly, after more than two years of endless discussions, as and when the vote goes down on this hard-fought compromise, Westminster's factions and rival camps might finally have to do more than talk amongst themselves, and actually bend or break. The divisions are so intense in both the main political parties that it could also be the moment some of the divisions turn into real splits. That really would be history happening in front of our eyes.

"After five days of debate on Theresa May's Brexit agreement, MPs will finally vote on the deal later. The final day of debate will end with a speech from the prime minister at about 18:20 GMT. But before the vote on the Brexit agreement happens, MPs will get a chance to reshape, or reject, the deal by voting on a series of amendments to it, from about 19:00 GMT. This will start with votes on three or four backbench amendments that could reshape the deal. Each amendment will take about 15 minutes. The vote on the withdrawal agreement itself is unlikely to happen before 20:00 and is expected to be followed by a statement from Mrs May. There will be live updates onthe BBC News websiteand it will be broadcast on theBBC News channelor watchBBC Parliament liveon BBC iPlayer. Amendments give MPs the chance to reshape, or reject, the deal. Commons Speaker John Bercow has selected four amendments to be put to the vote: Labour frontbench amendment Rejects the deal because it fails to provide a permanent customs union and ""strong single market deal"", as set out in Labour's ""six tests"" Rejects leaving with no deal Resolves to ""pursue every option"" that prevents either no-deal or leaving on the basis of the current deal SNP and Plaid Cymru amendment Declines to approve Theresa May's Brexit deal ""in line with the views of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly that they would be damaging for Scotland, Wales and the nations and regions of the UK as a whole"" Calls for the UK's departure from the EU to be delayed until another withdrawal deal is agreed. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh's amendment Makes clear the Northern Ireland backstop is temporary and should remain temporary Calls for assurance that, if the backstop doesn't end by the close of 2021, this will be treated as a fundamental change of circumstances and would terminate the Withdrawal Treaty on 1 January 2022 Backed by 15 other Tory Brexiteers. Conservative MP John Baron's amendment Gives the UK the right to terminate the Northern Ireland backstop without the agreement of the EU Amendment backed by cross-party group of Brexiteers, including 12 Conservatives, one independent and one DUP MP. John Bercow told MPs that if they back Sir Edward Leigh's amendment, John Baron's amendment will not be voted on. You can see the full text of the motion and the amendments put down by MPs here,external. There is a question mark over how far the government's withdrawal agreement could be modified by MPs before it no longer has force under international law, or the EU judges it to be in breach of what was agreed by Mrs May. The government had indicated it would back an amendment proposed by Conservative MP Hugo Swire, which accepted the government's deal as the EU Withdrawal Bill but included provisions to: Make the government report to Parliament in March 2020 on the status of the arrangements to supersede the Northern Ireland backstop. This is the controversial ""insurance policy"" aimed at preventing the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland if the UK and EU have not agreed on a new trade deal by December 2020 Give Parliament a vote on whether to extend the 21-month post-Brexit transition period, which would end in December 2020 Give Parliament a vote on whether to implement the backstop Impose ""a duty"" on the government to agree a future relationship with the EU, or alternative arrangements, within one year of the backstop coming into force. But Speaker Bercow has not selected this amendment to be put to the vote, although MPs will be able to refer to it during the debate.

"David Duckenfield (left) and Graham Mackrell arrive at Preston Crown Court Match commander David Duckenfield's ""extraordinarily bad"" failures led to the deaths of 96 ""wholly innocent"" fans at Hillsborough, a court has heard. The ex-policeman did not quickly take measures to free Liverpool supporters trapped in the fatal crush at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final, jurors were told. Prosecutors said his actions ""contributed substantially"" to the ""tragic and unnecessary"" loss of life. Mr Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans. Ex-Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who is on trial alongside the former South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent, denies safety breaches. Opening the case at Preston Crown Court, prosecutor Richard Matthews QC said each of those who died did so as a result of ""the wholly innocent activity of attending a football match"". On the day of the disaster, he said, a capacity crowd of 50,000 had been expected at the game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Of those, jurors heard, 24,000 Reds supporters were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the Sheffield Wednesday ground. Pressure to get through the turnstiles ""almost inevitably"" built up outside the stadium before kick-off, Mr Matthews said. Under Mr Duckenfield's direction, the court heard, an exit gate - known as Gate C - was opened to alleviate the crush. Once inside the ground, Mr Matthews said, the crowd was met with a sign leading them towards two fenced pens on the terrace which were already full. ""David Duckenfield gave no thought to the inevitable consequence of the flood of people through Gate C,"" Mr Matthews said. ""Nor did he make any attempt to even monitor what was occurring, let alone avert the tragedy"". Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown in Dorset, would have had ""ultimate responsibility"" for the police operation as match commander, Mr Matthews told jurors. But as the disaster unfolded, the court was told, Mr Duckenfield failed to quickly declare a major incident or enact emergency measures to free trapped supporters. The senior officer also failed to provide ""emergency medical attention, particularly attempts at resuscitation"", in a timely fashion, Mr Matthews said. ""It is the prosecution's case that David Duckenfield's failures to discharge this personal responsibility were extraordinarily bad and contributed substantially to the deaths of each of those 96 people who so tragically and unnecessarily lost their lives,"" he added. Fans entered pens three and four through the central tunnel after Gate C was opened Outlining the prosecution's case, Mr Matthews said: Pressure built up outside turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium, where 24,000 Liverpool fans were to be directed An exit gate - known as Gate C - was opened after requests by Mr Duckenfield to do something to alleviate the crush outside Once inside the stadium, fans were met by a sign which led to pens three and four of the terrace - which were beneath the police control box Mr Duckenfield did nothing to monitor the capacity of the pens, which were already packed by the time the gate was opened He further failed to redirect the crowd to other, less crowded pens and control access to the tunnel to ""prevent the inevitable crush of fans effectively carried away down the slope of the tunnel"". ""Much about the Hillsborough disaster was extraordinary, not least the appalling scale of the loss of life, the scale of tragedy and the scale of those who failed to discharge their responsibilities with appropriate care,"" Mr Matthews said. ""Undoubtedly, each of the deceased has been failed by many, in many ways and over a protracted period; before, during and even after this disaster,"" he said. ""Each died as a result of the extraordinarily bad failures by David Duckenfield in the care he took to discharge his personal responsibility on that fateful day."" This video can not be played Jurors were shown a computer-generated video of key areas of the stadium The jury was shown photos, video footage and plans of the stadium, which was the third largest club football ground in England in 1989. One clip was a computer-generated recreation of Hillsborough as it would have looked at the time. Jurors were shown a ""walkthrough"" of the Leppings Lane end of the stadium up to pens three and four where the fatal crush occurred. Mr Matthews explained the turnstile configuration and showed pictures of the possible routes for fans to take once inside. He said in the event of a crush in pens three and four there was no means of escape, other than the way spectators had come in. ""The way in is through the tunnel. In a crush, the pressure is coming from that direction and the only way out is back against the pressure of that crush,"" he said. Jurors were told second defendant Mr Mackrell was the Sheffield Wednesday safety officer responsible for ensuring the club followed Home Office guidance. Mr Matthews said the club breached the conditions of its safety certificate by failing to agree methods of entry into the stadium with police before the semi-final. Mr Mackrell, of Stocking Pelham in Hertfordshire, committed an offence by ""by agreeing to, or at the very least turning a blind eye to,"" the breach, he said. Mackrell, who joined the club in 1986, is also charged with failing to take reasonable care of the health and safety of others, in respect of the arrangements for admission to the ground and the drawing-up of contingency plans. This concerned ensuring turnstiles were sufficient to admit fans at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds would be waiting outside and planning how to cope in the event that entrances proved insufficient to stop such a crowd from gathering, he said. Mr Matthews said: ""It is the prosecution's case that Mr Mackrell effectively shrugged off all responsibility for these important aspects of the role he had taken on as safety officer."" The court was adjourned until Wednesday. The 96 people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Jurors have been told 96 fans were killed as a result of a crush in pens at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. Of those, 94 died on the same day. The youngest of the victims had been 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley. Lee Nicol, 14, died two days later and Tony Bland, who suffered ""terrible brain damage"" was in a permanent vegetative state until his death in March 1993, jurors heard. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of Mr Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused.

"This video can not be played Nairobi Dusit hotel attack: explosions, gunfire and rescue operation Suspected militants have attacked a luxury hotel complex in Nairobi, killing at least 15 people. The compound in the Westlands district of the Kenyan capital, which houses the DusitD2 hotel as well as offices, was attacked by gunmen on Tuesday. By the evening officials said the siege was over but gunfire and explosions were heard early on Wednesday and a security operation is ongoing. The Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. Nairobi attack: Latest from the scene In pictures: Assault on hotel complex Police sources say 15 people have been killed, but an official number has not yet been confirmed by the government. Some civilians are reportedly still trapped in the complex, and some have been texting relatives from hiding places. A US citizen is among the dead, according to the US State Department. The fate of the attackers is also unclear. The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) when four gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say. A woman working in a neighbouring building told Reuters news agency: ""I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives."" Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area At 20:00 GMT, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i said all the buildings in the complex had been secured by security forces. ""The situation is under control and the country is safe,"" he told reporters. ""Terrorism will never defeat us."" But just an hour later gunfire and sporadic explosions were reported in the area. Security forces then combed their way through the building with reports saying frightened workers had barricaded themselves inside. In the early hours of Wednesday, more than 100 people were rescued from the complex and taken to a nearby trauma centre. About 30 people are being treated at Nairobi hospitals, media reports say, while the security operation is ongoing. People have been escorted out of the building with gunshot wounds The five-star DusitD2 hotel has 101 rooms. Located in the Westlands suburb, minutes from the capital's business district, it has its own spa and several restaurants. Kenya has seen a number of terror attacks in recent years - most notably in areas close to the Somali border and in the country's capital. By Joe Inwood, BBC News, Nairobi Every person escaping the Dusit complex has the same story - heavily armed men firing indiscriminately, using bombs and automatic rifles to kill. Most were too shaken to talk. They were all relieved to have escaped. They were coming out in small groups, many hours after the first explosions. The blasts could be heard across the city. I was in my flat round the corner when they happened, followed by the unmistakable sound of gunfire. The pictures that have been coming from inside are truly horrific. Ordinary people going about their business, murdered as they had lunch or did their jobs. This has a personal feel, too. The restaurant that seems to have taken the brunt of the explosions is a place I know well. It was full of lovely staff who would always greet you with a smile. As I sit watching the survivors escape, I wonder how many of them didn't make it. They are a militant Islamist group that opposes the Somali government but has also carried out attacks throughout East Africa. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? Kenya is part of a regional peacekeeping operation that supports the Somali government in its battle against al-Shabab. In September 2013,al-Shabab gunmen entered the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi and targeted shoppers. During an 80-hour siege at the upscale centre, 67 people were killed. Two years later,the group carried out its deadliest ever assault in Kenya, shooting dead almost 150 people at Garissa University. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab?

"Alfie Lamb was described in court as a ""smiley"" boy A three-year-old boy was fatally crushed by a car passenger seat pushed back by his mother's boyfriend who felt he was being too noisy, a court heard. Alfie Lamb, 3, cried out ""mummy"" before going ""ominously quiet"" in the footwell of the car, the Old Bailey was told. His mother, Adrian Hoare, 23, allegedly lied to police, telling them Alfie was in a taxi when he became unresponsive after falling asleep, in February 2018. She and her boyfriend Stephen Waterson deny manslaughter at the Old Bailey. Front passenger Mr Waterson, 25, allegedly pushed his seat back twice in anger at the ""noise and fuss"" Alfie was making in the rear footwell of an Audi being driven by acquaintance Marcus Lamb. Ms Hoare, who lives with Mr Waterson in Adams Way, Croydon, was in the rear seat, sitting above her son. Audi driver Mr Lamb, 22, told police Alfie collapsed during the journey back from shops with his then-girlfriend Emilie Williams, 19, and the defendants. He described how Hoare had been shouting at Alfie, who was screaming and crying. The witness alleged he heard Hoare slap her child before the front passenger seat moved back as Alfie called ""Mummy"". Mr Lamb claimed he only realised there was a problem when they arrived at Adams Way in Croydon, south London. Ms Hoare said ""what have you done?"", when Mr Waterson pulled Alfie from the car, Mr Lamb claimed. Duncan Atkinson QC, prosecuting, said a pathologist found the ""smiley boy"" died from crush asphyxia. ""It was caused by the front passenger seat of the Audi vehicle, Waterson's seat, being moved back further into the rear passenger side footwell at a time when, as was known, Alfie was in that footwell,"" Mr Atkinson said. ""In effect, he was squashed by the car seat and suffocated. This movement of the seat was a deliberate action by Waterson, who knew that Alfie was there and was angered by the noise and fuss that the three-and-a-half-year-old was making during the fateful car journey. ""The deliberate movement of the seat, by electrical operation by the touch of a button and involving the application of considerable force to Alfie, took place not once but twice."" Three charged over death of three-year-old boy in Croydon News and updates from across London Mr Atkinson said Mr Waterson moved the seat forward when others in the car realised it was causing Alfie to have breathing difficulties. ""However, when Alfie made noise again, Waterson deliberately moved his seat back again, and kept it in that reversed position, squashing Alfie, as he again showed signs of breathing problems until he went ominously quiet,"" he said. Ms Hoare had a duty of care to Alfie but did ""nothing"" to help him, Mr Atkinson added. Despite Mr Lamb trying to resuscitate the child, it was obvious to police and medics that Alfie had been dead for some time when they were called to Adams Way on the evening of 1 February, Mr Atkinson said. Alfie was found in cardiac arrest and was taken to hospital but his life support machine was switched off days later. Ms Hoare allegedly told paramedics Alfie had fallen asleep in a taxi, but was unresponsive when she tried to wake him. Mr Atkinson said this was ""only the beginning of the lies that she, and others, were to tell"". Police found CCTV footage of Ms Hoare, Mr Waterson, Mr Lamb and his ex Emilie Williams in a dark Audi car. Since then, Miss Williams had been attacked by Ms Hoare, and Mr Lamb intimidated by Mr Waterson, the court heard. Mr Lamb, 22, and Miss Williams, 19, are due to give evidence against the defendants. Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty, and common assault on Miss Williams. Mr Waterson denies manslaughter, and intimidation of Mr Lamb.

"MPs will soon decide the fate of Theresa May's Brexit deal. There are many views about why they should back or reject the deal, which was struck late last year with the European Union. But what do voters want MPs to do? And what do they think should happen if the deal is rejected? Polls suggest the deal has not proved popular with the public. YouGov has asked people whether they support or oppose it on no fewer than 11 occasions since it wasfirst unveiled in mid-November. Never have more than 27% said that they support the deal, while at least 42% have always said they are against it. Other polls show a similar pattern. Opinium found only one in 10 thinks the deal is good for the UK, while as many as half believe it is bad. Ipsos MORI has reported only a quarter think it would be a good thing for the UK to leave the EU on the terms of the deal. More than six in 10 believe it would be a bad thing. It is perhaps unsurprising then that many more voters say MPs should reject the deal than believe they should back it. More like this What British people think about Brexit now How young and old would vote on Brexit now Not only do Remain supporters seem inclined to reject the deal, but Leave voters do as well. In its recent polls, YouGov has found an average of 30% of Leave voters back the deal, while 47% are opposed to it. This arguably makes it harder for the PM to say that her deal fulfils the expectations of those who voted Leave in the referendum. That said, many voters have not made up their mind about the deal on offer. YouGov is still finding that about three in 10 still do not know whether they support it or not, well after the deal was revealed. This suggests some voters could yet be won round to Mrs May's proposal. While Remain and Leave voters appear to oppose the Brexit deal, they are split over what should be done instead. Opinium has repeatedly asked voters which of five possible options should be pursued if Parliament were to reject the current deal. None of the options comes close to being backed by a majority. The most popular every time - backed on average by just over a quarter - has been to leave without a deal at all. Meanwhile, the second most popular option each time - supported by just over a fifth - has been to hold a ""public vote"" on whether to accept the deal or to stay in the EU. While these options enjoy similar levels of support, they come from very different voter groups. Leaving without a deal is easily the single most popular option among those who voted Leave, chosen by an average of 46%. Holding a ""public vote"" on the deal, with an option to stay in the EU, is favoured among backers of Remain, 38% of whom pick this option. However, other courses of action also gain support. Fifteen per cent of all voters prefer attempting to negotiate a better deal, while 12% back Labour's preferred option of holding a general election. A further 9% support a different ""public vote"" in which the choice would be either Mrs May's deal or leaving the EU without one. Please upgrade your browser The idea of a second Brexit vote has attracted particular interest in recent weeks, thanks not least to a high-profile campaign. However, public support for the idea depends on how the poll question is worded. Polls asking whether there should be a ""public"" or ""people's vote"" - without specifying what the options would be - typically find that the idea is relatively popular. For example, Survation found that 48% support holding a ""people's vote"" to gauge the public's reaction to the deal, while 34% are opposed. Similarly, Populus reported that 44% believe the public should have the ""final say"" on the deal via a ""people's vote"", while just 30% are against this. However, when voters are asked about holding another referendum that might have the effect of reversing Brexit, the proposal attracts less support. ComRes has reported as many as 50% oppose ""holding a second referendum on whether to Remain or Leave"", with only 40% in favour. Similarly, according to polling commissioned by Lord Ashcroft, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, 47% are against holding a ""second referendum"", while 38% are in favour. In that scenario, voters would choose between leaving the EU under the terms of Mrs May's deal and remaining in the EU. The wording of the poll question seems to make a significant difference, particularly to Leave voters. Putting ""the people"" in charge of Brexit appeals to some Leavers, but a ballot which could potentially reverse the decision does not. Broadly, the idea of another referendum appears as controversial to voters as Brexit itself continues to be. When it comes to how people say they would vote if there were another referendum, the country still appears quite evenly divided. Remain, with an average score of 53% is enjoying just a narrow lead over Leave, which scored 47% in the most recent polls.

"Contact lens wearers will be able to recycle their lenses for free in a new UK-wide scheme launching this week. Wearers can dispose of their waste at public drop-off points, offered by Boots Opticians and other selected independent stores, or choose to have their old lenses collected. There are 3.7 million soft lens users in the UK who can access the scheme, regardless of which brand they use. The scheme also offers recycling for the blister and foil packaging. According to research by the organisers, Johnson and Johnson Vision,external, 20% of consumers currently flush their plastic lenses down the toilet or sink. Previously, if customers wanted to recycle their contact lenses and packaging they had to use a paid-for recycling service, the company said. The firm added that old lenses could be turned into items including outdoor furniture or plastic lumber. Sandra Rasche, area vice president of Johnson and Johnson Vision, said: ""70% of British contact lens wearers said they would recycle their contact lenses if they could and we share their interest in reducing the amount of plastics in the environment."" Stop flushing contact lenses down the toilet Why is recycling plastic so confusing? How big is the plastic problem? Roger Baynham, chairman of theBPF Recycling Group,external, said: ""It is encouraging that consumers are now becoming more conscious of the impact that waste can have on the environment. ""We strongly discourage people from flushing away any item made of plastic, as there is the risk it may find its way into the sea.""

"This video can not be played Nairobi Dusit hotel attack: explosions, gunfire and rescue operation Suspected militants have attacked a luxury hotel complex in Nairobi, killing at least 15 people. The compound in the Westlands district of the Kenyan capital, which houses the DusitD2 hotel as well as offices, was attacked by gunmen on Tuesday. By the evening officials said the siege was over but gunfire and explosions were heard early on Wednesday and a security operation is ongoing. The Somalia-based militant group al-Shabab said it was behind the attack. Nairobi attack: Latest from the scene In pictures: Assault on hotel complex Police sources say 15 people have been killed, but an official number has not yet been confirmed by the government. Some civilians are reportedly still trapped in the complex, and some have been texting relatives from hiding places. A US citizen is among the dead, according to the US State Department. The fate of the attackers is also unclear. The attack began at about 15:00 local time (12:00 GMT) when four gunmen threw bombs at vehicles in the car park before entering the lobby, where one blew himself up, police say. A woman working in a neighbouring building told Reuters news agency: ""I just started hearing gunshots, and then started seeing people running away raising their hands up and some were entering the bank to hide for their lives."" Security camera footage showed at least four heavily armed men walking in and opening fire. There are reports they had been seen visiting the compound in recent days. Security forces swiftly cordoned off the area At 20:00 GMT, Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i said all the buildings in the complex had been secured by security forces. ""The situation is under control and the country is safe,"" he told reporters. ""Terrorism will never defeat us."" But just an hour later gunfire and sporadic explosions were reported in the area. Security forces then combed their way through the building with reports saying frightened workers had barricaded themselves inside. In the early hours of Wednesday, more than 100 people were rescued from the complex and taken to a nearby trauma centre. About 30 people are being treated at Nairobi hospitals, media reports say, while the security operation is ongoing. People have been escorted out of the building with gunshot wounds The five-star DusitD2 hotel has 101 rooms. Located in the Westlands suburb, minutes from the capital's business district, it has its own spa and several restaurants. Kenya has seen a number of terror attacks in recent years - most notably in areas close to the Somali border and in the country's capital. By Joe Inwood, BBC News, Nairobi Every person escaping the Dusit complex has the same story - heavily armed men firing indiscriminately, using bombs and automatic rifles to kill. Most were too shaken to talk. They were all relieved to have escaped. They were coming out in small groups, many hours after the first explosions. The blasts could be heard across the city. I was in my flat round the corner when they happened, followed by the unmistakable sound of gunfire. The pictures that have been coming from inside are truly horrific. Ordinary people going about their business, murdered as they had lunch or did their jobs. This has a personal feel, too. The restaurant that seems to have taken the brunt of the explosions is a place I know well. It was full of lovely staff who would always greet you with a smile. As I sit watching the survivors escape, I wonder how many of them didn't make it. They are a militant Islamist group that opposes the Somali government but has also carried out attacks throughout East Africa. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab? Kenya is part of a regional peacekeeping operation that supports the Somali government in its battle against al-Shabab. In September 2013,al-Shabab gunmen entered the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi and targeted shoppers. During an 80-hour siege at the upscale centre, 67 people were killed. Two years later,the group carried out its deadliest ever assault in Kenya, shooting dead almost 150 people at Garissa University. Who are Somalia's al-Shabab?

"This video can not be played Romeo (L) is to meet Juliet (R) A frog believed to be the last of his kind in the world has been granted a reprieve from solitude. Romeo, known as the world's loneliest frog, has spent 10 years in isolation at an aquarium in Bolivia. Scientists say they have found him a Juliet after an expedition to a remote Bolivian cloud forest. Five Sehuencas water frogs found in a stream were captured, with the goal of breeding and re-introducing the amphibians back into the wild. Teresa Camacho Badani is chief of herpetology at the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide d'Orbigny in Cochabamba City and the expedition leader. She is optimistic that opposites will attract, even in frogs: ""Romeo is really calm and relaxed and doesn't move a whole lot,"" she told BBC News. ""He's healthy and likes to eat, but he is kind of shy and slow."" Juliet: A female Sehuencas water frog Juliet, however, has a very different personality. ""She's really energetic, she swims a lot and she eats a lot and sometimes she tries to escape."" The five frogs - three males and two females - are the first Seheuncas water frogs to be seen in the wild for a decade, despite previous searches in the Bolivian wilderness. Romeo was collected 10 years ago when biologists knew the species was in trouble, but was not expected to remain alone for so long. He attracted international attention a year ago over his search for a mate, and was even given a dating profile. Race to find mate for 'lonely' frog The newly discovered frogs are now in quarantine at the museum's conservation centre, where the race is on to stop the species from becoming extinct. Juliet with Teresa Camacho Badani An aquatic frog (Telmatobius yuracare) that was once abundant in the small streams, rivers and ponds of the montane cloud forest of Bolivia Water frogs are declining rapidly in Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru They face a combination of threats, including climate change, habitat destruction and the introduction of invasive trout Chris Jordan of Global Wildlife Conservation, which is supporting conservation efforts, said there is risk to taking animals into captivity. However, there are too few of the frogs in the wild to maintain a viable population in the long term, he said. ""We have a real chance to save the Sehuencas water frog - restoring a unique part of the diversity of life that is the foundation of Bolivia's forests, and generating important information on how to restore similar species at grave risk of extinction."" More frogs were found on an expedition The re-discovered frogs will be treated to protect against an infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, which is wiping out amphibians around the world. Romeo will then meet Juliet, in an attempt to produce offspring that can eventually be put back into their natural habitat. In Bolivia, 22% of amphibian species face some degree of extinction threat, from habitat loss, pollution and climate change. Searching the streams for frogs Teresa Camacho Badani says Romeo's story is important to draw attention to the plight of amphibians. They did not find any other water frogs in adjacent streams, raising worrying questions about the health of the ecosystem. ""It's a really good opportunity to use Romeo to help understand those threats, help understand how to bring those species back from the brink but also at the same time to take advantage of the global profile that Romeo and his species has now,"" she said. BBC World Service - The Inquiry, Can We Stop a Mass Extinction Other amphibians such as the Mallorcan midwife toad in Spain and the Kihansi spray toad of Tanzania have been bred and reintroduced from just a few individuals in the past. ""They provide hope in the context of this sixth mass extinction that there are solutions to maintain our wonderful biodiversity, to protect endangered and even extinct-in-the-wild species and bring them back and restore some of the beauty of these ecosystems,"" said Chris Jordan. All species are important and should not be underestimated as their DNA represents millions and millions of years of evolution, he added. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"The purple dots and lines on this photo of the Stratosphere hotel in Las Vegas show the damage... A man who took a photograph of a driverless car on display at the CES tech fair says his camera was damaged as a result. Jit Ray Chowdhury noticed purple spots on all his photographs after taking a photo of a lidar laser scanning system displayed by San Francisco firm AEye. He says the $1,198 (Â£930) Sony camera was one month old and the firm has offered to buy him a replacement. AEye said its system is not harmful to human eyes. Mr Chowdhury said at first he thought he had damaged the camera himself. ""It was the first morning of CES and I had some helicopter tours later on where I wanted to use this new camera and now it's not working,"" he said. ""Later at night after reading up on different types of camera sensor damages and going through the photos again I discovered that it was the lidar."" ... and in this aerial view of the Hoover Dam AEye did not respond to the BBC's request for comment butin a statement to Ars Technica,external, chief executive Luis Dussan said: ""Cameras are up to 1,000 times more sensitive to lasers than eyeballs... Occasionally, this can cause thermal damage to a camera's focal-plane array."" Mr Chowdhury said he was happy with the firm's response but he thought a warning should have been issued at the stand. ""I have personally tested many lidar systems and taken pictures up close and [they] did not harm my camera,"" he said. ""Lidar companies should test how camera-safe they are."" Lidar works in a similar way to radar and sonar, using lasers rather than radio or soundwaves, explained Zeina Nazer, a postgraduate researcher at the University of Southampton specialising in driverless car technology. ""Powerful lasers can damage cameras,"" she said. ""Camera sensors are, in general, more susceptible to damage than the human eye from lasers. Consumers are usually warned never to point a camera directly at laser emitters during a laser show."" The lidar system on the top of the demonstration car Ms Nazer added that for cameras to be immune to high power laser beams, they need an optical filter that cuts out infrared which is invisible to humans. However, it can affect night vision, when infrared can be an advantage. ""AEye is known for its lidar units with much longer range than their competitors, ranging 1km compared to 200m or 300m,"" she said. ""In my opinion, AEye should not use their powerful fibre laser during shows.""

"This video can not be played Key figures in the Brexit debate give us their views MPs have begun to vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal for leaving the European Union. The so-called ""meaningful vote"" comes at the end of five days of debate over the plan. Mrs May called for politicians to back her deal or risk ""letting the British people down"". But with many of her own MPs expected to join opposition parties to vote against the deal, it is widely expected to be defeated. Brexit Live: Rolling updates ahead of crunch vote Labour, the SNP and Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh all pulled the amendments that they had proposed to the deal before they came to a vote. Tory MP John Baron insisted MPs vote on his - which would have given the UK the right to terminate the Northern Ireland backstop without the agreement of the EU - but it was defeated by 600 votes to 24. Closing the debate on her deal, Mrs May said the responsibility of MPs was ""profound"" and that her deal ""delivers on the core tenets of Brexit... in a way that protects jobs, ensures our security and honours the integrity of our United Kingdom"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said backing the ""botched and damaging"" deal would be a ""reckless leap in the dark"" for the UK. What's next if MPs reject May's deal? Kuenssberg: Playing the numbers game The prime minister addressed her cabinet on Tuesday morning before heading to the Commons for the start of the debate on her deal - which includes both the withdrawal agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves the EU and a political declaration for the future relationship. She had spent the lead up to the vote trying to reassure MPs from all sides of the House over the controversial Northern Irish ""backstop"" - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland - having receivednew written assurances,externalfrom the EU that it would be temporary and, if triggered, would last for ""the shortest possible period"". Speaking at the close of the debate, Mrs May added: ""If we leave with the deal I am proposing, I believe we can lay the foundations for which to build a better Britain. ""And as prime minister I would not stand at this dispatch box and recommended a course of action that I do not believe is in the best interests of our country and our future."" Pro-Brexit demonstrators are making their voices heard Anti- Brexit campaigners are holding a mass rally in Parliament Square With fancy dress, lurid floats and colourful banners, there has been something approaching a carnival atmosphere opposite Parliament, as pro and anti-Brexit demonstrators make their voices heard ahead of the MPs' vote. A rally by supporters of the People's Vote campaign for another referendum is currently taking place in nearby Parliament Square. Passionate protests outside Parliament Opening the final day of the debate earlier, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave an impassioned speech to the Commons with the prime minister by his side, saying that voting for the deal was ""the first of two keys that will unlock our future with the European Union"", allowing the government to focus on the future relationship. He said that MPs could not underestimate the complexity of Brexit and that the deal offered an ""orderly, predictable and legally certain"" way of leaving the bloc, without ""thousands"" of legal issues arising for citizens and businesses. ""If you found yourself suddenly with the rug pulled from under you, not knowing what your legal obligations would be, you would say to this House, 'What are you playing at? What are you doing?' ""You are not children in the playground, you are legislators, and it is your job. We are playing with people's lives,"" he said. This video can not be played Geoffrey Cox: ""You are not children in the playground"" But many remain opposed to the deal, with about 100 Conservative MPs and the DUP's 10 MPs expected to join Labour and the other opposition parties in voting it down. Mr Corbyn told the Commons: ""The prime minister has treated Brexit as a matter for the Conservative Party rather than for the good of the country. But she has failed to even win over her own party. ""This deal is a bad deal for our economy, a bad deal for our democracy, and a bad deal for this country."" Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said that Brexiteers like him could back a deal if aspects such as the backstop were dealt with. But he told the Today programme the EU had played ""a smart game of hard ball"" and said it was time for the UK to do the same. This video can not be played DUP's Sammy Wilson: ""The deal would remove us from the rest of the United Kingdom"" Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said the backstop ""was something that we could not accept"" and said her party's MPs would be voting against the deal. ""It (the backstop) does violence to the union - it separates us from the rest of the United Kingdom in a very very obvious way,"" she said, calling for Mrs May to ""get rid"" of the backstop. And speaking during the Commons debate, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford, reiterated his belief that there was ""no such thing as a good Brexit"" and his party would continue to fight against leaving. ""There is no way that the Scottish National Party and the people of Scotland are going to be sitting in that bus as the prime minister drives us off the cliff,"" he said. BBC Brussels correspondent, Adam Fleming, said the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will be returning to the city later to deal with ""Brexit-related business"", fuelling speculation Mrs May will make an emergency visit on Wednesday if her deal is voted down. When asked by the BBC for a message to MPs ahead of the vote, he said: ""I would like them to behave in a responsible way."" The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, also appealed for MPs to ""keep calm"" when voting later. He will be holding talks with the European Parliament's Brexit steering group later tonight in Strasbourg before a debate on Wednesday morning about the result of the meaningful vote. Brexit: A really simple guide What could happen next? How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit The deal suffered a heavy defeat in the House of Lords on Monday night, as peers backed a Labour motion by 321 votes to 152. While the Lords vote carries no real weight, as peers accepted MPs should have the final say, the motion - which also rejected a ""no deal"" scenario - expressed ""regret"" that Mrs May's deal would ""damage the future economic prosperity, internal security and global influence"" of the UK. This video can not be played Brexit plan: Political declaration and withdrawal agreement However, five Conservative Brexiteer MPs who have been critics of the withdrawal agreement have now said they will support the government, along with three Labour backbenchers and independent Frank Field. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said it showed there had been ""progress"" but admitted to the BBC's Politics Live that gaining support was ""challenging"". Speaking to his own backbenchers on Monday night, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn again condemned the deal and repeated his call for a general election if it was voted down by Parliament. He also promised Labour would call a no-confidence vote in the government ""soon"". Please upgrade your browser If the deal is rejected by MPs, Mrs May has three sitting days to return to Parliament with a ""Plan B"". Some have suggested she would head to Brussels on Wednesday to try to get further concessions from the EU, before returning to the Commons to give a statement about her new proposal by Monday. This could then be put to a vote by MPs. If this also fails, there is a proposal put forward by senior Conservative backbenchers Nick Boles, Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan for a ""European Union Withdrawal Number 2 Bill"". This would give ministers another three weeks to come up with another plan and get it through Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Laura Kuenssberg sets out some potential scenarios after the vote In another development, a cross-party group of anti-Brexit politicians has published proposed legislation to bring about another referendum to ask the public whether they want to remain in the EU or leave under the prime minister's deal. This video can not be played Lib Dems' Layla Moran: ""Brexit is a complete cluster shambles"" The MPs behind the draft legislation point out that Article 50 - the two-year process by which an EU member can leave the bloc - would have to be extended in order for another referendum to take place, meaning the UK would remain a member beyond 29 March. But, unless new legislation is introduced, the default position will be that the UK leaves the EU on that date with no deal. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"MPs will soon decide the fate of Theresa May's Brexit deal. There are many views about why they should back or reject the deal, which was struck late last year with the European Union. But what do voters want MPs to do? And what do they think should happen if the deal is rejected? Polls suggest the deal has not proved popular with the public. YouGov has asked people whether they support or oppose it on no fewer than 11 occasions since it wasfirst unveiled in mid-November. Never have more than 27% said that they support the deal, while at least 42% have always said they are against it. Other polls show a similar pattern. Opinium found only one in 10 thinks the deal is good for the UK, while as many as half believe it is bad. Ipsos MORI has reported only a quarter think it would be a good thing for the UK to leave the EU on the terms of the deal. More than six in 10 believe it would be a bad thing. It is perhaps unsurprising then that many more voters say MPs should reject the deal than believe they should back it. More like this What British people think about Brexit now How young and old would vote on Brexit now Not only do Remain supporters seem inclined to reject the deal, but Leave voters do as well. In its recent polls, YouGov has found an average of 30% of Leave voters back the deal, while 47% are opposed to it. This arguably makes it harder for the PM to say that her deal fulfils the expectations of those who voted Leave in the referendum. That said, many voters have not made up their mind about the deal on offer. YouGov is still finding that about three in 10 still do not know whether they support it or not, well after the deal was revealed. This suggests some voters could yet be won round to Mrs May's proposal. While Remain and Leave voters appear to oppose the Brexit deal, they are split over what should be done instead. Opinium has repeatedly asked voters which of five possible options should be pursued if Parliament were to reject the current deal. None of the options comes close to being backed by a majority. The most popular every time - backed on average by just over a quarter - has been to leave without a deal at all. Meanwhile, the second most popular option each time - supported by just over a fifth - has been to hold a ""public vote"" on whether to accept the deal or to stay in the EU. While these options enjoy similar levels of support, they come from very different voter groups. Leaving without a deal is easily the single most popular option among those who voted Leave, chosen by an average of 46%. Holding a ""public vote"" on the deal, with an option to stay in the EU, is favoured among backers of Remain, 38% of whom pick this option. However, other courses of action also gain support. Fifteen per cent of all voters prefer attempting to negotiate a better deal, while 12% back Labour's preferred option of holding a general election. A further 9% support a different ""public vote"" in which the choice would be either Mrs May's deal or leaving the EU without one. Please upgrade your browser The idea of a second Brexit vote has attracted particular interest in recent weeks, thanks not least to a high-profile campaign. However, public support for the idea depends on how the poll question is worded. Polls asking whether there should be a ""public"" or ""people's vote"" - without specifying what the options would be - typically find that the idea is relatively popular. For example, Survation found that 48% support holding a ""people's vote"" to gauge the public's reaction to the deal, while 34% are opposed. Similarly, Populus reported that 44% believe the public should have the ""final say"" on the deal via a ""people's vote"", while just 30% are against this. However, when voters are asked about holding another referendum that might have the effect of reversing Brexit, the proposal attracts less support. ComRes has reported as many as 50% oppose ""holding a second referendum on whether to Remain or Leave"", with only 40% in favour. Similarly, according to polling commissioned by Lord Ashcroft, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, 47% are against holding a ""second referendum"", while 38% are in favour. In that scenario, voters would choose between leaving the EU under the terms of Mrs May's deal and remaining in the EU. The wording of the poll question seems to make a significant difference, particularly to Leave voters. Putting ""the people"" in charge of Brexit appeals to some Leavers, but a ballot which could potentially reverse the decision does not. Broadly, the idea of another referendum appears as controversial to voters as Brexit itself continues to be. When it comes to how people say they would vote if there were another referendum, the country still appears quite evenly divided. Remain, with an average score of 53% is enjoying just a narrow lead over Leave, which scored 47% in the most recent polls.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 599 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union. Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls outthe key points from the agreement,externaland what they mean. The transition period (which the UK government calls ""implementation period"")  is due to last for 21 months. The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions. The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or ""divorce bill"") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations. While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least Â£39bn and it will be paid over a number of years. Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. In 2018/19 the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net Â£10.8bn. If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately. Chris Morris's analysis:It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court. All you need to know about Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition. Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. Chris Morris's analysis:The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders after the transition period, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now are also unresolved issues. If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of ""a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom"" will be triggered. Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market. As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to ""level playing field conditions"", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory. The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU. Chris Morris's analysis:The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters. The document says: ""The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."" Chris Morris's analysis:Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters. It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be. The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition. A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly. Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision. Chris Morris's analysis:Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come. Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus. There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled. EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like ""Welsh Lamb"" or ""Parma Ham"" remain. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.

"Graham Mackrell (left) and David Duckenfield arrived at Preston Crown Court earlier Potential jurors at the manslaughter trial of Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield have been asked to reveal their football allegiances. Mr Duckenfield, 74, appeared at Preston Crown Court at the start of his trial. He denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. Jury candidates were asked whether they supported Liverpool, Everton, Sheffield Wednesday or Nottingham Forest. More than 20 family members of those who died were in the public gallery. Other relatives of the 96 victims watched proceedings via a videolink from Liverpool. Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown in Dorset, is accused in relation to the deaths of 95 people who were in the crowd at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground for the FA Cup semi-final. between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989. The retired chief superintendent was South Yorkshire Police's match commander for the game. Men, women and children died in the crush in pens at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough. The 96 people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Mr Duckenfield sat in the well of the court as 100 potential jurors were asked to answer a questionnaire made up of 18 questions. He sat alongside former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who is charged with contravening the stadium's safety certificate and a health and safety offence. Mr Mackrell was the club's designated safety officer for the Hillsborough stadium. Judge Sir Peter Openshaw warned the jury panel that the trial ""might last three or even four months"". Other questions on the form included whether potential jurors, close family members or friends had ever been police officers or been employed by the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Independent Police Complaints Commission or any criminal justice agency. The two defendants were asked to stand up so the panel could see whether anyone recognised them.  A list of the witnesses to be called was also read out. In addition, the panel was warned not to look up anything about the disaster on the internet. After filling in the questionnaires 68 panel members were excused from serving on the jury. Sir Peter told the remaining 32 he would allow them to reflect on their positions overnight and they would be able to make any further submissions on Tuesday, before the jury was selected by ballot. Mr Duckenfield previously appeared via videolink to enter a not guilty plea to the charge of gross negligence manslaughter.

"This video can not be played Watch: CCTV footage of Kumar throwing the poppy wreaths A homeless man who threw poppy wreaths from a war memorial on to the road described his actions as ""shameful"" as he was jailed for eight weeks. Ashwani Kumar took 50 wreaths from the Cenotaph on Regent Street, Swindon, and scattered them in the road on Saturday. A court heard the alcoholic had drunk around three quarters of a bottle of vodka and could not remember a thing. Kumar, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to outraging public decency at Salisbury Magistrates' Court. The 54-year-old, who had recently been released from prison, told the court he had not been taking his depression medication before committing the offence. He said that he did not remember anything shown on CCTV to the court. ""I have been 34 years here and I've never done anything like this,"" he said. ""I'm an alcoholic. I'm very sorry."" Officers on patrol came across the wreaths in the early hours of Saturday Magistrate Simon Crichton said: ""This was a serious matter and would have caused great offence to many people. ""It's further made serious by the fact you committed the offence soon after being released from prison."" Kumar would have been given a 12-week custodial sentence but it was reduced to eight weeks owing to his early guilty plea, Mr Crichton said. He was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£115. Kumar, who lives in a car park in Swindon and receives benefits, had recently served 17 weeks in jail for battery, criminal damage and assault, the court heard. Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard described Kumar's actions as ""a total disgrace"". ""I laid our Wiltshire Police wreath at this cenotaph on 11 November alongside many war veterans to show respect to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to provide the freedoms we enjoy today,"" he added.

"Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987, since when it has become one of China's biggest companies Huawei's founder has denied Chinese authorities have ever asked his company to help spy on its clients. Ren Zhengfei was speaking to foreign media in a rare interview, following claims Huawei posed a security risk. He also said he was missing his daughter Meng Wanzhou ""very much"". Ms Meng - who is the technology company's chief financial officer - has been ordered to stay in Canada, where she is under arrest after being accused of breaking sanctions on Iran. She now faces extradition to the US, which requested the move. The telecom equipment-maker's actions are also under scrutiny elsewhere. Last week, one of its sales executives was arrested in Poland, where the authorities have accused him of spying. Huawei has since sacked the employee and denied any illegal behaviour was being carried out on its behalf. In addition, concerns have been raised in the UK and elsewhere about the use of the company's equipment in 5G networks and other communications infrastructure, with claims that it could provide Beijing a way to spy on or disrupt data. Poland spy arrest: Huawei sacks employee 'Deep concerns' over Huawei's role in UK 5G upgrade China accuses UK of 'pride and prejudice' The media event was only the third time Mr Ren has hosted such a briefing with foreign reporters. The last such event was more than three years ago. Six writers were invited, including reporters fromthe Financial Times,external,Bloomberg,externalandthe Wall Street Journal,external. One of the concerns frequently cited about Huawei is that Mr Ren joined China's Communist Party in 1978 and was also a member of the People's Liberation Army. But the 74-year-old told the journalists: ""I love my country. I support the Communist Party. But I will not do anything to harm the world."" He added that Beijing had never asked him or his company to share ""improper information"" about its partners. ""I personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests,"" he said. ""No law in China requires any company to install mandatory backdoors,"" he added, addressing suggestions that Huawei might make it possible for Chinese spies to extract data directly themselves. Mr Ren's eldest daughter, Ms Meng, has denied allegations that she broke US sanctions on Iran and of conspiring to defraud banks by pretending that one of Huawei subsidiaries was not linked to the company. Meng Wanzhou was granted bail by a Vancouver judge last month China has claimed that the case is an abuse of legal procedures. It now threatens to add to tensions between the US and China at a time the two are involved in a trade dispute. In December, President Trumpsuggested he might interveneif it suited the US's national security interests or might help secure a trade deal. At the Shenzhen event, Mr Ren described Mr Trump as being a ""great president"". ""He dares to massively cut tax, which will benefit... business,"" he added. Mr Trump is also reportedly considering an executive order that would formally ban US companies from using equipment made by Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company,external. But Mr Ren held out the prospect of this being avoided. ""The message to the US I want to communicate is, 'Collaboration and shared success',"" he said. But he appeared to acknowledge that in some cases Huawei would be unable to sell its products overseas. Australia has already banned it from selling 5G technology to local network providers. New Zealand has also blocked a deal involving one of its companies. ""You can't work with everyone,"" said Mr Ren. ""We'll shift our focus to better serve countries that welcome Huawei.""

"This video can not be played The machete-wielding man was filmed from a nearby train A machete-wielding man was Tasered on a railway station platform as ""terrified"" rush hour commuters looked on.

"Laurent Gbagbo had been charged with crimes against humanity The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has acquitted Ivory Coast ex-President Laurent Gbagbo. He had been charged with crimes against humanity in connection with violence following a disputed 2010 election that left 3,000 dead and 500,000 displaced. Mr Gbagbo was captured in 2011 in a presidential palace bunker by UN and French-backed forces supporting his rival, Alassane Ouattara. He was the first former head of state to go on trial at the ICC. The violence in Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer, came after Mr Gbagbo refused to accept that he had lost a disputed election run-off to Mr Ouattara in 2010. The five months of violence that followed were described as some of the most brutal clashes the country had ever seen. What does this mean for the ICC? Laurent Gbagbo: Ivory Coast's defiant 'Cicero' Africa live: Loud cheers greet Gbagbo acquittal During the political stand-off there were bloody clashes and targeted killings in Abidjan in the south, and several hundred were massacred in the western town of Duekoue. Prosecutors said Mr Gbagbo clung to power ""by all means"" and charged him with four counts of crimes against humanity, murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and ""other inhuman acts"". He denied the charges, which he said were politically motivated. Victims of the 2010 post-election violence are opposed to Mr Gbagbo's release ICC judges ruled on Tuesday that he had no case to answer and ordered his immediate release. Prosecutors had failed to demonstrate ""the existence of a 'common plan' to keep Mr Gbagbo in power"" which included crimes against civilians, or a ""policy to attack a civilian population"", the ICC said. Presiding Judge Cuno Tarfusser said the prosecution had also ""failed to demonstrate that public speeches by Gbagbo constituted ordering or inducing the alleged crimes"". Prosecutors can appeal after the court files its decision in writing. Mr Gbagbo's supporters whooped, cheered and threw their firsts in the air in the public gallery following the announcement, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports from the court. Mr Gbagbo's supporters are jubilant One of his supporters, Gragbayou Yves, who had travelled to the court from Paris, told AFP news agency: ""I am very, very happy. Finally there is some justice."" However, victims of the violence are opposed to his release. ""If Laurent Gbagbo is released, we victims will not see justice,"" Karim Coulibaly, who was shot in the violence and had to have his arm amputated, told AFP earlier. ""I was a driver but now I am unemployed. I'm not against reconciliation but first you have to look after the victims."" Paolina Massidda, a lawyer representing the victims said she ""deeply regrets"" the decision. ""The victims participated in this trial in the hope that an impartial tribunal could one day give them justice. That hope is today in vain,"" she added. ""Whenever a case involving mass atrocities essentially collapses at the ICC, it does damage to the perception of the court as a credible and effective institution of international justice,""Mark Kersten, author of Justice in Conflict, told the BBC's Anna Holligan. ""Many are concerned that the court is emerging as an institution where only rebels can be successfully prosecuted,"" he added. The prosecution at the ICC has also failed in its attempts to build successful cases against former DR Congo Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba, and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. On the other hand, the ruling demonstrates the judges' independence and impartiality and makes it harder to push the narrative, popular among those who fear the long arm of the ICC, that the court is a biased weapon of neo-colonial justice used purely to convict African leaders, our correspondent says. Janet Anderson, a writer for the Justice Tribune, told the BBC: ""It's important also to find people not guilty or to find there isn't a case to answer if there isn't one.""

"Det Sgt Nick Bailey was contaminated at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March A police officer poisoned in the Salisbury Novichok attack has returned to active duty. Det Sgt Nick Bailey was contaminated with the nerve agent in March at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, where it had been sprayed on the door handle, and needed hospital treatment. Wiltshire Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Angus Macpherson confirmed the officer had now returned to work. ""He's doing very well and we look forward to working with him,"" he said. ""He's making a good recovery - but I suspect the mental recovery will be longer, as it would for any of us who were exposed to something as horrific as that. ""He will be given all the support he needs."" The Skripals also survived the attack which was condemned by Prime Minister Theresa May Speaking to the BBC in November, Det Sgt Baileydescribed being ""petrified""when doctors broke the news to him he had been poisoned with Novichok. He and two colleagues were sent to the Skripals' home, after the former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury on the afternoon of Sunday 4 March. The Skripals survived the attack, which Prime Minister Theresa May said had ""almost certainly"" been approved by the Russian state. 'We lost everything because of Novichok' The Salisbury poisoning: What happened next? Why Novichok stays deadly for so long Dawn Sturgess, 44, fell ill in Amesbury months after the incident and died in hospital in July after coming into contact with a perfume bottle believed to have been used in the attack on the Skripals and then discarded. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, was also exposed to the same nerve agent but was treated and discharged. Two Russian nationals were accused of travelling to the UK to try to murder Mr Skripal with Novichok. The two men - known by their aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov - were caught on CCTV in Salisbury the day before the attack.

"Having sex too soon is the biggest regret of young people losing their virginity, a survey of British sexual behaviour suggests. More than a third of women and a quarter of men in their teens and early 20s admitted it had not been ""the right time"" when they first had sex. People must be 16 or over to legally consent to sex. Thelatest National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles poll says,externalmany people may not be ready at that age. The Natsal survey, carried out every decade or so, gives a detailed picture of sexual behaviour in the UK. For this latest work, published in BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine looked at the responses of nearly 3,000 young people who had completed the survey between 2010 and 2012. The responses showed that nearly 40% of young women and 26% of young men did not feel that their first sexual experience had happened ""at the right time"". When asked in more depth, most said they wished they had waited longer to lose their virginity. Few said they should have done it sooner. Most had had sex by the time they were 18 - half had done it by the time they were turning 17. Nearly a third had sex before turning 16. The survey also looked at sexual competence or readiness - whether a person could reasonably make an informed decision about whether to have sex for the first time. For example, they had to be sober enough to have consented and should not have been acting on peer pressure. Around half of the young women and four in 10 of the young men who responded failed this measure. And almost one in five women and one in 10 men said they and their partner had not been equally willing to have sex at the time, suggesting some felt pressured to have intercourse. What do young people think of safe sex? Are teenagers having less sex? Young people 'experimenting more in bed' Founder of the Natsal survey, Prof Kaye Wellings, said the age of consent was not an indicator that someone might be ready to become sexually active. ""Every young person is different - some 15-year-olds may be ready while some 18-year-olds are not."" Co-researcher Dr Melissa Palmer said: ""Our findings seem to support the idea that young women are more likely than young men to be under pressure from their partners to have sex. ""Although the survey results yielded some positive outcomes, such as nearly nine in 10 young people using a reliable method of contraception at first sex, further efforts are required to ensure that the broader wellbeing of young people is protected as they become sexually active."" She said sex education in schools should equip young people with the right negotiating skills to enable them to have safe and positive first sexual experiences. If you think you might have sex, ask yourself: Does it feel right? Do I love my partner? Does he/she love me just as much? Have we talked about using condoms to prevent STIs and HIV, and was the talk OK? Have we got contraception organised to protect against pregnancy? Do I feel able to say ""no"" at any point if I change my mind, and will we both be OK with that? If you answer yes to all these questions, the time may be right. But if you answer yes to any of the following questions, it might not be: Do I feel under pressure from anyone, such as my partner or friends? Could I have any regrets afterwards? Am I thinking about having sex just to impress my friends or keep up with them? Am I thinking about having sex just to keep my partner? Source:NHS Choices,external Isabel Inman from the sexual health charity Brook said: ""We firmly believe that age and stage appropriate relationships and sex education (RSE) should start early in order to empower young people to make positive decisions that are right for them.

"China has rejected accusations from Canada that it is arbitrarily applying a death sentence to a Canadian convicted of drug smuggling. The foreign ministry told Canadian PM Justin Trudeau to ""stop making such irresponsible remarks"", accusing Canada of ""double standards"". Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was initially given a 15-year jail term in November. But on Monday a court increased this to the death penalty, saying the original sentence was too lenient. The ruling is likely to worsen a diplomatic row between the countries, which has been escalating since Canada arrested an official of China's Huawei telecoms giant last month. China has expressed anger at the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, on suspicion of using a subsidiary company to evade US sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. She was detained at the request of the United States. Ms Meng, 46, denies the charges. She was granted bail shortly after her arrest, but remains under constant surveillance and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Huawei founder denies spy risk claims What's going on with Huawei? Life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Denying that Beijing had politicised Schellenberg's case in response to Ms Meng's arrest, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged Canada to ""respect China's judicial sovereignty"". ""The comments from the Canadian government are full of double standards,"" Ms Hua said, adding: ""The Canadians are the ones who have arbitrarily arrested somebody,"" in an apparent reference to Ms Meng. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Tuesday that Canada had formally appealed for clemency for Schellenberg.  She also struck a softer tone when she spoke of the ""very important and long-standing ties"" between both countries. ""It is true that this is a difficult moment,"" she told a news conference in Quebec. ""The best thing for both Canada and China... is to get past these current difficulties."" The Canadian, who is believed to be 36, was arrested in 2014 and accused of planning to smuggle almost 500lb (227kg) of methamphetamine from China to Australia. Schellenberg, who has previous drugs-related convictions in Canada,external, has denied the charges against him, saying he entered China as a tourist and was framed. Schellenberg case: What we know so far Who is detained Canadian Michael Spavor? Mr Trudeau has condemned the latest ruling, saying: ""It is of extreme concern to us... that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply the death penalty."" Drug dealing is punishable by death in China, and at leasta dozen foreigners have been executed,externalfor drug-related offenses. Many more are on death row. Schellenberg was tried at the Dalian Intermediate People's Court However, the execution of Westerners is less common. One of the most high-profile cases involvedBritish man Akmal Shaikh, who was executed in 2009,externaldespite claims he was mentally ill and an appeal for clemency from the UK prime minister. His family said that Shaikh had never received a mental health assessment and that judges at an appeal hearing laughed openly at Shaikh as he pleaded for his life. China has argued that Schellenberg's death sentence was not political. However, some analysts have argued that both the timing, and the publicity given to Schellenberg's retrial has been unusual. How many countries still have the death penalty? US travel warning amid China arrests It took a Chinese court two and a half years to hand down Schellenberg's initial sentence of 15 years - but the retrial lasted just a day. China also worked hard to push Schellenberg's case to international prominence, taking the highly unusual step of inviting foreign journalists into the court, the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing reports. Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of Huawei's founder Donald Clarke, a specialist in Chinese law at George Washington University, said that Schellenberg's death sentence appeared to be ""an unprecedented step in China's diplomacy"". ""I have seen cases I considered unjust before, but I cannot recall a previous case that looked so clearly unconnected to the defendant's guilt or innocence,"" Prof Clarke told the BBC's Chinese service. Schellenberg's lawyer, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters that his client's sentence should not have been increased, because no new evidence had been presented at the retrial. He intends to appeal. Chinese state media have reacted angrily,externalto claims the death sentence is linked to Ms Meng's case. Nationalist newspaper Global Times called it ""unreasonable speculation"" in Western media, arguing it showed ""rude contempt toward Chinese law"". However, back in December, the editor of the Global Times had warned that China would ""definitely take retaliatory measures against Canada"" if Ms Meng were not released, adding: ""If Canada extradites Meng to the US, China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian."" China was previously accused of tit-for-tat action, after it detained two other Canadian citizens in the weeks following Ms Meng's arrest. Former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor face accusations of harming national security. Canadian's death sentence 'horrific' Who is China prisoner Robert Lloyd Schellenberg?

"David Duckenfield (left) and Graham Mackrell arrive at Preston Crown Court Match commander David Duckenfield's ""extraordinarily bad"" failures led to the deaths of 96 ""wholly innocent"" fans at Hillsborough, a court has heard. The ex-policeman did not quickly take measures to free Liverpool supporters trapped in the fatal crush at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final, jurors were told. Prosecutors said his actions ""contributed substantially"" to the ""tragic and unnecessary"" loss of life. Mr Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans. Ex-Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who is on trial alongside the former South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent, denies safety breaches. Opening the case at Preston Crown Court, prosecutor Richard Matthews QC said each of those who died did so as a result of ""the wholly innocent activity of attending a football match"". On the day of the disaster, he said, a capacity crowd of 50,000 had been expected at the game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Of those, jurors heard, 24,000 Reds supporters were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the Sheffield Wednesday ground. Pressure to get through the turnstiles ""almost inevitably"" built up outside the stadium before kick-off, Mr Matthews said. Under Mr Duckenfield's direction, the court heard, an exit gate - known as Gate C - was opened to alleviate the crush. Once inside the ground, Mr Matthews said, the crowd was met with a sign leading them towards two fenced pens on the terrace which were already full. ""David Duckenfield gave no thought to the inevitable consequence of the flood of people through Gate C,"" Mr Matthews said. ""Nor did he make any attempt to even monitor what was occurring, let alone avert the tragedy"". Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown in Dorset, would have had ""ultimate responsibility"" for the police operation as match commander, Mr Matthews told jurors. But as the disaster unfolded, the court was told, Mr Duckenfield failed to quickly declare a major incident or enact emergency measures to free trapped supporters. The senior officer also failed to provide ""emergency medical attention, particularly attempts at resuscitation"", in a timely fashion, Mr Matthews said. ""It is the prosecution's case that David Duckenfield's failures to discharge this personal responsibility were extraordinarily bad and contributed substantially to the deaths of each of those 96 people who so tragically and unnecessarily lost their lives,"" he added. Fans entered pens three and four through the central tunnel after Gate C was opened Outlining the prosecution's case, Mr Matthews said: Pressure built up outside turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the stadium, where 24,000 Liverpool fans were to be directed An exit gate - known as Gate C - was opened after requests by Mr Duckenfield to do something to alleviate the crush outside Once inside the stadium, fans were met by a sign which led to pens three and four of the terrace - which were beneath the police control box Mr Duckenfield did nothing to monitor the capacity of the pens, which were already packed by the time the gate was opened He further failed to redirect the crowd to other, less crowded pens and control access to the tunnel to ""prevent the inevitable crush of fans effectively carried away down the slope of the tunnel"". ""Much about the Hillsborough disaster was extraordinary, not least the appalling scale of the loss of life, the scale of tragedy and the scale of those who failed to discharge their responsibilities with appropriate care,"" Mr Matthews said. ""Undoubtedly, each of the deceased has been failed by many, in many ways and over a protracted period; before, during and even after this disaster,"" he said. ""Each died as a result of the extraordinarily bad failures by David Duckenfield in the care he took to discharge his personal responsibility on that fateful day."" This video can not be played Jurors were shown a computer-generated video of key areas of the stadium The jury was shown photos, video footage and plans of the stadium, which was the third largest club football ground in England in 1989. One clip was a computer-generated recreation of Hillsborough as it would have looked at the time. Jurors were shown a ""walkthrough"" of the Leppings Lane end of the stadium up to pens three and four where the fatal crush occurred. Mr Matthews explained the turnstile configuration and showed pictures of the possible routes for fans to take once inside. He said in the event of a crush in pens three and four there was no means of escape, other than the way spectators had come in. ""The way in is through the tunnel. In a crush, the pressure is coming from that direction and the only way out is back against the pressure of that crush,"" he said. Jurors were told second defendant Mr Mackrell was the Sheffield Wednesday safety officer responsible for ensuring the club followed Home Office guidance. Mr Matthews said the club breached the conditions of its safety certificate by failing to agree methods of entry into the stadium with police before the semi-final. Mr Mackrell, of Stocking Pelham in Hertfordshire, committed an offence by ""by agreeing to, or at the very least turning a blind eye to,"" the breach, he said. Mackrell, who joined the club in 1986, is also charged with failing to take reasonable care of the health and safety of others, in respect of the arrangements for admission to the ground and the drawing-up of contingency plans. This concerned ensuring turnstiles were sufficient to admit fans at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds would be waiting outside and planning how to cope in the event that entrances proved insufficient to stop such a crowd from gathering, he said. Mr Matthews said: ""It is the prosecution's case that Mr Mackrell effectively shrugged off all responsibility for these important aspects of the role he had taken on as safety officer."" The court was adjourned until Wednesday. The 96 people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Jurors have been told 96 fans were killed as a result of a crush in pens at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. Of those, 94 died on the same day. The youngest of the victims had been 10-year-old Jon-Paul Gilhooley. Lee Nicol, 14, died two days later and Tony Bland, who suffered ""terrible brain damage"" was in a permanent vegetative state until his death in March 1993, jurors heard. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of Mr Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused.

"Experts have developed a potentially ""game-changing"" test to predict a woman's risk of breast cancer. It combines information on family history and hundreds of genetic markers with other factors, such as weight, to give the most comprehensive assessment possible, says Cancer Research UK. The test is not yet routinely available on the NHS - some GPs and specialists are trialling it first. It is part of a push to spot cancers earlier through tailored screening. Women at high risk could be given preventative treatments or offered more checks, say the researchers. Nearly 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. A large proportion of the cases occur in women who have risk factors. I was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer when I was 22 Treatment may extend advanced breast cancer survival 'Remarkable' therapy beats terminal breast cancer Prof Antonis Antoniou, lead researcher at the University of Cambridge, said: ""This is the first time that anyone has combined so many elements into one breast cancer prediction tool. ""It could be a game changer for breast cancer because now we can identify large numbers of women with different levels of risk - not just women who are at high risk. ""This should help doctors to tailor the care they provide depending on their patients' level of risk. ""For example, some women may need additional appointments with their doctor to discuss screening or prevention options and others may just need advice on their lifestyle and diet. ""We hope this means more people can be diagnosed early and survive their disease for longer but more research and trials are needed before we will fully understand how this could be used."" The Breast Cancer Now charity called it a ""promising step"" but cautioned that more research was needed to develop and test the tool before it could begin to change NHS practice. ""In the meantime, we'd encourage anyone who is concerned about their breast cancer risk to speak to their GP,"" spokeswoman Eluned Hughes said. ""While there are some factors that we can't change, there are steps everyone can take to reduce their risk of breast cancer, such as exercising regularly, maintaining a healthy weight and drinking less alcohol."" The test, which also assess ovarian cancer risk, is described in the journalGenetics in Medicine,external.

"Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was sentenced to jail last year but had his case suddenly reviewed The family of a Canadian man who has been sentenced to death in China say their ""worst fears"" have been realised. Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was given a 15-year jail term in November but, on Monday, a court said the sentence for drug smuggling was too lenient. The ruling is likely to worsen a diplomatic row between the countries. Last month, Canada arrested a top official at the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, on a request from the United States. The detention of Ms Meng, 46, last month angered China and soured its relations with both Canada and the US. What's going on with Huawei? Life of Huawei's high-flying heiress How many countries still have the death penalty? Following Schellenberg's death sentence, Canada has updated its travel advice for China, urging citizens to ""exercise a high degree of caution due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws"". Schellenberg's aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones said the death sentence was ""a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation"". ""It is our worst case fear confirmed,"" she added. ""It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking."" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the ruling. ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply the death penalty,"" he said in a statement. China's foreign ministry said it was ""strongly dissatisfied"" with Mr Trudeau's remarks, and said Canada should respect China's sovereignty. Schellenberg has 10 days to launch an appeal and his lawyer told Reuters news agency that he would probably do so. The Canadian, who is believed to be 36, was arrested in 2014 and accused of planning to smuggle almost 500lb (227kg) of methamphetamine from China to Australia. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in November but, following an appeal, a high court in the north-eastern city of Dalian on Monday sentenced him to death. The court in north-eastern China where Schellenberg's case was reviewed ""I am not a drug smuggler. I came to China as a tourist,"" Schellenberg said just before the verdict was announced, the AFP news agency reports. China is believed to execute more people annually than any other country, but is highly secretive about the number. Human rights group Amnesty International puts the figure in the thousands - more than the rest of the world's nations put together. A number of foreigners have been executed for drug-related offences in the past, including British man Akmal Shaikh, who was executed in 2009 despite claims he was mentally ill, and an appeal for clemency from the UK prime minister. Relations between China and Canada have deteriorated rapidly since the arrest of Ms Meng in Vancouver on 1 December. She was granted bail by a Canadian court several days later but remains under constant surveillance and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Ms Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei's founder, is accused in the US of using a subsidiary of the company called Skycom to evade sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. She denies any wrongdoing and says she will contest the allegations. Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of Huawei's founder In the weeks that followed her arrest China detained two other Canadian citizens. Former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor face accusations of harming national security. China has denied the detention of the two men is tied to Ms Meng's arrest, but many analysts believe it is a tit-for-tat action. Who is detained Canadian Michael Spavor? Huawei arrest puts 'bullseye' on Apple Donald Clarke, a specialist in Chinese law at George Washington University, said that Schellenberg's death sentence appeared to be ""an unprecedented step in China's diplomacy"". ""I have seen cases I considered unjust before, but I cannot recall a previous case that looked so clearly unconnected to the defendant's guilt or innocence,"" Prof Clarke told the BBC's Chinese service. China began working hard to push Schellenberg's case to international prominence, taking the highly unusual step of inviting foreign journalists into the court, the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing reports. And despite the Canadian's insistence that he is innocent, his retrial lasted just a day, with his death sentence being announced barely an hour after its conclusion, our correspondent says. An editorial in the nationalist state-backed Chinese newspaper Global Times,externalon Tuesday said ""unreasonable speculation"" in Western media linking his case to Ms Meng's showed ""rude contempt toward Chinese law"". ""The trial will also send the message that China won't yield to outside pressure in implementing its law,"" it said. However, back in December, the editor of the Global Times warned that China would ""definitely take retaliatory measures against Canada"" if Ms Meng were not released. Hu Xijin said in a video posted on the Global Times website: ""If Canada extradites Meng to the US, China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian.""

"China has rejected accusations from Canada that it is arbitrarily applying a death sentence to a Canadian convicted of drug smuggling. The foreign ministry told Canadian PM Justin Trudeau to ""stop making such irresponsible remarks"", accusing Canada of ""double standards"". Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was initially given a 15-year jail term in November. But on Monday a court increased this to the death penalty, saying the original sentence was too lenient. The ruling is likely to worsen a diplomatic row between the countries, which has been escalating since Canada arrested an official of China's Huawei telecoms giant last month. China has expressed anger at the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, on suspicion of using a subsidiary company to evade US sanctions on Iran between 2009 and 2014. She was detained at the request of the United States. Ms Meng, 46, denies the charges. She was granted bail shortly after her arrest, but remains under constant surveillance and must wear an electronic ankle tag. Huawei founder denies spy risk claims What's going on with Huawei? Life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Denying that Beijing had politicised Schellenberg's case in response to Ms Meng's arrest, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying urged Canada to ""respect China's judicial sovereignty"". ""The comments from the Canadian government are full of double standards,"" Ms Hua said, adding: ""The Canadians are the ones who have arbitrarily arrested somebody,"" in an apparent reference to Ms Meng. Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters on Tuesday that Canada had formally appealed for clemency for Schellenberg.  She also struck a softer tone when she spoke of the ""very important and long-standing ties"" between both countries. ""It is true that this is a difficult moment,"" she told a news conference in Quebec. ""The best thing for both Canada and China... is to get past these current difficulties."" The Canadian, who is believed to be 36, was arrested in 2014 and accused of planning to smuggle almost 500lb (227kg) of methamphetamine from China to Australia. Schellenberg, who has previous drugs-related convictions in Canada,external, has denied the charges against him, saying he entered China as a tourist and was framed. Schellenberg case: What we know so far Who is detained Canadian Michael Spavor? Mr Trudeau has condemned the latest ruling, saying: ""It is of extreme concern to us... that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply the death penalty."" Drug dealing is punishable by death in China, and at leasta dozen foreigners have been executed,externalfor drug-related offenses. Many more are on death row. Schellenberg was tried at the Dalian Intermediate People's Court However, the execution of Westerners is less common. One of the most high-profile cases involvedBritish man Akmal Shaikh, who was executed in 2009,externaldespite claims he was mentally ill and an appeal for clemency from the UK prime minister. His family said that Shaikh had never received a mental health assessment and that judges at an appeal hearing laughed openly at Shaikh as he pleaded for his life. China has argued that Schellenberg's death sentence was not political. However, some analysts have argued that both the timing, and the publicity given to Schellenberg's retrial has been unusual. How many countries still have the death penalty? US travel warning amid China arrests It took a Chinese court two and a half years to hand down Schellenberg's initial sentence of 15 years - but the retrial lasted just a day. China also worked hard to push Schellenberg's case to international prominence, taking the highly unusual step of inviting foreign journalists into the court, the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing reports. Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of Huawei's founder Donald Clarke, a specialist in Chinese law at George Washington University, said that Schellenberg's death sentence appeared to be ""an unprecedented step in China's diplomacy"". ""I have seen cases I considered unjust before, but I cannot recall a previous case that looked so clearly unconnected to the defendant's guilt or innocence,"" Prof Clarke told the BBC's Chinese service. Schellenberg's lawyer, Zhang Dongshuo, told Reuters that his client's sentence should not have been increased, because no new evidence had been presented at the retrial. He intends to appeal. Chinese state media have reacted angrily,externalto claims the death sentence is linked to Ms Meng's case. Nationalist newspaper Global Times called it ""unreasonable speculation"" in Western media, arguing it showed ""rude contempt toward Chinese law"". However, back in December, the editor of the Global Times had warned that China would ""definitely take retaliatory measures against Canada"" if Ms Meng were not released, adding: ""If Canada extradites Meng to the US, China's revenge will be far worse than detaining a Canadian."" China was previously accused of tit-for-tat action, after it detained two other Canadian citizens in the weeks following Ms Meng's arrest. Former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor face accusations of harming national security. Canadian's death sentence 'horrific' Who is China prisoner Robert Lloyd Schellenberg?

"Forget what might happen when the tellers read out the numbers on Tuesday night, let's think about what's at stake. With Brexit, it's nearly always subjective, but according to MPs and ministers of different flavours, these are some of the factors that matter and that the result might influence. Disagree at will of course - you may read these and scoff, or you may even have your own. But the meaningful vote may well end up having multiple meanings... Don't let British people down, May tells MPs Possible amendments to PM's Brexit deal Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit 1)Let's start with the least likely outcome. A miracle could take place overnight and scores of MPs might suddenly find themselves swinging behind the prime minister's plan. The vote goes through, she shouts hurray, and the process moves on smoothly. We leave the EU as planned in less than three months, and Theresa May's place in history is secure (no laughing at the back). 2)The defeat is disastrous and a combination of pressure from some ministers and MPs forces the PM to reach across the aisle. Depending on the scale of the defeat, and the reaction of Labour front and backbenchers, Westminster might be ushered into a different phase of bargaining across the benches. One Labour MP told me today: ""At some stage I will vote for the deal, but I will need something specific to show for it. We are about to enter an era of transactional politics."" Cross-party working may not be some kind of high-minded pursuit. 3)The scale of the likely loss might prompt the kind of parliamentary takeover that's been much discussed in the last couple of days. Arguably this might be one of the most long-lasting impacts. Rewriting the parliamentary rulebook may inevitably be largely of interest to nerds like me, but the kind of suggestions these extraordinary times are prompting might reshape the relationship between the government and MPs for years to come - and that matters. 4)Given that the balance in Parliament is definitely for a softer Brexit with closer ties to the EU, (arguably) the defeat on Tuesday might lead to a less dramatic break with the EU than the deal on the table promises. One member of the cabinet tonight told me: ""The longer this goes on, the softer Brexit gets."" Before you scream, I know that is not a view that is shared universally. But it is sincerely held by plenty of people around the place who point rather frustratedly to the irony. As another member of cabinet said: ""The hardline Brexiteers will push us toward a softer Brexit by digging in their resistance."" 5)Technically speaking, if you don't assume (and assumptions are dangerous) that Parliament can and would block no deal, the rejection of the plan would move us closer to leaving without a deal. That's not just because Eurosceptics are showing very little sign of budging, but remember the process is on a clock. Article 50 has to come to a conclusion by the end of March and, as the law currently stands, we are leaving with or without an agreement. Some other ministers in the cabinet believe very firmly once the vote is lost the PM has not much choice other than to up no-deal prep again in the hope, not of going that way, but of trying for another EU concession. One told me it is the ""only logical conclusion"" to keep going steadily and hope the EU will break - a continuation of the high-stakes poker game. 6)Jeremy Corbyn will either delight or disappoint his ranks by having the bottle to force a confidence vote, or delaying again, waiting for a magic moment. But he seems unlikely to take the bold step many of his members want and to move to offering another referendum. 7)For those campaigning for another European referendum, too, the scale of the defeat, and Tuesday night's front bench responses to it, are vital. The outcome of the vote will affect whether we leave the EU on time, and less likely, whether we could be given another say on whether we leave at all. And when those truths eventually reveal themselves, they in turn could have an impact on the fabric of the UK itself. What happens in Northern Ireland, or to the case for Scottish independence, are part of what is at stake in the long term. 8)Lastly, after more than two years of endless discussions, as and when the vote goes down on this hard-fought compromise, Westminster's factions and rival camps might finally have to do more than talk amongst themselves, and actually bend or break. The divisions are so intense in both the main political parties that it could also be the moment some of the divisions turn into real splits. That really would be history happening in front of our eyes.

"Laurent Gbagbo had been charged with crimes against humanity The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has acquitted Ivory Coast ex-President Laurent Gbagbo. He had been charged with crimes against humanity in connection with violence following a disputed 2010 election that left 3,000 dead and 500,000 displaced. Mr Gbagbo was captured in 2011 in a presidential palace bunker by UN and French-backed forces supporting his rival, Alassane Ouattara. He was the first former head of state to go on trial at the ICC. The violence in Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer, came after Mr Gbagbo refused to accept that he had lost a disputed election run-off to Mr Ouattara in 2010. The five months of violence that followed were described as some of the most brutal clashes the country had ever seen. What does this mean for the ICC? Laurent Gbagbo: Ivory Coast's defiant 'Cicero' Africa live: Loud cheers greet Gbagbo acquittal During the political stand-off there were bloody clashes and targeted killings in Abidjan in the south, and several hundred were massacred in the western town of Duekoue. Prosecutors said Mr Gbagbo clung to power ""by all means"" and charged him with four counts of crimes against humanity, murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and ""other inhuman acts"". He denied the charges, which he said were politically motivated. Victims of the 2010 post-election violence are opposed to Mr Gbagbo's release ICC judges ruled on Tuesday that he had no case to answer and ordered his immediate release. Prosecutors had failed to demonstrate ""the existence of a 'common plan' to keep Mr Gbagbo in power"" which included crimes against civilians, or a ""policy to attack a civilian population"", the ICC said. Presiding Judge Cuno Tarfusser said the prosecution had also ""failed to demonstrate that public speeches by Gbagbo constituted ordering or inducing the alleged crimes"". Prosecutors can appeal after the court files its decision in writing. Mr Gbagbo's supporters whooped, cheered and threw their firsts in the air in the public gallery following the announcement, the BBC's Anna Holligan reports from the court. Mr Gbagbo's supporters are jubilant One of his supporters, Gragbayou Yves, who had travelled to the court from Paris, told AFP news agency: ""I am very, very happy. Finally there is some justice."" However, victims of the violence are opposed to his release. ""If Laurent Gbagbo is released, we victims will not see justice,"" Karim Coulibaly, who was shot in the violence and had to have his arm amputated, told AFP earlier. ""I was a driver but now I am unemployed. I'm not against reconciliation but first you have to look after the victims."" Paolina Massidda, a lawyer representing the victims said she ""deeply regrets"" the decision. ""The victims participated in this trial in the hope that an impartial tribunal could one day give them justice. That hope is today in vain,"" she added. ""Whenever a case involving mass atrocities essentially collapses at the ICC, it does damage to the perception of the court as a credible and effective institution of international justice,""Mark Kersten, author of Justice in Conflict, told the BBC's Anna Holligan. ""Many are concerned that the court is emerging as an institution where only rebels can be successfully prosecuted,"" he added. The prosecution at the ICC has also failed in its attempts to build successful cases against former DR Congo Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba, and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta. On the other hand, the ruling demonstrates the judges' independence and impartiality and makes it harder to push the narrative, popular among those who fear the long arm of the ICC, that the court is a biased weapon of neo-colonial justice used purely to convict African leaders, our correspondent says. Janet Anderson, a writer for the Justice Tribune, told the BBC: ""It's important also to find people not guilty or to find there isn't a case to answer if there isn't one.""

"Germany's economy grew by 1.5% last year, its slowest rate since 2013, the latest official figures show. Figures from the Federal Statistics Office,externalshowed Europe's largest economy slowed sharply as the year wore on. A weaker global economy and problems in the car industry, caused by new pollution standards, have been cited as contributing to the slowdown. At the start of 2018, the German economy had been expected to grow by 1.8%. Growth was 2.2% in 2017. Germany's economy had shrunk in the third quarter of the year, by 0.2%, with global trade disputes blamed for the contraction. There were fears that Germany was at risk of following that with another quarter of negative growth, something that would have put the country into recession. The statistics office has not released fourth-quarter figures yet, as it does not have enough data to give an accurate reading. But initial calculations by independent economists suggest the economy may have grown by about 0.2% in the final three months of the year. Reasons for slower growth last year include a slowdown in the global economy and a weaker car sector, with German consumers less willing to buy new cars amid confusion over new emission standards. In addition, low water levels, particularly in the Rhine, affected growth by holding back movement of some goods. Analysis:Andrew Walker, World Service economics correspondent So Germany probably avoided a recession last year, although further data publications might yet change that conclusion. What is clear though is that the economy hit a weak patch in the second half of last year. It's not alone. The eurozone as whole slowed markedly in the third quarter of the year. Two large economies, Germany and Italy, contracted in that period, though Spain and France both managed reasonably firm growth. Germany, as a leading exporter, is especially exposed to the global trade climate. A slowdown in international commerce is a major part of Germany's loss of momentum and China is an important element in that story. It's Germany's third largest export market. A recent survey of German manufacturers found the steepest fall in export orders for six years and a number of firms reporting lower sales to China. Germany's export orientation also makes it vulnerable to the tensions in global trade spilling out from the United States - the new tariffs on steel and aluminium and the conflict with China. For Germany, and the eurozone more widely, there are certainly clouds on the horizon. Germany may have dodged a recession, but a period of slower expansion looks likely. It's worth adding that whatever other problems Germany might encounter, unemployment is currently very low. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the best guess was that the German economy had avoided recession, but the main story was still that the economy had lost pace, ""thanks mainly to a slowdown in consumers' spending and exports"". ""Looking ahead, we think consumption will pick up. Real wage growth is firm, and the recent plunge in growth of goods spending won't be sustained."" What are Germany's no-deal Brexit plans?

"Ren Zhengfei founded Huawei in 1987, since when it has become one of China's biggest companies Huawei's founder has denied Chinese authorities have ever asked his company to help spy on its clients. Ren Zhengfei was speaking to foreign media in a rare interview, following claims Huawei posed a security risk. He also said he was missing his daughter Meng Wanzhou ""very much"". Ms Meng - who is the technology company's chief financial officer - has been ordered to stay in Canada, where she is under arrest after being accused of breaking sanctions on Iran. She now faces extradition to the US, which requested the move. The telecom equipment-maker's actions are also under scrutiny elsewhere. Last week, one of its sales executives was arrested in Poland, where the authorities have accused him of spying. Huawei has since sacked the employee and denied any illegal behaviour was being carried out on its behalf. In addition, concerns have been raised in the UK and elsewhere about the use of the company's equipment in 5G networks and other communications infrastructure, with claims that it could provide Beijing a way to spy on or disrupt data. Poland spy arrest: Huawei sacks employee 'Deep concerns' over Huawei's role in UK 5G upgrade China accuses UK of 'pride and prejudice' The media event was only the third time Mr Ren has hosted such a briefing with foreign reporters. The last such event was more than three years ago. Six writers were invited, including reporters fromthe Financial Times,external,Bloomberg,externalandthe Wall Street Journal,external. One of the concerns frequently cited about Huawei is that Mr Ren joined China's Communist Party in 1978 and was also a member of the People's Liberation Army. But the 74-year-old told the journalists: ""I love my country. I support the Communist Party. But I will not do anything to harm the world."" He added that Beijing had never asked him or his company to share ""improper information"" about its partners. ""I personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests,"" he said. ""No law in China requires any company to install mandatory backdoors,"" he added, addressing suggestions that Huawei might make it possible for Chinese spies to extract data directly themselves. Mr Ren's eldest daughter, Ms Meng, has denied allegations that she broke US sanctions on Iran and of conspiring to defraud banks by pretending that one of Huawei subsidiaries was not linked to the company. Meng Wanzhou was granted bail by a Vancouver judge last month China has claimed that the case is an abuse of legal procedures. It now threatens to add to tensions between the US and China at a time the two are involved in a trade dispute. In December, President Trumpsuggested he might interveneif it suited the US's national security interests or might help secure a trade deal. At the Shenzhen event, Mr Ren described Mr Trump as being a ""great president"". ""He dares to massively cut tax, which will benefit... business,"" he added. Mr Trump is also reportedly considering an executive order that would formally ban US companies from using equipment made by Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese company,external. But Mr Ren held out the prospect of this being avoided. ""The message to the US I want to communicate is, 'Collaboration and shared success',"" he said. But he appeared to acknowledge that in some cases Huawei would be unable to sell its products overseas. Australia has already banned it from selling 5G technology to local network providers. New Zealand has also blocked a deal involving one of its companies. ""You can't work with everyone,"" said Mr Ren. ""We'll shift our focus to better serve countries that welcome Huawei.""

"The wealthiest students are going to university in England for the lowest cost, by paying their tuition fees up front, say researchers. About 10% of students are not taking out loans and so avoid interest rates of 6.3% paid by other students, says the Intergenerational Foundation. The think tank says it ""makes a mockery"" of claims that the fees system is fair for poorer students. The government says that its review of fees will ensure value for money. ""Wealthier families have realised that they can give their children a get-out-of-jail-free-card by helping them to escape sky-high interest rates and a 30-year loan that could be sold off to the private sector in the future,"" said report author, Rakib Ehsan. About 10% of undergraduates from the UK are self-funding, says the analysis of official data for 2016-17 - with higher than average rates at some Russell Group universities. Among full-time students, there are 20% self-funding their fees at King's College London and 16% at Oxford and Cambridge. University College London, Imperial and LSE are all above average, at around 14%. This excludes overseas students, or people who might have fees paid for them by job-related support or through scholarships and bursaries. The researchers say that universities with higher proportions of self-funding students are often those with a higher proportion of students from private school - suggesting that their families might be continuing to pay for university. For those who can afford it, there are significant savings. Biggest winners and losers from degrees Student loan ruling adds Â£12bn to deficit 'I want to be the first in my family to go to university' Tuition fees to be cut to Â£6,500 Interest charges begin to build up as soon as a student begins at university - and about Â£6,000 can be owed before a student even graduates. Those paying up front will leave not owing this money - and they will not be part of the repayment scheme paying back loans over 30 years. This will give self-funders a ""serious economic advantage"" when they leave university, say researchers. ""This analysis makes a mockery of claims that the current system is progressive, since the wealthiest kids are not even in the system,"" said Angus Hanton of the think tank. ""The government should treat all students fairly and that means reducing the interest rates charged while at university, reducing fees, reintroducing maintenance grants, and lowering the repayment rate,"" he said. Shakira Martin, president of the National Union of Students, says it means that wealthy students can avoid debt and high interest rates, while too many poorer students are struggling ""to make ends meet"". ""The government's claims that the higher education sector is a level playing field are nonsense, and the scrapping of maintenance grants means that in fact they've squarely placed the extra burden on the poorest in our society,"" she said. Gordon Marsden, Labour's shadow minister for higher education, said the report showed that the combination of ""eye-watering tuition fees and huge interest payments is unfair and unsustainable"". ""The fact that the wealthiest students can avoid the thousands of pounds of interest paid by their less fortunate peers exposes a fundamental injustice at the heart of the system."" The government has commissioned a review of student finance in England, with suggestions that it could lower the headline figure for tuition fees. A Department for Education spokeswoman said the review would be ""considering how best to provide value for money, both for students and taxpayers"". She said the loan system was progressive in how repayments were ""based on income after graduation, not on the amount borrowed"" and that it enabled all students to have funds for studying. ""The student finance system removes financial barriers for those hoping to study but who are unable to self-fund,"" said the DfE spokeswoman.

"Germany's economy grew by 1.5% last year, its slowest rate since 2013, the latest official figures show. Figures from the Federal Statistics Office,externalshowed Europe's largest economy slowed sharply as the year wore on. A weaker global economy and problems in the car industry, caused by new pollution standards, have been cited as contributing to the slowdown. At the start of 2018, the German economy had been expected to grow by 1.8%. Growth was 2.2% in 2017. Germany's economy had shrunk in the third quarter of the year, by 0.2%, with global trade disputes blamed for the contraction. There were fears that Germany was at risk of following that with another quarter of negative growth, something that would have put the country into recession. The statistics office has not released fourth-quarter figures yet, as it does not have enough data to give an accurate reading. But initial calculations by independent economists suggest the economy may have grown by about 0.2% in the final three months of the year. Reasons for slower growth last year include a slowdown in the global economy and a weaker car sector, with German consumers less willing to buy new cars amid confusion over new emission standards. In addition, low water levels, particularly in the Rhine, affected growth by holding back movement of some goods. Analysis:Andrew Walker, World Service economics correspondent So Germany probably avoided a recession last year, although further data publications might yet change that conclusion. What is clear though is that the economy hit a weak patch in the second half of last year. It's not alone. The eurozone as whole slowed markedly in the third quarter of the year. Two large economies, Germany and Italy, contracted in that period, though Spain and France both managed reasonably firm growth. Germany, as a leading exporter, is especially exposed to the global trade climate. A slowdown in international commerce is a major part of Germany's loss of momentum and China is an important element in that story. It's Germany's third largest export market. A recent survey of German manufacturers found the steepest fall in export orders for six years and a number of firms reporting lower sales to China. Germany's export orientation also makes it vulnerable to the tensions in global trade spilling out from the United States - the new tariffs on steel and aluminium and the conflict with China. For Germany, and the eurozone more widely, there are certainly clouds on the horizon. Germany may have dodged a recession, but a period of slower expansion looks likely. It's worth adding that whatever other problems Germany might encounter, unemployment is currently very low. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the best guess was that the German economy had avoided recession, but the main story was still that the economy had lost pace, ""thanks mainly to a slowdown in consumers' spending and exports"". ""Looking ahead, we think consumption will pick up. Real wage growth is firm, and the recent plunge in growth of goods spending won't be sustained."" What are Germany's no-deal Brexit plans?

"Sales at Boohoo grew strongly in the last four months of 2018, in another sign that people are choosing online shopping over the High Street. The online fashion retailer, which also owns the PrettyLittleThing and Nastygal fashion labels, saw revenues in the four-month period jump 44% to Â£328.2m. It revised its revenue growth forecast for the financial year to 43%-45%, up from a previous estimate of 38%-43% Boohoo sells clothes, accessories and shoes for the 16 to 30-year-old market. The company, which was founded in 2006, distributes its stock from a huge warehouse in Burnley,and it claims to have more than five million customers.,external Boohoo called the figures,external""another great set of results"". Revenue from PrettyLittleThing nearly doubled, rising by 95% to Â£144.2m, while there was 74% growth in NastyGal's revenue to Â£20.6m. UK economy's fate is held in the hands of the shopper Boohoo warned over advertising real fur as fake Julie Palmer, partner at business consultancy Begbies Traynor, said Boohoo's results would ""go some way to restoring calm"" after the surprisepre-Christmas profit warning from rival online fashion retailer Asos. She said: ""Customers are basing their decisions on price, and Boohoo is very competitively placed to capitalise on this. ""Tie in the fact that overall footfall is down on the High Street and online sales continue to grow, Boohoo is entering 2019 in a very strong position."" However, she warned: ""According to our latest Red Flag Alert, the number of online retailers in financial distress increased to 8,500 in 2018. Being cut from a similar cloth to Asos, Boohoo must remain innovative and resilient if it is to stay in fashion."" Emily Salter, retail analyst at data and analytics company GlobalData, said: ""The Boohoo group appears to have been immune to the tough retail conditions faced by UK retailers over the past few months."" She added that 2019 should be another successful year, but warned UK growth could slow because of ""the relative maturity of the brands"". ""The group therefore needs to invest in the proposition, operations and infrastructure in key global markets to allow for further growth, especially the USA, where the group experienced a 77.7% increase in revenue during the period."" Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, agreed that the company's investment in the US was important, but warned: ""An American adventure isn't coming cheap."" She added: ""Looking further ahead, it's important Stateside spending is kept firmly under control if investors are to believe the group hasn't bitten off more than it can chew."" It might come as a surprise to many, but lots of the UK's big fast fashion retailers are making dresses, tops, jumpers and skirts in the UK again - and it's paying dividends for their financial results. After years of outsourcing to factories in Asia, making clothes here means fast fashion can be reactive and responsive - servicing the huge demand of the Instagram generation which wants what it sees online immediately. By manufacturing here, distribution and shipping times are hugely reduced meaning products hit online portals when they're at peak demand, meaning the retailer can charge a higher price to cover the higher cost of UK manufacture. It can often mean the profit margin is slightly tighter, but with higher demand it means more sales and ultimately less waste and discounting. Manufacturing here also means retailers like Boohoo can quickly replenish stock if a product is a hit with fast access to market. Now other big UK retailers are recognising the effectiveness of this model, but they face a challenge in making the switch. Lots of the factories in cities like Leicester are at full capacity, and after decades of manufacturing moving offshore, many of the others have closed down and workers' skills have been lost.

"This video can not be played Rahaf Mohammed told Canadian media she'll work in support of women's freedom around the world A Saudi teenager given asylum in Canada after fleeing her family has said the journey was ""worth the risk"" so she could live a more independent life. Rahaf Mohammed, 18, made headlines when she flew to Thailand and barricaded herself in a hotel while appealing on Twitter for help to avoid deportation. She said she feared being killed if she was sent back to her family. ""It's something that is worth the risk I took,""she told the Toronto Star,externaland CBC News. ""I had nothing to lose."" ""We are treated as an object, like a slave,"" she said. ""I wanted to tell people my story and about what happens to Saudi women."" This video can not be played Rahaf Mohammed: 'I can't believe what has happened to me' Under Saudi Arabia's guardianship system, women must obtain permission from a male relative to travel outside the country, study abroad on a government scholarship, get married or even leave prison. 'I needed consent to leave the house' Arrested for disobeying your father #SaveRahaf: How Twitter saved a Saudi woman Ms Mohammed - who has dropped her surname, al-Qunun - alleged that her family had subjected her to physical and psychological abuse. ""In the beginning they locked me up for six months after I cut my hair... because it is forbidden in Islam for a woman to dress like a man,"" she told reporters at the office of an immigrant settlement agency in Toronto. ""But I was mostly exposed to violence by my mother and my brother,"" she added. ""They were beating me and there was corporal violence."" This video can not be played The #SaveRahaf campaign went viral after Rahaf started tweeting about her plight for asylum While she was in Thailand, Ms Mohammed also told the BBC that she had renounced Islam - a crime that is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. She had been on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight to Bangkok on 5 January, saying she intended to take a connecting flight to Australia and had an Australian visa. But she says her passport was seized by a Saudi diplomat when he met her coming off the flight, leaving her stranded. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Mohammed then sent a series of tweets pleading for help from her hotel room. ""During this time, I was thinking about what kind of goodbye messages I would write, because I was not going to allow them to take me. I was prepared to end my life before they kidnapped me,""she told CBC,external. Her case was picked up by Human Rights Watch and numerous journalists. Thailand eventually allowed her to stay and the UN assessed her claim for asylum. On Tuesday, Ms Mohammed gave a statement to media in Toronto and called herself ""one of the lucky ones"". She said that she wants ""to be independent, travel, make my own decisions on education, a career, or who, and when I should marry"". ""I had no say in all this,"" she said in Arabic. ""Today I proudly say I am capable of making all those decisions."" Ms Mohammed was met at Toronto's airport by Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland Last Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that his country would accept Ms Mohammed as a refugee. The following day she was met at Toronto's international airport by Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland. Ms Freeland and her ministry enraged the Saudi government in Augustwhen they called for the release of several women's rights activists campaigning for the male guardianship system to be abolished who were detained as part of an apparent crackdown on dissent. Riyadh responded by freezing all new trade with Canada and expelling its ambassador over its ""interference"" in the kingdom's domestic affairs. The Saudi government has not commented since Ms Qanun's arrival, but the head of the state-funded National Society for Human Rights said on Monday that he had been ""surprised by some countries' incitement of some Saudi female delinquents to rebel against the values of their families"".

""I feel very safe in Canada, a country that respects human rights,"" Ms Mohammed said. She added: ""I feel born again from feeling the love coming from everyone waiting for my arrival."" Ms Mohammed said that, although the Canadian weather may take some getting used to, she was excited for the new experiences ahead. ""I will try things I haven't tried,"" she said. ""I will learn things I didn't learn. I will explore life.... I will have a job and live a normal life."" Like a typical 18-year-old, one of the first things Ms Mohammed did upon her arrival, after getting clothing appropriate for the Canadian winter, was purchasing a smart phone, an official at the immigrant settlement agency said. The Canadian government offers refugees financial support for up to a year,external, as well as help with finding housing and registering for federal and provincial programmes, and English lessons. Mario Calla, executive director with Costi Immigrant Services, which is assisting Ms Mohammed in Canada, said they have temporarily hired a private security guard for the Saudi teen because of the threats she has received on social media. He said that because of the possible risks they are considering settling her - at least for the foreseeable future - with a family to ensure she is not living alone. Her fast-tracked refugee claim has not been received entirely without criticism and Mr Trudeau was asked this week what message it sent to the many other refugee claimants hoping for Canadian asylum. The prime minister said her asylum was granted on a ""specific and precise request"" by the UNHCR, adding ""we know that this is quite an exceptional case but Canada will always be there for people who are in difficulty"". Mr Calla said her case is not without precedent, and that his organisation alone receives about two ""urgent protection"" cases a year.

"The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 599 pages long. It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union. Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls outthe key points from the agreement,externaland what they mean. The transition period (which the UK government calls ""implementation period"")  is due to last for 21 months. The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions. The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that. At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer. There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice. The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter. The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU. Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or ""divorce bill"") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations. While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least Â£39bn and it will be paid over a number of years. Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period. In 2018/19 the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net Â£10.8bn. If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately. Chris Morris's analysis:It seems a long time now since the size of the ""divorce bill"" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible. Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU. Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court. All you need to know about Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Your guide to Brexit jargon What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition. Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. Chris Morris's analysis:The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority. But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty. British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders after the transition period, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live. Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now are also unresolved issues. If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of ""a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom"" will be triggered. Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market. As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to ""level playing field conditions"", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory. The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU. Chris Morris's analysis:The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border. But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods. That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent. The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters. The document says: ""The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."" Chris Morris's analysis:Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy. Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters. It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be. The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition. A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly. Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel. However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision. Chris Morris's analysis:Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow. The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over. That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come. Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus. There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled. EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like ""Welsh Lamb"" or ""Parma Ham"" remain. Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like. It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.

"The new Trump administration rules have drawn protests A US federal judge has blocked new Trump administration regulations on birth control from applying across the entire country. The rules allow employers and insurers to decline to provide birth control if doing so violates their ""religious beliefs"" or ""moral convictions"". The rules were to come into effect nationwide from Monday. But the judge in Philadelphia granted an injunction requested by attorneys general in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that the new rules would make it more difficult for many women to obtain free contraception and would be an undue burden on US states. Her decision follows a similar verdict by a judge in California on Sunday. However, that verdict only covered 13 states and Washington DC. Trump rolls back free birth control The US state where women 'could be fired' for using contraception Fifty-five million women benefited from the original Obama-era rule, which made companies provide free birth control. Before taking office, President Donald Trump pledged to eliminate the requirement. President Trump vowed to change the Obama-era rule when running for office California attorney general Xavier Becerra said in a statement,external: ""It's 2019, yet the Trump administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. ""The law couldn't be clearer - employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions."" But the US Department of Justice said in court documents that the new rules defended ""a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors"" and stopped them from conducting practices ""that conflict with their beliefs"". âWe took birth control for shorter jail term' The strange truth about the pill Mr Trump's rule change could force state governments to provide additional birth control coverage, Mr Becerra said, and pay health costs arising from unplanned pregnancies.

"A Gillette advert which references bullying, the #MeToo movement and toxic masculinity has split opinion online. The razor company's short film, called Believe, plays on their famous slogan ""The best a man can get"", replacing it with ""The best men can be"". The company says it wants men to hold each other ""accountable"". Some have praised the message of the advert, which aims to update the company's 30-year-old tagline, but others say Gillette is ""dead"" to them. The ad has been watched more than 2 million times on YouTube in 48 hours. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

People such as Piers Morgan have said they will boycott Gillette because of the message of the new advert In it, the company asks ""Is this the best a man can get?"" before showing images of bullying, sexual harassment, sexist behaviour and aggressive male behaviour. It then shows examples of more positive behaviour - such as stepping into prevent these behaviours when they happen in public. In the advert, one man stops his friend from harassing a woman in the street Comments on the video are largely negative, with viewers saying they will never buy Gillette products again or that the advert was ""feminist propaganda"". ""In less than two minutes you managed to alienate your biggest sales group for your products. Well doneï»¿,"" wrote one angry viewer. Twitter users are also sharing their disappointment with Gillette's new campaign. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There have also been calls for Gillette, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, topost an apology video.,external But the brand believes the new advert aligns with its slogan and says it believes in ""the best in men."" ""By holding each other accountable, eliminating excuses for bad behaviour, and supporting a new generation working toward their personal 'best,' we can help create positive change that will matter for years to come,"" says its president, Gary Coombe. The advert was directed by Kim Gehrig from the UK-based production company Somesuch, who also directed the 2015 campaign for Sport England, This Girl Can. The advert encourages men to act with more respect and to set a positive example to young boys Gillette has partnered with the Building A Better Man project, which seeks to reduce violent behaviour in men, and The Boys and Girls Club of America, which helps young men develop better social and communication skills. It's also donating $1m (around Â£778,000) a year for the next three years to US charities aimed at supporting men. But while the response to the ad has been largely negative, as the old saying goes, there's no such thing as bad publicity. ""Their next steps are very important but it shouldn't necessarily be widespread panic yet,"" Rob Saunders, an account manager at UK advertising company the Media Agency Group, tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Their ad is getting them good publicity and good numbers and causing a debate - which they must have known when they put out this ad. Rob says Gillette will have anticipated a negative reaction to the advert from some people. ""This ad would have been approved by many people high up at Gillette,"" he adds. ""So they must have known that there may have been a backlash."" Rob believes the strong reaction is because the ad is such a shift from how Gillette was previously promoted and that has surprised people. ""It's such a change in stance for Gillette and it's happening overnight, particularly with the social commentary and that's why it's done such huge numbers."" But alongside the negative reaction to the brand's new message, there has also been widespread praise for its attempt to join the debate on what it means to be a modern man. Allow Twitter content?

"The new Trump administration rules have drawn protests A US federal judge has blocked new Trump administration regulations on birth control from applying across the entire country. The rules allow employers and insurers to decline to provide birth control if doing so violates their ""religious beliefs"" or ""moral convictions"". The rules were to come into effect nationwide from Monday. But the judge in Philadelphia granted an injunction requested by attorneys general in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that the new rules would make it more difficult for many women to obtain free contraception and would be an undue burden on US states. Her decision follows a similar verdict by a judge in California on Sunday. However, that verdict only covered 13 states and Washington DC. Trump rolls back free birth control The US state where women 'could be fired' for using contraception Fifty-five million women benefited from the original Obama-era rule, which made companies provide free birth control. Before taking office, President Donald Trump pledged to eliminate the requirement. President Trump vowed to change the Obama-era rule when running for office California attorney general Xavier Becerra said in a statement,external: ""It's 2019, yet the Trump administration is still trying to roll back women's rights. ""The law couldn't be clearer - employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions."" But the US Department of Justice said in court documents that the new rules defended ""a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors"" and stopped them from conducting practices ""that conflict with their beliefs"". âWe took birth control for shorter jail term' The strange truth about the pill Mr Trump's rule change could force state governments to provide additional birth control coverage, Mr Becerra said, and pay health costs arising from unplanned pregnancies.

"Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has previously claimed the reports were ""made up"" Activists in Russia say there has been a new crackdown against LGBT people in Chechnya. The Russian LGBT Network believes about 40 people have been imprisoned since December - two of whom they say have died under torture. The group has been monitoring alleged abuses in the mainly Muslim Russian republic since 2017 when dozens of gay people were reportedly detained. A government spokesman has dismissed their latest report as ""complete lies"". Chechnya, and its authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov, has consistently denied allegations of illegal detentions and human rights abuses. In an interview with the BBC last year, Mr Kadyrov said the allegations were ""an invention by foreign agents"" or created by activists looking for money. Homophobia is widespread in the highly conservative and predominantly Muslim Russian republic. Mr Kadyrov and other government figures have repeatedly claimed Chechnya has no gay population at all. Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally Chechnya uses 'televised shamings' Canada grants asylum to LGBT Chechens Despite official denials, dozens have come forward and alleged they were detained and tortured by authorities because of their sexual orientation. The reports have drawn condemnation from around the world. The Russian LGBT Network, an activist group, has been monitoring the situation in Chechnya and working to evacuate people from the region since reports of the crackdown emerged in 2017. In a statement released on Monday,the group alleged a fresh wave of persecution and abuses had been unleashed in recent weeks,external. This video can not be played Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov is questioned by the BBC's Sarah Rainsford on the region's human rights record They believe the latest wave was sparked by the arrest of an administrator of an online LGBT group on the social media network VKontakte. Recent posts on the network have allegedly told LGBT people to ""run away from the republic as soon as possible"", according to reports in Russian media. Gay Chechens flee threats, beatings and exorcism Activists believe dozens have been taken in recent weeks to a detention centre near Argun - a town 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. ""We know of around 40 people who have been detained, but it may be more. It's also unclear at this point how many have since been freed. We know that does happen, when people are handed over to their families to 'deal with',"" Igor Kochetkov, the head of the group, told the BBC. He said it had helped more than 140 people escape the region since the persecution began. The group had evidence, including from witnesses, that two detainees had died under torture, including one from knife wounds, he said. Mr Kochetkov also said that police were now seizing detainees' travel documents. ""Everything is being done so that they can't flee the country,"" he told the Moscow Times,external. ""And this is very bad for us because it makes our work much more difficult in terms of evacuation."" The reports have not been independently verified by the BBC. The allegations have led to protests around the world, like this at Russia's London embassy in 2017 Last month a report by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) concluded that ""very serious human rights violations"" had occurred in the republic. The report was compiled using evidence including survivor testimony - and made allegations of harassment, persecution, torture, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings of minorities, including LGBT people. It identified a ""climate of impunity"" and called on Russia to investigate the abuse. On Monday, a spokesman for the Chechen government told the Kremlin-backed RT website that the latest allegations were untruthful. ""If even a single person were arrested, let alone 40, the entire Chechen public would have known. The claim that two were killed is even more absurd,"" Alvi Kraimov said. One victim of the 2017 crackdown spoke anonymously to the BBCabout his experience of detainment. He said he was subjected to torture - including electric shocks and beatings. This video can not be played 'Ruslan', a gay man who says he fled: ""It's the extermination of gay men"" ""They have a special black box and they attach wires to your hands or ears. The pain is awful. It's terrible torture,"" Ruslan (not his real name) said. Former detainees have spoken of being pressured to give the names of others during beatings.

"The phrase ""Brits abroad"" often conjures up images of retirees enjoying the sun. But the reality is far more complex and even something of a puzzle. Official figures suggest there are about three-quarters-of-a-million Britons living in the EU and that the majority are not retirees but workers - many of them young. Other estimates put the number far higher. It raises the possibility that we don't know how many people there are whose lives abroad will be affected by Brexit - or who they are. Nevertheless, we know that many are concerned about the future. Putting a number on the UK diaspora means using census and registration data from the countries they live in. Themost recent official figures suggest 784,900 British citizens live in EU countries,external, excluding the UK itself and Ireland. Published by the Office for National Statistics, they show nearly three-quarters are aged 64 or under. Seven out of 10 are living in Spain, France and Germany. But these figures only count those who have been in a country for more than 12 months. Those living and working overseas for a relatively short period of time - often younger workers - are undercounted. Many are seasonal workers, people on short-term contracts and students studying abroad. Even those settled abroad for a longer time can be missed, as registration is not always compulsory. For example, an official at the UK consulate in Spain said there were""tens of thousands at least under the radar"",external. Coming up with a precise figure for the true number of Britons in Europe is difficult, but it could be 1 million to 2.25 million. Thisincludes estimates for temporary residents, those currently not registered and dual nationals,external. If the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May is accepted, citizens' rights will remain unchanged until the end of 2020 From 2021, under the UK government's current plan,EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay,externalif they have settled status Similar systems are expected to be put in place in the EU countries for UK citizens If there is no deal, British and other EU governments say they will guarantee that citizens already in their countries can stay Source:The withdrawal agreement - what it all means The other problem with the official statistics is that they don't tell us much about who the Brits in Europe are. Knowing more about their education, the jobs they hold and their incomes could help us understand more about their lives abroad - and how they could be affected by Brexit. We have been trying to learn more through theBrExpats,externalresearch project. Interviews with more than 200 UK citizens in France and Spain have been carried out and responses to short surveys collected from a similar number. Unsurprisingly, those we spoke to work in a wide variety of roles: from tourism to English language teaching, banking and higher education. More stories like this How voters want Brexit to be sorted out How young and old would vote on Brexit now Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? The strange normality of life in a breakaway state Although the withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU says those lawfully resident in another EU member state on 31 December 2020 will have their rights upheld, many are nervous. For example, there were worries among some on fixed-term contracts coming to an end before they qualify for permanent legal status. Some were concerned that without status as EU citizens, no employer would take them on. One sector in which this is a particular problem is academic research, as it is common for researchers to move around Europe on contracts of two or three years. It is also difficult to demonstrate continuous residence for those in hospitality and tourism, a sector of seasonal work demanding high levels of flexibility from workers. And we don't know how many workers depend upon travelling across EU borders for their work. This could be a problem for those in jobs which take them to more than one country. EU reveals no-deal Brexit plans Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? Post-Brexit immigration system unveiled Of course, all of these concerns take on a new dimension if the Brexit deal is rejected and the UK leaves the EU with no deal. The European Commission has urged its 27 remaining member states to take a ""generous"" approach to the residency rights of UK citizens in the event of a no deal Brexit, ""provided that this approach is reciprocated by the UK"". Nevertheless, concerns have been raised about how these arrangements will be put in place and documents issued by 29 March, when the UK is due to leave. A number of countries have already announced plans: UK citizens in theNetherlands can apply for temporary residence,externalbefore 29 March and a residence permit at a later date Germany will exempt UK citizens from having to have a residency title,externalfor three months in the event of a no deal Spain saysthe rights of 300,000 Britons there are secure,external, as long as the same is offered to Spanish people in the UK France will guarantee,externalthe residence, employment and welfare rights of the 160,000 UK residents, if French expats get the same guarantees The UK government says it will protect the rights of EU citizens who have made their homes in the UK and isexpecting about 3.5 million applications. So, these are some of the circumstances in which working-age Britons living in Europe find themselves. Their lives have been made possible by their rights to freedom of movement, but many now wonder whether they will be able to remain once the UK leaves. But there is a twist here. Many of these Britons are used to job markets that demand they are enterprising and flexible. Some of those we spoke to for the BrExpats project appear to be quite sanguine about the future - believing that they can adjust to the circumstances of Brexit. But the one thing they all are waiting for is a little more certainty about exactly what the UK's exit from the EU means for them.

"MPs will soon decide the fate of Theresa May's Brexit deal. There are many views about why they should back or reject the deal, which was struck late last year with the European Union. But what do voters want MPs to do? And what do they think should happen if the deal is rejected? Polls suggest the deal has not proved popular with the public. YouGov has asked people whether they support or oppose it on no fewer than 11 occasions since it wasfirst unveiled in mid-November. Never have more than 27% said that they support the deal, while at least 42% have always said they are against it. Other polls show a similar pattern. Opinium found only one in 10 thinks the deal is good for the UK, while as many as half believe it is bad. Ipsos MORI has reported only a quarter think it would be a good thing for the UK to leave the EU on the terms of the deal. More than six in 10 believe it would be a bad thing. It is perhaps unsurprising then that many more voters say MPs should reject the deal than believe they should back it. More like this What British people think about Brexit now How young and old would vote on Brexit now Not only do Remain supporters seem inclined to reject the deal, but Leave voters do as well. In its recent polls, YouGov has found an average of 30% of Leave voters back the deal, while 47% are opposed to it. This arguably makes it harder for the PM to say that her deal fulfils the expectations of those who voted Leave in the referendum. That said, many voters have not made up their mind about the deal on offer. YouGov is still finding that about three in 10 still do not know whether they support it or not, well after the deal was revealed. This suggests some voters could yet be won round to Mrs May's proposal. While Remain and Leave voters appear to oppose the Brexit deal, they are split over what should be done instead. Opinium has repeatedly asked voters which of five possible options should be pursued if Parliament were to reject the current deal. None of the options comes close to being backed by a majority. The most popular every time - backed on average by just over a quarter - has been to leave without a deal at all. Meanwhile, the second most popular option each time - supported by just over a fifth - has been to hold a ""public vote"" on whether to accept the deal or to stay in the EU. While these options enjoy similar levels of support, they come from very different voter groups. Leaving without a deal is easily the single most popular option among those who voted Leave, chosen by an average of 46%. Holding a ""public vote"" on the deal, with an option to stay in the EU, is favoured among backers of Remain, 38% of whom pick this option. However, other courses of action also gain support. Fifteen per cent of all voters prefer attempting to negotiate a better deal, while 12% back Labour's preferred option of holding a general election. A further 9% support a different ""public vote"" in which the choice would be either Mrs May's deal or leaving the EU without one. Please upgrade your browser The idea of a second Brexit vote has attracted particular interest in recent weeks, thanks not least to a high-profile campaign. However, public support for the idea depends on how the poll question is worded. Polls asking whether there should be a ""public"" or ""people's vote"" - without specifying what the options would be - typically find that the idea is relatively popular. For example, Survation found that 48% support holding a ""people's vote"" to gauge the public's reaction to the deal, while 34% are opposed. Similarly, Populus reported that 44% believe the public should have the ""final say"" on the deal via a ""people's vote"", while just 30% are against this. However, when voters are asked about holding another referendum that might have the effect of reversing Brexit, the proposal attracts less support. ComRes has reported as many as 50% oppose ""holding a second referendum on whether to Remain or Leave"", with only 40% in favour. Similarly, according to polling commissioned by Lord Ashcroft, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, 47% are against holding a ""second referendum"", while 38% are in favour. In that scenario, voters would choose between leaving the EU under the terms of Mrs May's deal and remaining in the EU. The wording of the poll question seems to make a significant difference, particularly to Leave voters. Putting ""the people"" in charge of Brexit appeals to some Leavers, but a ballot which could potentially reverse the decision does not. Broadly, the idea of another referendum appears as controversial to voters as Brexit itself continues to be. When it comes to how people say they would vote if there were another referendum, the country still appears quite evenly divided. Remain, with an average score of 53% is enjoying just a narrow lead over Leave, which scored 47% in the most recent polls.

"During the past three years, the pound has had a rough time of things when it comes to its price against the dollar and other currencies. The immediate aftermath of the Brexit referendum saw sterling decline sharply in value. And as the vote on the UK's withdrawal deal from the European Union looms, further volatility is expected. Since June 2016, holidays and imported goods have become more expensive, but UK exports have been cheaper. It's a complex picture, though. Exporters, such as carmakers, are importers themselves, buying in raw materials such as oil or copper. While Britons living abroad but drawing a UK pension have suffered as the pound has declined. Since 1992, the pound has floated freely on currency markets, meaning that traders - buyers and sellers - determine what it's worth. When the pound rises in value, more of the currency is being bought. When it goes down, more is sold. ""A free-floating currency is a very good thing, because it works as a safety valve,"" says Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank. After the global financial crisis, countries whose economies suffered had weaker currencies. ""Countries in the eurozone such as Greece and Spain had a strong euro they couldn't devalue,"" or reduce in value, she added, and for them, the safety valve was wage cuts. ""The downside is when it comes on the back of political uncertainty,"" she said. ""Goods become more expensive."" In recent years, traders have been looking at politics, rather than economic data, which means faster trading, and a faster pace of change in the price. That's the volatility traders talk about. ""If you think abut political uncertainty being bad, the worst outcome is a hard Brexit,"" says Ms Foley, because details of what will happen under those circumstances are so scarce. ""If that's the worst case scenario, it [the pound] will rally if hard Brexit seems unlikely."" Similarly, talk of putting Brexit on hold has boosted the pound, as it gives businesses more room to plan, she says. A softer Brexit could be good news for savers, according to CIBC's head of foreign exchange strategy, Jeremy Stretch. Currency experts think that a softer Brexit could provide a boost to the economy by providing confidence and certainty to companies and consumers who in turn may decide to spend more or take on more staff. That increased economic activity could prompt the Bank of England to raise interest rates, boosting returns for savers. ""We could see an interest rate hike come the May meeting of the Bank of England, although it may be the case that they wait until August,"" according to Mr Stretch. ""Moving towards a softer Brexit would help to alleviate the uncertainty that was impacting the economy in the latter stages of 2018."" ""Certainly since 2016, sterling is weaker,"" says Ms Foley. ""Our wealth overseas has lessened."" At the bureau de change, rates will be even worse than those on the financial market. That reflects their business costs including rent, staff, security and having lots of money ready. And if you buy your notes at the airport, convenience. BBC researchshows that travellers have seen bureau de change rates fall in recent months as the pound as suffered against other currencies. But the value of the pound is always reflected in the price of another currency. Which means that since the referendum there are some currencies against which sterling has performed better, notably the Turkish lira and the Argentine peso. Interest rates and money-printing can also have an effect. Higher interest rates, and therefore returns, may attract more foreign buyers, which pushes up the value of the currency. Printing money, either literally or through the bond-buying programmes known as quantitative easing, has historically reduced the value of a currency by increasing its supply. But sometimes the effects can be minor. Not all currencies have gained against the pound Another factor is the UK's current account deficit, says Jane Foley. That's where imports exceed the value of a nation's exports. A simple way of thinking about it is a deficit of savers, she says. ""We need foreign savers to make up the shortfall. If they don't like what they see, they are more likely to pull their money out."" That means selling pounds and a cheaper currency. ""If we had a surplus, we would not be as vulnerable,"" she says. It explains why the pound is more volatile - why trading happens at a faster rate - than the yen. Japan has much domestic wealth to draw upon. Companies may buy currencies for a variety of reasons. A company wanting to buy a UK-based rival will need lots of sterling to do so. It may have to sell dollars or euros and buy sterling. Likewise, a company wanting to pay shareholders a slice of profits may need to bring UK sales home. They will sell their pounds. Then you have traders who think they know something others don't. They will make bets on the market, or speculation. ""Customers I see are corporate customers who may have to buy energy, grain or some other component,"" says Ms Foley. ""They have a natural need. It's an easy mistake thinking it's just speculators, making a quick buck."" Events will determine how the pound performs in the short term, until some sort of resolution for Britain's departure from the EU comes about, said Ms Foley. The vote on Prime Minster Theresa May's Brexit deal will probably be the next event. Market-watchers have typically mixed views. ""The pound will react to the extent and manner of the government's likely defeat in the vote, with a heavier defeat more likely to push down on an exchange rate that has already depreciated a great deal,"" said Gregory Thwaites, research director at WorldRemit and previously Head of International Research at the Bank of England. ""In the unlikely event that the deal is passed, sterling will be likely to rally."" ""Should the withdrawal act be ratified on Tuesday, sterling will probably surge about 5% in value against the US dollar, but if December's failed attempt is anything to go by then the chances look slim,"" said Simon Harvey, market analyst at Monex Europe. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said: ""It is expected that the bill will be voted down, but this won't be the most significant factor influencing the pound's direction, it's what will happen next."" He says options as diverse as a no-confidence vote in the government, an extension of Article 50, a new general election and a second referendum could mean very different things for the pound. ""As of now, investors seem to be on wait-and-see mode."" The multiple meanings of the vote Brexit: How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU?

"West Midlands Police failed to record more than 16,600 violent crimes West Midlands Police is ""failing victims"" and not recording more than 16,600 violent crimes each year, a watchdog has said. The force was rated inadequate by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, who said victims felt let down and not believed. Only 78% of violent crime and 89% of sexual offences reported were recorded, it found. The force said it had made ""substantial progress"". About three-quarters of police forces around the country have already been inspected and of those, two-thirds were rated as either ""inadequate"" or ""requiring improvement"". Reports from inspections were first published in 2016, after police forces throughout England and Wales were found to have an ""utterly unacceptable"" rate of accurately recording crime. The recording rate by the West Midlands force remained ""unacceptable and must be urgently addressed"", the watchdog said. Latest news from the West Midlands ""Too often the force is still failing victims of crime, including domestic abuse victims,"" it said. Victim Support, an independent charity for crime victims in England and Wales, said the findings had ""the potential to undermine public trust in the criminal justice system"". Police officers in the West Midlands force have been given metal-detecting ""knife wands"" in an attempt to tackle knife crime An ""unrecorded"" crime is one that has been reported to the police but not recorded as an offence, and means the alleged crime may not have been investigated. In 2017 HMICFRS said five out of six reported crimes were recorded by West Midlands Police but38,800 crimes each year were not. It was re-examined for violent crime and sexual offences in 2018, with inspectors auditing a sample of reports from 1 March to 31 May. But they could not look at other types of crime because the force was updating its systems. Of the 2,176 reports of crime audited, 470 related to domestic abuse - of these 354 were recorded. Of those not recorded, 95 included offences classed as violent, such as common assaults, ABH, harassment and malicious communications. The report said: ""We found several examples of attending officers letting down victims by simply not believing them. ""Some incident logs contained closing comments that were completely different to the initial call and recorded no crime, without an adequate explanation."" West Midlands Police has been rated ""inadequate"" over violent crime reporting Deputy Chief Constable Louisa Rolfe, from West Midlands Police, claimed the watchdog had failed to recognise its strengths in recording crime overall. She said: ""It is frustrating that, despite substantial progress, our grading has remained as inadequate."" Ms Rolfe said the force was confident its current position was ""much improved"" and it could not be criticised for failing to put more resources into crime recording. The watchdog also published a report on Leicestershire, which was again rated as ""inadequate"". When it was first inspected in 2017, Leicestershire had the worst rate for recording crime out of 30 forces reported on. While there were some improvements for 2018, the watchdog found the overall recording rate and the rates for violent crime and sexual offences were too low. In 2018, the force recorded about 84% of reported crime, up from 75% the previous year, and 79% of violent crime, rising from 66%. For sexual offences, 88% were recorded. Force offers 'poor service' says chief Police get 'wands' to fight knife crime In terms of cancelled crimes, HMICFRS said Leicestershire's standards had become worse. Among 49 victims who should have been told a crime had been cancelled, 15 were not informed, which the watchdog said ""remains a concern"". Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Cole said: ""Crime recording is a complex issue and this inspection looks at our technical compliance with a national crime recording system - something which is focused on numbers, categories, how crimes are manually logged on systems and then audited."" Diana Fawcett, of Victim Support, said: ""By not recording crimes accurately the police are not then in a position to help victims access the help and support they need. ""These reports have the potential to undermine public trust in the criminal justice system and deter people from reporting crimes in the future."" Kate Russell, a spokeswoman for Rape Crisis England & Wales, said the reviews were ""seriously concerning"". ""Anyone who reports a sexual offence should be treated with respect, empathy and impartiality and have their report properly investigated,"" she said.

"The WHSmith diary maps out the purple Elizabeth line, which was set to open last month Misleading transport maps featuring the delayed Crossrail railway are being included in 2019 diaries sold by a major retailer. WHSmith is selling the products, which were printed before it emerged the line would not open on time. London's new east-west railway was originally set to open last month but has since been delayed past 2019. The delay has resulted in a row overwhen London mayor Sadiq Khan knew the railway would not open on time. Sportswear firm Adidas was also caught out by Crossrail's problems as it put special edition trainers displaying the Elizabeth line roundel and purple branding on sale to coincide with the scheduled opening. Transport bosses have also been forced to partly cover a large Crossrail poster at Tottenham Court Road Tube station to hide references to an opening in 2018. It was announced on 31 August that Crossrail, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, would not open until autumn 2019, it has since been announced that the project will be delayed even further. Mark Wild, who became the project's chief executive in November, revealed that ""none of the stations could have been ready for December"" and admitted there are ""still thousands of hours of construction work to do in the tunnels"". Testing of the signalling systems is also taking much longer than expected. The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018 The diaries were already in production when the delays were announced, TfL said. A spokeswoman said: ""The Elizabeth line naming was announced in February 2016 and we have been working with a range of companies on products to generate commercial revenue, which is then reinvested in TfL services. ""...Due to lead times some of these products were already in production when Crossrail Ltd announced there would be a delay to the opening of the line."" Mr Khan claimshe only found out on 29 August, two days before Londoners were informed,but Crossrail Ltd's former chairman Sir Terry Morgan insists the mayor was aware of problems at least a month beforehand. TfL 'removed' Crossrail delay warnings Â£1.4bn bailout for Crossrail amid delays Crossrail to miss December opening date Keith Prince, a Conservative member of the Greater London Authority who sits on the transport committee, said: ""The delay to Crossrail will have an effect on housing, business, Transport for London's (TfL) finances and the ability of Londoners to travel around our city. ""The delay has even impacted on the manufacturers of products such as trainers and diaries, who invested in adapting their products to coincide with the Crossrail opening."" Once fully opened, the Elizabeth line will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east, through 13 miles of new tunnels in central London. The cost is being met by the Government, the Greater London Authority and London businesses. Its budget was set at Â£15.9 billion in 2007. This was cut to Â£14.8 billion in 2010, but raised to Â£15.4 billion in July 2018. In December, the project was given a Â£1.4 billion bailout due to the delays.

"Paul Dawson was surprised to find the police had taken an interest in his Facebook post The father of a newborn baby was ""shocked"" to be confronted by police after posting on social media that he accidentally fed his son chilli sauce. Paul Dawson, from Stockton, was out with his partner and five-day-old Ben on 5 January when the mishap occurred. Forgetting he had been eating spicy chicken wings, Mr Dawson put his knuckle in Ben's mouth to pacify him. Cleveland Police said officers visited Mr Dawson after a member of the public complained about his Facebook post. Barber Mr Dawson. 39, said the ""upsetting experience"" of two police officers coming to his home had spoiled his first days with his newborn son. Mr Dawson said Ben showed no ill effects from his brush with hot sauce He said he was at a branch of TGI Fridays when he took hold of Ben to allow his partner Laurencia Wood to eat her food. After wiping his hands on a napkin, he then put a knuckle in Ben's mouth to pacify him. The baby made a ""funny face"", but did not scream or cry, he said. Mr Dawson later wrote on Facebook: ""Apparently five-day-old babies don't like it when their dads put their fingers in their mouths after eating hot wings. Unintentionally by the way. Lol."" Three days later police knocked on his door to ask if he had been feeding Ben hot sauce. Mr Dawson said he had not received an apology A Cleveland Police spokesperson said: ""Police received a call from a member of the public regarding concern for the welfare of a baby. ""As a result, two officers were deployed to speak with the parents to understand the circumstances of the report.

"This video can not be played Roads were barricaded by protesters Several people have been killed during protests in Zimbabwe after the government more than doubled the price of fuel overnight. Hundreds more were arrested as demonstrators took to the streets in the cities of Harare and Bulawayo. Burning tyres have been used to barricade roads and block bus routes. President Emmerson Mnangagwa said the fuel price rise is aimed at tackling shortages caused by an increase in fuel use and ""rampant"" illegal trading. Zimbabwe's government is trying to resuscitate the country's struggling economy. Inflation is running high while wages have stagnated. Despair, anger and anxiety in Zimbabwe's fuel queue Why Zimbabwe's Christmas crackers cost $40 Security Minister Owen Ncube confirmed there had been deaths but did not give a figure. He blamed opposition figures and political rights groups for the violence and said an investigation was under way. Roads were blocked and cars were torched in Harare The southern African nation faces a severe shortage of US dollar cash and confidence in its bond notes, which are supposed to be worth the same as the dollar, is low. The bond notes, or ""bollars"", have lost value because of a lack of foreign currency backing the note, and are now worth much less than a dollar. Zimbabwean companies are also not producing enough to satisfy local demand or to earn foreign currency by exporting goods. Instead, the country is importing more than it is exporting and struggling to pay. Riot police officers cleared the roads littered with burnt tyres In Harare, most businesses are closed following calls by trade unions and the opposition for a three-day strike over the fuel price increase. Riot police have been deployed in the capital and in the southern city of Bulawayo. In a televised address on Saturday, President Mnangagwa said the fuel price hike would address the ongoing fuel problems, which have seen motorists queuing for hours at petrol stations. He said the government would crackdown on ""elements bent on taking advantage of the current fuel shortages to cause and sponsor unrest and instability in the country"". The hike means petrol prices rose from $1.24 (Â£0.97) a litre to $3.31 , with diesel up from $1.36 a litre to $3.11.

In the capital, Harare, hundreds of residents in the suburb of Epworth blocked roads to prevent buses from getting to their destination. ""People are protesting now that things are hurting. People are suffering,"" a protester told the BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare. He added that the government does not seem to have solutions to their problems and called on it to step down. Many protesters said the president - who left the country on Sunday for a trip to Russia and several central Asian countries - should have cancelled his trip to deal with the crisis. Protesters in Bulawayo blocked the main road leading to the city In Bulawayo, demonstrators attacked minibuses heading to the city centre and used burning tyres and boulders to block the main routes into town. Some schools turned away pupils fearing for their safety, AFP says. ""We want Mnangagwa to know our displeasure in his failure,"" an angry Mthandazo Moyo told AFP. ""[Former President] Mugabe was evil but he listened,"" he added. Nelson Chamisa, the leader of the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change said: ""We have a national crisis which is descending into a humanitarian crisis."" Mr Mnangagwa came to power in November 2017 after long-time ruler Robert Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Over the next 24 hours, give this deal a second look"" Theresa May has warned opponents of her Brexit deal that they risk ""letting the British people down"" as Labour said the prime minister faced a ""humiliating defeat"" in Tuesday's crunch vote. She urged critics to give the deal ""a second look"", insisting new assurances on the Irish border had ""legal force"". She said the ""history books"" would judge if MPs delivered on Brexit while safeguarding the economy and security. But Jeremy Corbyn said the PM had ""completely and utterly failed"". And the SNP said the PM was ""in fantasy land and the government should stop threatening no-deal"". MPs will vote on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and declaration on future relations on Tuesday evening. Labour and the other opposition parties will vote against the deal while about 100 Conservative MPs, and the Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs, could also join them. Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn met their backbenchers after the PM's Commons statement on Monday night - the PM to appeal once more for their support and the Labour leader to reiterate his plan to call for a general election if the deal is rejected. Mr Corbyn also told his MPs a no-confidence vote in the prime minister would be ""coming soon"", according to BBC political correspondent Iain Watson. Brexit Live: Rolling updates on developments Laura Kuenssberg: Multiple meanings of meaningful vote Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit Possible amendments to PM's Brexit deal Assistant whip Gareth Johnson has become the latest member of the government to quit his job over the deal, saying in his resignation letter to the PM that it would be ""detrimental to our nation's interests"". He added: ""The time has come to place my loyalty to my country above my loyalty to the government."" Ahead of the vote, Mrs May briefed MPs on the controversial issue of the ""backstop"" - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical Northern Ireland border checks. She said her ""absolute conviction"" was that the UK and EU would be able to finalise their future relationship by the end of 2020, meaning the backstop would never be needed. Shepublished a joint letter,externalfrom European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in which they stressed their ""firm commitment"" to working towards such an agreement - and said if the backstop were to be used it would be for the ""shortest possible period"". However, they said they could not add anything to change the terms of the deal negotiated with Mrs May. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Laura Kuenssberg: What's next if MPs reject May's deal? What could happen next? PM's 'hypocritical' assembly remark dropped The PM told MPs: ""I say to members on all sides of this house, whatever you may have previously concluded, over these next 24 hours, give this deal a second look. ""It is not perfect, but when the history books are written, people will look at the decision of this House tomorrow and ask 'did we deliver on the country's vote to leave the EU, did we safeguard our economy, security or union or did we let the British people down'."" Five Conservative Brexiteer MPs who have been critics of the withdrawal agreement have now said they will support the government in the vote on Tuesday, including Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and former Public Accounts Committee chairman Sir Edward Leigh. But former Labour leader Ed Miliband said the PM must make the government ""the servant of the House"" if the deal was rejected, giving Parliament an ""open and honest process"" to express their will. By Alex Forsyth, BBC political correspondent The letter from Presidents Juncker and Tusk was deliberately released at the moment No 10 hoped it might have the most impact - the eve of the crucial Brexit vote. But regardless of the timing, the attempt to reassure hasn't done enough to convince many senior Brexiteers to swing behind the prime minister's deal. The contentious Northern Ireland backstop remains the biggest sticking point, and nothing short of a legally watertight guarantee that it can't go on indefinitely will be enough for many of those with concerns. At this stage, the EU has made clear it won't reopen the negotiated Withdrawal Agreement to include such a guarantee. So, however warm the words of reassurance offered today, it seems they won't be enough to persuade many opponents to Mrs May's deal to change their mind. This video can not be played Corbyn: PM ""utterly failed"" on Brexit legal agreements The so-called Irish backstop will see the UK and EU share a single customs territory until they settle their future relationship or come up with another solution to stop a hard border. Many Tory MPs, as well as the Democratic Unionists, are adamantly opposed to it. The EU has given fresh written assurances about how the backstop might be triggered and how long it would last. The key points, in the letter from top officials Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker to the PM, are: The backstop will not affect or supersede the provisions of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement The backstop will not extend regulatory alignment with EU law in Northern Ireland beyond what is strictly necessary to avoid a hard border Alternatives to the backstop such as ""facilitative arrangements or technologies"", will be looked at with progress considered every six months after the UK's departure Any alternative arrangements would not be ""required to replicate"" the backstop ""provided the underlying objectives continue to be met"" ""Were the backstop to enter into force in whole or in part, it is intended to apply only temporarily, unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement,"" they said. ""The Commission is committed to providing the necessary political impetus and resources to help achieving the objective of making this period as short as possible,"" it said. Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? Brexit: A really simple guide Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said the assurances offered ""legal force"" to the UK, but admitted they did not alter the ""fundamental meanings"" in the Withdrawal Agreement - namely that the UK is indefinitely committed to the backstop if it comes into force, as neither side can unilaterally withdraw from it. Mr Corbyn said it amounted to nothing more than ""warm words and aspirations"" while the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds said there were no ""legally binding assurances"" as talked about by the PM in December. ""In fact, there is nothing new,"" he said. Please upgrade your browser Here is what is likely to happen: Tuesday - Day five of debate followed by ""meaningful vote"" on the PM's deal. MPs will also get to vote on amendments that could reshape the deal. If the deal is rejected Theresa May will get three working days to come up with a ""plan B"" Wednesday - Mrs May could head to Brussels to try to get further concessions from the EU Monday 21 January - Expected Commons vote on ""Plan B"" The UK will leave the EU on 29 March unless there is a new act of Parliament preventing that. Three senior Conservative backbenchers - Nick Boles, Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan - have proposed a ""European Union Withdrawal Number 2 Bill"" if she fails a second time, giving ministers three weeks to get a plan B through Parliament. If this doesn't work, they propose that the Liaison Committee - made up of the chairmen and chairwomen of all the Commons select committees - should be given ""the responsibility to try and come up with its own compromise deal, which would have to go back to the House for a vote"". Downing Street has said it is ""extremely concerned"" about the plot, which it says could potentially overturn centuries of Parliamentary precedent. A cross-party group of anti-Brexit politicians have also published proposed legislation to bring about a second referendum on leaving the EU, asking the public whether they want to remain in the EU or leave under the prime minister's deal. The MPs behind the draft legislation point out that Article 50 - the two-year process by which an EU member leaves the bloc - would have to be extended in order for another poll to take place, meaning the UK would remain a member beyond 29 March.

"This video can not be played Key figures in the Brexit debate give us their views MPs have begun to vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal for leaving the European Union. The so-called ""meaningful vote"" comes at the end of five days of debate over the plan. Mrs May called for politicians to back her deal or risk ""letting the British people down"". But with many of her own MPs expected to join opposition parties to vote against the deal, it is widely expected to be defeated. Brexit Live: Rolling updates ahead of crunch vote Labour, the SNP and Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh all pulled the amendments that they had proposed to the deal before they came to a vote. Tory MP John Baron insisted MPs vote on his - which would have given the UK the right to terminate the Northern Ireland backstop without the agreement of the EU - but it was defeated by 600 votes to 24. Closing the debate on her deal, Mrs May said the responsibility of MPs was ""profound"" and that her deal ""delivers on the core tenets of Brexit... in a way that protects jobs, ensures our security and honours the integrity of our United Kingdom"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said backing the ""botched and damaging"" deal would be a ""reckless leap in the dark"" for the UK. What's next if MPs reject May's deal? Kuenssberg: Playing the numbers game The prime minister addressed her cabinet on Tuesday morning before heading to the Commons for the start of the debate on her deal - which includes both the withdrawal agreement on the terms on which the UK leaves the EU and a political declaration for the future relationship. She had spent the lead up to the vote trying to reassure MPs from all sides of the House over the controversial Northern Irish ""backstop"" - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical border checks between the country and Ireland - having receivednew written assurances,externalfrom the EU that it would be temporary and, if triggered, would last for ""the shortest possible period"". Speaking at the close of the debate, Mrs May added: ""If we leave with the deal I am proposing, I believe we can lay the foundations for which to build a better Britain. ""And as prime minister I would not stand at this dispatch box and recommended a course of action that I do not believe is in the best interests of our country and our future."" Pro-Brexit demonstrators are making their voices heard Anti- Brexit campaigners are holding a mass rally in Parliament Square With fancy dress, lurid floats and colourful banners, there has been something approaching a carnival atmosphere opposite Parliament, as pro and anti-Brexit demonstrators make their voices heard ahead of the MPs' vote. A rally by supporters of the People's Vote campaign for another referendum is currently taking place in nearby Parliament Square. Passionate protests outside Parliament Opening the final day of the debate earlier, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox gave an impassioned speech to the Commons with the prime minister by his side, saying that voting for the deal was ""the first of two keys that will unlock our future with the European Union"", allowing the government to focus on the future relationship. He said that MPs could not underestimate the complexity of Brexit and that the deal offered an ""orderly, predictable and legally certain"" way of leaving the bloc, without ""thousands"" of legal issues arising for citizens and businesses. ""If you found yourself suddenly with the rug pulled from under you, not knowing what your legal obligations would be, you would say to this House, 'What are you playing at? What are you doing?' ""You are not children in the playground, you are legislators, and it is your job. We are playing with people's lives,"" he said. This video can not be played Geoffrey Cox: ""You are not children in the playground"" But many remain opposed to the deal, with about 100 Conservative MPs and the DUP's 10 MPs expected to join Labour and the other opposition parties in voting it down. Mr Corbyn told the Commons: ""The prime minister has treated Brexit as a matter for the Conservative Party rather than for the good of the country. But she has failed to even win over her own party. ""This deal is a bad deal for our economy, a bad deal for our democracy, and a bad deal for this country."" Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said that Brexiteers like him could back a deal if aspects such as the backstop were dealt with. But he told the Today programme the EU had played ""a smart game of hard ball"" and said it was time for the UK to do the same. This video can not be played DUP's Sammy Wilson: ""The deal would remove us from the rest of the United Kingdom"" Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster said the backstop ""was something that we could not accept"" and said her party's MPs would be voting against the deal. ""It (the backstop) does violence to the union - it separates us from the rest of the United Kingdom in a very very obvious way,"" she said, calling for Mrs May to ""get rid"" of the backstop. And speaking during the Commons debate, the leader of the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford, reiterated his belief that there was ""no such thing as a good Brexit"" and his party would continue to fight against leaving. ""There is no way that the Scottish National Party and the people of Scotland are going to be sitting in that bus as the prime minister drives us off the cliff,"" he said. BBC Brussels correspondent, Adam Fleming, said the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will be returning to the city later to deal with ""Brexit-related business"", fuelling speculation Mrs May will make an emergency visit on Wednesday if her deal is voted down. When asked by the BBC for a message to MPs ahead of the vote, he said: ""I would like them to behave in a responsible way."" The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, also appealed for MPs to ""keep calm"" when voting later. He will be holding talks with the European Parliament's Brexit steering group later tonight in Strasbourg before a debate on Wednesday morning about the result of the meaningful vote. Brexit: A really simple guide What could happen next? How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit The deal suffered a heavy defeat in the House of Lords on Monday night, as peers backed a Labour motion by 321 votes to 152. While the Lords vote carries no real weight, as peers accepted MPs should have the final say, the motion - which also rejected a ""no deal"" scenario - expressed ""regret"" that Mrs May's deal would ""damage the future economic prosperity, internal security and global influence"" of the UK. This video can not be played Brexit plan: Political declaration and withdrawal agreement However, five Conservative Brexiteer MPs who have been critics of the withdrawal agreement have now said they will support the government, along with three Labour backbenchers and independent Frank Field. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said it showed there had been ""progress"" but admitted to the BBC's Politics Live that gaining support was ""challenging"". Speaking to his own backbenchers on Monday night, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn again condemned the deal and repeated his call for a general election if it was voted down by Parliament. He also promised Labour would call a no-confidence vote in the government ""soon"". Please upgrade your browser If the deal is rejected by MPs, Mrs May has three sitting days to return to Parliament with a ""Plan B"". Some have suggested she would head to Brussels on Wednesday to try to get further concessions from the EU, before returning to the Commons to give a statement about her new proposal by Monday. This could then be put to a vote by MPs. If this also fails, there is a proposal put forward by senior Conservative backbenchers Nick Boles, Sir Oliver Letwin and Nicky Morgan for a ""European Union Withdrawal Number 2 Bill"". This would give ministers another three weeks to come up with another plan and get it through Parliament. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If this doesn't work either, they propose giving the responsibility of coming up with a compromise deal to the Liaison Committee - which is made up of the chairmen and chairwomen of all the Commons select committees, drawn from opposition parties as well as the Conservatives. This proposal in turn would have to be voted through by MPs. Laura Kuenssberg sets out some potential scenarios after the vote In another development, a cross-party group of anti-Brexit politicians has published proposed legislation to bring about another referendum to ask the public whether they want to remain in the EU or leave under the prime minister's deal. This video can not be played Lib Dems' Layla Moran: ""Brexit is a complete cluster shambles"" The MPs behind the draft legislation point out that Article 50 - the two-year process by which an EU member can leave the bloc - would have to be extended in order for another referendum to take place, meaning the UK would remain a member beyond 29 March. But, unless new legislation is introduced, the default position will be that the UK leaves the EU on that date with no deal. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks.

"After five days of debate on Theresa May's Brexit agreement, MPs will finally vote on the deal later. The final day of debate will end with a speech from the prime minister at about 18:20 GMT. But before the vote on the Brexit agreement happens, MPs will get a chance to reshape, or reject, the deal by voting on a series of amendments to it, from about 19:00 GMT. This will start with votes on three or four backbench amendments that could reshape the deal. Each amendment will take about 15 minutes. The vote on the withdrawal agreement itself is unlikely to happen before 20:00 and is expected to be followed by a statement from Mrs May. There will be live updates onthe BBC News websiteand it will be broadcast on theBBC News channelor watchBBC Parliament liveon BBC iPlayer. Amendments give MPs the chance to reshape, or reject, the deal. Commons Speaker John Bercow has selected four amendments to be put to the vote: Labour frontbench amendment Rejects the deal because it fails to provide a permanent customs union and ""strong single market deal"", as set out in Labour's ""six tests"" Rejects leaving with no deal Resolves to ""pursue every option"" that prevents either no-deal or leaving on the basis of the current deal SNP and Plaid Cymru amendment Declines to approve Theresa May's Brexit deal ""in line with the views of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly that they would be damaging for Scotland, Wales and the nations and regions of the UK as a whole"" Calls for the UK's departure from the EU to be delayed until another withdrawal deal is agreed. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh's amendment Makes clear the Northern Ireland backstop is temporary and should remain temporary Calls for assurance that, if the backstop doesn't end by the close of 2021, this will be treated as a fundamental change of circumstances and would terminate the Withdrawal Treaty on 1 January 2022 Backed by 15 other Tory Brexiteers. Conservative MP John Baron's amendment Gives the UK the right to terminate the Northern Ireland backstop without the agreement of the EU Amendment backed by cross-party group of Brexiteers, including 12 Conservatives, one independent and one DUP MP. John Bercow told MPs that if they back Sir Edward Leigh's amendment, John Baron's amendment will not be voted on. You can see the full text of the motion and the amendments put down by MPs here,external. There is a question mark over how far the government's withdrawal agreement could be modified by MPs before it no longer has force under international law, or the EU judges it to be in breach of what was agreed by Mrs May. The government had indicated it would back an amendment proposed by Conservative MP Hugo Swire, which accepted the government's deal as the EU Withdrawal Bill but included provisions to: Make the government report to Parliament in March 2020 on the status of the arrangements to supersede the Northern Ireland backstop. This is the controversial ""insurance policy"" aimed at preventing the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland if the UK and EU have not agreed on a new trade deal by December 2020 Give Parliament a vote on whether to extend the 21-month post-Brexit transition period, which would end in December 2020 Give Parliament a vote on whether to implement the backstop Impose ""a duty"" on the government to agree a future relationship with the EU, or alternative arrangements, within one year of the backstop coming into force. But Speaker Bercow has not selected this amendment to be put to the vote, although MPs will be able to refer to it during the debate.

"""You say we haven't achieved anything,"" the prime minister said in answer to a reporter's question in Stoke. ""We have achieved this exchange of letters..."" She saidthe letters gave further assurances,externalabout the UK and the EU not wanting to usethe Irish backstop. For her critics, it was an underwhelming moment. But what does the exchange - between Theresa May and the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission - actually say? Well, the tone is certainly constructive and genuinely so - an effort on both sides to offer reassurance of good faith, for public consumption. The letters contain carefully worded arguments (hardly a surprise here) that both sides have had to compromise and that both sides are sensitive to the concerns of the other. But when it comes to the core issue - getting the Brexit deal approved in the UK Parliament - the letters are unlikely to change anything. Mrs May's letter highlights two big problems identified by MPs: the fear that the EU will ""leave the UK permanently in the backstop"" the separation between  thelegally binding withdrawal agreementandthe non-binding political declarationon future relations The fact that the part of the deal focusing on the future relationship with the EU was not legally binding, the prime minister's letter suggested, had left MPs ""concerned"" that no-one could guarantee where negotiations might finally end up. For many Tory opponents of the prime minister's deal, the key phrase appears early in the EU's response. May: Back Brexit deal 'for country's sake' Brexit vote: What could happen next? ""As you know,"" the letter says, ""we are not in a position to agree to anything that changes or is inconsistent with the withdrawal agreement."" The legal underpinning of the backstop proposal, in other words, will not change. There are plenty of words in the EU letter about how the backstop has only ever been designed as a temporary measure ""which would represent a sub-optimal trading arrangement for both sides"". The EU would ""use its best endeavours"" (a phrase we've heard before and which carries some legal weight) to ensure that ""the backstop would only be in place (if at all) for as long as strictly necessary"". This isn't just telling the UK what it wants to hear. The EU really doesn't like the backstop and it was a significant compromise for it to accept it. But the letter doesn't really go any further than the language that can already be found in the withdrawal agreement itself and in theconclusions of an EU summit,externallast month. What the EU letter does offer is extra reassurance that it will push on with plans to finalise a new trade deal, which would remove the need for any backstop, as quickly as possible. And it emphasises that those summit conclusions do carry some legal weight. There are other titbits in the text, designed to answer some of the concerns set out by the prime minister. The EU letter confirms that the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration are ""part of the same negotiation package"" and can be published side by side in the EU's Official Journal ""in order to underline the close relationship between the two texts"". It also highlights an important point that is set out in the withdrawal agreement - that any new laws that the EU proposes, under the terms of the backstop, for Northern Ireland require the agreement of the UK. But the UK wouldn't have the power of veto (it couldn't block all changes automatically) and it couldn't stop the EU from making amendments to existing laws. In any case, many opponents of Mrs May's deal are unimpressed. ""Despite a letter of supposed reassurance from the European Union, there are no 'legally binding assurances', as the prime minister talked about in December,"" said the Democratic Unionist Party MP Nigel Dodds. ""In fact, there is nothing new. Nothing has changed."" And that leads to a key question - what else is the EU really prepared to offer if, or once, the deal gets rejected in a first vote in Parliament? At the moment, with the stakes higher than ever, we're stuck at a point that has bedevilled relations between the EU and the UK for decades - the maximum the EU is prepared to offer is less than the minimum that many Tory Eurosceptics are prepared to accept.

"Drivers from the UK living in the EU have been urged to swap their licence for a local one as soon as possible in case there is a no-deal Brexit. If they do not, they might have to pass a test in the country where they live. The government also said,externalthose living in the UK who want to drive in the EU after 29 March might need an international driving permit (IDP). It warned British licence holders living in the EU they should exchange their licence soon to avoid any delays. The AA estimated,externalas many as half a million ex-pats living in France and Spain would have to take a new test if they had not exchanged their licence, should there be no deal. You are only allowed one EU driving licence,externalat any one time, which is why people currently have to exchange their licence, rather having both one from the UK and one from another EU country. How will Brexit affect my European holiday? What next if deal rejected? The guidance - updated on Monday - told Britons living in the EU that from 29 March, when the UK is set to leave the union, that ""in the event that there is no EU exit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in the EU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there"". It continued: ""You should consider exchanging your UK driving licence for an EU driving licence as soon as possible. ""Increased demand may lead to longer processing times and delays to exchanging driving licences the closer it is to 29 March 2019."" Those affected would be able to have a UK licence again if they return to live in the UK. For drivers living in the UK and travelling to the EU and EEA, the IDP might be needed in some countries in addition to a UK driving licence, but this would not apply in Ireland. The international permits cost Â£5.50 and are available at some post offices. Peers debate private members' bills Don't let British people down, May tells MPs What's next if MPs reject May's deal?

"Peers looking at the Civil Partnerships Bill Stalking Protection Bill debated as well The week ahead suggests it is the calm between Brexit storms in Parliament: but a quiet agenda can reveal hidden surprises. House of LordsParliament Peers approve second reading of the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill and it moves onto committee stage. With that the Lords adjourn for the day. Peers return on Monday - as do we, for more coverage of Parliament. Thanks for joining us. House of LordsParliament Peers are now debating the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill at second reading. This bill - which was introduced into the Commons by the Conservative MP Sir Greg Knight - regulates the operation and management of private parking facilities. You canread more about the bill on the Parliament website,external. House of LordsParliament Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who introduced the bill in the Commons, told the campagning group, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, that there was currently a gap in the law, especially for those stalked by strangers. She said the bill aimed to introduce a new Stalking Protection Order to protect victims at the early stages of an investigation. The order would be civil orders, making them easier to impose, breaching their requirements would be a criminal offence with serious consequences. Read more aboutDr Wollaston's aims here,external. House of LordsParliament Peers have moved on to the Stalking Protection Bill. This bill was introduced to the Commons by Sarah Wollaston, the Tory MP and chair of the Health select committee. It's designed to provide protection for those at risk of stalking. Civil Partnership, Marriages and Deaths Bill House of LordsParliament The Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths Bill was introduced to the Commons by Tory MP Tim Laughton. It makes provision for opposite sex couples to enter a civil partnership and it also allows for the mother of each party to a marriage or civil partnership to be a witness on the marriage certificate. Welcome to our coverage of the House of Lords today - peers are going to be discussing three private members' bills. The Stalking Protection Bill and the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill will both be debated at second reading later today. But first, from 10am, it's the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill. House of LordsParliament There were three debates in the upper chamber today: two on Brexit, the first on steps required for another referendum, the second on its effect on the integrity of the UK. A third debate on the threat to the health of young people by technology had peers wishing for more research in the area. Questions were asked of the government on everything from the UK's nuclear power industry, to teaching art and design in schools. The Lords returns on Monday at 2.30pm. Technology and young people's health debate House of LordsParliament Labour's media spokesperson Lord Griffiths of Burry Port says that there needs to be research on online gambling and how it affects children. He adds that children may well see nine junk food adverts during half an hour's worth of TV. Culture Minister Lord Ashton of Hyde says the internet offers ""opportunities"" but there are concerns over the relationship children can develop with it. ""We do recognise that more research is required"" to better understand new technologies, he adds. He says he himself finds evidence on screen time in the media ""confusing and contradictory"". House of CommonsParliament The debate on children's social care finished. Labour MP Bill Esterson is concluding the parliamentary week with his adjournment debate, which focuses on awareness of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. That's it for our coverage of the Commons today, join us again on Monday from 2.30pm. As Andrea Leadsom confirmed earlier today, that's when the government will table a motion outlining its new plan for breaking the deadlock over Brexit. Children's Social Care House of CommonsParliament Responding for the government, Education Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the importance of children's social care ""too often goes unrecognised"". He notes that the sector only grabs headlines ""when things go wrong"". Mr Zahawi says interventions by the government in children's social services that are underperforming has ""brought results"". He adds that there are ""financial constraints on children's services"", but it is being proven that local authorities can achieve great things. He says the government hopes that by 2022, fewer than 10% of local authorities will be rated as 'inadequate' by Ofsted, and that they ""intervene early and in the right way"". Technology and young people's health debate House of LordsParliament Crossbencher Viscount Colville of Culross says the World Health Organization is considering including gaming addiction in their official diagnostics as a condition. In China and South Korea, gaming addiction is ""widespread amongst young men"", he says. The government is working with schools, and game developers are now including time alert warnings, he warns. Crossbencher and former civil servant Lord Bichard says that ""very few live streaming sites"" have taken steps to stop potential child abusers. Fortnite has upwards of 45m players, he says, and children underneath the age rating of 12 can join and provide their email addresses as age verification is not performed by the game. He says there should be an ""independent regulator"" as ""every"" attempt at self regulation has ""failed"". Children's Social Care Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow families minister Emma Lewell-Buck - who was a children's social worker before becoming an MP - says the system is failing children and parents. ""The scale of this neglect toward our most vulnerable children is colossal"", she says - with an ""unprecedented rate of referrals"" and falling numbers of foster carers. 41% of children's services are now unable to meet their statutory duties, she says, with 140,000 children on the fringe of services and not receiving the care they need. ""Children in desperate need of care are being neglected"", she says, quoting Conservative MPs who are warning of a ""fast approaching Baby P tragedy"". She says the children's minister has ignored her concerns repeatedly, adding: ""it is clear to everybody except this government that their department lacks a cohesive strategy and is consumed by piecemeal, misguided measures."" ""At the moment, the idea that every child matters could not be further from the reality"". Children's Social Care Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Laura Smith says respite care is an important aspect of children's social care: ""everybody needs a break sometimes, and nobody more so than someone who is caring for a loved one with complex needs"". Many children's care services are provided by charities reliant on ever-decreasing government funding, forcing both organisations and parents to ""battle"" for survival, she says. ""I am a warrior, but I just want to be a mum"", she quotes one constituent whose disabled child is supported by children's social care services. She says the government must address the Â£3bn shortfall in social care funding, urging ministers to ""put children at the heart of the upcoming spending review"". Technology and young people's health debate House of LordsParliament The Bishop of St Albans says that children see gambling adverts on the internet and TV. ""Digital natives"" are ""most at risk"" from the ""digital switch that the gambling industry"" is currently undergoing, he says. He warns that young people can follow gambling sites without age verification. Technology and young people's health debate House of LordsParliament The Lords have now moved onto their final debate today, on the use of technology and the health and wellbeing of young people. Crossbencher Baroness Kidron says that it is ""ludicrous"" that 61% of children under the minimum Facebook age of 13 have an account, and that Twitter has ""half a million pornographic images posted to it daily, despite it being a news app"". Labour peer Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall says that all technology has ""good sides and bad sides"". Children's Social Care House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Lyn Brown says 60% cuts to children's services have made it ""so much harder"" for organisations to work with vulnerable children and families ""effectively and early"". It costs more money when you take a child into care than preventing a child from going into care, she says, referring to the cuts as a ""massive mistake"". She adds that 130,000 children were homeless over Christmas, most put up in temporary accommodation and ""torn from schools, families and support networks"". Ms Brown says the government must ""do more"" to help vulnerable children in society, and this should be something all MPs should push towards together. Children's Social Care House of CommonsParliament Opening the debate, Conservative MP Tim Loughton says children's social care is the sort of ""bread and butter"" issue that Parliament ""should be spending more time on"". He says government data shows the number of looked-after children is ""at its highest ever,"" and in early 2018 there were 75,420 children in care in the UK. More children are coming into care with more complex problems, he adds, noting that it is ""an impending crisis"". Mr Loughton says more money needs to be invested in children's social care, as it costs ""about Â£56,000 a year"" to look after a child in care, and at the minute there is ""a significant shortfall of funding"", with poorer areas ""most affected"". ""We are failing to do enough early to prevent babies having to be taken into care because their parents have not had enough support"", he adds. Brexit referendum legislation debate House of LordsParliament Brexit Minister Lord Callanan says the 2016 referendum was ""historic"" because of the high turnout. He says it is the government's ""firm view"" that there can be no second vote, which he adds would ""disrespect"" the result of the first referendum. ""There has been no significant change in public opinion"", he says. Labour's Lord Adonis asks if the Cabinet Office is making secret preparations for a second referendum. Lord Callanan responds: ""it is a matter of firm government policy that we will not be holding another referendum"". Brexit referendum legislation debate House of LordsParliament Opposition spokeswoman Baroness Wheeler says while it may seem ""premature"", it is good that these questions are being raised by members of the Lords today. She says that there is a ""significant letter"" in The Times today from 127 business leaders who are calling for a second referendum. The priority for Labour at the moment, she says, is to try and ""find a way through the impasse"". She says she hopes that the government will not fall back on the ""usual responses"" that a second referendum would be an ""assault to democracy"" in their response this afternoon. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has previously claimed the reports were ""made up"" Activists in Russia say there has been a new crackdown against LGBT people in Chechnya. The Russian LGBT Network believes about 40 people have been imprisoned since December - two of whom they say have died under torture. The group has been monitoring alleged abuses in the mainly Muslim Russian republic since 2017 when dozens of gay people were reportedly detained. A government spokesman has dismissed their latest report as ""complete lies"". Chechnya, and its authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov, has consistently denied allegations of illegal detentions and human rights abuses. In an interview with the BBC last year, Mr Kadyrov said the allegations were ""an invention by foreign agents"" or created by activists looking for money. Homophobia is widespread in the highly conservative and predominantly Muslim Russian republic. Mr Kadyrov and other government figures have repeatedly claimed Chechnya has no gay population at all. Ramzan Kadyrov: Putin's key Chechen ally Chechnya uses 'televised shamings' Canada grants asylum to LGBT Chechens Despite official denials, dozens have come forward and alleged they were detained and tortured by authorities because of their sexual orientation. The reports have drawn condemnation from around the world. The Russian LGBT Network, an activist group, has been monitoring the situation in Chechnya and working to evacuate people from the region since reports of the crackdown emerged in 2017. In a statement released on Monday,the group alleged a fresh wave of persecution and abuses had been unleashed in recent weeks,external. This video can not be played Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov is questioned by the BBC's Sarah Rainsford on the region's human rights record They believe the latest wave was sparked by the arrest of an administrator of an online LGBT group on the social media network VKontakte. Recent posts on the network have allegedly told LGBT people to ""run away from the republic as soon as possible"", according to reports in Russian media. Gay Chechens flee threats, beatings and exorcism Activists believe dozens have been taken in recent weeks to a detention centre near Argun - a town 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. ""We know of around 40 people who have been detained, but it may be more. It's also unclear at this point how many have since been freed. We know that does happen, when people are handed over to their families to 'deal with',"" Igor Kochetkov, the head of the group, told the BBC. He said it had helped more than 140 people escape the region since the persecution began. The group had evidence, including from witnesses, that two detainees had died under torture, including one from knife wounds, he said. Mr Kochetkov also said that police were now seizing detainees' travel documents. ""Everything is being done so that they can't flee the country,"" he told the Moscow Times,external. ""And this is very bad for us because it makes our work much more difficult in terms of evacuation."" The reports have not been independently verified by the BBC. The allegations have led to protests around the world, like this at Russia's London embassy in 2017 Last month a report by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) concluded that ""very serious human rights violations"" had occurred in the republic. The report was compiled using evidence including survivor testimony - and made allegations of harassment, persecution, torture, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings of minorities, including LGBT people. It identified a ""climate of impunity"" and called on Russia to investigate the abuse. On Monday, a spokesman for the Chechen government told the Kremlin-backed RT website that the latest allegations were untruthful. ""If even a single person were arrested, let alone 40, the entire Chechen public would have known. The claim that two were killed is even more absurd,"" Alvi Kraimov said. One victim of the 2017 crackdown spoke anonymously to the BBCabout his experience of detainment. He said he was subjected to torture - including electric shocks and beatings. This video can not be played 'Ruslan', a gay man who says he fled: ""It's the extermination of gay men"" ""They have a special black box and they attach wires to your hands or ears. The pain is awful. It's terrible torture,"" Ruslan (not his real name) said. Former detainees have spoken of being pressured to give the names of others during beatings.

"Forget what might happen when the tellers read out the numbers on Tuesday night, let's think about what's at stake. With Brexit, it's nearly always subjective, but according to MPs and ministers of different flavours, these are some of the factors that matter and that the result might influence. Disagree at will of course - you may read these and scoff, or you may even have your own. But the meaningful vote may well end up having multiple meanings... Don't let British people down, May tells MPs Possible amendments to PM's Brexit deal Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit 1)Let's start with the least likely outcome. A miracle could take place overnight and scores of MPs might suddenly find themselves swinging behind the prime minister's plan. The vote goes through, she shouts hurray, and the process moves on smoothly. We leave the EU as planned in less than three months, and Theresa May's place in history is secure (no laughing at the back). 2)The defeat is disastrous and a combination of pressure from some ministers and MPs forces the PM to reach across the aisle. Depending on the scale of the defeat, and the reaction of Labour front and backbenchers, Westminster might be ushered into a different phase of bargaining across the benches. One Labour MP told me today: ""At some stage I will vote for the deal, but I will need something specific to show for it. We are about to enter an era of transactional politics."" Cross-party working may not be some kind of high-minded pursuit. 3)The scale of the likely loss might prompt the kind of parliamentary takeover that's been much discussed in the last couple of days. Arguably this might be one of the most long-lasting impacts. Rewriting the parliamentary rulebook may inevitably be largely of interest to nerds like me, but the kind of suggestions these extraordinary times are prompting might reshape the relationship between the government and MPs for years to come - and that matters. 4)Given that the balance in Parliament is definitely for a softer Brexit with closer ties to the EU, (arguably) the defeat on Tuesday might lead to a less dramatic break with the EU than the deal on the table promises. One member of the cabinet tonight told me: ""The longer this goes on, the softer Brexit gets."" Before you scream, I know that is not a view that is shared universally. But it is sincerely held by plenty of people around the place who point rather frustratedly to the irony. As another member of cabinet said: ""The hardline Brexiteers will push us toward a softer Brexit by digging in their resistance."" 5)Technically speaking, if you don't assume (and assumptions are dangerous) that Parliament can and would block no deal, the rejection of the plan would move us closer to leaving without a deal. That's not just because Eurosceptics are showing very little sign of budging, but remember the process is on a clock. Article 50 has to come to a conclusion by the end of March and, as the law currently stands, we are leaving with or without an agreement. Some other ministers in the cabinet believe very firmly once the vote is lost the PM has not much choice other than to up no-deal prep again in the hope, not of going that way, but of trying for another EU concession. One told me it is the ""only logical conclusion"" to keep going steadily and hope the EU will break - a continuation of the high-stakes poker game. 6)Jeremy Corbyn will either delight or disappoint his ranks by having the bottle to force a confidence vote, or delaying again, waiting for a magic moment. But he seems unlikely to take the bold step many of his members want and to move to offering another referendum. 7)For those campaigning for another European referendum, too, the scale of the defeat, and Tuesday night's front bench responses to it, are vital. The outcome of the vote will affect whether we leave the EU on time, and less likely, whether we could be given another say on whether we leave at all. And when those truths eventually reveal themselves, they in turn could have an impact on the fabric of the UK itself. What happens in Northern Ireland, or to the case for Scottish independence, are part of what is at stake in the long term. 8)Lastly, after more than two years of endless discussions, as and when the vote goes down on this hard-fought compromise, Westminster's factions and rival camps might finally have to do more than talk amongst themselves, and actually bend or break. The divisions are so intense in both the main political parties that it could also be the moment some of the divisions turn into real splits. That really would be history happening in front of our eyes.
