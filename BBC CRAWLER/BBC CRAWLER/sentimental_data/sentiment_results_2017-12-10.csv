"A towering model of a Star Wars attack vehicle stood at the entrance to the theatre Stormtroopers, an AT-AT Walker and a panoply of droids brought the Star Wars universe to downtown Los Angeles at the premiere of The Last Jedi. The much-anticipated first screening of the franchise's latest episode was dedicated to the late Carrie Fisher, who died last December aged 60. Fisher, playing General Leia, finished work on the movie before her death. Writer-director Rian Johnson opened the screening with a tribute, urging fans to ""have a blast... for Carrie"". ""I want to dedicate tonight to Carrie, who is up there right now flipping me the bird, saying 'Damn it Rian, don't you dare make this night a solemn tribute,'"" said Johnson, who brought the stars of the film onstage to introduce it. Actors Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie and Domhnall Gleeson were applauded at the premiere Carrie Fisher died last December after completing her work on the movie Formal reviews of the film have been embargoed until later in the week, but guests at the premiere have already been pouring out their thoughts on social media. Joshus Yehl, editor of IGN Comics, said he gasped, laughed, screamed and cried at what might be ""the best Star Wars movie ever"". Allow Twitter content?

Grae Drake, a senior editor with movie and TV review site Rotten Tomatoes, described it as ""as epic and sweeping as all the other films combined"" with moments ""that will make your head pop off"" - in a good way. Film critic Scott Mantz said The last Jedi was ""a little too long and dragged in the middle"", but said it was a ""worthy Episode VIII"" - and that Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill was ""awesome"". Meanwhile, Mark Hamill himself referenced the lyrics to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with a tweet from the auditorium, ending with a plea to fans to ""keep the secrets of VIII"". Daisy Ridley: I deleted my social media Princes William and Harry are stormtroopers in Last Jedi Last Jedi: Four big questions we want answers to Fisher given 'amazing' send-off in Last Jedi Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Episode VIII in the movie franchise that started in 1977) follows on from the 2015 film The Force Awakens, and opens with the Resistance trying to fight off Supreme Leader Snoke's First Order, which is trying to take over the galaxy. Meanwhile, leading character Rey (Daisy Ridley) is trying to persuade Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to join the Resistance fight and bring a spark of hope to the rebels. Daisy Ridley met fans and signed autographs on the red carpet ""There hasn't been a Star Wars movie yet that has explored war the way The Last Jedi has,"" said John Boyega, who plays the heroic stormtrooper-turned-rebel Finn. ""It's very messy. The categorising of good and evil is all mixed together."" Oscar Isaac, who plays X-wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron, added: ""It's a dire situation, it's critical. The Resistance is on its last legs. ""When you're trying to survive, the First Order's right on top of us, it is like war, where you've got to keep moving to try to survive. You feel the momentum of everything that happened in The Force Awakens just pushing to a critical mass."" Experts are predicting the movie - which opens on 15 December - will gross about $220m (Â£164m) on its opening weekend in the United States. That would push it into second place on the all-time list, ahead of Jurassic World but behind 2015's The Force Awakens, which made some $248m on its opening weekend. Longtime characters R2-D2 and C-3PO were among the droids represented on the red carpet Gwendoline Christie, who plays stormtrooper commander Captain Phasma, said the franchise had an enduring appeal. ""I think it's because the world we live in is a changing and evolving place that it retains the simplicity of those elements,"" she said. ""But it really resonates with what it is to follow your own human, dark, narcissistic tendencies, where that will take you.""

"This video can not be played David Davis: ""No deal means we won't be paying the money"" Brexit Secretary David Davis says the UK wants to secure a free-trade deal with no tariffs when it leaves the EU. He described it as ""Canada plus plus plus"" - a reference to the free trade deal struck between Canada and the EU. But unlike the Canada deal, he wants financial services included in the tariff-free area, he told Andrew Marr. Labour says the UK should ""stay aligned"" to the EU after Brexit and could pay to access the single market like Norway. Gove says voters can change Brexit deal 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks Reality Check: Theresa May's deal with Brussels So, did 'soft Brexit' just win? The Conservatives claim this would ""mean billions of pounds going to the EU in perpetuity"" and the UK ""being forced to obey rules over which we have no say"". Canada's deal with the EU, signed last year, removes the vast majority of customs duties on EU exports to Canada and Canadian exports to the EU but without paying for access to the single market. But Mr Davis said he wanted a ""bespoke"" deal with the EU and was aiming for ""overarching"" agreement with no tariffs, that included the service industries - which are a key part of the British economy. Referring to some of the EU's trade deals, he said: ""We'll probably start with the best of Canada, and the best of Japan and the best of South Korea and then add to that the bits that are missing which is the services."" He said the odds of the UK exiting without a deal had ""dropped dramatically"" following Friday's joint EU-UK statement in Brussels. But he stressed that the deal struck by Theresa May on Friday to move to the next phase of talks was a ""statement of intent"" and not ""legally enforceable"". And if the UK failed to get a trade deal with the EU then it would not pay its divorce bill, which the Treasury says will be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn. But the Irish government said that as far as it was concerned the agreement signed on Friday between the EU and the UK was binding. ""The European Union will be holding the United Kingdom to account,"" the Irish government's chief whip told RTE. ""My question to anybody within the British government would be, why would there be an agreement, a set of principled agreements, in order to get to phase two, if they weren't going to be held up? That just sounds bizarre to me,"" Joe McHugh told RTE Radio's This Week. Mr Davis stressed in his Marr interview that the UK was committed to keeping a ""frictionless and invisible"" Irish border and it would ""find a way"" to do this if there was a ""no deal"" Brexit. Mrs May signedan agreement,externalon Friday ruling out the return of a ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland, protecting the rights of EU and UK citizens and agreeing a formula for the divorce bill. EU leaders are now expected to recommend starting the next phase of Brexit talks at a summit on Thursday. Mr Davis stressed Friday's agreement was conditional on getting a trade deal, agreements on security and foreign affairs, as well as the two-year transition period the UK wants after if officially leaves the EU in March 2019. Friday's agreement includes a fallback position if the UK fails to get a trade deal, which proposes full regulatory ""alignment"" between the EU and the UK. This clause had been diluted at the insistence of the Democratic Unionist Party, which fears Northern Ireland would be separated from the rest of the UK, and move closer to Ireland, if it had to adopt EU rules to keep goods flowing across the border. But there is still controversy, and confusion, over what ""full alignment"" would mean in practice, with some Brexiteers fearing the UK would have to continue to abide by EU regulations on agriculture and other issues after Brexit and would not be able to strike its own trade deals. Mr Davis has said ""full alignment"" would apply to the whole of the UK, not just Northern Ireland, butthe Sunday Telegraph said,externalConservative Brexiteers had been reassured that it was ""non-binding"" and had been included to secure Ireland's backing for the deal. Pushed to explain what it meant, Mr Davis told Andrew Marr: ""We want to protect the peace process and we also want to protect Ireland from the impact of Brexit for them. This was a statement of intent more than anything else."" The Labour party has ruled out remaining in the EU single market and customs union if it wins power. But the party's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted a partnership with the EU that ""retains the benefits of the single market and the customs union"". Labour's Sir Keir Starmer suggested the UK could pay for single market access The EU has asked for more clarity from the UK on what it wants from trade talks. But today it was the opposition who gave more details than ever before. So far Labour has said, if in power, it would stay in the single market and customs union in a transition period. But now the shadow Brexit secretary has talked about the benefits of staying in alignment with the EU in the longer term. And he has even suggested he'd be willing to pay for the type of single market access that Norway enjoys. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has raised the possibility of staying in a form of customs union. That might restrict the ability to do global trade deals but - as she puts it - she doesn't want to ""kybosh"" trade with the EU. For the Conservatives in the short term it's a political gift - they can portray Labour as rule takers who are prepared to pay far more to Brussels than their divorce settlement. But it's more likely a sign that ""creative ambiguity"" across the political spectrum could be unsustainable when serious trade talks begin.

"This video can not be played Protests in Beirut turn ugly again Israel's prime minister has said Palestinians must ""get to grips with"" the reality that Jerusalem is Israel's capital in order to move towards peace. Benjamin Netanyahu said Jerusalem had been the capital of Israel for 3,000 years and had ""never been the capital of any other people"". He spoke amid ongoing protests in the Muslim and Arab world at a US decision recognising Jerusalem as the capital. Violence flared near the US embassy in Lebanon and elsewhere on Sunday. In Jerusalem itself, a Palestinian was arrested after stabbing and seriously wounding an Israeli security guard at the central bus station. This video can not be played Netanyahu: Paris is the capital of France, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel Speaking in Paris after talks with French President Emmanuel Macron, Mr Netanyahu said efforts to deny the ""millennial connection of the Jewish people to Jerusalem"" were ""absurd"". ""You can read it in a very fine book - it's called the Bible,"" he said. ""You can read it after the Bible. You can hear it in the history of Jewish communities throughout our diaspora... Where else is the capital of Israel, but in Jerusalem? ""The sooner the Palestinians come to grips with this reality, the sooner we will move towards peace."" Meanwhile a spokesman for the US Vice-President, Mike Pence, strongly criticised the Palestinian Authority, saying it was ""unfortunate"" that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was declining to meet Mr Pence on his forthcoming trip to the region. In Egypt, the country's top Muslim and Christian clerics have also cancelled scheduled talks with Mr Pence in protest at the US move. There has been widespread condemnation of President Donald Trump's decision - announced on Wednesday - to reverse decades of US neutrality on the status of Jerusalem which cuts to the heart of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. The city is home to key religious sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity, especially in East Jerusalem. Israel has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Sunday has seen a further raft of protests at the US move: In Beirut, riot police used teargas and water cannon to stop hundreds of protestersfrom reaching the US embassy Further protests took place in Cairo and Rabat, the Moroccan capital In the Palestinian territories themselves protests continued while Israel said it had blown up a tunnel from Gaza, which it says was being dug to enable militant attacks Thousands of people demonstrated outside the US embassy in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, some waving banners reading ""Palestine is in our hearts"" A burning object was thrown at a synagogue in the Swedish city of Gothenburg late on Saturday in what police said was a failed arson attempt US allies round on Trump over Jerusalem How are capital cities chosen and what do they represent? In Turkey, President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan told a large rally in Istanbul he would not abandon Jerusalem to a state that ""kills children"". Mr Netanyahu said the Turkish leader had ""attacked Israel"". ""I'm not used to receiving lectures about morality from a leader who bombs Kurdish villages in his native Turkey, who jails journalists, helps Iran go around international sanctions and who helps terrorists, including in Gaza, kill innocent people,"" he added. Mr ErdoÄan has described Jerusalem as a ""red line"" issue for Muslims and warned Turkey could end up severing diplomatic ties with Israel over the issue. Turkey and Israel only restored diplomatic relations last year, six years after Turkey cut ties in protest at the killing of nine pro-Palestinian Turkish activists in clashes with Israeli commandos on board a ship trying to break Israel's naval blockade of Gaza.

"Germany's domestic intelligence agency says China used Linkedin to target at least 10,000 people China is using fake LinkedIn profiles to gather information on German officials and politicians, the German intelligence agency (BfV) has said. The agency alleges that Chinese intelligence used the networking site to target at least 10,000 Germans, possibly to recruit them as informants. It released a number of fake profiles allegedly used for this purpose. BfV head Hans-Georg Maassen said the accounts show China's efforts to subvert top-level German politics. ""This is a broad-based attempt to infiltrate in particular parliaments, ministries and government agencies,"" he said. Social media shown as evidence of 'Russian trolls' China has denied similar allegations of cyber espionage in the past and has not yet responded to the German allegation. The BfV published eight of what they say are the most active profiles used to contact German LinkedIn users. They are designed to look enticing to other users, and promote young Chinese professionals  -who do not exist. Spy chief Hans-Georg Maassen says the accounts show an attempt to infiltrate German politics Some of the accounts include ""Allen Liu"", said to be a human resources manager at an economic consultancy, and ""Lily Wu"", who reportedly works at a think tank in eastern China. The BfV says both accounts are fake. The agency is increasingly worried that Chinese intelligence is using the method to recruit high-ranking politicians as informants. They asked users who believed they had been targeted by suspect accounts to contact them. Last year, the BfV said they had detected ""increasingly aggressive cyber-espionage"" including ""intensifying"" attempts to influence September's parliamentary elections. They said the hacker group known as ""Fancy Bear"" or APT28 was especially active - and it is believed to be controlled by the Russian state. Social media data shared by spy agencies Turkey 'spied' on opponents in Germany German intelligence employee arrested Russian hackers 'threaten Germany vote' Russia 'behind German parliament hack' Germany facing 'very serious' threat.

"Georgia Toffolo has been named the winner of this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here. The shocked reality star, known as Toff, was crowned by Ant and Dec on Sunday evening after more than nine million votes were cast. She was odds-on favourite to win the ITV show, but said: ""I am so taken aback. Is this real?"" Former Hollyoaks star Jamie Lomas came in second place, with radio and TV presenter Iain Lee coming in third. Toff, 23, is known for appearing on E4's Made in Chelsea, joining in the seventh series. She also works for The Lady magazine and is head of events for think tank Parliament Street. The I'm A Celebrity final attracted an average of 9.2 million live viewers on Sunday night. It was ITV's third biggest audience of the year - behind the series' launch show and the One Love Manchester concert - with a 41% share of the total TV audience. The Strictly Come Dancing results show earlier in the night had more viewers however, with an average of 11.1 million viewers; while the final episode of Blue Planet II attracted an audience of 10.36m. Jamie Lomas came second in the ITV series Toff's fellow campmate Stanley Johnson - father of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - said: ""I knew she was going to make it. I said right from the start that Toff is the one."" The winner said her favourite moment of the show was going to collect water with Johnson, with whom she struck up a strong friendship. She follows in the footsteps of previous Queens of the Jungle Scarlett Moffatt and Vicky Pattinson. Moffatt, who won last year's series, said: ""It's girls like you that make me feel proud to be a young woman. I am so proud of you."" Iain Lee was voted into third place by the public After her win, Toff welcomed the prospect of earning money on the back of her appearance on the show, admitting: ""I haven't paid my rent."" She told Good Morning Britain's Susanna Reid and Piers Morgan she wanted to take a shot at presenting, saying: ""I want to do what you guys do. I want to try it. Who knows?""

"This video can not be played Ben Rich updates the situation on the California wildfires The most destructive wildfire raging in southern California has expanded significantly, scorching an area larger than New York City. The Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties has consumed 230,000 acres (930 sq km) in the past week. Fanned by strong winds, it has become the fifth largest wildfire in recorded state history after it grew by more than 50,000 acres in a day. Residents in coastal beach communities have been ordered to leave. Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast On Sunday, firefighters reported that 15% of the blaze had been contained but were forced to downgrade that to 10% as it continued to spread. ""This is a menacing fire, certainly, but we have a lot of people working very diligently to bring it under control,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said. Thousands of firefighters are working round the clock to tackle the blaze, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The containment operation is not only being hampered by dry winds. It is proving challenging for firefighters because of the location and mountainous terrain. Firefighters face challenging conditions to contain the Thomas fire An analyst with the California fire protection department, Tim Chavez, said the emergency services were struggling because ""a hot interior"" was in parts practically meeting the ocean, making access difficult. ""It's just a very difficult place to fight fire,"" Mr Chavez said, adding: ""It's very dangerous and has a historical record of multiple fatalities occurring over the years."" Powerful pictures of the fires Flames seen from space The other fires hitting California are largely controlled, but 200,000 people have evacuated their homes and some 800 buildings have been destroyed since 4 December. This video can not be played The Thomas fire has the potential to be one of the worst in California's history Evacuation orders were issued overnight on Sunday for parts of Carpinteria close to Los Padres National Forest, about 100 miles (160km) northwest of Los Angeles. Forecasters said wind speeds were expected to increase throughout the day, before dying down again overnight. The local fire department tweeted pictures of a wall of flames advancing on homes on the outskirts of Carpinteria early on Sunday morning. Allow Twitter content?

California has spent the past seven days battling wildfires. Six large blazes, and other smaller ones, erupted on Monday night in southern California. The Thomas Fire - named according to where it started, near the Thomas Aquinas College - is by far the largest of the fires. They swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours, driven by extreme weather, including low humidity, high winds and parched ground. The authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"", while US President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency. On Saturday, California Governor Jerry Brown described the situation as ""the new normal"" and predicted vast fires, fuelled by climate change, ""could happen every year or every few years"". Several firefighters have been injured, but only one person has died - a 70-year-old woman who was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. There are also fears the blaze will seriously hit California's multi-million dollar agricultural industry.

"Boris Johnson concluded his visit to Iran with a meeting with President Rouhani UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has had a ""worthwhile visit"" to Iran and met President Hassan Rouhani on a second day of talks in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said both ""spoke forthrightly"" on several issues, including the case of jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The mother-of-one has been held in Iran since April 2016 on charges of spying, which she denies. She was not required to appear at an expected court case on Sunday. It had been thought she would appear in court on fresh charges, but her husband Richard Ratcliffe has confirmed that the case was not held. ""Of course, one swallow doesn't make a Christmas - Nazanin is not yet on a plane. But it is good to have at least a swallow in the sky,"" he said. The head of Iran's Revolution Court, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, confirmed no court hearing was held for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on Sunday. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift On Saturday Mr Johnson urged his Iranian counterpart to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals on humanitarian grounds. In two hours of talks, Mr Johnson and Mohammed Javad Zarif also discussed ""the obligations of all parties to implement the nuclear deal"", Iran's foreign ministry said. US President Donald Trump has made his opposition to the deal, struck in 2015, very clear and has threatened to scrap it. But the UK continues to support it. In October when Mr Trump threatened to tear the deal apart, the UK, France and Germany said it was ""in our shared national security interest"" that its arrangements continued. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife's release, said he hoped Mr Johnson would be ""persuasive and charming and build a good relationship"". It is thought that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces a possible court appearance later on new charges. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the president's powers were limited because he is not Iran's supreme leader. Analysis by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins The mere fact of Boris Johnson spending nearly an hour with President Hassan Rouhani can be seen as a positive. The Foreign Office says a ""full range of issues"" were discussed including ""concerns about the consular cases of dual nationals"". Banking matters were also on the agenda, including: An outstanding debt of Â£400m owed by Britain to Iran. Britain says the money is ready to be paid when a method of doing so can be found which doesn't break international sanctions Iranian anger that no British bank will open an account for Iran's embassy in London Iran's judgement that British banks and businesses are dragging their feet getting involved in Iran after the relaxation of many restrictions with the signing of the nuclear deal Neither side is linking any of this to the appeal for prison releases, but the Foreign Office said the delegation was leaving Iran with a sense that both sides ""wanted to resolve the difficult issues in the relationship"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested on a visit to see her parents with her infant daughter Gabriella. After the arrest, her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months the three-year-old has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. Iran does not recognise Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's dual citizenship and will not allow UK representatives to see her in prison. The case was further complicated when Mr Johnson told a parliamentary committee in November that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to train journalists. The foreign secretary laterapologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Last month, the Free Nazanin Campaign saidMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had suffered panic attacks, insomnia, bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and had been given a health assessment. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe doesn't expect his wife will be released immediately On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe said he believed the foreign secretary's presence in Iran would ""make a difference"", but the situation remained very unclear. ""It's all up in the air,"" he said. ""We're holding on to the good bits - it could go any which way. ""Fingers crossed it can be solved by Christmas, which means in the week or so afterwards there might be a happy outcome."" This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) The Foreign Office would not confirm the names or number of other dual nationals being held, saying their families had asked for their cases to be kept out of the public domain. Relations between the UK and Iran have long been difficult. Mr Johnson's visit is only the third by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

"Ican's executive director Beatrice Fihn (right) said nuclear disaster may be a ""tantrum away"" The world faces a ""nuclear crisis"" from a ""bruised ego"", the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) has warned in an apparent reference to US-North Korea tensions. Accepting the Nobel Peace Prize on Sunday, Ican's executive director Beatrice Fihn said ""the deaths of millions may be one tiny tantrum away"". ""We have a choice, the end of nuclear weapons or the end of us,"" she added. Tensions over North Korea's weapons programme have risen in recent months. The open hostility between US President Donald Trump and the North Korean leadership under Kim Jong-un has at times descended into personal attacks this year. Ican award sends nuclear message Who are the Nobel Peace Prize winners? Speaking at the ceremony in Oslo, Ms Fihn said ""a moment of panic"" could lead to the ""destruction of cities and the deaths of millions of civilians"" from nuclear weapons. The risk of such weapons being used, she added, was ""greater today than during the Cold War"". Ican, a coalition of hundreds of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), has worked for a treaty to ban the weapons. Prior to presenting the prize on Sunday, Nobel committee chair Berit Reiss-Andersen offered a similar warning, saying that ""irresponsible leaders can come to power in any nuclear state"". Ms Reiss-Andersen commended Ican which, she said, had succeeded in highlighting the dangers of nuclear weapons as well as trying to eradicate them. Ms Fihn (left) speaks with Hiroshima nuclear bombing survivor Setsuko Thurlow Ms Reiss-Andersen also acknowledged the contributions of Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the Hiroshima atomic bombing and now an Ican campaigner. Ms Thurlow, who was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building at the time, said that most of her classmates, who were in the same room, were burned alive. ""Processions of ghostly figures shuffled by,"" she said on Sunday. ""Grotesquely wounded people, they were bleeding, burnt, blackened and swollen."" In pictures: Hiroshima, the first atomic bomb Nobel winners throughout the years Mr Trump has warned that North Korea's government will be ""utterly destroyed"" if war breaks out. White House national security adviser HR McMaster said last week that the potential for war with North Korea was increasing every day. In November, Pyongyang said it had tested a missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and reaching the whole of continental United States. North Korea: What could tip the balance? What we know about new NK missile Trump and North Korea war of words Ican, formed in 2007 and inspired by a similar campaign to ban the use of landmines, has made it its mission to highlight the humanitarian risk of nuclear weapons. A coalition of hundreds of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), the Geneva-based group helped pave the way for the introduction of a UN treaty banning the weapons, which was signed this year. While 122 countries backed the treaty in July, the talks were notably boycotted by the world's nine known nuclear powers and the only Nato member to discuss it, the Netherlands, voted against. Only three countries, the Holy See, Guyana and Thailand, have so far ratified the treaty, which requires 50 ratifications to come into force.

"BAE makes the Eurofighter Typhoon at its Warton plant A Â£6bn deal to sell Eurofighter Typhoons to Qatar will help safeguard thousands of UK jobs. BAE Systems employs about 5,000 people in the UK to build the fighter jets, mainly at Warton in Lancashire. Qatar's purchase of 24 jets includes a support and training package from BAE, with deliveries due to start in 2022. The deal was announced in Doha by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and his Qatari counterpart, Khalid bin Mohammed al Attiyah. Mr Williamson said it was a ""massive vote of confidence, supporting thousands of British jobs and injecting billions into our economy"". An RAF Typhoon at the Akrotiri base in Cyprus BAE chief executive Charles Woodburn said the contract, worth Â£5bn to the company, was the start of a long-term relationship with Qatar and its armed forces. ""This agreement is a strong endorsement of Typhoon's leading capabilities and underlines BAE Systems' long track record of working in successful partnership with our customers,"" he said. The Typhoon entered service with the RAF in 2007 to replace the ageing Tornado fleet.

The UK's deal with Qatar also includes an agreement with MBDA for Brimstone and Meteor missiles and Raytheon's Paveway IV laser-guided bomb. Qatar signed a letter of intent in September to buy the 24 jets from BAE. It is the ninth country to buy the Typhoon, with other customers including Saudi Arabia. Talks about a second batch of sales to the kingdom are ongoing.

"A towering model of a Star Wars attack vehicle stood at the entrance to the theatre Stormtroopers, an AT-AT Walker and a panoply of droids brought the Star Wars universe to downtown Los Angeles at the premiere of The Last Jedi. The much-anticipated first screening of the franchise's latest episode was dedicated to the late Carrie Fisher, who died last December aged 60. Fisher, playing General Leia, finished work on the movie before her death. Writer-director Rian Johnson opened the screening with a tribute, urging fans to ""have a blast... for Carrie"". ""I want to dedicate tonight to Carrie, who is up there right now flipping me the bird, saying 'Damn it Rian, don't you dare make this night a solemn tribute,'"" said Johnson, who brought the stars of the film onstage to introduce it. Actors Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie and Domhnall Gleeson were applauded at the premiere Carrie Fisher died last December after completing her work on the movie Formal reviews of the film have been embargoed until later in the week, but guests at the premiere have already been pouring out their thoughts on social media.

"Aaron Reilly (left) and Joshua Brock and were found unconscious at the Pryzm nightclub in Plymouth Tributes have been paid to two 19-year-old men who died after apparently taking drugs at a nightclub. Aaron Reilly and Joshua Brock were found unconscious at Pryzm in Plymouth in the early hours of Saturday, The teenagers, who police said thought they were taking ecstasy, died later in hospital. The club was evacuated and an 18-year-old man was arrested by Devon and Cornwall Police. He has been released under investigation, the force said. More on this story, and other Devon and Cornwall news The family of Mr Reilly, from Newton Abbot, described him as ""a much-loved son, brother, grandson and boyfriend"" who loved skateboarding and playing computer games. His younger brother Kian said: ""My brother was one of the most responsible people I ever knew and everything he achieved I was so proud of, but I was so envious of his talent. ""I can't believe he was taken from me and my family from one silly mistake, just trying to have fun on a night out with his best mates."" Hundreds of young people had been attending a gig by the Swedish dance artist Basshunter when the pair collapsed Mr Brock, from Okehampton, was described as ""a loving son to Steve and Sandra, an inspirational brother to Liam and Demelza and a loyal mate to all his friends"".

"Claire Hart was shot with daughter Charlotte days after leaving her husband Luke Hart could never have foreseen his ""controlling"" father would kill his mother and sister in July 2016. Claire Hart, 50, was shot dead outside a swimming pool in Spalding, Lincs, with daughter Charlotte, 19, days after finally moving out of the family house. Luke and the other surviving brother Ryan say dangers can easily be missed. They spoke as figures showed more than 113 women in England, Northern Ireland and Wales in 2016 were killed by men - two thirds a current or ex-partner. TheFemicide Census,external, based on information from police and media reports, found 85 of the 113 women killed by men last year were in their own homes.

"A towering model of a Star Wars attack vehicle stood at the entrance to the theatre Stormtroopers, an AT-AT Walker and a panoply of droids brought the Star Wars universe to downtown Los Angeles at the premiere of The Last Jedi. The much-anticipated first screening of the franchise's latest episode was dedicated to the late Carrie Fisher, who died last December aged 60. Fisher, playing General Leia, finished work on the movie before her death. Writer-director Rian Johnson opened the screening with a tribute, urging fans to ""have a blast... for Carrie"". ""I want to dedicate tonight to Carrie, who is up there right now flipping me the bird, saying 'Damn it Rian, don't you dare make this night a solemn tribute,'"" said Johnson, who brought the stars of the film onstage to introduce it. Actors Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Gwendoline Christie and Domhnall Gleeson were applauded at the premiere Carrie Fisher died last December after completing her work on the movie Formal reviews of the film have been embargoed until later in the week, but guests at the premiere have already been pouring out their thoughts on social media. Joshus Yehl, editor of IGN Comics, said he gasped, laughed, screamed and cried at what might be ""the best Star Wars movie ever"". Allow Twitter content?

Grae Drake, a senior editor with movie and TV review site Rotten Tomatoes, described it as ""as epic and sweeping as all the other films combined"" with moments ""that will make your head pop off"" - in a good way. Film critic Scott Mantz said The last Jedi was ""a little too long and dragged in the middle"", but said it was a ""worthy Episode VIII"" - and that Luke Skywalker actor Mark Hamill was ""awesome"". Meanwhile, Mark Hamill himself referenced the lyrics to the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band with a tweet from the auditorium, ending with a plea to fans to ""keep the secrets of VIII"". Daisy Ridley: I deleted my social media Princes William and Harry are stormtroopers in Last Jedi Last Jedi: Four big questions we want answers to Fisher given 'amazing' send-off in Last Jedi Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Episode VIII in the movie franchise that started in 1977) follows on from the 2015 film The Force Awakens, and opens with the Resistance trying to fight off Supreme Leader Snoke's First Order, which is trying to take over the galaxy. Meanwhile, leading character Rey (Daisy Ridley) is trying to persuade Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to join the Resistance fight and bring a spark of hope to the rebels. Daisy Ridley met fans and signed autographs on the red carpet ""There hasn't been a Star Wars movie yet that has explored war the way The Last Jedi has,"" said John Boyega, who plays the heroic stormtrooper-turned-rebel Finn. ""It's very messy. The categorising of good and evil is all mixed together."" Oscar Isaac, who plays X-wing fighter pilot Poe Dameron, added: ""It's a dire situation, it's critical. The Resistance is on its last legs. ""When you're trying to survive, the First Order's right on top of us, it is like war, where you've got to keep moving to try to survive. You feel the momentum of everything that happened in The Force Awakens just pushing to a critical mass."" Experts are predicting the movie - which opens on 15 December - will gross about $220m (Â£164m) on its opening weekend in the United States. That would push it into second place on the all-time list, ahead of Jurassic World but behind 2015's The Force Awakens, which made some $248m on its opening weekend. Longtime characters R2-D2 and C-3PO were among the droids represented on the red carpet Gwendoline Christie, who plays stormtrooper commander Captain Phasma, said the franchise had an enduring appeal. ""I think it's because the world we live in is a changing and evolving place that it retains the simplicity of those elements,"" she said.

"Boris Johnson concluded his visit to Iran with a meeting with President Rouhani UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has had a ""worthwhile visit"" to Iran and met President Hassan Rouhani on a second day of talks in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said both ""spoke forthrightly"" on several issues, including the case of jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The mother-of-one has been held in Iran since April 2016 on charges of spying, which she denies. She was not required to appear at an expected court case on Sunday. It had been thought she would appear in court on fresh charges, but her husband Richard Ratcliffe has confirmed that the case was not held. ""Of course, one swallow doesn't make a Christmas - Nazanin is not yet on a plane. But it is good to have at least a swallow in the sky,"" he said. The head of Iran's Revolution Court, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, confirmed no court hearing was held for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on Sunday. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift On Saturday Mr Johnson urged his Iranian counterpart to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals on humanitarian grounds. In two hours of talks, Mr Johnson and Mohammed Javad Zarif also discussed ""the obligations of all parties to implement the nuclear deal"", Iran's foreign ministry said. US President Donald Trump has made his opposition to the deal, struck in 2015, very clear and has threatened to scrap it. But the UK continues to support it. In October when Mr Trump threatened to tear the deal apart, the UK, France and Germany said it was ""in our shared national security interest"" that its arrangements continued. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife's release, said he hoped Mr Johnson would be ""persuasive and charming and build a good relationship"". It is thought that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces a possible court appearance later on new charges. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the president's powers were limited because he is not Iran's supreme leader. Analysis by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins The mere fact of Boris Johnson spending nearly an hour with President Hassan Rouhani can be seen as a positive. The Foreign Office says a ""full range of issues"" were discussed including ""concerns about the consular cases of dual nationals"". Banking matters were also on the agenda, including: An outstanding debt of Â£400m owed by Britain to Iran. Britain says the money is ready to be paid when a method of doing so can be found which doesn't break international sanctions Iranian anger that no British bank will open an account for Iran's embassy in London Iran's judgement that British banks and businesses are dragging their feet getting involved in Iran after the relaxation of many restrictions with the signing of the nuclear deal Neither side is linking any of this to the appeal for prison releases, but the Foreign Office said the delegation was leaving Iran with a sense that both sides ""wanted to resolve the difficult issues in the relationship"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested on a visit to see her parents with her infant daughter Gabriella. After the arrest, her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months the three-year-old has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. Iran does not recognise Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's dual citizenship and will not allow UK representatives to see her in prison. The case was further complicated when Mr Johnson told a parliamentary committee in November that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to train journalists. The foreign secretary laterapologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"".

"Chris Rea is currently touring around Europe and the UK Singer Chris Rea is said to be in a stable condition in hospital after collapsing during a performance. Fans posted on Twitter that they saw the 66-year-old ""fall backwards"" mid-song at the New Theatre Oxford. Rea, who is known for his hits ""Driving Home for Christmas"" and ""Road to Hell"", is on tour to promote his new album. A concert due to take place in Brighton on Sunday has now been cancelled. A decision has not yet been made on a concert due in Bournemouth on Tuesday. Darren Fewins, who was in the audience in Oxford, said Rea had been on stage for about 45 minutes when he collapsed halfway through a song. He told the Press Association that Rea, who was born in Middlesbrough, was ""playing the best I have ever seen"" before his fall. South Central Ambulance Service said it was called at 21:30 GMT to an incident at the venue and that one patient had been taken to hospital. Staff at the theatre tweeted that they ""appreciate everyone's patience"" and will update people with news when they have it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Protests in Beirut turn ugly again There have been violent clashes near the US embassy in Lebanon, in the latest protest against President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Security forces fired tear gas and water cannon to force back flag-waving protesters close to the embassy complex north of the capital, Beirut. Overnight the Arab League condemned the US decision.

"Ms Wasim shared her experience on her Instagram account, which has almost 400,000 followers An actress who starred in Bollywood's biggest film says she was molested on a flight between Delhi and Mumbai. Zaira Wasim, 17, said a ""middle-aged man"" had repeatedly moved his foot up and down her neck and back while she was ""half-asleep"". She documented the incident on Instagram and tried to film the man's behaviour but said it was too dark. The airline, Air Vistara, said it was carrying out a detailed investigation into the incident. A suspect has been arrested, Indian media reports say, but his identity has not been disclosed. How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse What to do if you are being sexually harassed at work Ms Wasim posted on her Instagram account early on Sunday. ""I was sure of it,"" she wrote. He kept nudging my shoulder and continued to move his foot up and down my back and neck."" She said she blamed the turbulence at first but was later woken by the man's foot touching her neck. Ms Wasim shared a video of herself after the flight, in which she was visibly upset. ""This is terrible,"" she said. ""No one will help up if we don't decide to help ourselves."" Zaira Wasim made her acting debut in Dangal, the top grossing Bollywood movie of all time Last year, Ms Wasim made her acting debut inDangal, which became the top-grossing Bollywood movie of all time. She was awarded the National Child Award for Exceptional Achievement earlier this year by India's President Ram Nath Kovind. Air Vistara said on Twitter that staff had not become aware of the incident until the plane was on its descent to Mumbai but it apologised for what Ms Wasim had experienced.

"Truax (left) gained real impetus in the fifth round James DeGale says he will ""go back to the drawing board"" after his shock defeat by American Caleb Truax at London's Copper Box Arena. DeGale lost his IBF world super-middleweight title as Truax won 114-114 115-112 116-112 on the cards. The Briton was as short as 1-100 with some bookmakers as he fought for the first time since January. ""There's something missing in the ring,"" said 31-year-old DeGale, who had shoulder surgery in July. Truax, 34, offered constant pressure and rocked DeGale in the fifth as a stiff right drew gasps in the venue. DeGale, timid for large parts, rallied late on but Truax took the title. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live after the fight, DeGale - who suffered his second professional defeat - added: ""I honestly did [think I'd won], I've got to go back to the drawing board. ""My nose is blocked again, I've got to sort it out. The shoulder - I had serious reconstruction - there's no pain but I'll have to go back, have a look and see. I've probably rushed back to be honest, maybe I should have waited till next year."" He added: ""I'm going to speak to Al Haymon [his boxing advisor] later, maybe I can get a rematch."" Truax, who extended his record to 29-3, said: ""All week all I heard was who he's going to fight next. Well guess what? Those fights are mine now. ""I'd love to [fight in the UK again]. I'm staying until Wednesday - if anybody sees me, buy some pints."" Relive DeGale's shock defeat by Truax Champion Selby scores Ramirez points win Lomachenko wins as Rigondeaux retires Truax threw his arms aloft before the final bell and when it sounded he dropped to his knees Truax sank to his knees on the bell and was convinced he had landed arguably the biggest shock the sport has seen this year. While DeGale had questions to answer following shoulder surgery in July and having suffered ear and dental damage in drawing with Badou Jack in January, he was expected to shine against the 34-year-old, who was contesting a world title for the second time. Big money bouts with WBA super-middleweight champion George Groves, or other stellar names at the weight such as Callum Smith or Chris Eubank Jr will likely now have to wait and afterwards DeGale said he hoped for a rematch. Shortly after the fight, Groves tweeted: ""Call it a day, mate, you ain't got it no more."" Eubank Jr wrote: ""After all the trash talk and disrespectful comments James DeGale you go and put on a display like that! All I can say is WOW! You have properly let down British Boxing #Shameful."" DeGale had only ever lost to George Groves in his career back in 2011 Minnesota's Truax achieved his goal in the sport of paying off his student debt with this bout but he will leave the UK with so much more thanks to a game fighting style which unsettled DeGale from the second round onwards. DeGale, 31, found himself backed to the ropes consistently and while there were flurries of good work, Truax's solid straight shot rocked his head in the third and a left hook landed crisply in the fourth. But it was the fifth where trouble really arose for the champion. He was bloodied and Truax delivered variety with good body work, a clean uppercut and later ramrod right. BBC Radio 5 live's ringside pundit Adam Booth pointed to DeGale showing ""immense signs of distress"" as he offered little in return. Earlier in the year, DeGale told BBC Sport he did not want too many more battles like he shared with Jack in January. But he had no choice but to dig in and take punishment as this slipped away from him. Two counter lefts in the seventh gave DeGale hope he had stemmed the flow but the challenger still walked his man down, digging a right hook into the left abdomen in the eighth. A good body shot from the 2008 Olympic champion briefly threatened to save him in the 10th but Truax was not to be denied as he dished up DeGale's second career loss. Truax had contested a world title once before but lost to Daniel Jacobs in 2015 Caleb Truax on BBC Radio 5 live:""He was sleeping and now he's going to have nightmares about me. ""All week all I heard was who he's going to fight next. Well, guess what, those fights are mine now. I'd love to [fight in the UK again]. I'm staying until Wednesday - if anybody sees me, buy some pints."" BBC pundit and world-level trainer Adam Booth:""An hour ago James was world champion and thinking about unifying belts. Now he's being asked if he's a has-been former champion and it's brutal. It's easy for us to say we know what he can do and he didn't do it tonight, so he can't do it anymore. That's not necessarily the case."" Elsewhere on the night, IBF world featherweight championLee Selbyclaimed a wide points winagainst Mexico's Eduardo Ramirez to all but seal an all-British dust up with Leeds' Josh Warrington early in 2018. Selby could not lose his title after Ramirez failed to make weight for the bout which was supposed form part of a world-title double header. But the 30-year-old excelled nonetheless, showcasing evasive footwork to move to 26 wins from 27 fights. WBO European light-heavyweight championAnthony Yardebecame the first man to stop the durable Nikola Sjekloca, completing the win with impressive combinations in round four. And heavyweight prospectDaniel Duboistook his record to six knockouts from six fights with a second-round stoppage of Wales' Dorian Darch.

"Boris Johnson concluded his visit to Iran with a meeting with President Rouhani UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has had a ""worthwhile visit"" to Iran and met President Hassan Rouhani on a second day of talks in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said both ""spoke forthrightly"" on several issues, including the case of jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The mother-of-one has been held in Iran since April 2016 on charges of spying, which she denies. She was not required to appear at an expected court case on Sunday. It had been thought she would appear in court on fresh charges, but her husband Richard Ratcliffe has confirmed that the case was not held. ""Of course, one swallow doesn't make a Christmas - Nazanin is not yet on a plane. But it is good to have at least a swallow in the sky,"" he said. The head of Iran's Revolution Court, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, confirmed no court hearing was held for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on Sunday. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift On Saturday Mr Johnson urged his Iranian counterpart to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals on humanitarian grounds. In two hours of talks, Mr Johnson and Mohammed Javad Zarif also discussed ""the obligations of all parties to implement the nuclear deal"", Iran's foreign ministry said. US President Donald Trump has made his opposition to the deal, struck in 2015, very clear and has threatened to scrap it. But the UK continues to support it. In October when Mr Trump threatened to tear the deal apart, the UK, France and Germany said it was ""in our shared national security interest"" that its arrangements continued. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife's release, said he hoped Mr Johnson would be ""persuasive and charming and build a good relationship"". It is thought that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces a possible court appearance later on new charges. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the president's powers were limited because he is not Iran's supreme leader. Analysis by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins The mere fact of Boris Johnson spending nearly an hour with President Hassan Rouhani can be seen as a positive. The Foreign Office says a ""full range of issues"" were discussed including ""concerns about the consular cases of dual nationals"". Banking matters were also on the agenda, including: An outstanding debt of Â£400m owed by Britain to Iran. Britain says the money is ready to be paid when a method of doing so can be found which doesn't break international sanctions Iranian anger that no British bank will open an account for Iran's embassy in London Iran's judgement that British banks and businesses are dragging their feet getting involved in Iran after the relaxation of many restrictions with the signing of the nuclear deal Neither side is linking any of this to the appeal for prison releases, but the Foreign Office said the delegation was leaving Iran with a sense that both sides ""wanted to resolve the difficult issues in the relationship"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested on a visit to see her parents with her infant daughter Gabriella. After the arrest, her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months the three-year-old has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. Iran does not recognise Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's dual citizenship and will not allow UK representatives to see her in prison. The case was further complicated when Mr Johnson told a parliamentary committee in November that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to train journalists. The foreign secretary laterapologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"".

"Boris Johnson concluded his visit to Iran with a meeting with President Rouhani UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has had a ""worthwhile visit"" to Iran and met President Hassan Rouhani on a second day of talks in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said both ""spoke forthrightly"" on several issues, including the case of jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The mother-of-one has been held in Iran since April 2016 on charges of spying, which she denies. She was not required to appear at an expected court case on Sunday. It had been thought she would appear in court on fresh charges, but her husband Richard Ratcliffe has confirmed that the case was not held. ""Of course, one swallow doesn't make a Christmas - Nazanin is not yet on a plane. But it is good to have at least a swallow in the sky,"" he said. The head of Iran's Revolution Court, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, confirmed no court hearing was held for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on Sunday. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift On Saturday Mr Johnson urged his Iranian counterpart to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals on humanitarian grounds. In two hours of talks, Mr Johnson and Mohammed Javad Zarif also discussed ""the obligations of all parties to implement the nuclear deal"", Iran's foreign ministry said. US President Donald Trump has made his opposition to the deal, struck in 2015, very clear and has threatened to scrap it. But the UK continues to support it. In October when Mr Trump threatened to tear the deal apart, the UK, France and Germany said it was ""in our shared national security interest"" that its arrangements continued. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife's release, said he hoped Mr Johnson would be ""persuasive and charming and build a good relationship"". It is thought that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces a possible court appearance later on new charges. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the president's powers were limited because he is not Iran's supreme leader. Analysis by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins The mere fact of Boris Johnson spending nearly an hour with President Hassan Rouhani can be seen as a positive. The Foreign Office says a ""full range of issues"" were discussed including ""concerns about the consular cases of dual nationals"". Banking matters were also on the agenda, including: An outstanding debt of Â£400m owed by Britain to Iran. Britain says the money is ready to be paid when a method of doing so can be found which doesn't break international sanctions Iranian anger that no British bank will open an account for Iran's embassy in London Iran's judgement that British banks and businesses are dragging their feet getting involved in Iran after the relaxation of many restrictions with the signing of the nuclear deal Neither side is linking any of this to the appeal for prison releases, but the Foreign Office said the delegation was leaving Iran with a sense that both sides ""wanted to resolve the difficult issues in the relationship"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested on a visit to see her parents with her infant daughter Gabriella. After the arrest, her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months the three-year-old has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. Iran does not recognise Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's dual citizenship and will not allow UK representatives to see her in prison. The case was further complicated when Mr Johnson told a parliamentary committee in November that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to train journalists. The foreign secretary laterapologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Last month, the Free Nazanin Campaign saidMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had suffered panic attacks, insomnia, bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and had been given a health assessment. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe doesn't expect his wife will be released immediately On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe said he believed the foreign secretary's presence in Iran would ""make a difference"", but the situation remained very unclear. ""It's all up in the air,"" he said. ""We're holding on to the good bits - it could go any which way. ""Fingers crossed it can be solved by Christmas, which means in the week or so afterwards there might be a happy outcome.""

"One of the UK's largest teaching unions is calling for schools to ban energy drinks from their premises. The NASUWT is warning about caffeine levels in the drinks, describing them as ""readily available legal highs"" which can contribute to poor behaviour. It follows a report by academics, seen by 5 live investigates, calling on the government to consider making the sale of the drinks illegal to under-16s. But the British Soft Drinks Association says the drinks have been deemed safe. Academics from FUSE - the Centre for Transitional Research in Public Health in the North East - found children as young as 10 are buying energy drinks because they are ""cheaper than water or pop"". Children told them they buy the drinks for as little as 25p, and that they choose energy drinks to ""fit in"" or ""look tough"". They also found that the drinks are targeted at young people online in pop-up adverts, on TV, in computer games, and through sports sponsorship. A typical energy drink contains 32mg of caffeine per 100ml and cans carry warnings saying they are ""not recommended for children"". A single 500ml can contains 160mg of caffeine, equivalent to around two shots of espresso coffee. The researchers highlight European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidance which recommends an intake of no more than 105mg caffeine per day for an average 11-year-old. They also point out that young people in the UK are among the highest consumers of energy drinks in Europe. Figures from the British Soft Drinks Association show sales of energy drinks increased by 185% between 2006 and 2015, equating to 672 million litres consumed in 2015, and a total market value of over Â£2bn. Why our school bans energy drinks Ban energy drinks sales to children, Welsh Government urged Darren Northcott, NASUWT national official for education, said: ""Teachers have registered concerns with the NASUWT about the contribution of high energy drinks to poor pupil behaviour as a result of pupils consuming excessive quantities of these drinks. ""They are popular among young people who often think they are just another soft drink, and young people and parents are often not aware of the very high levels of stimulants that these drinks contain. ""They are readily available legal highs sold in vending machines, supermarkets and corner shops."" He added: ""The evidence of the impact of these drinks, including that uncovered by 5 live, is compelling and serves to emphasise that further action needs to be taken. ""The NASUWT has always been clear that drinks with high levels of sugar should not be sold on school premises. It is time to look again at the School Food Standards, and the enforcement of the standards, to make sure that every school in the country is free of highly-caffeinated soft drinks, as well as those that are high in sugar."" Victoria Stean, from Milton Keynes, started consuming energy drinks when she was 16 and was soon drinking around seven 500ml cans a day. She said: ""I was definitely hooked. I would have a can for breakfast, another one mid-morning, and several in the afternoon. ""It took me a while to wean myself off energy drinks.  I would get headaches if I didn't drink them.  Since I have stopped drinking them I have lost weight and my vision has improved again. ""Ironically, I also have more energy now and I sleep better."" Victoria was able to lose half her body weight after she stopped drinking around seven 500ml cans of energy drinks a day. Norman Lamb, chair of the Commons Science and Technology Committee and a former Liberal Democrat health minister, said: ""The potential health risks and impact on sleep of energy drinks is something I would like the committee to consider evidence on in the new year. He added that ""given epidemic levels of consumption among under-16s we have to consider banning the sale of these drinks to that group"". In a statement, the British Soft Drinks Association, which represents manufacturers, said: ""Energy drinks and their ingredients have been deemed safe by regulatory authorities around the world. ""In 2010 we introduced a voluntary Code of Practice to support consumers who want to make informed choices. In 2015 this was updated to include more stringent guidelines around marketing and promoting, including reference to in and around schools."" The Food Standards Agency said: ""The FSA reviews guidance when significant new work in the subject area becomes available. Our current guidance was developed following the European Food Safety Authority's assessment of caffeine in 2015."" 5 live Investigates: Energy Drinksis broadcast on Sunday 10th December 2017 at 11am GMT.

"Max Clifford had been serving an eight-year jail sentence for sex offences Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford has died in hospital, aged 74, after collapsing in prison. Clifford collapsed in his cell at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire on Thursday and again on Friday, his daughter said. He was taken to hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest. He had been serving an eight-year sentence for historical sex offences. The Ministry of Justice said as with all deaths in custody, there would an investigation by the ombudsman. A spokeswoman added: ""Our condolences are with Mr Clifford's family at this difficult time."" The publicist who became notorious How Clifford tried to spin his trial His daughter Louise, 46, hadtold the Mail on Sunday,externalthat Clifford first collapsed in his cell on Thursday when he was trying to clean it, adding: ""It was just too much."" She said he collapsed again the next day and was unconscious for several minutes, and after seeing a nurse was transferred to a local hospital where he suffered a cardiac arrest on Friday. During his trial he accused his victims of being fantasists The Ministry of Justice confirmed Clifford died in hospital on 10 December. In May 2014, Clifford was jailed after being convicted of eight historical indecent assaults on women and young girls under Operation Yewtree - the Met Police investigation set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. During this trial, evidence was heard about Clifford's manipulative behaviour, including how he promised to boost the careers of aspiring models and actresses in return for sexual favours. After his convictions, he continued to protest his innocence. The Court of Appeal was due to hear his case appealing against his sentence in the New Year. Clifford's lawyer, John Szepietowski, said his death meant there were a number of unresolved legal issues. He said Clifford had been suing News International and Mirror Group Newspapers for allegedly hacking his phone. His daughter Louise supported him through his trial The lawyer also said Clifford was being sued by a number of women who claimed he had sexually assaulted them. Mr Szepietowski said his legal team would meet in the coming days to decide whether Clifford's criminal appeal case should continue. He said Clifford had been receiving legal aid for the appeal, after being declared bankrupt earlier this year and having to sell his Surrey home to pay his debts. During his long career as a publicist, Clifford, who started his own company at 27, looked after press and publicity for a mixed range of clients such as Marlon Brando, Marvin Gaye, Muhammad Ali and Jade Goody. He claimed he had helped to launch the career of The Beatles by sending press releases about their debut single, Love Me Do, when record company bosses were unsure about the group's potential. High-profile clients came to him because of his connections in the tabloid press - while journalists turned to Clifford to provide stories. However, after 50 years in the showbiz industry allegations against him began to emerge. In a Facebook post,externalfollowing the announcement that Clifford had died, former X Factor winner Steve Brookstein, claimed Clifford had ""orchestrated a media hate campaign"" against him.

"Rescuers faced challenging conditions with sub-zero temperatures and snow One of Britain's worst train crashes is to be remembered in a memorial service. The Castlecary rail disaster cost 35 people their lives in a freezing snowstorm on a December Friday night in 1937. Another 179 were hurt in the tragedy when an Edinburgh to Glasgow express ploughed into a stationary train just west of Castlecary village. An inquiry found a signalling error led the driver of the express to believe the line was clear. The crash happened in the evening of 10 December 1937 as the express from Edinburgh Waverley was travelling at high speed in a blizzard. Both the express and the other train, from Dundee, were bound for Glasgow's Queen Street Station. The Edinburgh to Glasgow train crashed into the back of a stationary Dundee train heading for Queen Street Thirty five people died and 179 were injured in the disaster The Dundee train was running late and had stopped at signals outside Castlecary Station when the express train rammed into the stationary carriages. An investigation after the incident found a signaller error was to blame, with driver error and challenging weather conditions contributing factors. For years the disaster was remembered by the local people in Castlecary with a makeshift memorial by the side of the railway. But, keen to create a fitting tribute to those who died and those who helped in the aftermath of the terrible tragedy, Castlecary Community Council created a permanent memorial in 2007, made from railway sleepers, pieces of track and a wheel from a piece of rolling stock. It is at this memorial that the victims of the disaster will be remembered on Sunday evening. Locals fought to save passengers Official documents from the time of the disaster Secretary of the community council Albert McBeath said the memory of the tragedy endured despite the passage of time. ""I knew a lot of people who remembered and had seen the aftermath,"" she said. ""It must have been horrendous, in one of our worst winters, the temperature was -20C. ""I moved to the village 30 years ago and have always heard people talking about it. ""Even now, they have grandparents who remember what happened after the crash."" Falkirk councillor Billy Buchanan will be joined for a short service by the Provost of North Lanarkshire to remember those who lost their lives. They will also pay tribute to a later crash in 1968 which saw the loss of two men.

"This video can not be played David Davis: ""No deal means we won't be paying the money"" Brexit Secretary David Davis says the UK wants to secure a free-trade deal with no tariffs when it leaves the EU. He described it as ""Canada plus plus plus"" - a reference to the free trade deal struck between Canada and the EU. But unlike the Canada deal, he wants financial services included in the tariff-free area, he told Andrew Marr. Labour says the UK should ""stay aligned"" to the EU after Brexit and could pay to access the single market like Norway. Gove says voters can change Brexit deal 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks Reality Check: Theresa May's deal with Brussels So, did 'soft Brexit' just win? The Conservatives claim this would ""mean billions of pounds going to the EU in perpetuity"" and the UK ""being forced to obey rules over which we have no say"". Canada's deal with the EU, signed last year, removes the vast majority of customs duties on EU exports to Canada and Canadian exports to the EU but without paying for access to the single market. But Mr Davis said he wanted a ""bespoke"" deal with the EU and was aiming for ""overarching"" agreement with no tariffs, that included the service industries - which are a key part of the British economy. Referring to some of the EU's trade deals, he said: ""We'll probably start with the best of Canada, and the best of Japan and the best of South Korea and then add to that the bits that are missing which is the services."" He said the odds of the UK exiting without a deal had ""dropped dramatically"" following Friday's joint EU-UK statement in Brussels. But he stressed that the deal struck by Theresa May on Friday to move to the next phase of talks was a ""statement of intent"" and not ""legally enforceable"". And if the UK failed to get a trade deal with the EU then it would not pay its divorce bill, which the Treasury says will be between Â£35bn and Â£39bn. But the Irish government said that as far as it was concerned the agreement signed on Friday between the EU and the UK was binding. ""The European Union will be holding the United Kingdom to account,"" the Irish government's chief whip told RTE. ""My question to anybody within the British government would be, why would there be an agreement, a set of principled agreements, in order to get to phase two, if they weren't going to be held up? That just sounds bizarre to me,"" Joe McHugh told RTE Radio's This Week. Mr Davis stressed in his Marr interview that the UK was committed to keeping a ""frictionless and invisible"" Irish border and it would ""find a way"" to do this if there was a ""no deal"" Brexit. Mrs May signedan agreement,externalon Friday ruling out the return of a ""hard border"" on the island of Ireland, protecting the rights of EU and UK citizens and agreeing a formula for the divorce bill. EU leaders are now expected to recommend starting the next phase of Brexit talks at a summit on Thursday. Mr Davis stressed Friday's agreement was conditional on getting a trade deal, agreements on security and foreign affairs, as well as the two-year transition period the UK wants after if officially leaves the EU in March 2019. Friday's agreement includes a fallback position if the UK fails to get a trade deal, which proposes full regulatory ""alignment"" between the EU and the UK. This clause had been diluted at the insistence of the Democratic Unionist Party, which fears Northern Ireland would be separated from the rest of the UK, and move closer to Ireland, if it had to adopt EU rules to keep goods flowing across the border. But there is still controversy, and confusion, over what ""full alignment"" would mean in practice, with some Brexiteers fearing the UK would have to continue to abide by EU regulations on agriculture and other issues after Brexit and would not be able to strike its own trade deals. Mr Davis has said ""full alignment"" would apply to the whole of the UK, not just Northern Ireland, butthe Sunday Telegraph said,externalConservative Brexiteers had been reassured that it was ""non-binding"" and had been included to secure Ireland's backing for the deal. Pushed to explain what it meant, Mr Davis told Andrew Marr: ""We want to protect the peace process and we also want to protect Ireland from the impact of Brexit for them. This was a statement of intent more than anything else."" The Labour party has ruled out remaining in the EU single market and customs union if it wins power. But the party's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted a partnership with the EU that ""retains the benefits of the single market and the customs union"". Labour's Sir Keir Starmer suggested the UK could pay for single market access The EU has asked for more clarity from the UK on what it wants from trade talks. But today it was the opposition who gave more details than ever before. So far Labour has said, if in power, it would stay in the single market and customs union in a transition period. But now the shadow Brexit secretary has talked about the benefits of staying in alignment with the EU in the longer term. And he has even suggested he'd be willing to pay for the type of single market access that Norway enjoys. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry has raised the possibility of staying in a form of customs union. That might restrict the ability to do global trade deals but - as she puts it - she doesn't want to ""kybosh"" trade with the EU. For the Conservatives in the short term it's a political gift - they can portray Labour as rule takers who are prepared to pay far more to Brussels than their divorce settlement. But it's more likely a sign that ""creative ambiguity"" across the political spectrum could be unsustainable when serious trade talks begin.

"Boris Johnson concluded his visit to Iran with a meeting with President Rouhani UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has had a ""worthwhile visit"" to Iran and met President Hassan Rouhani on a second day of talks in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said both ""spoke forthrightly"" on several issues, including the case of jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. The mother-of-one has been held in Iran since April 2016 on charges of spying, which she denies. She was not required to appear at an expected court case on Sunday. It had been thought she would appear in court on fresh charges, but her husband Richard Ratcliffe has confirmed that the case was not held. ""Of course, one swallow doesn't make a Christmas - Nazanin is not yet on a plane. But it is good to have at least a swallow in the sky,"" he said. The head of Iran's Revolution Court, Hojjat ol-Eslam Mousa Ghazanfarabadi, confirmed no court hearing was held for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe on Sunday. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle The uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Global powers defy US over Iran deal shift On Saturday Mr Johnson urged his Iranian counterpart to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and other dual nationals on humanitarian grounds. In two hours of talks, Mr Johnson and Mohammed Javad Zarif also discussed ""the obligations of all parties to implement the nuclear deal"", Iran's foreign ministry said. US President Donald Trump has made his opposition to the deal, struck in 2015, very clear and has threatened to scrap it. But the UK continues to support it. In October when Mr Trump threatened to tear the deal apart, the UK, France and Germany said it was ""in our shared national security interest"" that its arrangements continued. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ""We leave with a sense that both sides want to keep up the momentum to resolve the difficult issues in the bilateral relationship and preserve the nuclear deal."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe, who has been campaigning for his wife's release, said he hoped Mr Johnson would be ""persuasive and charming and build a good relationship"". It is thought that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe faces a possible court appearance later on new charges. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said the president's powers were limited because he is not Iran's supreme leader. Analysis by the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Robbins The mere fact of Boris Johnson spending nearly an hour with President Hassan Rouhani can be seen as a positive. The Foreign Office says a ""full range of issues"" were discussed including ""concerns about the consular cases of dual nationals"". Banking matters were also on the agenda, including: An outstanding debt of Â£400m owed by Britain to Iran. Britain says the money is ready to be paid when a method of doing so can be found which doesn't break international sanctions Iranian anger that no British bank will open an account for Iran's embassy in London Iran's judgement that British banks and businesses are dragging their feet getting involved in Iran after the relaxation of many restrictions with the signing of the nuclear deal Neither side is linking any of this to the appeal for prison releases, but the Foreign Office said the delegation was leaving Iran with a sense that both sides ""wanted to resolve the difficult issues in the relationship"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested on a visit to see her parents with her infant daughter Gabriella. After the arrest, her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months the three-year-old has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. Iran does not recognise Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's dual citizenship and will not allow UK representatives to see her in prison. The case was further complicated when Mr Johnson told a parliamentary committee in November that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to train journalists. The foreign secretary laterapologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". Last month, the Free Nazanin Campaign saidMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had suffered panic attacks, insomnia, bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and had been given a health assessment. This video can not be played Mr Ratcliffe doesn't expect his wife will be released immediately On Saturday, Mr Ratcliffe said he believed the foreign secretary's presence in Iran would ""make a difference"", but the situation remained very unclear. ""It's all up in the air,"" he said. ""We're holding on to the good bits - it could go any which way. ""Fingers crossed it can be solved by Christmas, which means in the week or so afterwards there might be a happy outcome."" This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) The Foreign Office would not confirm the names or number of other dual nationals being held, saying their families had asked for their cases to be kept out of the public domain. Relations between the UK and Iran have long been difficult. Mr Johnson's visit is only the third by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. Who is Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe?

"More students will be encouraged to take degrees in two years Students in England are going to be offered degrees in two years with a Â£5,500 saving in tuition fees, says the universities minister Jo Johnson. Undergraduate courses will be condensed into ""accelerated"" degrees, with fees 20% less than a three-year course. Mr Johnson said he wants to ""break the mould"" of a system in which three-year degrees have ""crowded out"" any more flexible ways of studying. The Office for Fair Access says the plan could help to widen opportunities. But Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said there was no evidence that ""squeezing three years of learning into two will stop the huge drop in part-time students or lead to better outcomes"". Instead she said that in effect it would mean that for each of the two years of study, tuition fees would be more expensive than the current Â£9,250, at about Â£11,000 per year. The idea of a two-year degree had been proposed earlier this year - but this latest version has moved further towards making it cheaper for students. Students would take the same number of units and have the same amount of teaching and supervision, but degree courses would be delivered in one less year. As well as reduced tuition fees, students will save on a year's living costs and will be able to start working a year earlier - a package which Mr Johnson says could cut costs by Â£25,000. It would also be cheaper for the government, which would have lower tuition fee loans to fund, with this fee arrangement intended to be available from autumn 2019. It is part of Mr Johnson's push for more value for money for students - after concerns that students did not think they were getting good value from their tuition fees. It comes ahead of a wider review of fees and university funding expected in the next few weeks. Jo Johnson says universities have to address value for money for students The minister says the level of tuition fees for two year courses strikes the ""right balance"" between the fixed costs for universities, where the teaching hours will be the same as a three-year course, and a reduction for students for less time on campus. There have been previous attempts to promote two-year degrees, but Mr Johnson said the numbers currently taking them were ""pitiful"", with only 0.2% of students on such accelerated courses. ""I think this reflects that the incentives in the system are completely skewed against it."" The minister said he wanted to promote a more diverse and flexible set of choices at university level - in a market currently dominated by the traditional three-year, residential degree. Numbers of mature students have been declining in recent years - and Mr Johnson says that the two-year degree model could be a much more practical option for them. ""This policy will be particularly attractive for mature students who are looking to change their skills and adapt to changes in the economy - and who might want to go through higher education at a faster pace,"" he said. Mr Johnson said that if universities saw students being attracted by such courses, there could be a ""snowball"" effect which would result in such courses becoming widespread. The universities minister says he wants to move beyond being ""stuck with a system that has increasingly focused on offering only one way of benefiting from higher education"". Mr Johnson said he ""massively supported"" new providers such as Sir James Dyson's engineering institute, which he said provided the kind of innovation that had been ""sorely missing in the system"". This is a high-quality, work-focused project, where students learn alongside leading engineers - and where students do not pay tuition fees. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that ""making two-year degrees more makes sense"", particularly as a way to support mature students. But he warned that this would mean a higher charge per year in fees than the current three-year degree. And Mr Hillman warned that ""it remains an open question whether there is sufficient support in Parliament for a higher tuition fee cap for a minority of courses"". Prof Les Ebdon, head of the Offa access watchdog, backed the calls for such fast-track courses. ""Accelerated degrees are an attractive option for mature students who have missed out on the chance to go to university as a young person,"" said Prof Ebdon. ""Having often battled disadvantage, these students can thrive in higher education and I hope that now many more will be able to take up the life-changing opportunity to get a degree."" The proposal was supported by Sir Anthony Seldon, vice chancellor of the University of Buckingham, an institution which already offers two year degrees. ""Two years are the ideal solution for those students who want to get on with their degree and forsake three-month summer holidays,"" said Sir Anthony.

"The EU Withdrawal Bill will be debated again in Parliament on Tuesday A cross-party group of pro-EU MPs says the promise of a ""meaningful vote"" for Parliament on any Brexit deal should be enshrined in law. Tory former attorney-general Dominic Grieve will table such an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on EU Relations supports the move, urging backbenchers to put ""the national interest"" above party politics. The amendment will be debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Gove says voters can change Brexit deal Reality Check: Theresa May's deal with Brussels Brexit deal: How the night unfolded In a joint statement, senior figures from the parliamentary group - co-chaired by leading Remain-supporting MPs Chuka Umunna, from Labour, and the Conservative Anna Soubry - toldthe Observer,external: ""It has been said that in the EU referendum last year, the British people voted to 'take back control' of our laws. For many, that meant a powerful reassertion of parliamentary sovereignty. ""Members of all parties have already provided valuable scrutiny... but little of that will matter unless we can have a truly meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement the government negotiates with the European Union."" They added: ""We understand the pressures colleagues face to vote 'the right way'. [But] let us stand up for the sovereignty of Parliament."" On Friday, Theresa May agreed a deal with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker onthree key aspects of Brexit: The so-called ""divorce bill"", the rights of EU citizens in the UK and British citizens abroad, and the Irish border. If EU leaders agree to it at a European Council summit on Thursday, the next phase of negotiations can begin - discussing a transition deal and future trade. Brexit Secretary David Davis told the Commons in November that MPs will be allowed a ""take it or leave it"" voteon any final deal agreed between the two sides. However, that verbal commitment was not enough for Mr Grieve to withdraw his amendment, asking for the vote to be written into the bill. This video can not be played Brexit: What still needs to be worked out? Separately, former Brexit minister David Jones has suggested the UK's ""divorce bill"" could be much higher than figures reported on Friday. Downing Street sources said the bill to leave the EU would amount to between Â£35bn and Â£39bn. But Mr Jones, who has criticised Mrs May's deal, said the UK could end up paying a ""monstrous"" exit fee of up to Â£100bn. Writing in theMail on Sunday,external, he said the deal document had no ""precise figure"", but it did have ""a set of highly technical mechanisms we would have to follow"" to work out the cost. ""And those mechanisms could land us with a bill, on some estimates, of as much as Â£100bn - a figure EU sources were touting earlier this year,"" added Mr Jones. The cabinet is expected to meet on 19 December to discuss its ""end state"" plans for Brexit. This is two days before Parliament's two-week Christmas recess. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said some ministers who voted to leave will ""push for bespoke arrangements"" for the UK after it leaves, and are ""prepared to resist any blanket acceptance of EU regulations"".

"Mr Feltman met top North Korean officials on his trip including Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho A top UN official told senior North Korean figures there was an ""urgent need"" to keep channels open to avoid the risk of war, the organisation says. The statement follows a visit to Pyongyang by Jeffrey Feltman, the highest-level trip by a UN official to the isolated nation in six years. North Korea says it has agreed to regular communication with the UN. Tensions over the North's weapons programme were raised further after a fresh ballistic missile test last week. North Korea said it was its most advanced missile yet, capable of reaching the continental US. The test was the latest in a series of nuclear and missile tests conducted in defiance of UN sanctions. South Korea and the US have meanwhile been carrying out large-scale military drills in a show of force. North Korea: What could tip the balance? What we know about new NK missile On Sunday, South Korea said it will join the US in imposing fresh sanctions against the North. Twenty North Korean firms and 12 individuals have reportedly been added to a South Korean blacklist, which will take effect from Monday. The move by Seoul, its second set of unilateral sanctions in a month, was designed to cut off international sources of funding for North Korea's nuclear missile programme, a foreign ministry official in Seoul said. The measures are in addition to those imposed by the UN Security Council. The UN continues to operate in North Korea, with programmes providing food, agricultural and health aid butthe last visit by a senior official was back in 2011. After the UN's Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Mr Feltman met senior North Koreans all agreed ""the current situation was the most tense and dangerous peace and security issue in the world today"",according to the statement,external. ""Noting the urgent need to prevent miscalculations and open channels to reduce the risks of conflict, Mr Feltman underlined that the international community, alarmed by escalating tensions, is committed to the achievement of a peaceful solution,"" it added. What Hwasong-15 launch pictures tell us Triumph, threats follow N Korea missile North Korean state media earlier said current tensions were ""entirely ascribable to the US hostile policy"". Some of latest pictures released by North Korea showed Kim Jong-un on Mount Paektu, the country's highest peak But in its reporting of Mr Feltman's trip, KCNA also said both sides agreed on ""communication through visits at different level on a regular basis in the future"". Before leaving for Pyongyang, Mr Feltman held talks in China, North Korea's historic ally and main trading partner. Despite calls from other world leaders for restraint, this year has seen US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un hurl insults at each other, both at one time saying the other was mad. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson though hassaid that lines of communication are open between the two sides. North Korea argues nuclear capabilities are its only deterrent against an outside world seeking to destroy it. How North Korea could tip the balance What do we know about N Korea's new missile?

"This video can not be played Jerusalem: The view from one street Arab officials say US President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital risks plunging the Middle East into ""violence and chaos"". The move ended US neutrality on one of the region's most sensitive issues. Arab League foreign ministers now say it means the US cannot be relied upon as a broker of Middle East peace. The statement by 22 countries, including close US allies, comes after a third day of violence and protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel has always regarded Jerusalem as its capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. For Mr Trump the decision fulfils a campaign promise and he has said it was ""nothing more or less than a recognition of reality"". But he has faced fierce criticism for the decision. Frank Gardner: Counter-terror efforts at risk? TheArab Leagueresolution was agreed at 03:00 (01:00 GMT) after hours of talks in Cairo. It was backed by a number of US allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, who had already voiced their concern. The resolution said: The US had ""withdrawn itself as a sponsor and broker"" of any possible Israeli-Palestinian peace process through its decision Mr Trump's move ""deepens tension, ignites anger and threatens to plunge region into more violence and chaos"" A request would be made for the UN Security Council to condemn the move At an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Friday, the US found itself isolated, with the other 14 members all condemning Mr Trump's declaration. But US ambassador Nikki Haley accused the UN of bias, saying it ""has outrageously been one of the world's foremost centres of hostility towards Israel"", and that the US was still committed to finding peace. This video can not be played Analysis: Breaking down what Mr Trump said and what it means for peace On Saturday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had heard ""voices of condemnation over President Trump's historic announcement"" but had ""not heard any condemnation for the rocket firing against Israel that has come and the awful incitement against us"". He will be in Paris on Sunday for talks with President Emmanuel Macron, ahead of meetings with EU foreign ministers on Monday. Three rockets were fired towards Israel from Gaza on Friday, leading Israel to carry out air strikes in response. It said it hit military sites belonging to the Islamist group Hamas, killing two of its members. How the world reacted to Trump move What are the alternatives to a two-state solution? Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Sunday: ""Our hope is that everything is calming down and that we are returning to a path of normal life."" However, protests and violence continued in a number of nations on Sunday: Local media reports say there have been clashes outside the US embassy north of the Lebanese capital, Beirut Thousands of people demonstrated outside the US embassy in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, some waving banners reading ""Palestine is in our hearts"" A burning object was thrown at a synagogue in the Swedish city of Gothenburg late on Saturday in what police said was a failed arson attempt. Jewish community leader Allan Stutzinsky said recent events had led to ""higher threats"" Clashes occurred in the West Bank town of Nablus on Saturday Jerusalem is of huge importance to both Israel and the Palestinians. It contains sites sacred to the three major monotheistic faiths - Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Israel occupied the eastern sector - previously occupied by Jordan - in 1967, and annexed it in 1980, but the move has never been recognised internationally. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Some 330,000 Palestinians live in East Jerusalem, along with about 200,000 Israeli Jews in a dozen settlements there. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel does not regard them as settlements but legitimate neighbourhoods. According to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. The last round of talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014 and while the US is formulating fresh proposals, Palestinian officials have said Mr Trump's announcement has disqualified the US from brokering future negotiations.

"Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast Devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change are ""the new normal"", California's governor has said. Jerry Brown said vast fires, such as the ones that have ravaged southern California in recent days, ""could happen every year or every few years"". ""We're facing a new reality in this state,"" he said. Mr Brown made the comments after surveying the damage in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. Thousands of firefighters have been battling the fires since Monday. Mr Brown, a Democrat who has attacked the Trump administration's stance on climate change, said: ""We're facing a new reality in this state, where fires threaten people's lives, their properties, their neighbourhoods, and of course billions and billions of dollars. ""With climate change, some scientists are saying southern California is literally burning up."" Powerful pictures of the fires The largest wildfire - known as the Thomas Fire - burned close to 150,000 acres, an area of land roughly the size of Chicago, Reuters reported. On Saturday, firefighters began to make progress in containing the blaze. This video can not be played Large parts of southern California have been affected Six large wildfires, and some smaller blazes, erupted on Monday night in southern California. Fanned by high winds, they swept through tens of thousands of acres in a matter of hours. The fires have been driven by extreme weather, including low humidity and parched ground. Authorities issued a purple alert - the highest level warning - amid what it called ""extremely critical fire weather"". The largest of the blazes, the Thomas fire in Ventura County, spread as far as the Pacific coast and swept across 180 square miles (466 sq km). About 5,700 firefighters were brought in to battle the brushfires, with some drafted in from neighbouring states to help. US President Donald Trump issued a state of emergency to ""help alleviate the hardship and suffering that the emergency may inflict."" The Thomas fire in Ventura County swept across 180 square miles (466 sq km) Hundreds of buildings have been destroyed and vast areas of land have been badly scorched. Three firefighters were injured and one death was reported after a 70-year-old woman was found dead in her car on an evacuation route. Nearly 200,000 residents were evacuated from their homes, with many forced to flee in the middle of the night as the flames rapidly spread. There are fears the blaze will seriously hit California's multi-million dollar agricultural industry. About 90% of US avocados are grown in California, and much of the state's crop has been wiped out. This video can not be played Drivers filmed the flames from their cars near Bel Air The strong winds subsided on Saturday and firefighters finally made some progress in containing the fires. But forecasters expect the winds to pick up again on Sunday meaning they are under pressure to extinguish them quickly. ""We continue to make real good progress on all of these fires. But we're far from being out of the woods on any of them,"" fire department director Ken Pimlott said. Elsewhere, several evacuation orders have been lifted and residents are beginning to return home to assess the damage.

"Rescuers faced challenging conditions with sub-zero temperatures and snow One of Britain's worst train crashes is to be remembered in a memorial service. The Castlecary rail disaster cost 35 people their lives in a freezing snowstorm on a December Friday night in 1937. Another 179 were hurt in the tragedy when an Edinburgh to Glasgow express ploughed into a stationary train just west of Castlecary village. An inquiry found a signalling error led the driver of the express to believe the line was clear. The crash happened in the evening of 10 December 1937 as the express from Edinburgh Waverley was travelling at high speed in a blizzard. Both the express and the other train, from Dundee, were bound for Glasgow's Queen Street Station. The Edinburgh to Glasgow train crashed into the back of a stationary Dundee train heading for Queen Street Thirty five people died and 179 were injured in the disaster The Dundee train was running late and had stopped at signals outside Castlecary Station when the express train rammed into the stationary carriages. An investigation after the incident found a signaller error was to blame, with driver error and challenging weather conditions contributing factors. For years the disaster was remembered by the local people in Castlecary with a makeshift memorial by the side of the railway. But, keen to create a fitting tribute to those who died and those who helped in the aftermath of the terrible tragedy, Castlecary Community Council created a permanent memorial in 2007, made from railway sleepers, pieces of track and a wheel from a piece of rolling stock. It is at this memorial that the victims of the disaster will be remembered on Sunday evening. Locals fought to save passengers Official documents from the time of the disaster Secretary of the community council Albert McBeath said the memory of the tragedy endured despite the passage of time. ""I knew a lot of people who remembered and had seen the aftermath,"" she said. ""It must have been horrendous, in one of our worst winters, the temperature was -20C. ""I moved to the village 30 years ago and have always heard people talking about it. ""Even now, they have grandparents who remember what happened after the crash."" Falkirk councillor Billy Buchanan will be joined for a short service by the Provost of North Lanarkshire to remember those who lost their lives. They will also pay tribute to a later crash in 1968 which saw the loss of two men.

"Truax (left) gained real impetus in the fifth round James DeGale says he will ""go back to the drawing board"" after his shock defeat by American Caleb Truax at London's Copper Box Arena. DeGale lost his IBF world super-middleweight title as Truax won 114-114 115-112 116-112 on the cards. The Briton was as short as 1-100 with some bookmakers as he fought for the first time since January. ""There's something missing in the ring,"" said 31-year-old DeGale, who had shoulder surgery in July. Truax, 34, offered constant pressure and rocked DeGale in the fifth as a stiff right drew gasps in the venue. DeGale, timid for large parts, rallied late on but Truax took the title. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live after the fight, DeGale - who suffered his second professional defeat - added: ""I honestly did [think I'd won], I've got to go back to the drawing board. ""My nose is blocked again, I've got to sort it out. The shoulder - I had serious reconstruction - there's no pain but I'll have to go back, have a look and see. I've probably rushed back to be honest, maybe I should have waited till next year."" He added: ""I'm going to speak to Al Haymon [his boxing advisor] later, maybe I can get a rematch."" Truax, who extended his record to 29-3, said: ""All week all I heard was who he's going to fight next. Well guess what? Those fights are mine now. ""I'd love to [fight in the UK again]. I'm staying until Wednesday - if anybody sees me, buy some pints."" Relive DeGale's shock defeat by Truax Champion Selby scores Ramirez points win Lomachenko wins as Rigondeaux retires Truax threw his arms aloft before the final bell and when it sounded he dropped to his knees Truax sank to his knees on the bell and was convinced he had landed arguably the biggest shock the sport has seen this year. While DeGale had questions to answer following shoulder surgery in July and having suffered ear and dental damage in drawing with Badou Jack in January, he was expected to shine against the 34-year-old, who was contesting a world title for the second time. Big money bouts with WBA super-middleweight champion George Groves, or other stellar names at the weight such as Callum Smith or Chris Eubank Jr will likely now have to wait and afterwards DeGale said he hoped for a rematch. Shortly after the fight, Groves tweeted: ""Call it a day, mate, you ain't got it no more."" Eubank Jr wrote: ""After all the trash talk and disrespectful comments James DeGale you go and put on a display like that! All I can say is WOW! You have properly let down British Boxing #Shameful."" DeGale had only ever lost to George Groves in his career back in 2011 Minnesota's Truax achieved his goal in the sport of paying off his student debt with this bout but he will leave the UK with so much more thanks to a game fighting style which unsettled DeGale from the second round onwards. DeGale, 31, found himself backed to the ropes consistently and while there were flurries of good work, Truax's solid straight shot rocked his head in the third and a left hook landed crisply in the fourth. But it was the fifth where trouble really arose for the champion. He was bloodied and Truax delivered variety with good body work, a clean uppercut and later ramrod right. BBC Radio 5 live's ringside pundit Adam Booth pointed to DeGale showing ""immense signs of distress"" as he offered little in return. Earlier in the year, DeGale told BBC Sport he did not want too many more battles like he shared with Jack in January. But he had no choice but to dig in and take punishment as this slipped away from him. Two counter lefts in the seventh gave DeGale hope he had stemmed the flow but the challenger still walked his man down, digging a right hook into the left abdomen in the eighth. A good body shot from the 2008 Olympic champion briefly threatened to save him in the 10th but Truax was not to be denied as he dished up DeGale's second career loss. Truax had contested a world title once before but lost to Daniel Jacobs in 2015 Caleb Truax on BBC Radio 5 live:""He was sleeping and now he's going to have nightmares about me. ""All week all I heard was who he's going to fight next. Well, guess what, those fights are mine now. I'd love to [fight in the UK again]. I'm staying until Wednesday - if anybody sees me, buy some pints."" BBC pundit and world-level trainer Adam Booth:""An hour ago James was world champion and thinking about unifying belts. Now he's being asked if he's a has-been former champion and it's brutal. It's easy for us to say we know what he can do and he didn't do it tonight, so he can't do it anymore. That's not necessarily the case."" Elsewhere on the night, IBF world featherweight championLee Selbyclaimed a wide points winagainst Mexico's Eduardo Ramirez to all but seal an all-British dust up with Leeds' Josh Warrington early in 2018. Selby could not lose his title after Ramirez failed to make weight for the bout which was supposed form part of a world-title double header. But the 30-year-old excelled nonetheless, showcasing evasive footwork to move to 26 wins from 27 fights. WBO European light-heavyweight championAnthony Yardebecame the first man to stop the durable Nikola Sjekloca, completing the win with impressive combinations in round four. And heavyweight prospectDaniel Duboistook his record to six knockouts from six fights with a second-round stoppage of Wales' Dorian Darch.

"One of the UK's largest teaching unions is calling for schools to ban energy drinks from their premises. The NASUWT is warning about caffeine levels in the drinks, describing them as ""readily available legal highs"" which can contribute to poor behaviour. It follows a report by academics, seen by 5 live investigates, calling on the government to consider making the sale of the drinks illegal to under-16s. But the British Soft Drinks Association says the drinks have been deemed safe. Academics from FUSE - the Centre for Transitional Research in Public Health in the North East - found children as young as 10 are buying energy drinks because they are ""cheaper than water or pop"". Children told them they buy the drinks for as little as 25p, and that they choose energy drinks to ""fit in"" or ""look tough"". They also found that the drinks are targeted at young people online in pop-up adverts, on TV, in computer games, and through sports sponsorship. A typical energy drink contains 32mg of caffeine per 100ml and cans carry warnings saying they are ""not recommended for children"". A single 500ml can contains 160mg of caffeine, equivalent to around two shots of espresso coffee. The researchers highlight European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidance which recommends an intake of no more than 105mg caffeine per day for an average 11-year-old. They also point out that young people in the UK are among the highest consumers of energy drinks in Europe. Figures from the British Soft Drinks Association show sales of energy drinks increased by 185% between 2006 and 2015, equating to 672 million litres consumed in 2015, and a total market value of over Â£2bn. Why our school bans energy drinks Ban energy drinks sales to children, Welsh Government urged Darren Northcott, NASUWT national official for education, said: ""Teachers have registered concerns with the NASUWT about the contribution of high energy drinks to poor pupil behaviour as a result of pupils consuming excessive quantities of these drinks. ""They are popular among young people who often think they are just another soft drink, and young people and parents are often not aware of the very high levels of stimulants that these drinks contain. ""They are readily available legal highs sold in vending machines, supermarkets and corner shops."" He added: ""The evidence of the impact of these drinks, including that uncovered by 5 live, is compelling and serves to emphasise that further action needs to be taken. ""The NASUWT has always been clear that drinks with high levels of sugar should not be sold on school premises. It is time to look again at the School Food Standards, and the enforcement of the standards, to make sure that every school in the country is free of highly-caffeinated soft drinks, as well as those that are high in sugar."" Victoria Stean, from Milton Keynes, started consuming energy drinks when she was 16 and was soon drinking around seven 500ml cans a day. She said: ""I was definitely hooked. I would have a can for breakfast, another one mid-morning, and several in the afternoon. ""It took me a while to wean myself off energy drinks.  I would get headaches if I didn't drink them.  Since I have stopped drinking them I have lost weight and my vision has improved again. ""Ironically, I also have more energy now and I sleep better."" Victoria was able to lose half her body weight after she stopped drinking around seven 500ml cans of energy drinks a day. Norman Lamb, chair of the Commons Science and Technology Committee and a former Liberal Democrat health minister, said: ""The potential health risks and impact on sleep of energy drinks is something I would like the committee to consider evidence on in the new year. He added that ""given epidemic levels of consumption among under-16s we have to consider banning the sale of these drinks to that group"". In a statement, the British Soft Drinks Association, which represents manufacturers, said: ""Energy drinks and their ingredients have been deemed safe by regulatory authorities around the world. ""In 2010 we introduced a voluntary Code of Practice to support consumers who want to make informed choices. In 2015 this was updated to include more stringent guidelines around marketing and promoting, including reference to in and around schools."" The Food Standards Agency said: ""The FSA reviews guidance when significant new work in the subject area becomes available. Our current guidance was developed following the European Food Safety Authority's assessment of caffeine in 2015."" 5 live Investigates: Energy Drinksis broadcast on Sunday 10th December 2017 at 11am GMT.

"The mummy is believed to be that of a senior official from the New Kingdom Archaeologists in Egypt have displayed items, including a mummy, from one of two previously unexplored tombs in the ancient Nile city of Luxor. The mummy is believed to be that of a senior official from Egypt's ""New Kingdom"", about 3,500 years ago. Other items included figurines, wooden masks and richly coloured wall paintings. The tombs lie in the Draa Abul Naga necropolis, an area famed for its temples and burial grounds. It is close to the Valley of the Kings where many of ancient Egypt's pharaohs were buried. Egypt's antiquities ministry said that the tombs had been discovered by a German archaeologist in the 1990s, but were kept sealed until recently. Antiquities expert Mustafa al-Waziri showed reporters the intricate wall murals inside the tomb Painted wooden masks were found inside the excavated tomb The identity of the mummified body is not known but the ministry says there are two possibilities. It could be a person named Djehuty Mes, whose name is engraved on one of the walls, or it could be  a scribe called Maati whose name - and the name of his wife, Mehi - are written on funerary cones, officials said. The other tomb was only recently ""uncovered"" and has not yet been fully excavated, the ministry said. In September, archaeologists discovered the tomb of a royal goldsmith near Luxor. The tomb, which also dated back to the New Kingdom, contained a statue of the goldsmith Amenemhat, sitting beside his wife.

"Truax (left) gained real impetus in the fifth round James DeGale says he will ""go back to the drawing board"" after his shock defeat by American Caleb Truax at London's Copper Box Arena. DeGale lost his IBF world super-middleweight title as Truax won 114-114 115-112 116-112 on the cards. The Briton was as short as 1-100 with some bookmakers as he fought for the first time since January. ""There's something missing in the ring,"" said 31-year-old DeGale, who had shoulder surgery in July. Truax, 34, offered constant pressure and rocked DeGale in the fifth as a stiff right drew gasps in the venue. DeGale, timid for large parts, rallied late on but Truax took the title. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live after the fight, DeGale - who suffered his second professional defeat - added: ""I honestly did [think I'd won], I've got to go back to the drawing board. ""My nose is blocked again, I've got to sort it out. The shoulder - I had serious reconstruction - there's no pain but I'll have to go back, have a look and see. I've probably rushed back to be honest, maybe I should have waited till next year."" He added: ""I'm going to speak to Al Haymon [his boxing advisor] later, maybe I can get a rematch."" Truax, who extended his record to 29-3, said: ""All week all I heard was who he's going to fight next. Well guess what? Those fights are mine now. ""I'd love to [fight in the UK again]. I'm staying until Wednesday - if anybody sees me, buy some pints."" Relive DeGale's shock defeat by Truax Champion Selby scores Ramirez points win Lomachenko wins as Rigondeaux retires Truax threw his arms aloft before the final bell and when it sounded he dropped to his knees Truax sank to his knees on the bell and was convinced he had landed arguably the biggest shock the sport has seen this year. While DeGale had questions to answer following shoulder surgery in July and having suffered ear and dental damage in drawing with Badou Jack in January, he was expected to shine against the 34-year-old, who was contesting a world title for the second time. Big money bouts with WBA super-middleweight champion George Groves, or other stellar names at the weight such as Callum Smith or Chris Eubank Jr will likely now have to wait and afterwards DeGale said he hoped for a rematch. Shortly after the fight, Groves tweeted: ""Call it a day, mate, you ain't got it no more."" Eubank Jr wrote: ""After all the trash talk and disrespectful comments James DeGale you go and put on a display like that! All I can say is WOW! You have properly let down British Boxing #Shameful."" DeGale had only ever lost to George Groves in his career back in 2011 Minnesota's Truax achieved his goal in the sport of paying off his student debt with this bout but he will leave the UK with so much more thanks to a game fighting style which unsettled DeGale from the second round onwards. DeGale, 31, found himself backed to the ropes consistently and while there were flurries of good work, Truax's solid straight shot rocked his head in the third and a left hook landed crisply in the fourth. But it was the fifth where trouble really arose for the champion. He was bloodied and Truax delivered variety with good body work, a clean uppercut and later ramrod right. BBC Radio 5 live's ringside pundit Adam Booth pointed to DeGale showing ""immense signs of distress"" as he offered little in return. Earlier in the year, DeGale told BBC Sport he did not want too many more battles like he shared with Jack in January. But he had no choice but to dig in and take punishment as this slipped away from him. Two counter lefts in the seventh gave DeGale hope he had stemmed the flow but the challenger still walked his man down, digging a right hook into the left abdomen in the eighth. A good body shot from the 2008 Olympic champion briefly threatened to save him in the 10th but Truax was not to be denied as he dished up DeGale's second career loss. Truax had contested a world title once before but lost to Daniel Jacobs in 2015 Caleb Truax on BBC Radio 5 live:""He was sleeping and now he's going to have nightmares about me. ""All week all I heard was who he's going to fight next. Well, guess what, those fights are mine now. I'd love to [fight in the UK again]. I'm staying until Wednesday - if anybody sees me, buy some pints."" BBC pundit and world-level trainer Adam Booth:""An hour ago James was world champion and thinking about unifying belts. Now he's being asked if he's a has-been former champion and it's brutal. It's easy for us to say we know what he can do and he didn't do it tonight, so he can't do it anymore. That's not necessarily the case."" Elsewhere on the night, IBF world featherweight championLee Selbyclaimed a wide points winagainst Mexico's Eduardo Ramirez to all but seal an all-British dust up with Leeds' Josh Warrington early in 2018. Selby could not lose his title after Ramirez failed to make weight for the bout which was supposed form part of a world-title double header. But the 30-year-old excelled nonetheless, showcasing evasive footwork to move to 26 wins from 27 fights. WBO European light-heavyweight championAnthony Yardebecame the first man to stop the durable Nikola Sjekloca, completing the win with impressive combinations in round four. And heavyweight prospectDaniel Duboistook his record to six knockouts from six fights with a second-round stoppage of Wales' Dorian Darch.

Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested on a visit to see her parents with her baby daughter Gabriella. After the arrest her daughter's passport was confiscated and for the last 20 months she has been living with her maternal grandparents in Iran. The case was further complicated when Mr Johnson erroneously told a parliamentary committee in November that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran to train journalists. The foreign secretary laterapologised in the Commons, retracting ""any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity"". This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) Reports suggest Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe could appear in court on Sunday to face new charges and possibly have her sentence doubled as a result of Mr Johnson's comments.

He added: ""Fingers crossed it can be solved by Christmas, which means in the week or so afterwards there might be a happy outcome."" By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent As Boris Johnson and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif shook hands on their way into talks it could have seemed routine. But there was nothing routine about this encounter. The foreign secretary looked uncharacteristically tense, and with good reason. His mission - to improve relations - point to Britain's continuing support for the Iran nuclear deal, while at the same time being critical of Iran's actions in Yemen and Syria. And, hardest of all, argue for prisoner releases, including Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a case many accuse him of damaging by loose talk last month. Boris Johnson will say nothing at all publicly while in Iran, such is the sensitivity of his visit. But in one good sign, Iran's foreign minister confirmed Mr Johnson should be able to meet President Rouhani on Sunday. We should not expect immediate consequences, but Iran is in little doubt of the importance the British side attaches to getting Ms Zahari-Ratcliffe home. Relations between the UK and Iran have long been difficult. Mr Johnson's visit is only the third by a British foreign minister to Iran in the last 14 years. The Foreign Office would not confirm the names or number of other dual nationals being held, saying their families had asked for their cases to be kept out of the public domain. Speaking ahead of his visit, Mr Johnson said the talks would cover the ""bilateral relationship and I will stress my grave concerns about our dual national consular cases and press for their release where there are humanitarian grounds to do so"". Last month, the Free Nazanin Campaign saidMrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had suffered panic attacks, insomnia, bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and had been given a health assessment.

"Rescuers faced challenging conditions with sub-zero temperatures and snow One of Britain's worst train crashes is to be remembered in a memorial service. The Castlecary rail disaster cost 35 people their lives in a freezing snowstorm on a December Friday night in 1937. Another 179 were hurt in the tragedy when an Edinburgh to Glasgow express ploughed into a stationary train just west of Castlecary village. An inquiry found a signalling error led the driver of the express to believe the line was clear. The crash happened in the evening of 10 December 1937 as the express from Edinburgh Waverley was travelling at high speed in a blizzard. Both the express and the other train, from Dundee, were bound for Glasgow's Queen Street Station. The Edinburgh to Glasgow train crashed into the back of a stationary Dundee train heading for Queen Street Thirty five people died and 179 were injured in the disaster The Dundee train was running late and had stopped at signals outside Castlecary Station when the express train rammed into the stationary carriages. An investigation after the incident found a signaller error was to blame, with driver error and challenging weather conditions contributing factors. For years the disaster was remembered by the local people in Castlecary with a makeshift memorial by the side of the railway. But, keen to create a fitting tribute to those who died and those who helped in the aftermath of the terrible tragedy, Castlecary Community Council created a permanent memorial in 2007, made from railway sleepers, pieces of track and a wheel from a piece of rolling stock. It is at this memorial that the victims of the disaster will be remembered on Sunday evening. Locals fought to save passengers Official documents from the time of the disaster Secretary of the community council Albert McBeath said the memory of the tragedy endured despite the passage of time. ""I knew a lot of people who remembered and had seen the aftermath,"" she said. ""It must have been horrendous, in one of our worst winters, the temperature was -20C. ""I moved to the village 30 years ago and have always heard people talking about it. ""Even now, they have grandparents who remember what happened after the crash."" Falkirk councillor Billy Buchanan will be joined for a short service by the Provost of North Lanarkshire to remember those who lost their lives. They will also pay tribute to a later crash in 1968 which saw the loss of two men.

"Mr Nasralla, 64, is leading a left-wing coalition Opposition parties in Honduras have formally demanded the annulment of last month's presidential election. It triggered deadly street violence amid allegations of vote-rigging. The main opposition contender, Salvador Nasralla, accused the electoral authorities of tampering with the results in favour of the incumbent, Juan Orlando HernÃ¡ndez. Official results show that Mr HernÃ¡ndez won the vote by a narrow margin, but a partial recount is under way. ""We are not making a simple demand,"" said Mr Nasralla. ""The whole world knows what has happened and I do not believe the world will allow Honduras be robbed of the people's will,"" he added. Mr HernÃ¡ndez, 49, is seeking a new four-year term The partial recount was requested by the regional body, the Organisation for American States (OAS). It said that the electoral court must check a number of alleged irregularities before announcing a result for the 26 November poll. Votes from nearly 5,000 ballot boxes are being tallied again. Officials say results are due to be announced by Monday. Mr Nasralla had established a five-point lead over Mr HernÃ¡ndez on the first day of counting. But the gap began to close after a computer problem was reported at the vote tallying centre in the capital, Tegucigalpa. Government supporters say the opposition should accept defeat Mr HernÃ¡ndez eventually won by 1.6 percentage points. Thousands of people took to the streets in rival demonstrations over the past two weeks. Human rights group Amnesty International says 14 people died in days of clashes. The government imposed a curfew, which was lifted after on Friday, as violence was controlled. The electoral tribunal has until 26 December to publish the result of the election.

"Claire Hart was shot with daughter Charlotte days after leaving her husband Luke Hart could never have foreseen his ""controlling"" father would kill his mother and sister in July 2016. Claire Hart, 50, was shot dead outside a swimming pool in Spalding, Lincs, with daughter Charlotte, 19, days after finally moving out of the family house. Luke and the other surviving brother Ryan say dangers can easily be missed. They spoke as figures showed more than 113 women in England, Northern Ireland and Wales in 2016 were killed by men - two thirds a current or ex-partner. TheFemicide Census,external, based on information from police and media reports, found 85 of the 113 women killed by men last year were in their own homes. There were 100 women killed by someone they knew - including 78 by an existing or former partner. According to the figures, more than three quarters of women who were killed by a former partner died within the first year of separating from them. Lance Hart, 57, shot his wife Claire and daughter Charlotte with an unregistered single-barrel shotgun before turning the weapon on himself. Claire had left her husband, moving out of the family's home in Moulton four days earlier. Luke, 28, and his brother Ryan, 27, both engineers, were working abroad at the time of the killings but had helped their mother and sister find a new rented house a few weeks before. Luke with his sister Charlotte ""I don't think anything could ever, no matter how bad it was, lead you to expect what happened,"" Luke said. ""The second we stepped out of line, he was willing to kill all of us and I don't think anyone appreciated that."" Killer father was 'like a terrorist' In a newspaper interview earlier this year,,externalthe brothers talked about how their father ""rationed"" Claire's supermarket job wages. Recalling growing up, Luke told the BBC: ""Our father didn't need to hit us. He generated enough fear in ways that were subtler."" He added: ""People fail to appreciate that many victims of abuse are just incredibly resilient people dealing with the traumas of their lives the best way they can. ""A lot of education needs to be done in terms of abusive behaviour and also the way people will respond to abusive behaviour. I didn't understand them myself, none of us did."" Ryan with Charlotte According tofigures from the Office for National Statistics,,externala total of 601 homicides - cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide - were committed in England and Wales in 2016. Figures for 2016 have not been published in Northern Ireland but there were 17 homicides in the year to the end of March 2017 and 21 in the previous 12 months. The Femicide Census says the total number of killings of women by men in 2016 is thought to be higher than the 113 it recorded because a number of cases are still under investigation and police forces did not provide some details to its freedom of information requests. The figures were compiled by academic Karen Ingala Smith and the domestic abuse charity Women's Aid who say they make clear the ""disparity in the sexes of the victim and perpetrator"" was not always clear from official crime data. Ms Ingala Smith, chief executive of the organisation nia, which campaigns to end violence against women, said: ""By breaking the barriers through which we contextualise violent crime, we're able to build a different picture, a broader picture, about what causes and influences violence."" Katie Ghose, chief executive of Women's Aid, called on the government to provide a ""long-term and sustainable funding model for a national network of refuges...

"They're behind you! Firefighters on stage during the Perth Theatre pantomime The first performance at Perth Theatre in four years defied all expectations when two real-life firefighters appeared on stage. A smoke alarm mid-way through Aladdin on Saturday forced the evacuation of the Edwardian theatre whichhas just had a Â£16.6m refurbishment. After checks to the building, the show resumed with one of the actors carried back on stage by the firefighters. The theatre management blamed a ""snagging"" fault for the alarm. Theatregoers enjoyed some unexpected excitement Gwylym Gibbons, chief executive of Horsecross Arts which runs the theatre, said: ""There was a lovely moment when the firefighters came on stage, carrying one of the cast members. ""The beauty of pantomime is that you can adapt it to the moment - and everyone got back into the panto spirit."" The theatre's 500-seat B-listed Edwardian auditorium has been closed for four years while it was restored to its former glory. A new 200-capacity performance studio has also been created to encourage new writing, music and dance. The Edwardian auditorium has been restored to its former glory The refurbishment includes a new box office, cafe, bar and shop Artistic director Lu Kemp said the cast became accustomed to dealing with unforeseen events during rehearsals. She said: ""It's been hilarious. At times we've had rehearsals where a couple of builders with a very long pipe will walk through the room. ""But it's nothing that's ever got in the way of rehearsals: it's just added an extra layer of hilarity to the whole event.""

"Claire Hart was shot with daughter Charlotte days after leaving her husband Luke Hart could never have foreseen his ""controlling"" father would kill his mother and sister in July 2016. Claire Hart, 50, was shot dead outside a swimming pool in Spalding, Lincs, with daughter Charlotte, 19, days after finally moving out of the family house. Luke and the other surviving brother Ryan say dangers can easily be missed. They spoke as figures showed more than 113 women in England, Northern Ireland and Wales in 2016 were killed by men - two thirds a current or ex-partner. TheFemicide Census,external, based on information from police and media reports, found 85 of the 113 women killed by men last year were in their own homes. There were 100 women killed by someone they knew - including 78 by an existing or former partner. According to the figures, more than three quarters of women who were killed by a former partner died within the first year of separating from them. Lance Hart, 57, shot his wife Claire and daughter Charlotte with an unregistered single-barrel shotgun before turning the weapon on himself. Claire had left her husband, moving out of the family's home in Moulton four days earlier. Luke, 28, and his brother Ryan, 27, both engineers, were working abroad at the time of the killings but had helped their mother and sister find a new rented house a few weeks before. Luke with his sister Charlotte ""I don't think anything could ever, no matter how bad it was, lead you to expect what happened,"" Luke said. ""The second we stepped out of line, he was willing to kill all of us and I don't think anyone appreciated that."" Killer father was 'like a terrorist' In a newspaper interview earlier this year,,externalthe brothers talked about how their father ""rationed"" Claire's supermarket job wages. Recalling growing up, Luke told the BBC: ""Our father didn't need to hit us. He generated enough fear in ways that were subtler."" He added: ""People fail to appreciate that many victims of abuse are just incredibly resilient people dealing with the traumas of their lives the best way they can. ""A lot of education needs to be done in terms of abusive behaviour and also the way people will respond to abusive behaviour. I didn't understand them myself, none of us did."" Ryan with Charlotte According tofigures from the Office for National Statistics,,externala total of 601 homicides - cases of murder, manslaughter and infanticide - were committed in England and Wales in 2016. Figures for 2016 have not been published in Northern Ireland but there were 17 homicides in the year to the end of March 2017 and 21 in the previous 12 months. The Femicide Census says the total number of killings of women by men in 2016 is thought to be higher than the 113 it recorded because a number of cases are still under investigation and police forces did not provide some details to its freedom of information requests. The figures were compiled by academic Karen Ingala Smith and the domestic abuse charity Women's Aid who say they make clear the ""disparity in the sexes of the victim and perpetrator"" was not always clear from official crime data. Ms Ingala Smith, chief executive of the organisation nia, which campaigns to end violence against women, said: ""By breaking the barriers through which we contextualise violent crime, we're able to build a different picture, a broader picture, about what causes and influences violence."" Katie Ghose, chief executive of Women's Aid, called on the government to provide a ""long-term and sustainable funding model for a national network of refuges... [to] ensure that every woman can safely escape domestic abuse"". The Home Office said the number of refuge spaces available in England has increased by almost 10% since 2010 to 3,810 this year, while local authorities are overseeing new schemes that allow victims to remain in their homes.
