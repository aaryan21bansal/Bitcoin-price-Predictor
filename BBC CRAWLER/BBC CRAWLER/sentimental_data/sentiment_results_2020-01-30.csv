"The paper said the duke did not make it clear on Instagram that the elephant, pictured, had been tethered with a rope around its hind legs Prince Harry has lost a complaint against the Mail on Sunday over a story the paper ran about photos of African wildlife he posted on Instagram. The Mail said the duke - who had posted to mark Earth Day - had not made it clear the animals had been tranquilised and the elephant was tethered. He argued he did not need to say this because he had stated they were being moved as part of a conservation scheme. He complained to the press watchdog Ipso that the article was inaccurate. The duke argued the paper breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editor's Code of Practice in the article, which was published in April last year. The Mail on Sunday's story was headlined ""Drugged and tethered... what Harry didn't tell you about those awe-inspiring wildlife photos"". In it, the article said the images of a rhino, lion and elephant - posted on Harry's Instagram account to highlight Earth Day - ""don't quite tell the full story"". Earth Day is an annual global event to celebrate the world and encourage greater understanding about the environment and climate change. The newspaper reported the duke had ""notably avoided explaining the circumstances in which the images were taken"". It added that followers of Sussex Royal, the Instagram account the duke shares with wife, Meghan, were unable to see a rope around the hind legs of the elephant because of the way the photo was edited. Harry said that the image had been cropped due to Instagram's formatting requirements, which the newspaper disputed. In its ruling, Ipso said,externalthe prince had stated that ""he had not misled the public by failing to explain the circumstances in which the photograph of the elephant had been taken and that the article was inaccurate in claiming that he had sought to mislead the public by deliberately publishing an edited version of the photograph"". But Ipso ruled there had been no breach of the accuracy clause, adding it did not believe it was ""significantly misleading to report that the photographs posted on the complainant's Instagram account did not quite tell the full story and that the complainant had not explained the circumstances in which the photographs had been taken.""

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton There will be ""no haggle"" over Harry Dunn's death and investigations of Prince Andrew's Jeffery Epstein connections, the government says. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab responded after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked if there was a ""deal to be done"" regarding the cases. Mr Raab stressed the extradition treaty with the US is ""rules-based"" and there would be no ""barter"" over the cases. Mr Dunn's family is treating the developments ""with caution"". The 19-year-old died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August, before suspect Anne Sacoolas left for the US, citing diplomatic immunity over the case. In his response to the question, Mr Pompeo said Mr Dunn's case and the investigation into allegations about Prince Andrew would be ""resolved on their merits"". Prince Andrew has stepped back from royal duties for the ""foreseeable future"" At an event in London alongside Mr Raab, Mr Pompeo was asked if there was ""a deal to be done"" over Prince Andrew and Mrs Sacoolas. The secretary of state replied: ""Yeah, I can answer that. I am confident each of these cases will be resolved on their relative merits."" Mr Raab added: ""There is no barter, it's a rules-based approach. That's what the treaty does. ""We both see that the extradition treaty serves both sides. And we want to make it work. So, that's the approach. ""There is no haggle and no-one's raised Prince Andrew. Frankly, no-one has ever raised that with me."" Mr Pompeo countered: ""Yes, now they have."" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in London meeting Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab The developments come after US attorney Geoffrey Bermansaid on Mondaythat Prince Andrew had provided ""zero co-operation"" to an inquiry into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein accusers 'outraged' by Prince Andrew Dunn family meeting with minister 'very honest' US rejects Harry Dunn death extradition request Prosecutors and the FBI have contacted his lawyers but have received no reply according to the lead investigator, Mr Berman. Prince Andrew says he did not see, or suspect, any suspicious behaviour when visiting the homes of Mr Epstein. Buckingham Palace said the prince's legal team was dealing with the issue. Mr Dunn died after being fatally injured outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving last month. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Radd Seiger, spokesman for Mr Dunn's family, has noted that despite his clients' caution, ""the secretary of state is no longer saying [Mrs Sacoolas] will not return"". ""We treat these words with caution but it is clear that Mr Raab has followed through on his promise to the family that he would make it clear to the secretary of state that he will not accept anything less than Anne Sacoolas' return,"" he said. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the family has stressed ""right from the outset that Anne Sacoolas must face the legal system here"". ""There is no other way and no-one is above the law, diplomat or not, as the Vienna Convention makes clear,"" she added.

"His family said joining the marines fulfilled his dream A Royal Marine who died in hospital following an incident in training has been named as Ethan Jones. He was part of a group practising an assault from a landing craft on Tregantle beach, Cornwall, when he went under the water on 21 January. The 20-year-old was taken to hospital where he died on Friday. The Royal Navy is investigating the incident. His family said: ""Ethan died fulfilling his dream and doing something he loved."" They continued: ""Joining the Royal Marines was something Ethan had wanted to do for as long as we can remember. He wanted to join the best of the best and challenge himself. ""Ethan loved the outdoor lifestyle and was looking forward to serving as a Marine on operations around the world.  We are very proud of all that he achieved."" Mr Jones was born in Bath and lived in Westfield, Radstock. He had joined the Royal Marines in May and was in the last phase of the 32 weeks training. He was awarded the Commando medal as voted for by his fellow recruits His inquest opened at Plymouth Coroner's Court earlier and heard he exited a landing craft and was submerged in sea water for about five minutes. He was given treatment at Derriford Hospital where scans showed he had a brain injury and minimal brain activity. Cpl Dave Wright, his section commander, said his attitude was ""consistently noted in training"". ""As an example, during an exercise, the troop were fatigued, yet Jones took it upon himself to place his equipment down at the top of a hill, go back down and carry the kit of a fellow recruit who was struggling with an injury. ""He is a true loss to the Royal Marines as he would have inevitably achieved much within his career."" Fellow Recruit Daniel Landrey said: ""He was our best mate and we know he would not want this much fuss made of him. ""Lucky for him it does not take more than a few words to describe Jonesy. When he didn't have a pasty in his hand, he was getting the job done. No complaining, no fuss, just always sending it."" During training he had been selected as a recruit section commander and was awarded the Commando Medal, which is voted for by recruits for the individual who best personifies the Commando Spirit.

"Travel out of China has been severely restricted British nationals trapped in Wuhan will return home later, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. A flight carrying 150 Britons and 50 EU citizens was scheduled to leave China for at 07:00 local time (23:00 GMT Thursday), but it has been delayed. They will fly to RAF Brize Norton before the UK nationals are quarantined at a centre believed to be Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral. The remaining passengers will then fly to another EU airport. The World Health Organization (WHO)has declared an international public health emergencyover the outbreak. And the UK's four chief medical officers have said they were raising the risk level from low to moderate. ""This does not mean we think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed at this stage, but that government should plan for all eventualities,"" a joint statement said. They added that it was ""likely"" there would be ""individual"" cases of coronavirus in the UK. But they said they were confident the heath services would be able to protect the public and provide high quality care. So far, the virus has caused 213 deaths in China, where health officials have confirmed 9,692 cases. Elsewhere, 98 cases have been confirmed across 15 other countries. As of Wednesday,161 tests have been carried out,externalon people across the UK - all with negative results. The flight to repatriate UK citizens comes as airline Virgin Atlantic announced it had suspended its flights between Britain and China due to fears about the spread of the virus. Passengers flying from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, will be checked by Chinese officials at a handling centre in the airport, then taken to its departure area where they will be met by British officials. Anyone who is unwell will not be allowed to board the flight, which will have a team of Ministry of Defence medics on board. Wirral West MP Margaret Greenwood said she was told by the health secretary that the government did not think any of the people being flown back from Wuhan would be carrying the virus. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said he understood UK passengers would be taken to NHS staff accommodation. They will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"", a Downing Street spokesman said. The flight had been due to leave Wuhan earlier but was delayed because of a lack of clearance from Chinese authorities. Coronavirus declared global health emergency What virus does to the body Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak What does being in quarantine mean? In a statement, Mr Raab said: ""The safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. ""Our embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need."" In other developments: Downing Street said it was pressing Beijing to allow spouses or partners of UK nationals to be on the Wuhan flight Scotland's chief medical officer said a case of coronavirus was""highly likely"" to be detected in the country in the coming days British Airways has extended its cancellation of services to mainland China until 29 February. Virgin Atlantic flights between Heathrow and Shanghai are continuing to operate as scheduled Matt Raw has chosen to stay in Wuhan because his wife has been prevented from travelling Britons have told of family members with Chinese citizenship being not being permitted to travel by local authorities. Matt Raw lives in Wuhan with his mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, and his wife - who helps care for her. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme his spouse had been prevented from flying so the whole family was staying. He said they were also concerned about the risks of flying, having seen reports that three Japanese people on evacuation flights were found to have the virus. Adam Bridgeman said he would stay in Wuhan if his wife and one-month-old son were not allowed to fly with him. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that remaining in Wuhan with a newborn was ""a tough situation"" as they were ""not willing to take the risk"" of bringing him to hospital for routine treatment such as vaccinations. Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, with Japan, the US and the EU among those repatriating their citizens. This video can not be played Jeff Siddle's wife will have to stay behind in Wuhan when he leaves with their daughter It is a basic question, but the answer is elusive. It is far too simplistic to take the 170 deaths and the 7,711 cases and come up with a death rate of 2%. We are in the middle of the outbreak and thousands of those patients are still being treated. We don't know if they will live or die, so they can't be used in these calculations. We also don't know how many mild and undetected cases are out there. Also, the deadliness of the new virus is only one component of its threat. Flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, not because it is super-deadly, but because it is able to infect so many people.

"The UK will officially leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT, ending 47 years of membership. In a video message to be released an hour earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who led the 2016 campaign to leave - will call Brexit a ""new dawn"". Pro and anti-Brexit demonstrations and marches are being held across the country, as the UK flag is taken down from EU institutions in Brussels. Little will change immediately, as the UKbegins a ""transition period"". Most EU laws will continue to be in force - including the free movement of people - until the end of December, by which time the UK aims to have reached a permanent free trade agreement with the EU. LIVE: UK gets ready to leave the EU Kuenssberg: UK heading for the EU departure lounge Bells and bunting for Brexit, or shedding a tear? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the country had to ""move on"" after Brexit and needed to ""make sure we maintain good relations"" with the EU and not ""fall into the arms of a free trade deal with the United States"". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK ""must be united in a common vision for our country, however great our differences on achieving it"". Former Prime Minister David Cameron, who led the campaign to remain in the EU during the referendum, said he believed the UK could ""make a success of the choice that we made"". And Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""At last the day comes when we break free. A massive victory for the people against the establishment."" Brexit supporters are gathering in Parliament Square Supporters of the EU are expected to take part in a procession through Whitehall Brexit was originally scheduled for 29 March last year but was repeatedly delayed when MPs rejected a previous withdrawal agreement reached by the EU and former Prime Minister Theresa May. Mr Johnson got his own deal through Parliament after winning December's general election with a House of Commons majority of 80, on a pledge to ""get Brexit done"". This brought to an end more than three years of political argument, following the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of UK voters backed leaving the EU. Sir John Curtice: Do Britons now agree about Brexit? Brexitcast: The live final Lib Dems plea to unite in fight for soft Brexit 12 moments in the UK-EU relationship Boris Johnson arrives at the National Glass Centre in Sunderland The prime minister held a cabinet meeting at the National Glass Centre, a museum and arts centre in Sunderland, the city that was the first to back Brexit when results were announced after the referendum. The meeting was held amid tight security. Sunderland University students posted a video on social media of a small group of protesters chanting ""Boris you're not welcome here"" and ""Tory cuts not welcome here"". Mr Johnson told the Cabinet it was time to start a ""new chapter in the United Kingdom's story"" and end the division of the past three and a half years, according to a Downing Street spokesman. The Cabinet discussed future trade deals, including seeking a a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU, and Mr Johnson thanked Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay for the work of his department, which is being wound up. The PM told ministers the government aimed to have 80% of the UK's trade with other nations covered by free trade agreements within three years. Ministers also received updates from Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on measures to deal with the coronavirus. In his video message, filmed in Downing Street, Mr Johnson will say: ""The most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end but a beginning. ""This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act. It is a moment of real national renewal and change."" This video can not be played Brexit: The last four years in under two minutes Supporters of the EU have taken part in a procession through Whitehall to ""bid a fond farewell"" to the union. Later, Brexiteers will gather in Parliament Square for a celebration, and a clock counting down to the moment the UK leaves the EU will be projected on to Downing Street. Buildings along Whitehall will be lit up and Union flags line Parliament Square. A new commemorative 50p coin will also come into circulation to mark the UK's withdrawal. However, Big Ben will not chime at 23:00 GMT due to ongoing renovation works. How the UK celebrated joining Europe Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit How the UK celebrated joining Europe Tears and relief as the UK's MEPs bid goodbye Mr Johnson will host an evening reception in Downing Street for cabinet ministers, No 10 advisers, civil servants, those involved in the negotiations and supporters of the campaign to leave the EU. They will be served English sparkling wine and a selection of canapÃ©s including fillet of lamb on toast, Shropshire blue cheese, beef and Yorkshire pudding with horseradish sauce, mushrooms tarts and roast chicken skewers. A coach party travelled from Southampton to Parliament Square to celebrate Brexit In Brussels, the UK flag will be removed from the EU institutions, with one Union flag expected to be consigned to a museum. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen paid tribute to UK citizens who had ""contributed to the European Union and made it stronger"". Upcoming trade negotiations would be ""fair"" but each side would fight for its interests, she added. But European Council President Charles Michel warned: ""The more the UK will diverge from the EU standards, the less access to the single market it will have."" His predecessor, Donald Tusk, told the BBC's Andrew Marr show, in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, that he could not see the UK rejoining the EU in his lifetime. ""This new reality will be for life. I mean for my generation,"" he said. Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O'Neill takes part in a demonstration at the border Anti-Brexit campaigners have demanded Northern Ireland - where a majority voted to remain in the EU - continues to have a voice in the EU after the UK leaves. During one of a series of protests planned at the Irish border through Friday, Border Communities Against Brexit activists unveiled a billboard declaring the ""fight goes on"". They urged the Irish government and the restored Stormont executive to push for some form of continued representation in EU structures. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. In Scotland, which also voted to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum, candlelit vigils are planned. In a speech in Edinburgh, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Scotland was being ""taken out of the European Union against the wishes of the overwhelming majority""of its people. Speaking in Cardiff, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales, which voted to leave the EU,remained a ""European nation"". Liberal Democrat acting leader Sir Ed Davey vowed his pro-EU party would ""never stop fighting"" to have the ""closest possible relationship"" with Europe and try to prevent a ""hard Brexit hurting British people"".

"One Facebook user responded to the police appeal saying: ""Kudos to the burglar who did over Sauron's house"" Police were inundated with Lord of the Rings jokes after posting an appeal looking for the owner of a ""precious"" piece of jewellery. North Yorkshire Police seemed unaware of the JRR Tolkien connection when they shared photos of the ""distinctive silver ring"" on Facebook. Thousands of people soon responded with gifs and memes referencing the famous fantasy novel and film series. The force replied: ""We obviously need to brush up on our movie knowledge."" The ring, which features the Elven lettering seen in Peter Jackson's film trilogy, was found with property stolen from a house in York, last February. Police shared a series of pictures on Facebook in the hope that someone would recognise the markings: Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

"Jo took out a number of loans with Wonga after losing her full-time job People who were mis-sold loans by the payday lender Wonga have been told that they will receive just 4.3% of the compensation they are owed. Administrators have begun informing around 400,000 claimants by letter, some of whom have reacted in dismay. Before its collapse, Wonga was vilified for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. One ex-customer told BBC News it was ""an insult"" to borrowers. ""Trust has really been damaged by this company, and the amount of compensation is an insult to the people that have been hurt by this,"" said Jo from Basingstoke. After Jo lost her full-time job and started in a role with fewer hours, she took out a series of loans with Wonga between 2010 and 2014 to make ends meet. ""My partner also lost his job, so things were really difficult,"" she says. ""We were stuck in a cycle where we were getting a payday loan out every month for between Â£50 and Â£100. It was really dangerous."" Wonga, which collapsed in 2018, was once the UK's biggest payday lender but its practices attracted intense scrutiny. Wonga's legacy of nearly 400,000 mis-sold loans Wonga collapses into administration In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found it had lent money to many who would never be able to repay, prompting a crackdown on the sector. Administrators have since received 380,000 eligible claims against the business worth Â£460m in total - an average of Â£1,200 a claim. Wonga was once the biggest payday lender in the UK But while claimants were warned they would get ""significantly less"" than full compensation, few expected to get so little. Jo says she was due a total of Â£208 in compensation, but was told she would only receive Â£8. ""It's more effort than it's worth to be honest. I've changed my bank account since, and sending them all the forms and details that I would have to would take ages. ""I'm also not sure if I can trust them with my details. People have been burnt,"" she says. Sara Williams, who runs Debt Camel, said former customers had been ""badly let down"" by regulators. ""Wonga ignored the regulator's rules about checking the affordability of loans and they were allowed to get away with this for 10 years. ""Now customers are being let down again because they are not getting the compensation they deserve from the regulator."" Hundreds of ex-customers have vented their anger on the Debt Camel site. One said: ""We have all been exploited, and we all know how much we have been exploited by. ""In my case Â£6,500, of which I'll receive less than Â£300."" Ms Williams said borrowers were not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which is overseen by the FCA, The scheme covers products such as payment protection insurance (PPI), fully reimbursing anyone who has been mis-sold to, but does not extend to payday loans. ""Borrowers from many payday lenders have been unable to get proper compensation after the lender has had to close,"" Ms Williams said. ""The FCA needs to rethink this and provide a safety net for people who were mis-sold unaffordable loans."" Wonga's administrators said claims should be paid within the next four weeks, later than the 20 January date initially promised. They also said loans being refunded would be removed from people's credit records within the next six weeks - likely to be a relief to many. Some people still owe money to Wonga but it is unclear what will happen to their balances. Ms Williams said administrators were no longer taking payments and had said before that they were not likely to sell the loans to a debt collector.

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows the extent of the Rest And Be Thankful landslip The A83 has been closed in both directions in Argyll after a landslip resulted in more than 1,000 tonnes of debris covering the carriageway. Bear Scotland said a clean-up operation at the Rest and Be Thankful was likely to continue on Friday. Drivers are being diverted on to the Old Military Road. It is the latest in a series of major landslips to hit the road and it has led to calls from the local council for a ""permanent solution"" to the issue. Argyll and Bute Council leader Aileen Morton said the Scottish government needed to make a commitment to resolving the issue ""right now"". She said there should be ""no more prevaricating and faffing about, no more talking about processes and procedures, no more delay"". Transport Scotland said the government has invested Â£13.3m in landslide measures at the Rest and Be Thankful and the Old Military Road since 2007. A spokesman said the measures helped keep the road open for at least 48 days when it would otherwise have closed. More than 1,000 tonnes of debris fell on to the carriageway overnight Bear Scotland said it received reports of debris on the A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful at 03:00 on Thursday. More than 1,000 tonnes of material landed on the carriageway to the east of the area covered by debris fences and ""catchpits"" which were erected after previous landslides. Experts believed it was triggered by a landslip in a forested area above the road, after more than 86mm (3in) of rain fell over two days. The road was closed and drivers were initially advised to follow a 60-mile diversion. At 11:00 the Old Military Road, which runs parallel to the A83, was opened to motorists as a diversion following a safety inspection. A convoy system is in place and Bear said it would be open round-the-clock ""subject to weather conditions"". Drivers are also being advised that ferry options are also available via Western and CalMac Ferries. The A83 connects the Central Belt, via the A82 from Glasgow, to the Kintyre peninsula, all the way down to Campbeltown. The road, which starts in Tarbet on the banks of Loch Lomond, is almost 100 miles long. The Rest and Be Thankful is a pass about 10 miles from Tarbet between Glen Kinglas from Glen Croe. The road closed for several days in 2014following a 2,000 tonne landslip, then again in 2016 after ahuge boulder threatened the safety of traffic. A controlled explosion had to be carried out on the 150-tonne rock. In October 2018, the road wasshut for nine daysafter about 3,000 tonnes of landslide debris reached catch-fences above the carriageway. A 60-mile diversion was put in place while engineers worked to secure the rocks, which included one boulder of about 75 tonnes. Ms Morton, the local council leader, said the closure had caused a huge amount of disruption. She said years of weather-related closures had led to repairs by the Scottish government - but not a ""permanent solution"". ""The last landslip had a hugely negative impact on local businesses, and as well as day-to-day inconvenience for local residents it caused problems with essential services such as access to medical treatment,"" she said. ""The council and the people of Argyll and Bute have been asking for a permanent solution for a decade. Enough is enough - we need an announcement today that work is starting on finding a permanent solution."" Transport Scotland said improvement works have been carried out on the slope since 2013, including the erection of four catch-pits, with a total capacity of almost 15,000 tonnes. A spokesman said they understood the frustrations of local people, adding that they were ""exploring options"" of further catch-pits. The Rest And Be Thankful was previously closed for nine days The Rest and Be Thankful is the vital artery which connects Mid Argyll and Kintyre to the Central Belt,writes BBC Scotland correspondent Jamie McIvor, who travels regularly on the route. Many people living in Lochgilphead or Campbeltown travel to Glasgow regularly simply to visit shops or go to a football match. The route also leads to the Islay ferry terminal at Kennacraig. When the Rest is closed, the detour around Crianlarich adds around an hour to what is already a long, and often tiring, journey. However many car drivers heading for Glasgow have discovered an alternative - they can drive through Cowal then take the car ferry from Dunoon to Gourock. This is not ideal and is more expensive but some may consider it preferable in practice to such a long road journey. This, however, is not an option for people who rely on public transport. But the practical implications for people who want to make shorter journeys from one side of the Rest to the other are, ironically, often more severe in relative terms.  For instance an Inveraray residents may want to visit Dumbarton or Helensburgh to visit their bank branch. Inveraray business owners are also concerned about the loss of trade from day trippers.

"His family said joining the marines fulfilled his dream A Royal Marine who died in hospital following an incident in training has been named as Ethan Jones. He was part of a group practising an assault from a landing craft on Tregantle beach, Cornwall, when he went under the water on 21 January. The 20-year-old was taken to hospital where he died on Friday. The Royal Navy is investigating the incident. His family said: ""Ethan died fulfilling his dream and doing something he loved."" They continued: ""Joining the Royal Marines was something Ethan had wanted to do for as long as we can remember. He wanted to join the best of the best and challenge himself. ""Ethan loved the outdoor lifestyle and was looking forward to serving as a Marine on operations around the world.  We are very proud of all that he achieved."" Mr Jones was born in Bath and lived in Westfield, Radstock. He had joined the Royal Marines in May and was in the last phase of the 32 weeks training. He was awarded the Commando medal as voted for by his fellow recruits His inquest opened at Plymouth Coroner's Court earlier and heard he exited a landing craft and was submerged in sea water for about five minutes. He was given treatment at Derriford Hospital where scans showed he had a brain injury and minimal brain activity. Cpl Dave Wright, his section commander, said his attitude was ""consistently noted in training"". ""As an example, during an exercise, the troop were fatigued, yet Jones took it upon himself to place his equipment down at the top of a hill, go back down and carry the kit of a fellow recruit who was struggling with an injury. ""He is a true loss to the Royal Marines as he would have inevitably achieved much within his career."" Fellow Recruit Daniel Landrey said: ""He was our best mate and we know he would not want this much fuss made of him. ""Lucky for him it does not take more than a few words to describe Jonesy. When he didn't have a pasty in his hand, he was getting the job done. No complaining, no fuss, just always sending it."" During training he had been selected as a recruit section commander and was awarded the Commando Medal, which is voted for by recruits for the individual who best personifies the Commando Spirit.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton There will be ""no haggle"" over Harry Dunn's death and investigations of Prince Andrew's Jeffery Epstein connections, the government says. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab responded after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked if there was a ""deal to be done"" regarding the cases. Mr Raab stressed the extradition treaty with the US is ""rules-based"" and there would be no ""barter"" over the cases. Mr Dunn's family is treating the developments ""with caution"". The 19-year-old died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August, before suspect Anne Sacoolas left for the US, citing diplomatic immunity over the case. In his response to the question, Mr Pompeo said Mr Dunn's case and the investigation into allegations about Prince Andrew would be ""resolved on their merits"". Prince Andrew has stepped back from royal duties for the ""foreseeable future"" At an event in London alongside Mr Raab, Mr Pompeo was asked if there was ""a deal to be done"" over Prince Andrew and Mrs Sacoolas. The secretary of state replied: ""Yeah, I can answer that. I am confident each of these cases will be resolved on their relative merits."" Mr Raab added: ""There is no barter, it's a rules-based approach. That's what the treaty does. ""We both see that the extradition treaty serves both sides. And we want to make it work. So, that's the approach. ""There is no haggle and no-one's raised Prince Andrew. Frankly, no-one has ever raised that with me."" Mr Pompeo countered: ""Yes, now they have."" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in London meeting Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab The developments come after US attorney Geoffrey Bermansaid on Mondaythat Prince Andrew had provided ""zero co-operation"" to an inquiry into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein accusers 'outraged' by Prince Andrew Dunn family meeting with minister 'very honest' US rejects Harry Dunn death extradition request Prosecutors and the FBI have contacted his lawyers but have received no reply according to the lead investigator, Mr Berman. Prince Andrew says he did not see, or suspect, any suspicious behaviour when visiting the homes of Mr Epstein. Buckingham Palace said the prince's legal team was dealing with the issue. Mr Dunn died after being fatally injured outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving last month. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Radd Seiger, spokesman for Mr Dunn's family, has noted that despite his clients' caution, ""the secretary of state is no longer saying [Mrs Sacoolas] will not return"". ""We treat these words with caution but it is clear that Mr Raab has followed through on his promise to the family that he would make it clear to the secretary of state that he will not accept anything less than Anne Sacoolas' return,"" he said. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the family has stressed ""right from the outset that Anne Sacoolas must face the legal system here"". ""There is no other way and no-one is above the law, diplomat or not, as the Vienna Convention makes clear,"" she added.

"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said his country will help the UK reduce risks associated with involving Huawei in its 5G network. He said officials would work together to ""get this right"" after the UK's decision to give the Chinese firm a limited role in building its system. Mr Pompeo added that intelligence-sharing arrangements between the two countries would continue. The US has long argued that Huawei's equipment poses a spying risk. But the UK government gave the green light to Huawei's involvement in 5G on Tuesday, despite previous pressure from the US to block the firm. The company will, however, be banned from supplying kit to ""sensitive parts"" of the network, known as the core. What is Huawei and how could it be a security threat? Huawei set for limited role in UK 5G networks Pompeo urges UK to 'relook' at Huawei decision Speaking at the Policy Exchange think-tank in London, Mr Pompeo said his country considered that using the firm's technology was ""very difficult to mitigate"" and was ""not worth the candle"". But he said US allies, including the UK, had to make their own ""sovereign decision"" about whether to involve the company. Mr Pompeo said: ""The Chinese Communist Party presents the central threat of our times."" He told the audience that Huawei was ""deeply tied"" to the party, and countries would be taking a risk in involving it in the construction of telecoms networks. But he added: ""I am very confident that our two nations will find a way to work together to resolve this difference."" This video can not be played How will the Huawei 5G deal affect me? Mr Pompeo hadpreviously suggested,externalHuawei's equipment posed a spying risk, saying that ""we won't be able to share information"" with nations that put it into their ""critical information systems"". Huawei will only be allowed to account for 35% of the kit in a network's periphery, and will be excluded from areas near military bases and nuclear sites. The company has always denied that it would help the Chinese government attack one of its clients. Its founder has said he would ""shut the company down"" rather than assist ""any spying activities"". Speaking alongside Mr Pompeo, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK had taken a ""targeted approach"" towards involving the company. He said the dominance of the Chinese company in the telecoms sector was the result of a ""market failure"" for which the government needed to take some responsibility.

"This video can not be played Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine A deadly new virus. Thousands of people infected. No cure. No vaccine. We've been here many times before. In the past five years alone, the world has faced outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, another coronavirus called Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and now the virus simply  known as ""2019-nCoV"". It's already infected thousands of people and killed more than 100. But unlike in many previous outbreaks, where vaccines to protect people have taken years to develop, research for a vaccine to help stem this outbreak got under way within hours of the virus being identified. Chinese officials released its genetic code very quickly. That information helps scientists determine where the virus probably came from, how it might mutate as the outbreak develops, and how to protect people against it. With technological advances and greater commitment from governments around the world to fund research on emerging diseases, research facilities were able to spring into action fast. At Inovio's lab in San Diego, scientists are using a relatively new type of DNA technology to develop a potential vaccine. ""INO-4800"" - as it's currently called - with plans for it to enter human trials by the early summer. Kate Broderick, senior vice-president of research and development at Inovio, said: ""Once China had provided the DNA sequence of this virus, we were able to put it through our lab's computer technology and design a vaccine within three hours. ""Our DNA medicine vaccines are novel in that they use DNA sequences from the virus to target specific parts of the pathogen which we believe the body will mount the strongest response to. ""We then use the patient's own cells to become a factory for the vaccine, strengthening the body's own natural response mechanisms."" Scientists hope to have a vaccine ready to enter human trial by early summer Inovio says if the initial human trials are a success, larger trials would follow, ideally in an outbreak setting in China ""by the end of the year"". It is impossible to predict whether this outbreak is likely to have ended by then. But if Inovio's timeline goes to plan, the company says it will be the quickest a new vaccine has ever been developed and tested in an outbreak situation. The last time a similar virus - Sars - emerged in 2002 - China was slow to let the world know what was happening. So by the time work on a vaccine started in earnest, the outbreak was almost over. The timeline of 2019-nCoV 31 December 2019-  China alerts the World Health Organization (WHO) about a spate of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan 1 January 2020-  The seafood/animal market believed to be at the centre of the outbreak is closed 9 January- The WHO says the infection is caused by a new type of coronavirus 10 January- China shares the genetic code of the new virus 11 January- Scientists start working on a vaccine - and the first death confirmed 13 January- Virus spreads abroad for the first time, with a case in Thailand The work in these labs is being funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is made up of and funded by governments and philanthropic organisations from around the world. It was created in the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to provide funding to accelerate the development of vaccines for new diseases. Dr Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at Cepi, said: ""The mission is to make sure that outbreaks are no longer a threat to humanity and to develop vaccines for emerging infectious diseases."" Cepi is also funding two other programmes that are developing a vaccine for this new coronavirus. The University of Queensland is working on a ""molecular clamp"" vaccine, which it says ""enables targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens."" Fermenters grow bacteria to provide the main ingredient for a vaccine Moderna Inc in Massachusetts has also joined forces with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to accelerate its research. The WHO is co-ordinating this global quest for a new vaccine. It says it is following the progress of a number of research facilities, including the three supported by Cepi. Although efforts to come up with a vaccine for this new coronavirus have been accelerated, research is still at an early stage at all the facilities in the race to find a new vaccine. Clinical trials take time and are best carried out within an outbreak setting. There are no guarantees any of the designs so far will be safe and effective enough to be used in the outbreak in China. Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo from the WHO's Health Emergencies programme said: ""We have developed a framework to inform decisions on which candidate vaccine(s) should be tested first. ""The experts will consider a number of criteria, including acceptable safety profile, induction of appropriate immune responses, and the timely availability of sufficient supplies of vaccine doses. ""Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, its transmission, its clinical severity and developing effective counter measures is critical for the control of the outbreak."" The WHO is due to decide which vaccine will be tested on humans first in the coming days. Inovio has announced that it will collaborate with a biotech company in Beijing who can help manage human trials which are due to start in the summer. Dr J. Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio, said: ""This collaboration allows us to enter China and deliver our vaccine into the areas where they need it most as soon as possible.""

"Guo Jing lives in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the heart of the outbreak of a new virus which has got the world worried. Wuhan has been under lockdown since 23 January, to try to contain the infection. Transport is shut down, most shops and businesses closed, and people are being advised to stay at home. Jing is a 29-year-old social worker and rights activist who lives on her own. For the past week, she has kept a diary, which she shares here with the BBC. I didn't know what to dowhen I woke up and learned about the lockdown.I don't know what it means, how long it will last and what kind of preparations I should make. There are a lot of infuriating comments [on social media]: that many patients cannot be hospitalised after diagnosis [because of a lack of places], that patients with fever are not properly treated. Many more people are wearing masks. Friends have told me to stock up on supplies. Rice and noodles have almost sold out. This video can not be played Fears over coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortage A man was buying lots of salt, and someone asked him why he was buying so much. He replied: ""What if the lockdown lasted for a whole year?"" I went to a pharmacy and it was already limiting the number of shoppers. It had already sold out of masks and alcohol disinfectant. After stocking up on food, I am still in shock. Cars and pedestrians are dwindling, and the city has come to a stop all out of a sudden. When will the city live again? The world is quiet, and the silence is horrifying. I live alone, so I can only tell there are other human beings around from the occasional noises in the corridor. I have a lot of time to think about how to survive. I don't have any resources or connections. One of my goals is not to fall sick, so I have to make myself exercise. Food is crucial to survival too, so I have to know whether there is enough supply. The government hasn't said how long the lockdown will last, nor how we can carry on functioning. People are saying it might last until May. The pharmacy and the convenience store downstairs were closed today, but it was comforting to see that couriers are still out delivering food. Noodles are all sold out in the supermarkets, but there is some rice. I also went to the market today. I bought celery, garlic shoots and eggs. After going home, I washed all my clothes and took a shower. Personal hygiene is important - I think I am washing my hands 20 to 30 times a day. Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began People cry out 'stay strong' from Wuhan windows How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? Going out makes me feel that I am still connected to the world. It's very difficult to imagine how elderly citizens living alone and people with disabilities will get through this. I didn't want to cook less than usual, because it was the last night of the year of the pig - it was supposed to be a meal of celebration. Over dinner, I was on a video call with my friends. There was no escaping talk of the virus. Some people are in towns near Wuhan, some chose not to go home because of the disease, some still insist on gathering despite the outbreak. A friend coughed during the call. Someone jokingly told her to hang up! We chatted for three hours and I thought I could then fall asleep with happy thoughts. But when I closed my eyes, memories of the past few days came in flashbacks. Tears fell. I felt helpless, angry and sad. I thought about death, too. I don't have many regrets, because my job is meaningful. But I don't want my life to end. Today is Chinese New Year. I never have much interest in celebrating festivals, but now new year feels even more irrelevant. In the morning, I saw some blood after I sneezed, and I was scared. My brain was filled with worries about sickness. I was wondering if I should go out or not. But I had no fever and a good appetite, so I went out. I wore two masks even though people say it's pointless and unnecessary. I am worried about [poor quality] fakes, so a double mask makes me feel safer. It was still very quiet. Chinese wish is for new year health, not fortune Chinese diasporas stockpile surgical masks A flower shop was open, and the owner had placed some chrysanthemums [often used as funeral flowers] at the door. But I didn't know if that meant anything. In the supermarket, the vegetable shelves were empty and almost all dumplings and noodles were sold out. There were only a few people queuing. I keep having this urge to buy lots during each visit to the shop. I bought another 2.5 kg of rice, even though I have 7kg of rice at home. I also couldn't help buying some sweet potatoes, dumplings, sausages, red beans, green beans, millet and salted eggs. I don't even like salted eggs! I will give them to friends, after the lockdown is lifted. I have enough food for a month, and this compulsive buying seems crazy. But under such circumstances, how could I blame myself? I went for a walk by the river. Two snack shops were open and some people were out walking their dogs. I saw some others were taking a stroll as well - I guess they also didn't want to be trapped. I'd never walked along that road before. It felt like my world had expanded just a little bit. It not just the city that's trapped. It's also the voices of the people. On the first day of the lockdown, I couldn't write [anything about it] on social media [because of censorship]. I couldn't even write on WeChat. Internet censorship has existed for a long time in China, but now it feels even more cruel. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? How are coronavirus patients treated? Scientists race to develop a coronavirus vaccine Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? When your life is turned upside down, it's a challenge to build up your daily life again. I keep exercising in the mornings, using an app, but I can't focus because my brain is occupied. This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city I left home again today and tried to count how many people I met - I met eight during my walk to a noodle shop some 500m away from my home. I didn't want to go home. I wanted to explore more. It's only two months since I moved to Wuhan. I don't have many friends here, and I don't know the city very well. I guess I saw about 100 people today. I have to keep making myself heard and break the shackles. I hope everyone stays hopeful. Friends, I hope that we will meet and talk in the future. Around 8pm I heard the shouts of ""Go, Wuhan!"" from people's windows. The collective chanting is a form of self-empowerment. Panic has driven a wedge between people. In many cities, people are required to wear a face mask in public. On the face of it, the measure is to control the pneumonia outbreak. But actually it could lead to abuse of power. Some citizens without a mask have been thrown off public transport. We don't know why they didn't wear a mask. Perhaps they couldn't buy any, or they didn't know about the notice. No matter what, their rights to go out should not be taken away. In some videos circulating online, some people had sealed up the doors of people who'd self-quarantined themselves. People from Hubei province [where Wuhan is] were driven out of their homes and had nowhere to go. But at the same time, some people are offering accommodation to Hubei people. There are a lot of ways the government could encourage people to stay home. It has to ensure that every citizen has enough face masks, or even give cash rewards to citizens who stay home. Today, there's finally sunlight - just like my mood. I saw more people in my complex and there were a few community workers. They appeared to perform temperature checks on non-residents. It is not easy to build trust and bonds under a lockdown. The city is worn down by heaviness. In the midst of all this, I can't help but becoming more on-guard. My anxiety about survival has been slowly dissipating. Walking further in the city will be meaningless if I don't make any connections with people here. Social participation is an important need. Everyone has to find a role in society and makes one's life meaningful. In this lonely city, I have to find my role. Guo Jing also published parts of her diary on WeChat.

"The Tate has defended its decision to advertise for a ""head of coffee"", on wages of almost Â£40,000 a year. Union leaders had said the post highlights ""the pay discrepancy"" between museum professionals and others within the arts sector. The average annual salary for professional art curators in London is believed to be around Â£37,300. The Tate told the BBC: ""It's unfair to compare a head of department with a curatorial role of a different level"". ""All Tate's departments have a variety of roles with different responsibilities and salaries,"" a spokesman said, ""including curatorial, and a more accurate comparison would be a curatorial team leader."" The museum said curatorial team leaders can be paid around Â£50,000, while assistants may start on Â£17,524, asguidelines show.,external ""We value all our staff and strive to pay them appropriately for their work at Tate,"" the statement concluded.

"The PG Tips and Lipton tea brands could be sold by consumer goods giant Unilever because they are falling out of favour with the public. The firm is reviewing its tea business amid a slowdown in sales as more consumers switch to the herbal variety. It is part of efforts by chief executive Alan Jope to refocus the firm and concentrate on fewer brands. The announcement came as Unilever announced its slowest quarterly growth in a decade. The firm said its sales in the final three months of 2019 were up just 1.5%. However, it said it expected a stronger performance in 2020. Unilever said it would look at ""all options"" for the tea business, including a partial or full sale. Are young Brits falling out of love with the cuppa? According to research firm Kantar, the British tea industry is worth Â£667m a year, but over the last two years, demand for traditional black tea has fallen by 2.7%. In contrast, demand has risen for other types of tea, with herbal teas now worth Â£52m and cold infusions valued at Â£11.2m. On social media, BBC News readers had a mixed reaction to the news of the potential sale. Although she's not a fan of traditional black tea, Twitter user Helen said the move was ""surprising"". Another, James, said the British staple's decline was ""probably because loads more products are available now"", and suggested consumers are told more often to avoid caffeine. Mike posted about certain teas being more costly than supermarket own-brand equivalents. And of course there were plenty of tea-related puns about this being a ""traves-tea"". PG Tips was launched in the UK in 1930 by Manchester-based firm Brooke Bond Its original name was Pre-Gestee, implying that it had digestive properties. Grocers and salesmen shortened it to PG. The ""Tips"" was added in the 1950s PG Tips spawned the longest-running ad campaign on British TV, running for almost 50 years. It featured chimps dressed as humans and voiced by actors Within two years of the first TV appearance of the chimps in 1956, PG Tips was the UK's top-selling tea Brooke Bond was acquired by Unilever in 1984, but PG Tips continued to sell well Last year, PG Tips was overtaken as the UK's top tea brand by Twinings, which was then in turn leapfrogged by Yorkshire Tea Despite the question mark over Lipton's future, it is rated by Unilever as one of its seven highest-earning brands. The others are Dove soap, Knorr food products, Persil/Omo washing powder, Rexona deodorant, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Wall's ice cream (known as Ola, Algida, Kibon and Langnese in different parts of the world), according tothe company's website,external. Since he took over a year ago, Mr Jope has targeted what he calls ""brands with purpose"", saying that brands which do not have a clear social or environmental function could be eliminated from Unilever's roster. He told reporters last year that Unilever was taking a close look at such brands as Marmite, Magnum ice cream and Pot Noodle. Are young Brits falling out of love with the cuppa?

"Plastic waste often ends up in developing countries Exporting polluting plastic waste to developing countries will be banned or restricted under a new law. The rule presented to the UK Parliament is aimed at protecting poorer nations against becoming the dumping ground for unwanted rubbish. The latest trade data shows that some 356,233 tonnes of plastic waste was sent for recycling from the UK to developing countries in 2018. The plastic often ends up dumped in waterways. This has resulted in many developing countriessending back waste to rich nations. The revised Environment Bill also rules that firms producing packaging must take more responsibility for products and materials they put on the market. Environmentalists say the bill should also include measures to reduce the amount of plastic produced in the first place. Other powers in the bill include the promise of legally-binding targets to reduce air pollution from ultra-fine particles known as PM2.5s. Thereâs also a framework for long-term legal targets to support nature and improve the quality of air and water. How strong is the new bill? Green groups have welcomed much of the bill but they say that, in some ways, it still leaves environmental protection weaker than under the EU. They are especially concerned about the role of a proposed new âindependentâ environmental watchdog that will replace the over-seeing power of the EU and hold ministers to account for their policies after Brexit. The EU can threaten to fine nations that fail to meet environmental laws â that threat forced the UK to tackle air pollution more seriously. The new Office of Environmental Protection (OEP) wonât have the power to fine the government. Whatâs more, its members will be appointed by ministers, so critics say it wonât be fully independent. The government says it will still hold ministers to account â including on the issue of the UK meeting its 2050 Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions target. Most of the clauses in the draft legislation were unveiled before the election. The revised bill introduces the promise of a two-yearly review of significant developments in international environmental legislation to ensure the UK keeps up with green protections. What does the bill do for wildlife? The bill will support the governmentâs 25-year plan to improve the state of nature by demanding that developers show they will actually improve conditions for wildlife. Critics say this may prove hollow unless the current balance of power between developers and local councils is shifted away from developers. The turtle dove is critically endangered The bill also includes steps to give communities a greater say in the protection of local trees, following the row over tree felling in Sheffield. There will be a more consistent approach to recycling across England to tackle the ""postcode lottery"" on waste collections. Will plastic spoons face a levy? There will be powers to create a deposit return scheme for drinks containers and a mechanism for introducing a levy on single-use plastics that could be applied to takeaway cutlery. The Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: ""We are facing climate change and our precious natural environment is under threat. We need to take decisive action. ""We have set out our pitch to be a world leader on the environment as we leave the EU and the bill is a crucial part of achieving this aim.â The bill promises that the environment will be at the heart of all government policy making â although environmentalists are asking how that squares with ministersâ plans to spend Â£28.8bn on roads. Kiera Box from Friends of the Earth told BBC News: âWe welcome much of this bill, but weâre concerned about the OEP. It needs to have independent staff â not appointed by ministers. ""It needs a guarantee of multi-year funding and it needs complete organisational independence from Defra (the government environment department).â Will a waste ban solve the problem? The group also said banning plastic waste to developing countries wouldnât solve the problem as non-developing countries such as Turkey and Poland both host poorly-regulated dumps receiving UK plastic and other waste. Ruth Chambers from Greener UK â a coalition of environmental groups â fears that the bill doesn't guarantee the avoidance of back-sliding from EU environment standards after Brexit. She said: âThis bill is not itself regressive â but it offers no legal guarantee to raise environmental standards in line with other nations in future.â On the issue of air pollution, Dr Alison Cook from the British Lung Foundation, said: âThis Bill is a step in the right direction and we welcome the commitment to set legally binding targets on air pollution, including PM2.5 which is the most dangerous form of pollution to human health.â âWe now need to see a firm commitment from government that limits for PM2.5 will be set in line with those recommended by leading experts at the World Health Organization (WHO) and for them to be met by 2030 at the latest.â Nick Molho from the business coalition the Aldersgate Group said: âThe return of the Environment Bill sends an important signal to business, but the bill needs to clearly set out the expected ambition of future targets and how they will be set.""

"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.75% amid early signs of a pick-up in the UK and global economies. In Mark Carney's final interest rate meeting as governor, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to keep rates unchanged. Recent weak economic data had led to speculation rates could be cut, but Mr Carney said ""the most recent signs are that global growth has stabilised"". But the MPC said it was poised to cut interest rates if necessary. Fewer companies in the UK are worried about Brexit, Mr Carney told a news conference following the rate decision. He added that survey data suggested UK growth will improve. But he said: ""To be clear these are still early days and it's less of a case of so far so good than so far good enough,"" he said, again referring to the UK economy. ""Although the global economy looks to be recovering, caution is warranted,"" he said. ""Evidence of a pick-up in growth is not yet widespread."" He said the coronavirus outbreak was a ""reminder of the need to be vigilant"" when it comes to bumps in economic growth around the world. The nine MPC members have been split on rates since November. Lower interest rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for savers because High Street banks use the Bank of England base rate as a reference point for many mortgages and savings accounts. In a closely-watched decision, policymakers said they would monitor whether a recent improvement in business sentiment would lead to stronger economic growth. The MPC said it stood ready to cut rates if there were signs that growth would remain subdued. ""Policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth, should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained,"" the MPC said. Two members, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, argued that past business surveys of economic growth had not been reliable. They continued to call for an immediate interest rate cut to 0.5%. The Bank's latest economic estimates suggest the economy did not grow at all in the final three months of last year. Weaker growth at the turn of the year is also expected to drag overall economic growth down to just 0.75% in 2020. This is down from a projection of 1.25% last November. The UK economy is expected to expand by 0.2% in the first three months of this year. The Bank said a trade deal between the US and China that lowers some tariffs would provide a boost to the global economy. An expected rise in spending by the government in the March Budget could provide a further boost to growth, policymakers said. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said she also expected stronger growth ahead. ""Admittedly, the MPC left the door open to a rate cut in the coming months, but with the economy turning a corner and a big fiscal stimulus approaching, we suspect the next move in interest rates will be up not down, albeit not until next year."" The Bank said Brexit-related uncertainty had ""weighed on investment"" over the past few years. Policymakers said companies' Brexit plans had diverted money towards preparing for the UK's departure from the EU that would otherwise be invested elsewhere. This has reduced the UK's long-term growth prospects by limiting the space in which the economy can grow without the risk of overheating. This would force the Bank to raise interest rates, which would in turn slow the UK economy. Policymakers now believe the UK's potential growth has been reduced to 1.1%. This is down from 2.9% before the financial crisis and 1.6% over most of the past decade.

"Jo took out a number of loans with Wonga after losing her full-time job People who were mis-sold loans by the payday lender Wonga have been told that they will receive just 4.3% of the compensation they are owed. Administrators have begun informing around 400,000 claimants by letter, some of whom have reacted in dismay. Before its collapse, Wonga was vilified for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. One ex-customer told BBC News it was ""an insult"" to borrowers. ""Trust has really been damaged by this company, and the amount of compensation is an insult to the people that have been hurt by this,"" said Jo from Basingstoke. After Jo lost her full-time job and started in a role with fewer hours, she took out a series of loans with Wonga between 2010 and 2014 to make ends meet. ""My partner also lost his job, so things were really difficult,"" she says. ""We were stuck in a cycle where we were getting a payday loan out every month for between Â£50 and Â£100. It was really dangerous."" Wonga, which collapsed in 2018, was once the UK's biggest payday lender but its practices attracted intense scrutiny. Wonga's legacy of nearly 400,000 mis-sold loans Wonga collapses into administration In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found it had lent money to many who would never be able to repay, prompting a crackdown on the sector. Administrators have since received 380,000 eligible claims against the business worth Â£460m in total - an average of Â£1,200 a claim. Wonga was once the biggest payday lender in the UK But while claimants were warned they would get ""significantly less"" than full compensation, few expected to get so little. Jo says she was due a total of Â£208 in compensation, but was told she would only receive Â£8. ""It's more effort than it's worth to be honest. I've changed my bank account since, and sending them all the forms and details that I would have to would take ages. ""I'm also not sure if I can trust them with my details. People have been burnt,"" she says. Sara Williams, who runs Debt Camel, said former customers had been ""badly let down"" by regulators. ""Wonga ignored the regulator's rules about checking the affordability of loans and they were allowed to get away with this for 10 years. ""Now customers are being let down again because they are not getting the compensation they deserve from the regulator."" Hundreds of ex-customers have vented their anger on the Debt Camel site. One said: ""We have all been exploited, and we all know how much we have been exploited by. ""In my case Â£6,500, of which I'll receive less than Â£300."" Ms Williams said borrowers were not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which is overseen by the FCA, The scheme covers products such as payment protection insurance (PPI), fully reimbursing anyone who has been mis-sold to, but does not extend to payday loans. ""Borrowers from many payday lenders have been unable to get proper compensation after the lender has had to close,"" Ms Williams said. ""The FCA needs to rethink this and provide a safety net for people who were mis-sold unaffordable loans."" Wonga's administrators said claims should be paid within the next four weeks, later than the 20 January date initially promised. They also said loans being refunded would be removed from people's credit records within the next six weeks - likely to be a relief to many. Some people still owe money to Wonga but it is unclear what will happen to their balances. Ms Williams said administrators were no longer taking payments and had said before that they were not likely to sell the loans to a debt collector.

"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.75% amid early signs of a pick-up in the UK and global economies. In Mark Carney's final interest rate meeting as governor, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 7-2 to keep rates unchanged. Recent weak economic data had led to speculation rates could be cut, but Mr Carney said ""the most recent signs are that global growth has stabilised"". But the MPC said it was poised to cut interest rates if necessary. Fewer companies in the UK are worried about Brexit, Mr Carney told a news conference following the rate decision. He added that survey data suggested UK growth will improve. But he said: ""To be clear these are still early days and it's less of a case of so far so good than so far good enough,"" he said, again referring to the UK economy. ""Although the global economy looks to be recovering, caution is warranted,"" he said. ""Evidence of a pick-up in growth is not yet widespread."" He said the coronavirus outbreak was a ""reminder of the need to be vigilant"" when it comes to bumps in economic growth around the world. The nine MPC members have been split on rates since November. Lower interest rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for savers because High Street banks use the Bank of England base rate as a reference point for many mortgages and savings accounts. In a closely-watched decision, policymakers said they would monitor whether a recent improvement in business sentiment would lead to stronger economic growth. The MPC said it stood ready to cut rates if there were signs that growth would remain subdued. ""Policy might need to reinforce the expected recovery in UK GDP growth, should the more positive signals from recent indicators of global and domestic activity not be sustained,"" the MPC said. Two members, Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders, argued that past business surveys of economic growth had not been reliable. They continued to call for an immediate interest rate cut to 0.5%. The Bank's latest economic estimates suggest the economy did not grow at all in the final three months of last year. Weaker growth at the turn of the year is also expected to drag overall economic growth down to just 0.75% in 2020. This is down from a projection of 1.25% last November. The UK economy is expected to expand by 0.2% in the first three months of this year. The Bank said a trade deal between the US and China that lowers some tariffs would provide a boost to the global economy. An expected rise in spending by the government in the March Budget could provide a further boost to growth, policymakers said. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said she also expected stronger growth ahead. ""Admittedly, the MPC left the door open to a rate cut in the coming months, but with the economy turning a corner and a big fiscal stimulus approaching, we suspect the next move in interest rates will be up not down, albeit not until next year."" The Bank said Brexit-related uncertainty had ""weighed on investment"" over the past few years. Policymakers said companies' Brexit plans had diverted money towards preparing for the UK's departure from the EU that would otherwise be invested elsewhere. This has reduced the UK's long-term growth prospects by limiting the space in which the economy can grow without the risk of overheating. This would force the Bank to raise interest rates, which would in turn slow the UK economy. Policymakers now believe the UK's potential growth has been reduced to 1.1%. This is down from 2.9% before the financial crisis and 1.6% over most of the past decade.

"This video can not be played Paul Farnes on what it was like to fly in the Battle of Britain The last surviving Battle of Britain ace pilot from World War Two has died aged 101. Wing Cdr Paul Farnes was among the 3,000 airmen - The Few - who defended Britain's skies in 1940. He was born in Hampshire and died on Tuesday morning in West Sussex, where he had lived for most of his life, the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust said. Paying tribute, it described him as a ""distinguished man - who was generous with his time in support of the trust"". His battle victories made Wing Cdr Farnes an ace, a term taken to mean any fighter pilot credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft. His tally was six enemy aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and six damaged, the trust said. Wing Cdr Farnes at memorial day at Capel-le-Ferne, Folkestone There are now thought to be only two surviving members of The Few - Flight Lieutenant William Clark and Flying Officer John Hemingway, both aged 100. The trust added Wing Cdr Farnes was the last member of The Few fit enough to be able to attend the aerial conflict's memorial day in 2019. It said he had ""proudly"" represented his RAF colleagues at the service of commemoration just a week before his 101st birthday, in July. The trust said Wing Cdr Farnes was ""very proud"" of his Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM), which he received for his exploits in the Battle of Britain. In 2015, the then retired Sqn Ldr described the ""moving"" moment he and his comrades were spontaneously applauded during a service at Westminster Abbey to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Mr Farnes, who flew a Hurricane during the war, said: ""It was very emotional today because, when we walked out of the abbey, the audience applauded and it's never happened before at the annual service and I was very moved by it. ""It is amazing that the Battle of Britain has caught on with the public and I am very proud to have been a part of it."" Battle of Britain pilot dies after 100th birthday Battle of Britain museum opens Battle of Britain window rededicated Mr Farnes joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1938, later joining RAF No 501 Squadron and fighting in the Battle of France in 1940. After the Battle of Britain, he was commissioned as an officer and served as an instructor and fought in Malta with No 229 Squadron as well as serving in North Africa and Iraq. As World War Two ended, he was in command of two squadrons in the UK. Remaining in the RAF until 1958 when, having been appointed Sqn Ldr, he retired, retaining the rank of Wing Cdr. What was the Battle of Britain? Paul Farnes became an ace pilot flying the Hurricane in the Battle of Britain On 16 July 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered preparations for the invasion of Britain codenamed Operation Sealion. Britain retained naval superiority and Hitler knew that an amphibious invasion would be made easier if Germany could establish control of the air in the battle zone. The battle for control of the skies became known as theBattle of Britain. The Luftwaffe had the clear advantage - 750 long-range and 250 dive bombers, 600 single-engined and 150 twin-engined fighters - significantly more than RAF Fighter Command's 600 planes. But the Luftwaffe was hampered by an inconsistent plan of action whereas the British forces were well prepared. Radar technology - being used for the first time in battle - gave plenty of notice of the German bombing raids. The air attacks were initially focused on British shipping, ports and airfields along the English Channel but gradually the battle moved inland. The Germans stepped up their bombing raids in August and targeted London. Britain retaliated by bombing Berlin. The German forces were losing bombers quicker than they could replace them and so they switched to night-time raids, which continued until March 1941. But by then Britain had won the Battle of Britain - and Operation Sealion was postponed until further notice. What it was like to fly in the Battle of Britain.

"This video can not be played Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine A deadly new virus. Thousands of people infected. No cure. No vaccine. We've been here many times before. In the past five years alone, the world has faced outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, another coronavirus called Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and now the virus simply  known as ""2019-nCoV"". It's already infected thousands of people and killed more than 100. But unlike in many previous outbreaks, where vaccines to protect people have taken years to develop, research for a vaccine to help stem this outbreak got under way within hours of the virus being identified. Chinese officials released its genetic code very quickly. That information helps scientists determine where the virus probably came from, how it might mutate as the outbreak develops, and how to protect people against it. With technological advances and greater commitment from governments around the world to fund research on emerging diseases, research facilities were able to spring into action fast. At Inovio's lab in San Diego, scientists are using a relatively new type of DNA technology to develop a potential vaccine. ""INO-4800"" - as it's currently called - with plans for it to enter human trials by the early summer. Kate Broderick, senior vice-president of research and development at Inovio, said: ""Once China had provided the DNA sequence of this virus, we were able to put it through our lab's computer technology and design a vaccine within three hours. ""Our DNA medicine vaccines are novel in that they use DNA sequences from the virus to target specific parts of the pathogen which we believe the body will mount the strongest response to. ""We then use the patient's own cells to become a factory for the vaccine, strengthening the body's own natural response mechanisms."" Scientists hope to have a vaccine ready to enter human trial by early summer Inovio says if the initial human trials are a success, larger trials would follow, ideally in an outbreak setting in China ""by the end of the year"". It is impossible to predict whether this outbreak is likely to have ended by then. But if Inovio's timeline goes to plan, the company says it will be the quickest a new vaccine has ever been developed and tested in an outbreak situation. The last time a similar virus - Sars - emerged in 2002 - China was slow to let the world know what was happening. So by the time work on a vaccine started in earnest, the outbreak was almost over. The timeline of 2019-nCoV 31 December 2019-  China alerts the World Health Organization (WHO) about a spate of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan 1 January 2020-  The seafood/animal market believed to be at the centre of the outbreak is closed 9 January- The WHO says the infection is caused by a new type of coronavirus 10 January- China shares the genetic code of the new virus 11 January- Scientists start working on a vaccine - and the first death confirmed 13 January- Virus spreads abroad for the first time, with a case in Thailand The work in these labs is being funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is made up of and funded by governments and philanthropic organisations from around the world. It was created in the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to provide funding to accelerate the development of vaccines for new diseases. Dr Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at Cepi, said: ""The mission is to make sure that outbreaks are no longer a threat to humanity and to develop vaccines for emerging infectious diseases."" Cepi is also funding two other programmes that are developing a vaccine for this new coronavirus. The University of Queensland is working on a ""molecular clamp"" vaccine, which it says ""enables targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens."" Fermenters grow bacteria to provide the main ingredient for a vaccine Moderna Inc in Massachusetts has also joined forces with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to accelerate its research. The WHO is co-ordinating this global quest for a new vaccine. It says it is following the progress of a number of research facilities, including the three supported by Cepi. Although efforts to come up with a vaccine for this new coronavirus have been accelerated, research is still at an early stage at all the facilities in the race to find a new vaccine. Clinical trials take time and are best carried out within an outbreak setting. There are no guarantees any of the designs so far will be safe and effective enough to be used in the outbreak in China. Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo from the WHO's Health Emergencies programme said: ""We have developed a framework to inform decisions on which candidate vaccine(s) should be tested first. ""The experts will consider a number of criteria, including acceptable safety profile, induction of appropriate immune responses, and the timely availability of sufficient supplies of vaccine doses. ""Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, its transmission, its clinical severity and developing effective counter measures is critical for the control of the outbreak."" The WHO is due to decide which vaccine will be tested on humans first in the coming days. Inovio has announced that it will collaborate with a biotech company in Beijing who can help manage human trials which are due to start in the summer. Dr J. Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio, said: ""This collaboration allows us to enter China and deliver our vaccine into the areas where they need it most as soon as possible.""

His tally was six enemy aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and six damaged, the trust said. Wing Cdr Farnes at memorial day at Capel-le-Ferne, Folkestone There are now thought to be only two surviving members of The Few - Flight Lieutenant William Clark and Flying Officer John Hemingway, both aged 100. The trust added Wing Cdr Farnes was the last member of The Few fit enough to be able to attend the aerial conflict's memorial day in 2019. It said he had ""proudly"" represented his RAF colleagues at the service of commemoration just a week before his 101st birthday, in July. The trust said Wing Cdr Farnes was ""very proud"" of his Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM), which he received for his exploits in the Battle of Britain. In 2015, the then retired Sqn Ldr described the ""moving"" moment he and his comrades were spontaneously applauded during a service at Westminster Abbey to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Mr Farnes, who flew a Hurricane during the war, said: ""It was very emotional today because, when we walked out of the abbey, the audience applauded and it's never happened before at the annual service and I was very moved by it. ""It is amazing that the Battle of Britain has caught on with the public and I am very proud to have been a part of it."" Battle of Britain pilot dies after 100th birthday Battle of Britain museum opens Battle of Britain window rededicated Mr Farnes joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1938, later joining RAF No 501 Squadron and fighting in the Battle of France in 1940. After the Battle of Britain, he was commissioned as an officer and served as an instructor and fought in Malta with No 229 Squadron as well as serving in North Africa and Iraq. As World War Two ended, he was in command of two squadrons in the UK. Remaining in the RAF until 1958 when, having been appointed Sqn Ldr, he retired, retaining the rank of Wing Cdr. What was the Battle of Britain? Paul Farnes became an ace pilot flying the Hurricane in the Battle of Britain On 16 July 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered preparations for the invasion of Britain codenamed Operation Sealion. Britain retained naval superiority and Hitler knew that an amphibious invasion would be made easier if Germany could establish control of the air in the battle zone. The battle for control of the skies became known as theBattle of Britain. The Luftwaffe had the clear advantage - 750 long-range and 250 dive bombers, 600 single-engined and 150 twin-engined fighters - significantly more than RAF Fighter Command's 600 planes. But the Luftwaffe was hampered by an inconsistent plan of action whereas the British forces were well prepared. Radar technology - being used for the first time in battle - gave plenty of notice of the German bombing raids. The air attacks were initially focused on British shipping, ports and airfields along the English Channel but gradually the battle moved inland. The Germans stepped up their bombing raids in August and targeted London. Britain retaliated by bombing Berlin. The German forces were losing bombers quicker than they could replace them and so they switched to night-time raids, which continued until March 1941. But by then Britain had won the Battle of Britain - and Operation Sealion was postponed until further notice. What it was like to fly in the Battle of Britain.

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows the extent of the Rest And Be Thankful landslip The A83 has been closed in both directions in Argyll after a landslip resulted in more than 1,000 tonnes of debris covering the carriageway. Bear Scotland said a clean-up operation at the Rest and Be Thankful was likely to continue on Friday. Drivers are being diverted on to the Old Military Road. It is the latest in a series of major landslips to hit the road and it has led to calls from the local council for a ""permanent solution"" to the issue. Argyll and Bute Council leader Aileen Morton said the Scottish government needed to make a commitment to resolving the issue ""right now"". She said there should be ""no more prevaricating and faffing about, no more talking about processes and procedures, no more delay"". Transport Scotland said the government has invested Â£13.3m in landslide measures at the Rest and Be Thankful and the Old Military Road since 2007. A spokesman said the measures helped keep the road open for at least 48 days when it would otherwise have closed. More than 1,000 tonnes of debris fell on to the carriageway overnight Bear Scotland said it received reports of debris on the A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful at 03:00 on Thursday. More than 1,000 tonnes of material landed on the carriageway to the east of the area covered by debris fences and ""catchpits"" which were erected after previous landslides. Experts believed it was triggered by a landslip in a forested area above the road, after more than 86mm (3in) of rain fell over two days. The road was closed and drivers were initially advised to follow a 60-mile diversion. At 11:00 the Old Military Road, which runs parallel to the A83, was opened to motorists as a diversion following a safety inspection. A convoy system is in place and Bear said it would be open round-the-clock ""subject to weather conditions"". Drivers are also being advised that ferry options are also available via Western and CalMac Ferries. The A83 connects the Central Belt, via the A82 from Glasgow, to the Kintyre peninsula, all the way down to Campbeltown. The road, which starts in Tarbet on the banks of Loch Lomond, is almost 100 miles long. The Rest and Be Thankful is a pass about 10 miles from Tarbet between Glen Kinglas from Glen Croe. The road closed for several days in 2014following a 2,000 tonne landslip, then again in 2016 after ahuge boulder threatened the safety of traffic. A controlled explosion had to be carried out on the 150-tonne rock. In October 2018, the road wasshut for nine daysafter about 3,000 tonnes of landslide debris reached catch-fences above the carriageway. A 60-mile diversion was put in place while engineers worked to secure the rocks, which included one boulder of about 75 tonnes. Ms Morton, the local council leader, said the closure had caused a huge amount of disruption. She said years of weather-related closures had led to repairs by the Scottish government - but not a ""permanent solution"". ""The last landslip had a hugely negative impact on local businesses, and as well as day-to-day inconvenience for local residents it caused problems with essential services such as access to medical treatment,"" she said. ""The council and the people of Argyll and Bute have been asking for a permanent solution for a decade. Enough is enough - we need an announcement today that work is starting on finding a permanent solution."" Transport Scotland said improvement works have been carried out on the slope since 2013, including the erection of four catch-pits, with a total capacity of almost 15,000 tonnes. A spokesman said they understood the frustrations of local people, adding that they were ""exploring options"" of further catch-pits. The Rest And Be Thankful was previously closed for nine days The Rest and Be Thankful is the vital artery which connects Mid Argyll and Kintyre to the Central Belt,writes BBC Scotland correspondent Jamie McIvor, who travels regularly on the route. Many people living in Lochgilphead or Campbeltown travel to Glasgow regularly simply to visit shops or go to a football match. The route also leads to the Islay ferry terminal at Kennacraig. When the Rest is closed, the detour around Crianlarich adds around an hour to what is already a long, and often tiring, journey. However many car drivers heading for Glasgow have discovered an alternative - they can drive through Cowal then take the car ferry from Dunoon to Gourock. This is not ideal and is more expensive but some may consider it preferable in practice to such a long road journey. This, however, is not an option for people who rely on public transport. But the practical implications for people who want to make shorter journeys from one side of the Rest to the other are, ironically, often more severe in relative terms.  For instance an Inveraray residents may want to visit Dumbarton or Helensburgh to visit their bank branch. Inveraray business owners are also concerned about the loss of trade from day trippers.

"The teenager's #FridaysForFuture protest has grown into a global movement Climate change activist Greta Thunberg says she is trademarking her name and the #FridaysForFuture movement to stop people from impersonating her. In 2018, Ms Thunberg's school strike grew into a global movement that became known as #FridaysForFuture. Millions of people in countries such as Australia, Ghana, Germany and the UK have taken part in the protests. She said on Instagram that people had tried to sell products and collect money in the movement's name. ""My name and the #Fridaysforfuture movement are constantly being used for commercial purposes without any consent whatsoever,"" the 17 year old said. Who is Greta Thunberg? US treasury chief goads climate activist Thunberg Ms Thunberg has also applied to trademark Skolstrejk fÃ¶r klimatet (school strike for climate), the phrase used on her protest sign that she has carried around the world to #FridaysForFuture protests.

"A flight to bring about 200 British nationals back to the UK from coronavirus-hit Wuhan is unable to take off as planned on Thursday. It is understood relevant permissions from Chinese officials have not yet come through. Downing Street said it was ""working with Chinese authorities so the flight can take off as soon as possible"". The virus has caused at least 170 deaths,spreading to every Chinese regionand at least 15 other countries. The flight from Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged, had been expected to arrive on Thursday morning. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said when the passengers do return, they are due to land at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and be transported to former NHS staff accommodation in the north west of England. They will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"", a Downing Street spokesman said. A small team of military medics is flying out to Wuhan to accompany passengers on the repatriation flight, the Ministry of Defence said. World 'must be on alert' over China virus - WHO Britons warned against travel to mainland China Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Passengers catch last BA flights amid virus fears In a separate development, British Airways said it had extended its cancellation of services to mainland China until 29 February, following Foreign Office guidance against ""all but essential travel"" to the country. Britons waiting for the UK government's repatriation flight said they had been told it had been put back ""provisionally"" to Friday. Several UK citizens said they faced a stark choice as family members with Chinese citizenship were not being permitted to travel by local authorities. Matt Raw lives in Wuhan with his mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, and his wife, who helps care for her. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that his wife had been prevented from flying so the whole family was staying. Matt Raw has chosen to stay in Wuhan because his wife has been prevented from travelling He said they were also concerned about the risks of flying, having seen reports that three Japanese people on evacuation flights were found to have the virus. Adam Bridgeman said he would stay in Wuhan if his wife and one-month-old son were not allowed to fly with him. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that remaining in Wuhan with a newborn was ""a tough situation"" as they were ""not willing to take the risk"" of bringing him to hospital for routine treatment such as vaccinations. Jeff Siddle, from Northumberland, told the BBC his family faced a ""terrible dilemma"" after he and his nine-year-old daughter were told they could fly back - but not his Chinese wife, who has a permanent residency visa for the UK. This video can not be played Jeff Siddle's wife will have to stay behind in Wuhan when he leaves with their daughter As it stands, Mr Siddle's wife is not travelling back to the UK with him. ""I think there's still negotiations to get that changed, but the official line is still that she can't fly,"" he said. Chinese health authorities said there were 7,711 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country as of Wednesday night. The Foreign Office said a number of other countries' flights had also been unable to take off as planned. Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, with Japan, the US and the EU among those repatriating their citizens. Some 200 Japanese nationals have been flown from Wuhan and have landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Roughly 200 Americans - including workers from the local US consulate - have also left Wuhan on an evacuation flight. However, a number of UK citizens in China said local authorities had prevented members of their families from leaving because they held Chinese passports. Another UK citizen due to be flown out of Wuhan said she wastold to leave behind her three-year-old son because he has a Chinese passport. Natalie Francis works as a teacher in Wuhan Natalie Francis, originally from York, said: ""I literally had no words when I got the call."" The Foreign Office said its priority was to keep British nationals and their families together. The World Health Organization (WHO) will decide later whether the virus constitutes a global health emergency. It is a basic question, but the answer is elusive. It is far too simplistic to take the 170 deaths and the 7,711 cases and come up with a death rate of 2%. We are in the middle of the outbreak and thousands of those patients are still being treated. We don't know if they will live or die, so they can't be used in these calculations. We also don't know how many mild and undetected cases are out there. Also, the deadliness of the new virus is only one component of its threat. Flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, not because it is super-deadly, but because it is able to infect so many people. Professor Sian Griffiths said the ""shared response across the world"" to the new coronavirus was more effective than during the 2003 SARS outbreak, which she examined in an official inquiry. She told BBC Breakfast that world governments were ""taking everything very seriously in an attempt to contain the virus"", deploying greater resources and offering clear public health messages.

"Travel out of China has been severely restricted British nationals trapped in Wuhan will return home later, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. A flight carrying 150 Britons and 50 EU citizens was scheduled to leave China for at 07:00 local time (23:00 GMT Thursday), but it has been delayed. They will fly to RAF Brize Norton before the UK nationals are quarantined at a centre believed to be Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral. The remaining passengers will then fly to another EU airport. The World Health Organization (WHO)has declared an international public health emergencyover the outbreak. And the UK's four chief medical officers have said they were raising the risk level from low to moderate. ""This does not mean we think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed at this stage, but that government should plan for all eventualities,"" a joint statement said. They added that it was ""likely"" there would be ""individual"" cases of coronavirus in the UK. But they said they were confident the heath services would be able to protect the public and provide high quality care. So far, the virus has caused 213 deaths in China, where health officials have confirmed 9,692 cases. Elsewhere, 98 cases have been confirmed across 15 other countries. As of Wednesday,161 tests have been carried out,externalon people across the UK - all with negative results. The flight to repatriate UK citizens comes as airline Virgin Atlantic announced it had suspended its flights between Britain and China due to fears about the spread of the virus. Passengers flying from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, will be checked by Chinese officials at a handling centre in the airport, then taken to its departure area where they will be met by British officials. Anyone who is unwell will not be allowed to board the flight, which will have a team of Ministry of Defence medics on board. Wirral West MP Margaret Greenwood said she was told by the health secretary that the government did not think any of the people being flown back from Wuhan would be carrying the virus. BBC health editor Hugh Pym said he understood UK passengers would be taken to NHS staff accommodation. They will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"", a Downing Street spokesman said. The flight had been due to leave Wuhan earlier but was delayed because of a lack of clearance from Chinese authorities.

"Byron Wright had a lung transplant and wears a face mask because he has a suppressed immune system There has been a ""dramatic increase"" in face masks being bought as some think they may help halt the coronavirus spreading, a supplier has said. Theoutbreak has killed 170 in Chinaand infections have spread to at least 15 other countries. People have been tested for the virus in the UK. One medical supplies firm has sold out of its entire 500 face-mask stock. But Public Health Wales said there was ""insufficient evidence"" to suggest there was any benefit from wearing one. The agency added people should only do so if directed to by a doctor. Wynne Lloyd-Williams, of Cymru Healthcare, said they had seen a spike in demand for face masks. How are coronavirus patients treated? How worried should we be? You asked, we answered Visual guide to the outbreak Mr Lloyd-Williams, managing director of the Merthyr-based medical supplies firm, said it had sold its entire stock of 500 masks to a Chinese buyer from Leicestershire. ""We've seen a dramatic increase in demand,"" he said. ""This is unusual. They are not a significant product, but people now are thinking 'should we purchase them?'"" Some experts say frequent hand washing can also help to protect against catching a virus Surgical masks were first introduced into hospitals in the late 18th Century but they did not make the transition into public use until the Spanish flu outbreak in 1919. Using them to prevent infection is popular in many countries around the world but virologists are sceptical about their effectiveness against airborne viruses, although there issome evidence to suggest they can helpprevent hand-to-mouth transmissions. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? One man with cystic fibrosis said he was concerned about the availability of respirator masks due to the outbreak. Byron Wright had a lung transplant and has a suppressed immune system so uses a mask to protect against viruses. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? The 37-year-old's wife Glesni said viruses increase the risk of his body rejecting the new organ. She said it was harder and more expensive to buy the masks online since the outbreak in China. Mrs Wright, 36, who is her husband's full time carer, has been online to order respirator masks, but she was refunded her money as the company could not fulfil the order. Following more searching online, she was able to buy some masks, but she said prices had increased due to demand. Coronavirus has caused more than 170 deaths since the outbreak started in China A pharmacy in Cardiff told BBC Wales that, while it does not stock face masks, it had received up to 30 queries in recent days. The coronavirus death has prompted people in the affected areas to wear the masks when in public in the hope it helps stop the spread of the virus. But the increase in demand has caused problems for the Wrights, who live in Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog. Lecturer to leave China amid coronavirus lockdown Britons on Wuhan flights to be quarantined ""Since the coronavirus started we are taking more precautions and wanted to make sure we had enough masks,"" said Mrs Wright. ""I started to look on other websites and saw that many are out of stock and the ones available had significantly increased in price. ""You could get 10 masks for Â£10 but now they are around Â£6 to Â£10 each. This is a worrying time for people like us who depend on these types of masks. ""Some people don't care if they get a cold or a virus, they go to work as usual, but it can change our lives forever."" Glesni Wright: ""This is a worrying time for people like us who depend on these types of masks"" But a Public Health Wales (PHW) spokesman said: ""There is insufficient evidence to suggest that there is any benefit to members of the general public from wearing a face mask. ""The risk to the general public from the N-CoV infection remains low. ""Public Health Wales would not encourage people to buy or start wearing face masks unless they have been directed to do so by a clinician.""

"This video can not be played Paul Farnes on what it was like to fly in the Battle of Britain The last surviving Battle of Britain ace pilot from World War Two has died aged 101. Wing Cdr Paul Farnes was among the 3,000 airmen - The Few - who defended Britain's skies in 1940. He was born in Hampshire and died on Tuesday morning in West Sussex, where he had lived for most of his life, the Battle of Britain Memorial Trust said. Paying tribute, it described him as a ""distinguished man - who was generous with his time in support of the trust"". His battle victories made Wing Cdr Farnes an ace, a term taken to mean any fighter pilot credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft. His tally was six enemy aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and six damaged, the trust said. Wing Cdr Farnes at memorial day at Capel-le-Ferne, Folkestone There are now thought to be only two surviving members of The Few - Flight Lieutenant William Clark and Flying Officer John Hemingway, both aged 100. The trust added Wing Cdr Farnes was the last member of The Few fit enough to be able to attend the aerial conflict's memorial day in 2019. It said he had ""proudly"" represented his RAF colleagues at the service of commemoration just a week before his 101st birthday, in July. The trust said Wing Cdr Farnes was ""very proud"" of his Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM), which he received for his exploits in the Battle of Britain. In 2015, the then retired Sqn Ldr described the ""moving"" moment he and his comrades were spontaneously applauded during a service at Westminster Abbey to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Mr Farnes, who flew a Hurricane during the war, said: ""It was very emotional today because, when we walked out of the abbey, the audience applauded and it's never happened before at the annual service and I was very moved by it. ""It is amazing that the Battle of Britain has caught on with the public and I am very proud to have been a part of it."" Battle of Britain pilot dies after 100th birthday Battle of Britain museum opens Battle of Britain window rededicated Mr Farnes joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in 1938, later joining RAF No 501 Squadron and fighting in the Battle of France in 1940. After the Battle of Britain, he was commissioned as an officer and served as an instructor and fought in Malta with No 229 Squadron as well as serving in North Africa and Iraq. As World War Two ended, he was in command of two squadrons in the UK. Remaining in the RAF until 1958 when, having been appointed Sqn Ldr, he retired, retaining the rank of Wing Cdr. What was the Battle of Britain? Paul Farnes became an ace pilot flying the Hurricane in the Battle of Britain On 16 July 1940, Adolf Hitler ordered preparations for the invasion of Britain codenamed Operation Sealion. Britain retained naval superiority and Hitler knew that an amphibious invasion would be made easier if Germany could establish control of the air in the battle zone. The battle for control of the skies became known as theBattle of Britain. The Luftwaffe had the clear advantage - 750 long-range and 250 dive bombers, 600 single-engined and 150 twin-engined fighters - significantly more than RAF Fighter Command's 600 planes. But the Luftwaffe was hampered by an inconsistent plan of action whereas the British forces were well prepared. Radar technology - being used for the first time in battle - gave plenty of notice of the German bombing raids. The air attacks were initially focused on British shipping, ports and airfields along the English Channel but gradually the battle moved inland. The Germans stepped up their bombing raids in August and targeted London. Britain retaliated by bombing Berlin. The German forces were losing bombers quicker than they could replace them and so they switched to night-time raids, which continued until March 1941. But by then Britain had won the Battle of Britain - and Operation Sealion was postponed until further notice. What it was like to fly in the Battle of Britain.

"A proposed design for an HS2 train Sajid Javid has decided to throw his support behind HS2 ahead of a key meeting with Boris Johnson later. The chancellor is expected to tell the PM he supports the controversial London to Birmingham rail link after studying Treasury analysis of its impact,as first reported by the Financial Times,external. A leaked report has suggested the project could cost almost double the official 2015 estimate of Â£56bn. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the HS2 decision would come next month. No 10 said the meeting, also involving Mr Shapps, was expected to go a long way towards reaching a verdict. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the mood music seemed to be pointing towards going ahead but massive anxieties remained. Senior government figures had suggested that cancelling the project at this stage would be a ""credibility issue"", she added. HS2: Give me the facts, says Shapps What is HS2 and why is it so expensive? During Transport Questions in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Shapps said MPs ""won't have to wait very long"" to hear a decision on HS2, adding: ""We will have an announcement on this next month."" Mr Shapps also defended the right of Conservative MPs to oppose HS2, following growing criticism of the project from a number of them. In response to Labour MP for Chesterfield Toby Perkins, who urged the government to ""get control"" of MPs ""who are constantly undermining"" HS2, Mr Shapps said they were entitled to represent the views of their constituents. He added that the project should be properly debated. HS2 rail project to be reviewed Rail firm Northern to be nationalised Phase 1 of the rail line between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester scheduled for completion by 2032-33. It is designed to carry trains capable of travelling at 250mph (402km/h). The government commissioned a review into HS2 last August, designed, ministers said, to determine whether the project could still be deemed value for money. Billions of pounds have already been spent on it, but Mr Shapps has refused to rule out scrapping it entirely. He revealed last week he had asked for more data before making a ""massive decision"" on HS2, after a leaked government review found it could cost Â£106bn. The unpublished report, which has been seen by the BBC, suggests HS2 could cost more than Â£100bn but advises against cancelling the project, arguing it would cut overcrowding on trains and help rebalance the UK's economy. It also says scrapping HS2 would have a detrimental impact on the UK's ""fragile"" construction industry. The report recommends that more work is needed on the northern stretches to ensure they're better integrated with existing railways and other planned infrastructure projects. The government previously promised to make a decision on HS2 before the end of 2019. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? Several Tory MPs have criticised the project, including Tory MP for Buckingham Greg Smith, who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he and others would be ready to vote against the government. ""It is absolutely wrong for my constituents,"" he said, ""and I believe it to be wrong for the country as well and I made very clear commitments in the general election that come what may I will oppose HS2."" In the Commons on Thursday, Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, called HS2 a ""catastrophic waste of money"". He said ""better infrastructure"" was needed in the North and West Yorkshire and he asked about the government's intended timetable for completing Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). The NPR project was part of Mr Johnson's wider commitment to deliver a high-speed railway link across the north of England. But Labour MP Mr Perkins urged the government to commit to HS2, calling it ""the most important infrastructure project this country has"". And the prime minister also faced calls to back HS2 from Conservative MPs at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.

"Baroness Scotland is head of the Commonwealth Secretariat - the organisation's main intergovernmental agency The secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Baroness Scotland, has been strongly criticised by internal auditors for awarding a lucrative consultancy contract to a company run by a personal friend. The international organisation's Audit Committee accused her of ""circumventing"" the usual competitive tendering rules by awarding a Â£250,000 commission to KYA Global. The firm, owned by fellow Labour peer, Lord Patel of Bradford, was contracted to carry out a review of the Commonwealth Secretariat, the body headed by Lady Scotland from London. But the audit committee report claimed that Lord Patel's firm was ""apparently insolvent"" at the time with debts worth more than Â£40,000. And it stated that the Commonwealth Secretariat was unable to provide the auditors with KYA Global's final report setting out its recommendations. The committee's report - obtained by the BBC - expressed concerns that the Secretariat's ""acts and omissions"" in relation to the contract - and other alleged failings it identifies - ""[endanger] the integrity"" of the institution and risk ""serious reputational if not actual damage"". Commonwealth body in 'urgent need' of reform Concerns raised over Commonwealth leadership Commonwealth roiled by employment row Lady Scotland's lawyers insisted the decision to award the contract was fully justified and complied with procurement procedures at the time. The Secretariat is the central administrative hub for the Commonwealth, made up of 53 countries - many of them former British colonies - which encompass almost a third of the world's population. The critical report may raise fresh questions about whether Lady Scotland will be given a second term of office by Commonwealth heads of government when they meet in Rwanda later this year. There is already disquiet among some member states about the way the Secretariat has been run. The BBC understands that one leading Commonwealth country has recently stopped giving funds to the institution. Lady Scotland and Lord Patel were once Labour ministers together in the House of Lords. Baroness Scotland tweeted a photograph of herself with Lord Patel in 2016 The investigation into his appointment was carried out by the external accounting firm KPMG in September last year at the request of the Commonwealth High Commissioners in London, who together form the international organisation's board of governors. KPMG found that the consultancy contract was given to Lord Patel in April 2016 on ""the personal recommendation from SG Scotland"" because he had ""a high level of proven trust with the secretary general"". Lady Scotland asked one of her deputies to fill out a form waiving the usual competitive tendering rules, which she then approved. The audit committee said the initial contract was for Â£90,000 inclusive of VAT for three months' work. That was then extended for a second contract worth Â£162,000 for a further six months' work, it claimed, and no other firm was considered. According to KYA Global's accounts, the firm at the time had assets of Â£971 and debts of Â£48,762. In its report, dated 21 November 2019, the Commonwealth's audit committee said: ""Awarding an apparently insolvent company two contracts totalling Â£252,000 is unusual."" The committee said it was concerned that ""disclosing a real or perceived conflict of interest and then instructing a subordinate to prepare the waiver in order to approve it circumvented a fundamental control in the procurement process"". It also found that the Secretariat had no register either of tender waivers or conflicts of interest and was unable to explain why not. Under Commonwealth rules, competitive tendering procedures can be waived in certain circumstances, such as if a decision has to be taken urgently or if there are not enough suppliers. The committee identified no fewer than 50 occasions between July 2015 and June 2018 when the usual procurement tenders had been waived by the Commonwealth Secretariat. Some of these decisions predated Lady Scotland's appointment in April 2016. Baroness Scotland tweeted a photograph of Lord Patel in 2015 The report concluded: ""The audit committee is concerned that the acts and omissions set out above as well as the absence of any explanation for those failures endangers the integrity of the Secretariat. ""At the very least the failures identified risk serious reputational if not actual damage to the Secretariat."" It added: ""Despite requests, the audit committee have not been provided with the report prepared by KYA Global and delivered as a final document by 30 June 2016 as required in the initial contract."" In a statement, Lady Scotland's solicitors, Carter-Ruck, said that KYA Global Ltd was awarded the two contracts ""on the basis of its proven track record in change management consultancy"" and its services were ""dearly needed"" at the beginning of Lady Scotland's term of office. It said: ""This decision was wholly justifiable and SG Scotland was advised that this complied with the procurement procedures that were in force at the time. ""SG Scotland began her post as Commonwealth Secretary-General on 1 April 2016 when the Secretariat was in a very poor financial position and was in dire need of reform. ""She was tasked with transforming the organisation urgently. ""The appointment of KYA, a leading change management consultancy, was one of the steps SG Scotland took to bring about that change in haste."" Commonwealth boss Baroness Scotland Carter-Ruck insisted that KYA Global ""has never been deemed insolvent and it is false to insinuate otherwise"". It said: ""The assertion that KYA Global was a legally insolvent company is wrong and has been made clear to the Secretariat's audit committee chair. ""In addition, it is false and misleading to say that KYA Global was awarded contracts totalling Â£252,000. ""Rather KYA Global was actually awarded two contracts worth Â£75,000 (plus VAT) each. These contract awards constitute heavily subsidised rates from the fees which KYA Global could have charged the Secretariat."" The statement continued: ""The decision to award KYA Global the contracts has been fully justified in light of the recent success of the Secretariat which has gone from strength to strength in recent years and has successfully undergone a modernisation process. ""The Secretariat has complied fully with the request of its auditors and has adopted and implemented, or is implementing, their recommendations."" The BBC made repeated attempts to contact Lord Patel but there was no response.

"Former Rangers youth player Billy Gilmour signed for Chelsea in 2017 at the age of 16 Registration rules that tie very young footballers to professional clubs are to be reviewed, the Scottish Football Association's chief executive has said. Ian Maxwell told a Scottish Parliament committee there was a ""willingness and openness"" to see if the regulations were still fit for purpose. Holyrood's petitions committee has been looking at the ""appropriateness"" of children under 16 signing agreements. MSPs questioned whether clubs were treating children as commodities. Young players can register for a professional club from the age of 10 and a system is in place to compensate clubs for the money they have invested in training and developing a young player who then moves to another team. But such payments are rare in Scotland with just 10 cases of compensation sought in the past two years in the context of more than 2,000 players in the club academy system. The SFA argues that registration is not a contract but it does bind the player to the club. The registration applies to age groups 10 to 14 but can be extended into the 15 to 17 age groups. Ian Maxwell said that if a young player wants to leave a club they can Mr Maxwell, who has been SFA chief executive for 18 months, said a working party had been set up to review the registration process. He was pressed by committee convener Jackie Baillie on whether three-year registration of young players would be abolished but said he could not ""second guess"" the outcome of the review. Mr Maxwell, who was previously managing director of Partick Thistle, said: ""If a player does not want to be at a club any more, the player can leave the club. ""There are mechanisms by which that can happen. There are guidelines laid down by which that can occur."" However, he said football clubs were willing to review whether the current system of registration was the correct one. Mr Maxwell said the working party would look at registration rules, specifically issues with signing deals at 13 or 14 that extend into the 15 to 17 age group, often viewed by coaches as being the most crucial period in a young player's development. The Holyrood petition on youth football has been running for 10 years. MSPs have previously said they had ""serious concerns"" over contracts and agents in Scotland's youth football system. Among the concerns raised are the compensation payments creating a ""transfer market"" for child players and the ability for players to leave teams being curtailed. The petitions committee previously heard from Jim Sinclair, former director of youth development at Rangers, that the compensation scheme for young players ""can turn into a transfer market or end up in a bartering situation"", adding that some parents ""do not have full knowledge of the ramifications"" of their children signing deals with clubs. The committee has also previously questioned football chiefs over claims under-16 players had been paid Â£1 a week, and heard there were no background checks for player agents. Mr Maxwell said clubs must be minimum wage compliant and paying Â£1 a week would be ""absolutely breaking the law"". He urged anyone who was not paid minimum wage to come forward. Last year the Scottish FA unveiled afive-year plan to ensure protection for childrenat all levels of the sport. 'Serious concerns' over Scottish youth football system Scottish youth football contracts probed Football abuse: SFA publish child safety strategy Earlier, Tam Baillie, who was Scotland's children's commissioner between 2009 and 2017, praised the SFA's inquiry into historic sexual abuse but warned the issue would not be properly tackled unless the ""commercial exploitation of children"" is ended. He said: ""If you think about it these clubs have the dreams of these young players in the palm of their hand. There is a power imbalance between the clubs and the young players."" Youth coach Scott Robertson is behind the petition, which is the longest running in the parliament's history Scott Robertson, a youth coach with more than 30 years' experience who submitted the petition with fellow coach Willie Smith, said ""Why have we created a system where we have to transfer money for 13 or 14-year-old children and if the money's not paid they're stuck with the club whether they like it or not."" Mr Robertson said it was often difficult for players or parents to talk about the situation for fear of being ""blacklisted"" and effectively putting an end to their career. FIFA regulations allow football associations to adopt a system for the financial reward of clubs investing in the training and education of young players. Neil Doncaster, chief executive of the Scottish Professional Football League, who represents the clubs, has previously saidthe current system of compensation payments ""strikes the appropriate balance"", as it needs to protect clubs as well as young people. He said there had to be incentive for clubs to put time and money into developing young players, who could potentially be ""hoovered up"" by richer clubs. Ross McArthur, chairman of Dunfermline Athletic, told BBC Scotland a fair and equitable system was needed for both players and the clubs. He said: ""I think sometimes in football that people are treated as though they are a commodity but they're not, they're a person and that's the culture that we try and push down all the age groups and look after people."" But Mr McArthur said the compensation scheme has to be protected in some form though as if it is not then it would be ""not viable"" for his club and many others to continue to develop players if they could move to bigger teams for free.

"UK car production sank to its lowest in almost a decade in 2019, with output forecast to continue falling this year. Factories produced 1.3 million units last year, down 14.2% on 2018 and the third consecutive year of decline, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturing and Traders. Structural changes in the industry, Brexit uncertainty, and weak exports were all factors, the trade body said. SMMT boss Mike Hawes called the worst figures since 2010 ""a grave concern"". Production of cars to be sold in the UK fell 12.3% last year, while vehicles for export fell 14.7%. With 81% of cars built for export - the vast majority sent to the European Union - Mr Hawes again stressed the importance of a barrier-free EU trade deal after Brexit. Shipments to EU countries fell by 11.1% last year, but the bloc remains the industry's most important market ""Given the uncertainty the sector has experienced, it is essential to protect our global competitiveness, and that starts with an ambitious free trade agreement with Europe - one that guarantees all automotive products can be bought and sold without tariffs or additional burdens,"" he said. Britain leaves the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday, although trade rules will remain unchanged until the end of the transition period in December. Mr Hawes does not anticipate any disruption to exports or imports, as the threat of a cliff-edge Brexit that spooked the industry last year has receded. But given the integrated nature of the European motor industry, with parts, components and cars going back and forth across borders several times during the production process, a trade deal needed to be struck as soon as possible, he said. There was a big rise in production of electric and hybrid vehicles ""This will boost manufacturing, avoid costly price rises and maintain choice for UK consumers. Negotiations will be challenging but all sides stand to gain,"" Mr Hawes said. He estimates that the imposition of tariffs on cars and components will add Â£1,500 to the price of an average car, currently about Â£22,700. A satisfactory trade deal will unlock a pipeline of investment into the UK, by both manufactures and the supply chain, he said. Carlos Tavares, chief executive of France's PSA Group, which owns Vauxhall, has stressed the importance of a trade deal to secure investment at the UK company's Ellesmere Port factory, in Cheshire. It's dreadful news for car workers, but the fall in new cars sales may be good for the environment. It may also provoke a deeper debate about the role of the car in society. Perhaps people are putting off buying a car until they see how Brexit works out, or because they're uncertain how electric car charging will progress. But other changes are underway - such as the move away fromcar ownership among young people. In the 1990s, 80% of people were driving by 30; now this marker is only reached by 45. And men under 30 are travelling only half the miles their fathers did. Some young people can't afford cars. Others worry about the environment, and take public transport or perhaps hire a car when they need one. Yet still the government predicts a growth in traffic, and is planning Â£28.8bn spending on roads. The independentCommission on Travel Demand,externalsays this should lead to a government re-think about travel priorities. Manufacturing output this year is forecast to fall less sharply, to about 1.27 million units, with companies having already started adjusting to structural changes, such as the slump in diesel cars, new emissions regulations, and investment in electric and hybrid cars. Mr Hawes said a bright spot in last year's figures was a 34.7% rise in production of electric and hybrid vehicles. But with 192,304 units produced, it was a small part of the overall total. ""The challenge to the industry is how quickly it can move,"" Mr Hawes said. ""Environmental pressures are not going away. They are going to increase."" Alongside the production data, the SMMT released new figures highlighting the motor industry's contribution to the UK economy. About 168,000 people - one in 14 - employed in manufacturing works in automotive, with an additional 279,000 jobs supported by the sector. In the north east and west Midlands, automotive accounts for more than one in six manufacturing jobs.

In the past five years alone, the world has faced outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, another coronavirus called Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and now the virus simply  known as ""2019-nCoV"". It's already infected thousands of people and killed more than 100. But unlike in many previous outbreaks, where vaccines to protect people have taken years to develop, research for a vaccine to help stem this outbreak got under way within hours of the virus being identified. Chinese officials released its genetic code very quickly. That information helps scientists determine where the virus probably came from, how it might mutate as the outbreak develops, and how to protect people against it. With technological advances and greater commitment from governments around the world to fund research on emerging diseases, research facilities were able to spring into action fast. At Inovio's lab in San Diego, scientists are using a relatively new type of DNA technology to develop a potential vaccine. ""INO-4800"" - as it's currently called - with plans for it to enter human trials by the early summer. Kate Broderick, senior vice-president of research and development at Inovio, said: ""Once China had provided the DNA sequence of this virus, we were able to put it through our lab's computer technology and design a vaccine within three hours. ""Our DNA medicine vaccines are novel in that they use DNA sequences from the virus to target specific parts of the pathogen which we believe the body will mount the strongest response to. ""We then use the patient's own cells to become a factory for the vaccine, strengthening the body's own natural response mechanisms."" Scientists hope to have a vaccine ready to enter human trial by early summer Inovio says if the initial human trials are a success, larger trials would follow, ideally in an outbreak setting in China ""by the end of the year"". It is impossible to predict whether this outbreak is likely to have ended by then. But if Inovio's timeline goes to plan, the company says it will be the quickest a new vaccine has ever been developed and tested in an outbreak situation. The last time a similar virus - Sars - emerged in 2002 - China was slow to let the world know what was happening. So by the time work on a vaccine started in earnest, the outbreak was almost over. The timeline of 2019-nCoV 31 December 2019-  China alerts the World Health Organization (WHO) about a spate of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan 1 January 2020-  The seafood/animal market believed to be at the centre of the outbreak is closed 9 January- The WHO says the infection is caused by a new type of coronavirus 10 January- China shares the genetic code of the new virus 11 January- Scientists start working on a vaccine - and the first death confirmed 13 January- Virus spreads abroad for the first time, with a case in Thailand The work in these labs is being funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is made up of and funded by governments and philanthropic organisations from around the world. It was created in the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to provide funding to accelerate the development of vaccines for new diseases. Dr Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at Cepi, said: ""The mission is to make sure that outbreaks are no longer a threat to humanity and to develop vaccines for emerging infectious diseases."" Cepi is also funding two other programmes that are developing a vaccine for this new coronavirus. The University of Queensland is working on a ""molecular clamp"" vaccine, which it says ""enables targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens."" Fermenters grow bacteria to provide the main ingredient for a vaccine Moderna Inc in Massachusetts has also joined forces with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to accelerate its research. The WHO is co-ordinating this global quest for a new vaccine. It says it is following the progress of a number of research facilities, including the three supported by Cepi. Although efforts to come up with a vaccine for this new coronavirus have been accelerated, research is still at an early stage at all the facilities in the race to find a new vaccine. Clinical trials take time and are best carried out within an outbreak setting. There are no guarantees any of the designs so far will be safe and effective enough to be used in the outbreak in China. Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo from the WHO's Health Emergencies programme said: ""We have developed a framework to inform decisions on which candidate vaccine(s) should be tested first. ""The experts will consider a number of criteria, including acceptable safety profile, induction of appropriate immune responses, and the timely availability of sufficient supplies of vaccine doses. ""Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, its transmission, its clinical severity and developing effective counter measures is critical for the control of the outbreak."" The WHO is due to decide which vaccine will be tested on humans first in the coming days. Inovio has announced that it will collaborate with a biotech company in Beijing who can help manage human trials which are due to start in the summer. Dr J. Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio, said: ""This collaboration allows us to enter China and deliver our vaccine into the areas where they need it most as soon as possible.""

"Ulster University (UU) has requested a loan of Â£126m from the Department for the Economy (DfE) to complete its Belfast campus. That is according to evidence given by a senior departmental official to Stormont's Economy Committee. The NI Audit Office had previously saidthe final cost was expected to be Â£100m over the original budget. UU said ongoing costs for the building were being closely managed and monitored. According to an audit office report in December, the original business case for the campus put the cost at Â£254m but it was now expected to cost Â£363.9m. Heather Cousins from DfE was questioned about problems with the Belfast campus by MLAs on the committee. In response to a question from Sinn FÃ©in MLA John O'Dowd, Ms Cousins said ""stringent"" conditions would be in place around the loan. ""The university got into difficulty with this particular project and we need to have assurance that they are going to be able to manage it in the future and that we won't see further significant cost increases,"" she said. Later, responding to a question from DUP MLA Gordon Dunne, Ms Cousins said the building was due to be completed in 2021. However, she said the department would scrutinise the project much more closely than it had done before. Mr Dunne asked why that scrutiny had not previously happened. In response, Ms Cousins said universities were autonomous bodies and the department's role had been limited to asking for regular update reports. ""We were aware, for at least the last year, that things were going wrong and we not getting regular reports,"" she said. ""It's our understanding also that the university council were not getting full information and this has led to our concern about how the council and the senior executive team are interacting with each other."" She said there were ""pre-conditions"" to the additional loan which would require the university to demonstrate its financial sustainability and their governance. However, Ms Cousins said the project had been ""turned around"". ""We are more confident this will be delivered when they are saying it will be delivered, but it's not without risk,"" she said. Later in the committee hearing, an official from the department's higher education division said a conditional loan offer had been made to the university subject to Department of Finance approval. Trevor Cooper also said the interest on the loan to UU was ""a quarter per cent"". The university originally secured a Â£150m loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB), and also received a grant of Â£16m from the Department for the Economy (DfE) towards the cost of the building. However, the EIB withdrew the loan facility in 2017 due to delays in the project. Lagan Construction Group, which was part of a joint venture building the campus,went into administration in March 2018causing a further setback. The NI Audit Office said the university had, so far, spent Â£61.8m on the campus and had earmarked another Â£90m in spending from its own budget and reserves. In addition to the Â£16m grant, UU had also received Â£73.5m in additional loans from the Northern Ireland Executive. The new Â£126m loan would be additional to that previous money. A spokesperson for Ulster University said the new Belfast campus was one of the largest higher education capital builds in Europe and would deliver a world-class facility. ""An independent assessment of this project's overall regeneration impact details benefits to the NI economy of Â£1.4bn, through this significant investment in the aspirations of our young people, the city and beyond,"" they said. They also said the university was working closely with the Department for the Economy and a range of external partners, and that ongoing costs were being closely managed and monitored. ""The overall cost to the university is expected to be no more than originally anticipated,"" the spokesperson added. ""This is due to increased build costs having been offset by restructured finance, and the use of higher levels of institutional reserves built up during the period of delay. ""The borrowing arrangements to complete the project are currently being finalised.""

"Acting Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin has been a police officer for 32 years The outgoing acting deputy chief constable of the PSNI said he has ""taken legal advice"" over not being shortlisted for the permanent role. Stephen Martin was appointed to the temporary position in August 2018. But he was not shortlisted to be interviewed for the full-time role andsubsequently announced he would retirein February. On Thursday night, the Policing Board backed a candidate. The justice minister must now approve the choice. A Policing Board spokesperson said the recommendation of the deputy chief constable appointment panel was unanimously ratified by the board. ""The board chair will now formally seek the approval of the justice minister for the appointment in line with legislative requirements."" Earlier,an Ulster Unionist MLA expressed concern over the appointment processfor the permanent position. Alan Chambers was to be one of five politicians involved in the process, but withdrew from the interview panel and wrote to the Policing Board, saying the process needed to be ""rigorously fair"". Mr Martin said he was shocked at missing out on the shortlist for the role, describing it as a ""gunk"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Seamus Leheny is policy manager for the Freight Transport Association The haulage industry will need government support to help with Brexit, the Freight Transport Association (FTA) has said. It comes as EU chief negotiatorMichel Barnier said the UK's choices make frictionless trade ""impossible"". Seamus Lehany, FTA policy manager, said financial aid will be needed. ""As an industry, we are going to have to provide the expertise, the paperwork to facilitate trade so we are going to need... funding for training."" Mr Lehany told BBC News NI that it is ""a quick turnaround time if we are going to have to do this"". ""We need staff to do this, and at the moment we lack the staff and training and expertise to deliver."" The UK, including Northern Ireland, is due to leave the EU on Friday. Mr Barnier said new checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain are an ""indispensable"" consequence of the Brexit deal. But last week the prime minister suggested GB-NI trade would remain ""unfettered"". A simple guide to Brexit Brexit: The UK's trade deals so far Frictionless GB to NI trade 'impossible' Those working in logistics are concerned the responsibility will fall to them as they transport goods to and from retailers and manufacturers. Beatties Distribution in Crumlin delivers two thousand packages every day across Northern Ireland with many arriving from Great Britain. Could more paperwork mean businesses have to put up their prices to consumers? Richard Armour, sales director at Beatties, said: ""It's going to mean a lot more administration for us, we've another six or seven administrative staff coming on so it's a greater cost. ""We probably spent Â£100,000 last year upgrading our service and we are going to have to spend that again this year - that all has to be paid for."" A Ballymoney retailer called North x South, that sells electrical goods to and from GB to NI, had set up a base in the Republic of Ireland in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Andy Kilpatrick is managing director of a company that sells electrical goods But it now thinks there will not be much impact on its operations. ""We don't foresee much of a change to consumer pricing - what we might find is small delays, "" managing director Andy Kilpatrick said. ""It might require new processes, there might be costs involved, it's just if we want to continue being in business, it's just part of life. Nobody really wants to invest any more resources in hypothetical situations,"" The Brexit deal means Northern Ireland will follow EU rules on agricultural and manufactured goods - the rest of the UK will not. Additionally, the whole of the UK will leave the EU's customs union but Northern Ireland will continue to enforce the EU's customs code at its ports. This means some new checks and processes for goods moving between Northern Ireland and other parts of the UK. The nature and extent of any checks will only become clear near the end of a one year transition period which expires at the end of 2020.

"A proposed design for an HS2 train Sajid Javid has decided to throw his support behind HS2 ahead of a key meeting with Boris Johnson later. The chancellor is expected to tell the PM he supports the controversial London to Birmingham rail link after studying Treasury analysis of its impact,as first reported by the Financial Times,external. A leaked report has suggested the project could cost almost double the official 2015 estimate of Â£56bn. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the HS2 decision would come next month. No 10 said the meeting, also involving Mr Shapps, was expected to go a long way towards reaching a verdict. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the mood music seemed to be pointing towards going ahead but massive anxieties remained. Senior government figures had suggested that cancelling the project at this stage would be a ""credibility issue"", she added. HS2: Give me the facts, says Shapps What is HS2 and why is it so expensive? During Transport Questions in the Commons on Thursday, Mr Shapps said MPs ""won't have to wait very long"" to hear a decision on HS2, adding: ""We will have an announcement on this next month."" Mr Shapps also defended the right of Conservative MPs to oppose HS2, following growing criticism of the project from a number of them. In response to Labour MP for Chesterfield Toby Perkins, who urged the government to ""get control"" of MPs ""who are constantly undermining"" HS2, Mr Shapps said they were entitled to represent the views of their constituents. He added that the project should be properly debated. HS2 rail project to be reviewed Rail firm Northern to be nationalised Phase 1 of the rail line between London and Birmingham is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester scheduled for completion by 2032-33. It is designed to carry trains capable of travelling at 250mph (402km/h). The government commissioned a review into HS2 last August, designed, ministers said, to determine whether the project could still be deemed value for money. Billions of pounds have already been spent on it, but Mr Shapps has refused to rule out scrapping it entirely. He revealed last week he had asked for more data before making a ""massive decision"" on HS2, after a leaked government review found it could cost Â£106bn. The unpublished report, which has been seen by the BBC, suggests HS2 could cost more than Â£100bn but advises against cancelling the project, arguing it would cut overcrowding on trains and help rebalance the UK's economy. It also says scrapping HS2 would have a detrimental impact on the UK's ""fragile"" construction industry. The report recommends that more work is needed on the northern stretches to ensure they're better integrated with existing railways and other planned infrastructure projects. The government previously promised to make a decision on HS2 before the end of 2019. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? Several Tory MPs have criticised the project, including Tory MP for Buckingham Greg Smith, who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he and others would be ready to vote against the government. ""It is absolutely wrong for my constituents,"" he said, ""and I believe it to be wrong for the country as well and I made very clear commitments in the general election that come what may I will oppose HS2."" In the Commons on Thursday, Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, called HS2 a ""catastrophic waste of money"". He said ""better infrastructure"" was needed in the North and West Yorkshire and he asked about the government's intended timetable for completing Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). The NPR project was part of Mr Johnson's wider commitment to deliver a high-speed railway link across the north of England. But Labour MP Mr Perkins urged the government to commit to HS2, calling it ""the most important infrastructure project this country has"". And the prime minister also faced calls to back HS2 from Conservative MPs at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.

"Byron Wright had a lung transplant and wears a face mask because he has a suppressed immune system There has been a ""dramatic increase"" in face masks being bought as some think they may help halt the coronavirus spreading, a supplier has said. Theoutbreak has killed 170 in Chinaand infections have spread to at least 15 other countries. People have been tested for the virus in the UK. One medical supplies firm has sold out of its entire 500 face-mask stock. But Public Health Wales said there was ""insufficient evidence"" to suggest there was any benefit from wearing one.

""We've seen a dramatic increase in demand,"" he said. ""This is unusual. They are not a significant product, but people now are thinking 'should we purchase them?'"" Some experts say frequent hand washing can also help to protect against catching a virus Surgical masks were first introduced into hospitals in the late 18th Century but they did not make the transition into public use until the Spanish flu outbreak in 1919. Using them to prevent infection is popular in many countries around the world but virologists are sceptical about their effectiveness against airborne viruses, although there issome evidence to suggest they can helpprevent hand-to-mouth transmissions. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? One man with cystic fibrosis said he was concerned about the availability of respirator masks due to the outbreak. Byron Wright had a lung transplant and has a suppressed immune system so uses a mask to protect against viruses. This video can not be played Epidemic v pandemic: What's the difference? The 37-year-old's wife Glesni said viruses increase the risk of his body rejecting the new organ. She said it was harder and more expensive to buy the masks online since the outbreak in China. Mrs Wright, 36, who is her husband's full time carer, has been online to order respirator masks, but she was refunded her money as the company could not fulfil the order. Following more searching online, she was able to buy some masks, but she said prices had increased due to demand. Coronavirus has caused more than 170 deaths since the outbreak started in China A pharmacy in Cardiff told BBC Wales that, while it does not stock face masks, it had received up to 30 queries in recent days. The coronavirus death has prompted people in the affected areas to wear the masks when in public in the hope it helps stop the spread of the virus. But the increase in demand has caused problems for the Wrights, who live in Manod, Blaenau Ffestiniog. Lecturer to leave China amid coronavirus lockdown Britons on Wuhan flights to be quarantined ""Since the coronavirus started we are taking more precautions and wanted to make sure we had enough masks,"" said Mrs Wright. ""I started to look on other websites and saw that many are out of stock and the ones available had significantly increased in price. ""You could get 10 masks for Â£10 but now they are around Â£6 to Â£10 each. This is a worrying time for people like us who depend on these types of masks. ""Some people don't care if they get a cold or a virus, they go to work as usual, but it can change our lives forever."" Glesni Wright: ""This is a worrying time for people like us who depend on these types of masks"" But a Public Health Wales (PHW) spokesman said: ""There is insufficient evidence to suggest that there is any benefit to members of the general public from wearing a face mask. ""The risk to the general public from the N-CoV infection remains low. ""Public Health Wales would not encourage people to buy or start wearing face masks unless they have been directed to do so by a clinician."" A Boots spokesman added: ""The best way to help prevent catching a virus is by making sure you regularly wash your hands with soap, and avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth to prevent transmission from surfaces, especially after blowing your nose, sneezing and coughing. ""Antiviral hand foams and gel can also be useful when you are out and about."" Dr Yvonne Griffiths is waiting for news about when she will be flown home from China The Foreign Office said it would fly 200 British citizens to the UK from Wuhan early on Friday before they are put in quarantine for two weeks on their arrival. Lecturer Yvonne Griffiths from Cardiff as beenstuck in a hotel in Wuhanafter the flight, which was originally set to depart of Thursday, was delayed because of a lack of clearance. She said: ""There's uncertainty where we will be staying for two weeks [during quarantine] and the conditions to expect when we get back."" PHW said some residents in Wales had been offered screening for the virus as they ""meet the current testing criteria"", but they would not say how many as numbers were ""so low"". The UK's Department of Health said on Wednesday that 130 people had been given the all-clear for the new coronavirus which can cause severe acute respiratory infection.

"Guo Jing lives in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the heart of the outbreak of a new virus which has got the world worried. Wuhan has been under lockdown since 23 January, to try to contain the infection. Transport is shut down, most shops and businesses closed, and people are being advised to stay at home. Jing is a 29-year-old social worker and rights activist who lives on her own. For the past week, she has kept a diary, which she shares here with the BBC. I didn't know what to dowhen I woke up and learned about the lockdown.I don't know what it means, how long it will last and what kind of preparations I should make. There are a lot of infuriating comments [on social media]: that many patients cannot be hospitalised after diagnosis [because of a lack of places], that patients with fever are not properly treated. Many more people are wearing masks. Friends have told me to stock up on supplies. Rice and noodles have almost sold out. This video can not be played Fears over coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortage A man was buying lots of salt, and someone asked him why he was buying so much. He replied: ""What if the lockdown lasted for a whole year?"" I went to a pharmacy and it was already limiting the number of shoppers. It had already sold out of masks and alcohol disinfectant. After stocking up on food, I am still in shock. Cars and pedestrians are dwindling, and the city has come to a stop all out of a sudden. When will the city live again? The world is quiet, and the silence is horrifying. I live alone, so I can only tell there are other human beings around from the occasional noises in the corridor. I have a lot of time to think about how to survive. I don't have any resources or connections. One of my goals is not to fall sick, so I have to make myself exercise. Food is crucial to survival too, so I have to know whether there is enough supply. The government hasn't said how long the lockdown will last, nor how we can carry on functioning. People are saying it might last until May. The pharmacy and the convenience store downstairs were closed today, but it was comforting to see that couriers are still out delivering food. Noodles are all sold out in the supermarkets, but there is some rice. I also went to the market today. I bought celery, garlic shoots and eggs. After going home, I washed all my clothes and took a shower. Personal hygiene is important - I think I am washing my hands 20 to 30 times a day. Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began People cry out 'stay strong' from Wuhan windows How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? Going out makes me feel that I am still connected to the world. It's very difficult to imagine how elderly citizens living alone and people with disabilities will get through this. I didn't want to cook less than usual, because it was the last night of the year of the pig - it was supposed to be a meal of celebration. Over dinner, I was on a video call with my friends. There was no escaping talk of the virus. Some people are in towns near Wuhan, some chose not to go home because of the disease, some still insist on gathering despite the outbreak. A friend coughed during the call. Someone jokingly told her to hang up! We chatted for three hours and I thought I could then fall asleep with happy thoughts. But when I closed my eyes, memories of the past few days came in flashbacks. Tears fell. I felt helpless, angry and sad. I thought about death, too. I don't have many regrets, because my job is meaningful. But I don't want my life to end. Today is Chinese New Year. I never have much interest in celebrating festivals, but now new year feels even more irrelevant. In the morning, I saw some blood after I sneezed, and I was scared. My brain was filled with worries about sickness. I was wondering if I should go out or not. But I had no fever and a good appetite, so I went out. I wore two masks even though people say it's pointless and unnecessary. I am worried about [poor quality] fakes, so a double mask makes me feel safer. It was still very quiet. Chinese wish is for new year health, not fortune Chinese diasporas stockpile surgical masks A flower shop was open, and the owner had placed some chrysanthemums [often used as funeral flowers] at the door. But I didn't know if that meant anything. In the supermarket, the vegetable shelves were empty and almost all dumplings and noodles were sold out. There were only a few people queuing. I keep having this urge to buy lots during each visit to the shop. I bought another 2.5 kg of rice, even though I have 7kg of rice at home. I also couldn't help buying some sweet potatoes, dumplings, sausages, red beans, green beans, millet and salted eggs. I don't even like salted eggs! I will give them to friends, after the lockdown is lifted. I have enough food for a month, and this compulsive buying seems crazy. But under such circumstances, how could I blame myself? I went for a walk by the river. Two snack shops were open and some people were out walking their dogs. I saw some others were taking a stroll as well - I guess they also didn't want to be trapped. I'd never walked along that road before. It felt like my world had expanded just a little bit. It not just the city that's trapped. It's also the voices of the people. On the first day of the lockdown, I couldn't write [anything about it] on social media [because of censorship]. I couldn't even write on WeChat. Internet censorship has existed for a long time in China, but now it feels even more cruel. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? How are coronavirus patients treated? Scientists race to develop a coronavirus vaccine Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? When your life is turned upside down, it's a challenge to build up your daily life again. I keep exercising in the mornings, using an app, but I can't focus because my brain is occupied. This video can not be played ""Wuhan, add oil!"": Watch residents shouting to boost morale in quarantined city I left home again today and tried to count how many people I met - I met eight during my walk to a noodle shop some 500m away from my home. I didn't want to go home. I wanted to explore more. It's only two months since I moved to Wuhan. I don't have many friends here, and I don't know the city very well. I guess I saw about 100 people today. I have to keep making myself heard and break the shackles. I hope everyone stays hopeful. Friends, I hope that we will meet and talk in the future. Around 8pm I heard the shouts of ""Go, Wuhan!"" from people's windows. The collective chanting is a form of self-empowerment. Panic has driven a wedge between people. In many cities, people are required to wear a face mask in public. On the face of it, the measure is to control the pneumonia outbreak. But actually it could lead to abuse of power. Some citizens without a mask have been thrown off public transport. We don't know why they didn't wear a mask. Perhaps they couldn't buy any, or they didn't know about the notice. No matter what, their rights to go out should not be taken away. In some videos circulating online, some people had sealed up the doors of people who'd self-quarantined themselves. People from Hubei province [where Wuhan is] were driven out of their homes and had nowhere to go. But at the same time, some people are offering accommodation to Hubei people. There are a lot of ways the government could encourage people to stay home. It has to ensure that every citizen has enough face masks, or even give cash rewards to citizens who stay home. Today, there's finally sunlight - just like my mood. I saw more people in my complex and there were a few community workers. They appeared to perform temperature checks on non-residents. It is not easy to build trust and bonds under a lockdown. The city is worn down by heaviness. In the midst of all this, I can't help but becoming more on-guard. My anxiety about survival has been slowly dissipating. Walking further in the city will be meaningless if I don't make any connections with people here. Social participation is an important need. Everyone has to find a role in society and makes one's life meaningful. In this lonely city, I have to find my role. Guo Jing also published parts of her diary on WeChat.

"Jo took out a number of loans with Wonga after losing her full-time job People who were mis-sold loans by the payday lender Wonga have been told that they will receive just 4.3% of the compensation they are owed. Administrators have begun informing around 400,000 claimants by letter, some of whom have reacted in dismay. Before its collapse, Wonga was vilified for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. One ex-customer told BBC News it was ""an insult"" to borrowers. ""Trust has really been damaged by this company, and the amount of compensation is an insult to the people that have been hurt by this,"" said Jo from Basingstoke. After Jo lost her full-time job and started in a role with fewer hours, she took out a series of loans with Wonga between 2010 and 2014 to make ends meet. ""My partner also lost his job, so things were really difficult,"" she says. ""We were stuck in a cycle where we were getting a payday loan out every month for between Â£50 and Â£100. It was really dangerous."" Wonga, which collapsed in 2018, was once the UK's biggest payday lender but its practices attracted intense scrutiny. Wonga's legacy of nearly 400,000 mis-sold loans Wonga collapses into administration In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found it had lent money to many who would never be able to repay, prompting a crackdown on the sector. Administrators have since received 380,000 eligible claims against the business worth Â£460m in total - an average of Â£1,200 a claim. Wonga was once the biggest payday lender in the UK But while claimants were warned they would get ""significantly less"" than full compensation, few expected to get so little. Jo says she was due a total of Â£208 in compensation, but was told she would only receive Â£8. ""It's more effort than it's worth to be honest. I've changed my bank account since, and sending them all the forms and details that I would have to would take ages. ""I'm also not sure if I can trust them with my details. People have been burnt,"" she says. Sara Williams, who runs Debt Camel, said former customers had been ""badly let down"" by regulators. ""Wonga ignored the regulator's rules about checking the affordability of loans and they were allowed to get away with this for 10 years. ""Now customers are being let down again because they are not getting the compensation they deserve from the regulator."" Hundreds of ex-customers have vented their anger on the Debt Camel site. One said: ""We have all been exploited, and we all know how much we have been exploited by. ""In my case Â£6,500, of which I'll receive less than Â£300."" Ms Williams said borrowers were not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which is overseen by the FCA, The scheme covers products such as payment protection insurance (PPI), fully reimbursing anyone who has been mis-sold to, but does not extend to payday loans. ""Borrowers from many payday lenders have been unable to get proper compensation after the lender has had to close,"" Ms Williams said. ""The FCA needs to rethink this and provide a safety net for people who were mis-sold unaffordable loans."" Wonga's administrators said claims should be paid within the next four weeks, later than the 20 January date initially promised. They also said loans being refunded would be removed from people's credit records within the next six weeks - likely to be a relief to many. Some people still owe money to Wonga but it is unclear what will happen to their balances. Ms Williams said administrators were no longer taking payments and had said before that they were not likely to sell the loans to a debt collector.

"Customers have overpaid on electricity for seven years because the regulator has made targets too easy for network operators, a watchdog has said. The National Audit Office (NAO) said regulator Ofgem allowed the companies which run the wires and pylons to make bigger profits than they needed to. This Â£800m of excess returns meant bills have been creeping up by Â£1.60 more than necessary per year. Ofgem said the excess could have hit Â£13 without action. Gillian Guy, from Citizens Advice, said the report was proof that ""energy networks have enjoyed a major windfall at the expense of consumers"". The privatised electricity supply business is divided into the supply companies - the ones customers deal with, which buy and sell the power - and companies which manage the delivery of electricity from power stations to our homes. These transmission and distribution companies, which include the National Grid, are in the private sector but there is an upper limit to the return they are allowed to make, set by Ofgem. Current rules, known as RIIO-1, give electricity networks an allowance to run and invest in their systems. If they spend less they can keep half of the savings and return half to customers. During the full eight years of RIIO-1, due to end in 2021, the distribution networks expect to underspend by 3% on average. One company, National Grid Energy Transmission, forecasts a 22% underspend. Only one business will overspend its allowance. Ovo Energy to pay Â£8.9m for overcharging customers Clean electricity overtaking fossil fuels in Britain The National Audit Office accuses Ofgem of being too fearful, when setting the controls, that the companies might fail and have to be rescued. As a result, the NAO said, energy network investors have seen returns of 9%, compared with between 5% and 6% at other UK companies. Ofgem has already indicated it will clamp down on generous investor returns as it plans for RIIO-2, the next round of price controls. ""Our tough new round of price controls will lower returns to save consumers money, whilst pushing companies to go further on decarbonisation and ensuring we retain one of the world's most reliable energy systems,"" said Akshay Kaul, Ofgem's director of network price controls. Gas and electricity networks have been heavily regulated since they started to be privatised in the late 1980s. The supply business has benefited from a huge proliferation in competition, but Ofgem has been unable to encourage the same explosion in networks because they are natural monopolies. Citizens Advice has campaigned for changes to network returns. Ms Guy said: ""Ofgem has made good progress towards a tougher settlement next time around.

The virus has caused at least 170 deaths,spreading to every Chinese regionand at least 15 other countries. The flight from Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged, had been expected to arrive on Thursday morning.

They will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"", a Downing Street spokesman said. A small team of military medics is flying out to Wuhan to accompany passengers on the repatriation flight, the Ministry of Defence said. World 'must be on alert' over China virus - WHO Britons warned against travel to mainland China Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Passengers catch last BA flights amid virus fears In a separate development, British Airways said it had extended its cancellation of services to mainland China until 29 February, following Foreign Office guidance against ""all but essential travel"" to the country. Britons waiting for the UK government's repatriation flight said they had been told it had been put back ""provisionally"" to Friday. Several UK citizens said they faced a stark choice as family members with Chinese citizenship were not being permitted to travel by local authorities. Matt Raw lives in Wuhan with his mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, and his wife, who helps care for her. He told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that his wife had been prevented from flying so the whole family was staying. Matt Raw has chosen to stay in Wuhan because his wife has been prevented from travelling He said they were also concerned about the risks of flying, having seen reports that three Japanese people on evacuation flights were found to have the virus. Adam Bridgeman said he would stay in Wuhan if his wife and one-month-old son were not allowed to fly with him. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that remaining in Wuhan with a newborn was ""a tough situation"" as they were ""not willing to take the risk"" of bringing him to hospital for routine treatment such as vaccinations. Jeff Siddle, from Northumberland, told the BBC his family faced a ""terrible dilemma"" after he and his nine-year-old daughter were told they could fly back - but not his Chinese wife, who has a permanent residency visa for the UK. This video can not be played Jeff Siddle's wife will have to stay behind in Wuhan when he leaves with their daughter As it stands, Mr Siddle's wife is not travelling back to the UK with him. ""I think there's still negotiations to get that changed, but the official line is still that she can't fly,"" he said. Chinese health authorities said there were 7,711 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country as of Wednesday night. The Foreign Office said a number of other countries' flights had also been unable to take off as planned. Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, with Japan, the US and the EU among those repatriating their citizens. Some 200 Japanese nationals have been flown from Wuhan and have landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Roughly 200 Americans - including workers from the local US consulate - have also left Wuhan on an evacuation flight. However, a number of UK citizens in China said local authorities had prevented members of their families from leaving because they held Chinese passports. Another UK citizen due to be flown out of Wuhan said she wastold to leave behind her three-year-old son because he has a Chinese passport. Natalie Francis works as a teacher in Wuhan Natalie Francis, originally from York, said: ""I literally had no words when I got the call."" The Foreign Office said its priority was to keep British nationals and their families together. The World Health Organization (WHO) will decide later whether the virus constitutes a global health emergency. It is a basic question, but the answer is elusive. It is far too simplistic to take the 170 deaths and the 7,711 cases and come up with a death rate of 2%. We are in the middle of the outbreak and thousands of those patients are still being treated. We don't know if they will live or die, so they can't be used in these calculations. We also don't know how many mild and undetected cases are out there. Also, the deadliness of the new virus is only one component of its threat. Flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year, not because it is super-deadly, but because it is able to infect so many people. Professor Sian Griffiths said the ""shared response across the world"" to the new coronavirus was more effective than during the 2003 SARS outbreak, which she examined in an official inquiry. She told BBC Breakfast that world governments were ""taking everything very seriously in an attempt to contain the virus"", deploying greater resources and offering clear public health messages.

"This video can not be played Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak has risen to 170, and a confirmed case in Tibet means it has reached every region in mainland China. Chinese health authorities said there were 7,711 confirmed cases in the country as of 29 January. Infections have also spread to at least 15 other countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) are again meeting in Geneva to consider whether the virus should be declared a global health emergency. Various countries have implemented evacuation and quarantine plans for nationals wanting to return from China, where the outbreak began in the city of Wuhan. Russia has decided to close its 4,300km (2,670-mile) far-eastern border with China in an attempt to stop contagion. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus named Germany, Vietnam and Japan, as places where people had caught the virus from others who had visited China. 'The silence is horrifying': A diary of life under lockdown What does coronavirus do to the body? Visual guide to the outbreak ""Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak,"" he said, adding that human-to-human transmission was a concern. More people have now been infected in China than during the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s, but the death toll remains far lower. Sars, also a coronavirus, caused acute respiratory illness. Researchers are racing to develop a vaccineto protect people from the virus. One lab in California has plans for a potential vaccine to enter human trials by June or July. Voluntary evacuations of hundreds of foreign nationals from Wuhan are under way to help people who want to leave the closed-off city and return to their countries. The UK, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are expected to quarantine all evacuees for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid any contagion. Britons in Wuhan to return home on Friday Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas Island, 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland in a detention centre that has been used to house asylum seekers. The Costa Smeralda cruise ship, carrying 6,000 people, is stuck at port near Rome Singapore is setting up a quarantine facility on Pulau Ubin, an island north-east of the city-state's mainland. In other developments: Chicago health officials have reportedthe first US case of human-to-human transmissionof the deadly coronavirus Six thousand people on board a cruise shipin Italy were barred from disembarking after a Chinese passenger was suspected of having coronavirus; however initial tests have come back as negative Flights to take British and South Korean citizens out of Wuhan have both been delayed after relevant permissions from the Chinese authorities did not come through Two flights to Japan have already landed in Tokyo. Three passengers have so far tested positive for the virus, Japanese media report Around 200 US citizens have been flown out of Wuhan and are being isolated at a military base in California for at least 72 hours Two aircraft are due to fly EU citizens home with 250 French nationals leaving on the first flight India has confirmed its first case of the virus - a student in the southern state of Kerala who was studying in Wuhan Japan's first flight with evacuees arrived on Wednesday Although questions have been raised about transparency, the WHO has praised China's handling of the outbreak. President Xi Jinping has vowed to defeat what he called a ""devil"" virus. The central province of Hubei, where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown. The province of 60 million people is home to Wuhan, the heart of the outbreak. The city has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus. The WHO warns the virus holds the potential for a much larger outbreak People who have been in Hubei are also being told by their employers to work from home until it is considered safe for them to return. The virus is affecting China's economy, the world's second-largest, with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country. How are coronavirus patients treated? How worried should we be? Several international airlines have stopped or scaled back their routes to China andcompanies like Google, Ikea, Starbucks and Tesla have closed their shops or stopped operations. There have been reports of food shortages in some places. State media says authorities are ""stepping up efforts to ensure continuous supply and stable prices"". The Chinese Football Association has announced the postponement of all games in the 2020 season. Although there have been nearly 8,000 infections, there has been little detailed information released on the profiles of patients and how the disease affects them. Most of the confirmed cases involve people either from Wuhan or who had close contact with someone who had been there. A new studypublished by The New England Journal of Medicine,externalon the coronavirus is based on data for the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan. It reveals: Of the 425, 55% diagnosed before 1 January were linked to the seafood and animal market believed to be at the centre of the outbreak, compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases The average age was 59 years and 56% were men Almost half the 425 cases were adults 60 years of age or older Human-to-human transmission among close contacts has occurred since the middle of December In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every seven days 89% of the patients were not hospitalised until at least day five of illness You asked, we answered How worried should we be?

"Mr Maloney and his two children, Freddie and Isabella, have stayed indoors the past week ""I think we made the right decision,"" said Daniel Maloney, who flew back with his two children on British Airways' final flight out of Beijing on Wednesday. Theairline has cancelledall direct flights to and from China until Friday because of the spread of the new strain of coronavirus. ""The village we are in is in lockdown,"" said Mr Maloney, who lives in northern Beijing where he teaches at an international school. ""All the roads in and out are barricaded off. You can't go outside. They have shut down the malls. ""We have been inside our apartment for a week. There's only so many jigsaws we can do."" Mr Maloney, 50, said he made the decision for the family to leave China and stay with his parents, in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, after he saw the statistics of the number of people infected ""stacking up"". ""I wanted to get the kids out,"" he said, speaking from the arrivals lounge in Heathrow Airport on Wednesday afternoon. ""I got the kids out this morning with a special driver. All the motorways were empty. [There were] about 20 people at the airport."" He had been stockpiling food for just under a week, and as he left he gave all his fresh supplies to neighbours. Asked whether he and others back in China are scared, he replied: ""I think now, yes."" For many Chinese people, ""Sars is still in their minds"", he adds. Public Health England has posted coronavirus information around the airport He said staff in Beijing carried out temperature checks before the flight and - like most of the passengers - the family wore masks, plus goggles for the children. But on the flight. he said he did not see any checks - although were told some were carried out before landing. ""We have just come from customs. They were joking, saying they have just been given some blue gloves,"" he added. The government says it hasa team of health experts in Heathrow,externalto support anyone travelling from China who feels unwell. Mr Maloney said he has already arranged for his children Isabella, 12, and Freddie, 9, to see a doctor later this week. Edinburgh University student James Marmol, 22, decided ""last-minute"" to cut short his year abroad in Beijing because of the virus. ""I wasn't actually returning from China until August,"" he said, also speaking at Heathrow. ""My main worry was I was going to get trapped and not be able to get out of China again, not necessarily as scared about the virus. ""Obviously my parents are, but I was not too afraid."" Britons on Wuhan flights to be quarantined A visual guide to the outbreak How are coronavirus patients treated? 'I've been told my wife must stay in Wuhan' But he said: ""Beijing is pretty scary at the moment. No cars on the street, very different to normal."" And the student accommodation where he lives has closed its doors, with staff taking temperature checks whenever people go in or out. ""It's a little bit scary but mostly because the closing down of things. It's very apparent the government is clamping down,"" he said. He said masks have sold out in China - ""I was hearing about people who are buying them from Japan in bulk"" - but he managed to get hold of one while abroad, which he has been wearing. Mr Hao said his parents are worried and want him to stay away from the virus Among the masked passengers walking into the arrivals lounge at Heathrow was Joel Hao, 21, a first year business student at Swansea University. Mr Hao, from the city of Tangshan, said he was in China celebrating Chinese New Year with his family, but changed his flight to come back early. ""I'm quite happy because I changed my flight, but for those who didn't it's too unfortunate,"" he said. Salesman Gil Qiao, 40, from Oxford, also changed his flight to come home nearly two weeks early, after the strict travel restrictions in China meant he could not do business - selling laboratory instruments. ""I will keep myself away from family for at least a week,"" said Mr Qiao.

""I don't remember I was given any information on the plane. Before landing I was told someone would check. We sat there for about five minutes where we were told to [stay seated]."" More than 130 people have died from coronavirus in China and close to 6,000 have been infected.

"This video can not be played Overcrowding on trains has been one of many issues facing Northern passengers Troubled rail company Northern is to be brought under government control. The decision, which will see the firm's franchise stripped from operator Arriva Rail North from 1 March, was taken following years of major disruption. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said passengers had ""lost trust in the north's rail network"". Arriva said it ""understood the government's decision"", but problems had been largely due to ""external factors"" such as rail infrastructure. Northern passengers have faced rail chaos ever since new timetables were introduced in May 2018, and punctuality and reliability problems have continued to blight the network. This video can not be played Passengers outside Leeds train station respond to finding out Northern being nationalised Mr Shapps said: ""People across the north deserve better, their communities deserve better and I am determined to achieve that."" The move means services will be operated by an arms-length government-owned company. 'Good riddance' to Northern rail What will happen to Northern rail tickets? German-based Arriva had been due to run Northern until March 2025. But Mr Shapps revealed in October he had requested a proposal from Northern to outline its plans to improve services,after ""unacceptable"" delays and cancellations. The Department for Transport then had to consider whether to hand a new, short-term contract to Arriva, or to nationalise services by putting the government-controlled Operator of Last Resort (OLR) in charge. Frustrated rail users let their feelings be known at Manchester Piccadilly in 2018 The company has faced a range of problems in recent years, includingwidespread cancellations and delaysfollowing the introduction of new timetables. It also faced challenges due to infrastructure projects,strike actionand an ageing fleet of trains. Its continued poor performance earned it the nickname 'Northern Fail' from frustrated passengers. Recent figures from Office of Rail and Road revealed how just56% of Northern trains arrived at stations within a minute of the stated time on the timetablein the 12 months to 7 December. That compares to an average across Britain of 65%. Northern said external factors had made the company's plan for the network ""undeliverable"". These included prolonged industrial action by the RMT, and delayed and cancelled infrastructure projects. More than half of delays on the entire UK rail network were down to problems with the infrastructure, like signalling. Government-owned firm Network Railwas put on a warning earlier this monthfor its poor service on routes in the North West and Midlands. This video can not be played Hayley Camfield says overcrowding causes major problems for disabled passengers Northern services will transfer from Arriva Rail North to Northern Trains Limited, a newly formed subsidiary of the Department for Transport's OLR. OLR is a public company, staffed by experienced train managers, which reports directly to the government. It already manages the London North Eastern Railway (LNER) franchise after rail services on the East Coast Main Line werebrought back under government control in May 2018. However, this was only supposed to last for two years. Sam Barnes said she was in support of the government takeover For many people who have faced repeated delays travelling on Northern trains, the news has been welcomed. ""Good riddance,"" said Sam Barnes, 56, from Todmorden, West Yorkshire. ""My brother-in-law is a train driver on London routes and when he finishes his shift it takes him ages to get home on Northern as they are always delayed."" Read more on how Northern passengers have reacted. Mr Shapps described the move as ""a new beginning for Northern"" but he sounded a note of caution for those expecting immediate dramatic improvements. ""Northern's network is huge and complex, some of the things which are wrong are not going to be quick or easy to put right,"" he said. The much-maligned Pacer trains must still be replaced and Mr Shapps said new technology would be rolled out to identify overcrowding issues. He also revealed plans to extend platforms at 30 stations on the Northern network to allow for longer trains. The new government-owned company will be asked to prepare a plan in the first 100 days ""to make sure we leave no stone unturned in improving this franchise for passengers"". This is an uncomfortable moment for the government. In the end, nationalising this vast commuter network was its only option. An agreement to change Arriva's contract and keep the firm on board wasn't possible because a commercially, and politically, palatable deal couldn't be found. What the government wants on Northern is a new performance-related train contract, like existing ones for Merseyrail and the London Overground, which put less risk on the train company. As one rail boss described it, this type of system will be very similar to a nationalised railway, but private companies will still have a role to play. Northern's failure is in large part down to ancient infrastructure which struggles to cope with the high volume of trains and passengers at peak times. Put simply, there is no silver bullet for improving our railways. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and his Liverpool City Region counterpart Steve Rotheram described the news as a ""victory"" for passengers. In a joint statement, they called on the government to ""commit to investing in much-needed rail infrastructure and work with leaders across the north to deliver the vision and funding needed to build the modern transport network that the people of our region deserve"". Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA transport union, welcomed the decision but said the government must understand ""franchising of our railways, while stuffing the mouths of shareholders with gold, has completely failed"". Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union ASLEF, also warned ""there won't be an immediate improvement"". ""[This is] because many of the systemic failures at Northern - the late delivery of new rolling stock, the cancellation by the Conservative government of infrastructure upgrades, trying to run a service with too few drivers - cannot be remedied overnight,"" he said. Northern passengers have faced two years of rail chaos ever since new timetables were introduced in May 2018 Chris Burchell, Arriva's UK managing director, said he recognised ""overall service improvements have not come quickly enough"". ""For that, we wholeheartedly apologise,"" he said. He also thanked staff for working ""tirelessly over the last four years"". ""I am confident that as a result of the determination and hard work of the Northern rail team, they have helped set strong foundations for future improvement on the network."" While the name of the operator will change on 1 March, branding on the trains will remain the same and staff will keep their jobs. Over the next few weeks, services will continue to run and customers should continue to buy tickets in the usual way, Northern Trains Limited said. Tickets purchased for journeys using multiple train companies will still be valid, a spokesperson added. Further announcements will be made when the transfer is complete on 1 March.

"Jo took out a number of loans with Wonga after losing her full-time job People who were mis-sold loans by the payday lender Wonga have been told that they will receive just 4.3% of the compensation they are owed. Administrators have begun informing around 400,000 claimants by letter, some of whom have reacted in dismay. Before its collapse, Wonga was vilified for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. One ex-customer told BBC News it was ""an insult"" to borrowers. ""Trust has really been damaged by this company, and the amount of compensation is an insult to the people that have been hurt by this,"" said Jo from Basingstoke. After Jo lost her full-time job and started in a role with fewer hours, she took out a series of loans with Wonga between 2010 and 2014 to make ends meet. ""My partner also lost his job, so things were really difficult,"" she says. ""We were stuck in a cycle where we were getting a payday loan out every month for between Â£50 and Â£100. It was really dangerous."" Wonga, which collapsed in 2018, was once the UK's biggest payday lender but its practices attracted intense scrutiny. Wonga's legacy of nearly 400,000 mis-sold loans Wonga collapses into administration In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found it had lent money to many who would never be able to repay, prompting a crackdown on the sector. Administrators have since received 380,000 eligible claims against the business worth Â£460m in total - an average of Â£1,200 a claim. Wonga was once the biggest payday lender in the UK But while claimants were warned they would get ""significantly less"" than full compensation, few expected to get so little. Jo says she was due a total of Â£208 in compensation, but was told she would only receive Â£8. ""It's more effort than it's worth to be honest. I've changed my bank account since, and sending them all the forms and details that I would have to would take ages. ""I'm also not sure if I can trust them with my details. People have been burnt,"" she says. Sara Williams, who runs Debt Camel, said former customers had been ""badly let down"" by regulators. ""Wonga ignored the regulator's rules about checking the affordability of loans and they were allowed to get away with this for 10 years. ""Now customers are being let down again because they are not getting the compensation they deserve from the regulator."" Hundreds of ex-customers have vented their anger on the Debt Camel site. One said: ""We have all been exploited, and we all know how much we have been exploited by. ""In my case Â£6,500, of which I'll receive less than Â£300."" Ms Williams said borrowers were not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which is overseen by the FCA, The scheme covers products such as payment protection insurance (PPI), fully reimbursing anyone who has been mis-sold to, but does not extend to payday loans. ""Borrowers from many payday lenders have been unable to get proper compensation after the lender has had to close,"" Ms Williams said. ""The FCA needs to rethink this and provide a safety net for people who were mis-sold unaffordable loans."" Wonga's administrators said claims should be paid within the next four weeks, later than the 20 January date initially promised. They also said loans being refunded would be removed from people's credit records within the next six weeks - likely to be a relief to many. Some people still owe money to Wonga but it is unclear what will happen to their balances. Ms Williams said administrators were no longer taking payments and had said before that they were not likely to sell the loans to a debt collector.

"Jo took out a number of loans with Wonga after losing her full-time job People who were mis-sold loans by the payday lender Wonga have been told that they will receive just 4.3% of the compensation they are owed. Administrators have begun informing around 400,000 claimants by letter, some of whom have reacted in dismay. Before its collapse, Wonga was vilified for its high-cost, short-term loans, seen as targeting the vulnerable. One ex-customer told BBC News it was ""an insult"" to borrowers. ""Trust has really been damaged by this company, and the amount of compensation is an insult to the people that have been hurt by this,"" said Jo from Basingstoke. After Jo lost her full-time job and started in a role with fewer hours, she took out a series of loans with Wonga between 2010 and 2014 to make ends meet. ""My partner also lost his job, so things were really difficult,"" she says. ""We were stuck in a cycle where we were getting a payday loan out every month for between Â£50 and Â£100. It was really dangerous."" Wonga, which collapsed in 2018, was once the UK's biggest payday lender but its practices attracted intense scrutiny. Wonga's legacy of nearly 400,000 mis-sold loans Wonga collapses into administration In 2014, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found it had lent money to many who would never be able to repay, prompting a crackdown on the sector. Administrators have since received 380,000 eligible claims against the business worth Â£460m in total - an average of Â£1,200 a claim. Wonga was once the biggest payday lender in the UK But while claimants were warned they would get ""significantly less"" than full compensation, few expected to get so little. Jo says she was due a total of Â£208 in compensation, but was told she would only receive Â£8. ""It's more effort than it's worth to be honest. I've changed my bank account since, and sending them all the forms and details that I would have to would take ages. ""I'm also not sure if I can trust them with my details. People have been burnt,"" she says. Sara Williams, who runs Debt Camel, said former customers had been ""badly let down"" by regulators. ""Wonga ignored the regulator's rules about checking the affordability of loans and they were allowed to get away with this for 10 years. ""Now customers are being let down again because they are not getting the compensation they deserve from the regulator."" Hundreds of ex-customers have vented their anger on the Debt Camel site. One said: ""We have all been exploited, and we all know how much we have been exploited by. ""In my case Â£6,500, of which I'll receive less than Â£300."" Ms Williams said borrowers were not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which is overseen by the FCA, The scheme covers products such as payment protection insurance (PPI), fully reimbursing anyone who has been mis-sold to, but does not extend to payday loans. ""Borrowers from many payday lenders have been unable to get proper compensation after the lender has had to close,"" Ms Williams said. ""The FCA needs to rethink this and provide a safety net for people who were mis-sold unaffordable loans."" Wonga's administrators said claims should be paid within the next four weeks, later than the 20 January date initially promised. They also said loans being refunded would be removed from people's credit records within the next six weeks - likely to be a relief to many. Some people still owe money to Wonga but it is unclear what will happen to their balances. Ms Williams said administrators were no longer taking payments and had said before that they were not likely to sell the loans to a debt collector.
