"A mocked up image of what the new flagship might look like has been released A new national flagship is to be commissioned by the government in a bid to boost British trade and industry globally, the prime minister has said. The vessel will be the successor to the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was retired in 1997. The government plans to build the ship in the UK, at a reported cost of Â£200m. Labour said the government must demonstrate clearly how the ship is expected to boost trade, jobs and growth. The name of the new flagship has yet to be announced, but the Daily Telegraph has suggested the ship will be named after the Duke of Edinburgh, who helped design Britannia. The new vessel would be used to promote British interests around the world - including hosting trade fairs and diplomatic meetings - as the UK seeks to build links and boost exports following Brexit. The tendering process for its design and construction will begin soon - with an emphasis on utilising British design expertise and the latest green technology. Downing Street said costs for the ""construction and operation"" of the ship would be confirmed after the tendering process concluded. Construction is set to start as early as next year, with the ship expected to enter service within the next four years. The vessel, which is set to be in service for about 30 years, will be part of the Royal Navy and crewed by it. After it was decommissioned in 1997, the Royal Yacht Britannia became a tourist attraction in Edinburgh The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh travelled aboard the the Royal Yacht Britannia many times, including during the monarch's Silver Jubilee tour in 1977 Prince Philip,who died on 9 April, aged 99, served in theRoyal Navy during World War Twoand was made Lord High Admiral by the Queen in 2011. How the navy shaped the Duke of Edinburgh's life Boris Johnson said the flagship would be ""the first vessel of its kind in the world"" and would reflect ""the UK's burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation"". ""Every aspect of the ship, from its build to the businesses it showcases on board, will represent and promote the best of British - a clear and powerful symbol of our commitment to be an active player on the world stage,"" he said. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said if the ship is going to be part of a genuine plan for Britain's future, the government ""must set out clearly how it will boost trade, jobs and growth in every corner of our country"". She said if the flagship is built, it should be made in the UK to support jobs in shipyards and there must be ""a real focus on value for money at every stage"". ""Right now our country faces huge challenges, and there's no sign the government has a plan for the recovery. We want to see public money used for targeted investment in a green economic recovery, resources for our NHS, and supporting families to succeed,"" she said. This video can not be played The launch of the Royal Yacht Britannia 65 years ago The Queen launched the Royal Yacht Britannia at the John Brown shipyard in Clydebank on 16 April 1953 in front of thousands of people. It travelled more than one million miles in its 44 years of service and, after it was decommissioned, became a tourist attraction in Ocean Terminal in Leith, Edinburgh. In November last year,it was announced the yacht would temporarily shutafter recording losses of Â£2.4m as coronavirus restrictions meant it cost more to open with limited visitor numbers than to be closed with staff furloughed. The floating visitor attraction, which had 390,000 visitors in 2019, has since reopened. How the navy shaped the duke's life MP: Time to commission new royal yacht Britannia.

"This video can not be played Nancy Kelley: ""Iâm comfortable with our direction as an organisation"" Stonewall head Nancy Kelley has defended the organisation's position amid a freedom of speech row and criticism from a founder. Matthew Parrissaid in the Times,externalthat Stonewall had become ""tangled up in the trans issue"" and ""cornered into an extremist stance"". But Ms Kelley told the BBC she was ""really comfortable""with the direction the charity was going in. She likened so-called ""gender critical"" beliefs to anti-Semitism. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has said its defence of the right to hold ""gender critical beliefs"" - that sex cannot be changed - ""does not have an impact on our commitment to uphold the rights of transgender people"". The new EHRC chair, Lady Falkner,has said women have the right to question transgender identity,externalwithout being abused, stigmatised or risking losing their job. Ms Kelley said while Stonewall believed in freedom of speech, it was ""not without limit"". ""With all beliefs including controversial beliefs there is a right to express those beliefs publicly and where they're harmful or damaging - whether it's anti-Semitic beliefs, gender critical beliefs, beliefs about disability - we have legal systems that are put in place for people who are harmed by that."" Challenged as to whether it might be considered offensive to compare anti-Semitic beliefs to gender-critical views, she insisted it was appropriate. ""We're talking about protected groups. We're talking about people that are protected on the basis of their sexuality, people that are protected on the basis of gender identity, people who are protected on the basis of race and that's why I think the analogy is apt."" Journalist and former Tory MP Matthew Parris, one of Stonewall's 14 founders, recently suggested the charity had ""lost its way"". In an article for the Times, he said: ""The organisation is tangled up in the trans issue, cornered into an extremist stance on a debate that a charity formed to help gay men, lesbian women and bisexual people should never have got itself into."" Ms Kelley said while Mr Parris was entitled to his views, being trans-inclusive was the ""absolute norm"" for LGBT organisations. She also denied Stonewall had approved incorrect advice on transgender issues for the University of Essex, which is part of its Diversity Champions workplace inclusion scheme. Arecent report,externalfound the university had unlawfully blacklisted a speaker after some protesters labelled her a ""transphobe"". Ms Kelley said Stonewall had ""nothing to do"" with the university's process for deciding external speakers and was ""really confident"" in its legal advice. Stonewall's been criticised for using the term ""gender identity"" when referring to the Equality Act's protected characteristic of ""gender reassignment"". But Ms Kelley described that as ""the difference between natural language and statutory language"". She also expressed frustration that the volume of media coverage and debate around trans rights meant ""it can be difficult to get across all the work we do... focusing on the experiences of LGB [lesbian, gay and bisexual] people."" She said the organisation's work could still benefit people, whether or not they agreed with its position, such as improving access to IVF. That aim is part ofthe organisation's new ""free to be"" strategy,external, which includes campaigning for ""hate crime and hate speech laws in the UK that protect LGBTQ+ communities"" and a pledge to champion inclusion across schools. Human rights body quits Stonewall diversity scheme Groups criticise conversion therapy 'Groundhog Day' Liz Truss is Equalities Minister as well as Secretary of State for International Trade The strategy also prioritises a ""legally enforceable ban on conversion therapy"". Ms Kelley said the consultation process, planned for September, was an ""unnecessary delay"" but promised to work closely with the government on the ban. Conversion therapyis defined by health groups, including NHS England, as attempts to change someone's sexuality or gender identity. It is understood part of the consultation will look at how to ensure certain medical or other accredited professionals will not be criminalised. Ms Kelley said a therapist, helping someone explore their gender identity or sexual orientation, wouldn't be caught by a ban, ""because that's not seeking to suppress or change something. That's exploring with you."" A government Equality Hub spokeswoman said: ""The consultation will seek further views from the public and key stakeholders to ensure that the ban can address the practice while protecting the medical profession; defending freedom of speech; and upholding religious freedom."" Ms Kelly has also called for an ""individual cabinet level post"" to focus on the equalities brief. Liz Truss holds the role as well as being international trade secretary.

"Signs were put in places including Pistyll in Gwynedd on Saturday saying ""no more second homes"" ""Absolutely crazy"" prices are forcing local people out of the housing market in parts of Wales, say campaigners. Nefyn Town Council chair Rhys Tudur said prices had ""gone through the roof"" with residents outbid on one property in Gwynedd that went for more than double its Â£120,000 asking price. Events were being held in Pistyll, Morfa Nefyn, Aberdaron and elsewhere on Saturday to highlight the issue. The first minister has pledged to help local people trying to buy homes. But Mark Drakeford warned there was no ""single bullet solution"" to stop local people being priced out of the market. About 50 people gathered in Pistyll - the first in a series of the events being held on Saturday - with signs put up saying ""no more second homes"". Mr Tudur toldBBC Radio Cymruthe village church was recently sold for Â£275,000 - ""far higher than the asking price"" of Â£120,000. ""The prices are absolutely crazy,"" he said. Second home debate: Call for action Gwynedd second homes 'crisis' prompts 20-mile march Homes in Wales bought before viewing in 'mad' housing market ""It's so sad that you can be raised in a community, to feel love towards that community, and then the door gets slammed shut in your face because the houses are too expensive for you to live there."" Mr Drakeford said the Welsh government was proposing solutions involving taxation and planning rules when asked about the issue while on a visit to north Wales. He said he hoped the plans would help young people currently unable to stay in their home towns because of property prices. ""It will be some measures to do with the way we tax property sales, there'll be measures to do with planning - rights local authorities will be able to use,"" he said. ""There will be things we can use to do with land transaction arrangements."" Rhys Tudur said it was ""devastating"" when people brought up in a community could not afford to live there themselves ""None of these by themselves are a single bullet solution but, if we bring together a range of measures we can use, then we can make a difference in those local housing markets,"" he added. Land transaction tax (LTT) is paid by people buying property in Wales and replaced stamp duty land tax. For sales completed up to 30 June people can buy a home worth up to Â£250,000 without paying it, after the Welsh government scrapped the bottom rate of 3.5% for property above Â£180,000. Any amount above a sale price of more than Â£250,000 attracts a 5% charge with higher rates for more expensive property. For sales completed from 1 July, buyers face 3.5% LTT on homes between Â£180,000 and Â£250,000 in addition. Some experts say this has added to the rush to buy in north Wales before those changes come in. Mr Drakeford said a scheme helping people buy new-build properties had helped. But he accepted buying older properties was becoming a major problem for many in north Wales. People took part in a socially distanced protest in Pistyll on Saturday TheLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid the plans were prompted by local people increasingly losing out on homes to people from cities in the Midlands and north-west of England. The Welsh government's Help to Buy scheme has aided local people in buying new-build properties up to Â£250,000, as long as they have a 5% deposit. The government then provides a shared equity loan of up to 20%, to help fund the purchase. That loan needs to be repaid within 25 years but can be paid back in full or in part at any point within that timescale. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We want everyone to have access to high-quality affordable homes, which is why we will build a further 20,000 low-carbon homes across Wales this term. ""A large number of second homes in a local community can have a real impact on that community. ""Wales is the only UK nation to give local authorities powers to charge higher levels of council tax on both long-term empty properties and second homes. ""The decision to apply and increase council tax premiums rests with local authorities. ""We've also increased the higher rate of Land Transaction Tax, which applies when people buy an additional property. ""We are looking at what further interventions are available and how our partners can use existing powers."" Are second home owners really pricing locals out?

"State media published photos of a ceremony for the children who allegedly volunteered North Korean state media has claimed that orphans are volunteering to work in state-run mines and farms. The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said hundreds of children ""with wisdom and courage in the prime of their youth"" have chosen to perform manual labour for the state. Their ages are unclear but photos suggest they are in their teens. Human rights groups have long accused North Korea of using forced child labour, something the state denies. In February, the BBC reported on allegations that generations ofSouth Korean prisoners of war are being used as slave labourin North Korean coal mines to generate money for the regime and its weapons programme. About 26 million people are thought to live in North Korea, which is ruled by a government with rigid control over all parts of people's lives. I've interviewed a number of North Korean defectors who claim to have been forced to work in the country's coal mines. The conditions they described were horrendous. They recalled regular fatal accidents and long hours of hard work with little food. Few would choose this work and I am sure many human rights organisations will look at these state media reports and pictures with real concern. There is also a wider question to be answered - why is North Korea searching for free labour for its mines, farms and factories? These are desperate times after Kim Jong Un took drastic measures and completely sealed the border last January to stop Covid19 spreading from neighbouring China. There are reports that some essential supplies are finally making it into the country but certainly not enough to get the economy moving again. The only way to do that is to step up production and for that the regime needs new sources of free labour. Praising the ""wisdom and courage"" of  these young ""volunteers"" also turns them into communist party role models. They are being idolised for their self-sacrifice. It also comes as Kim Jong Un is trying to crack down on any dissent from the country's youth. He described outside media such as K-pop, foreign news and drama as ""dangerous poisons"". When times get tough, he doesn't want his people knowing how good others may have it - especially if he's sending his young people into coal mines. In April, leaderKim Jong-un warned his country to prepare for tough times aheadin a rare admission of problems. North Korea shut its borders in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, shutting off trade with China - its economic lifeline. The South Koreans enslaved in the North's mines North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Koreaâs âonly openly gay defectorâ finds love Several reports in state media over the last week say so-called volunteers are taking up manual labour across the country. On Saturday, a KCNA report said 700 orphans had volunteered to work at factories, farms and forests. And on Thursday, KCNA reported that ""dozens of orphan children rushed out to the Chonnae Area Coal-mining Complex to fulfil their oath to repay even just a millionth of the love the party showed"".

It also said children as young as 16 or 17 ""were enrolled in military-style youth construction brigades for 10-year periods"", and suffered from ""physical and psychological injuries, malnutrition, exhaustion, and growth deficiencies as a result of required forced labour"".

"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds in the garden of 10 Downing Street after their wedding Prime Minister Boris Johnson has married his fiancee Carrie Symonds in a secretly-planned wedding at Westminster Cathedral. The marriage took place in a ""small ceremony"" on Saturday afternoon, a Downing Street spokesman said. The spokesman added that the couple would celebrate again with family and friends next summer, with their honeymoon also delayed until then. The prime minister has already returned to work. He is the first PM to get married while in office in nearly 200 years. The Mail on Sunday reported,externalthat 30 guests were invited to the ceremony at short notice - the maximum number of attendees allowed under Covid restrictions in England. A small number of church officials were involved in preparations for the Catholic ceremony, which was officiated by Father Daniel Humphreys, it said. Although Mr Johnson, 56, has been married twice before, the Roman Catholic Church can allow divorcees to remarry if the previous marriages were outside the Roman Catholic Church. Boris Johnson likes to avoid talking about his private life - he's declined to answer questions on the topic for the past few years. It can't have been easy to keep yesterday's wedding - between a former journalist and someone who works in public relations - under wraps. But it seems to have taken almost everyone in Westminster by surprise.

""And I think that's where the Church, I think, can look at its current rules and see how it can become more welcoming. It has been welcoming to Boris Johnson, why not to others?"" Who is Carrie Symonds? Father Mark Drew, assistant priest at St Joseph's Church in Penketh, Warrington, said he has previously had to tell Catholic couples going through a divorce they are not able to remarry in the Church. ""It looks to them - rightly or wrongly - as if the Church is applying double standards and I do fear that this decision does make the Church look bad."" Just one official photograph has been released - the day after the wedding - showing the couple in the garden at 10 Downing Street in the hours following the ceremony.

"Mr Biden will need Congress to pass his plan before it becomes law US President Joe Biden has released his first annual budget - a $6tn (Â£4.2tn) spending plan that includes steep tax increases for wealthier Americans. The bumper proposal would include huge new social programmes and investment in the fight against climate change. But it needs approval from Congress, where Republican Senator Lindsey Graham condemned it as ""insanely expensive"". Under the plan, debt would reach 117% of GDP by 2031, surpassing levels during World War Two. That would be in spite of at least $3tn in proposed tax increases on corporations, capital gains and the top income tax bracket. Former President Donald Trump, a Republican, also ran up the deficit each year he was in office, and his final annual spending proposal had a price tag of $4.8tn. The Biden budget includes a $1.5tn request for operating expenditures for the Pentagon and other government departments. It also incorporates two plans he has previously publicised: his $2.3tn jobs plan and a $1.8tn families plan. Mr Biden, a Democrat, said his budget ""invests directly in the American people and will strengthen our nation's economy and improve our long-run fiscal health"". Biden unveils 'once in a generation' spending plan What's in Biden's $1.9tn Covid stimulus plan? US Congress reaches deal to avert budget showdown The White House says the proposal will help grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out. This budget promises: More than $800bn for the fight against climate change, including investments in clean energy $200bn to provide free pre-school places for all three and four-year-olds $109bn for two years of free community college for all Americans $225bn for a national paid family and medical leave programme - bringing the US in line with comparable wealthy nations $115bn for roads and bridges and $160bn for public transit and railways $100bn to improve access to broadband internet for every American household The budget also has a noticeable absence: the Hyde Amendment, a federal provision that says taxpayer money cannot fund abortions in US states except in cases of rape and incest. Mr Biden is the first president in decades to exclude the abortion coverage ban, a move that has already been applauded by progressives. He supported the amendment for years before changing course during last year's presidential campaign. But the president's plan faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where several centrist members of his own party could side with Republicans in supporting the Hyde Amendment. Top White House economic adviser Cecelia Rouse acknowledged the economy was now seeing inflation spikes, but projected it would settle down to an annual rate of around 2% over time. Some economists, including Larry Summers, who advised Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, have warned such massive government spending could drive up inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which would in turn raise the risk of a recession. The Biden budget projects an additional $14.5tn would be added to US debt over the next decade. But the White House estimates the plan would be completely paid for within 15 years as tax increases eat away at the deficit. Critics, however, are sceptical about projected happy endings long after Mr Biden leaves office. Republicans have expressed alarm at the record spending. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell on Friday called the plan a ""socialist daydream"". Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas said it would ""saddle future generations with burdensome levels of debt"". The era of big government is back - that is, if Joe Biden has his way. Back in 1996, Bill Clinton famously said that big government was a thing of the past, as the Democratic president acquiesced to Republican efforts in Congress to slash welfare benefits and other federal funding. In the two decades since, following the September 11 attacks, the Great Recession and a global pandemic, American support for government activism has returned - and Biden, long considered a political centrist, is proposing a budget that reflects that. There are no massive new government proposals in Biden's budget - no publicly run health insurance or free college for all - but his administration incorporates the president's current legislative agenda and boosts spending for numerous social programmes, with a focus on health and education. The Biden plan anticipates massive deficits - over $1tn annually - which will prompt condemnation from fiscal hawks on the left and right. And Republicans will pick apart specific spending items. Presidential budgets are blueprints, however, and seldom resemble what Congress ultimately approves. What Biden's proposal says is that he wants to keep the government spending spigots wide open - and that he thinks the American people will have his back. Congress has until the end of September to enact new spending bills. If they fail to pass a new budget, the government could partially shut down. Mr Biden's Democrats have a narrow majority in the House, and a meagre one-seat advantage over Republicans in the 100-seat Senate. Unlike most other bills, budget measures can be passed with just 51 votes instead of the 60 typically required meaning he might be able to sign some of his plans into law without Republican support. Republicans have already criticised Mr Biden for the size of his spending - including the $1.9tn spent on coronavirus relief earlier this year. This video can not be played Has Biden unified the country? Watch as Americans weigh in. And ensuring all Democrats are on board won't be easy either.

"More than half of those in their 30s in the UK have received a first vaccine dose in the past two weeks It comes as the Duchess of Cambridge, 39, receives her first Covid-19 vaccine dose Covid expert Sir Tim Gowers says things could turn bad ""very, very quickly"" after 21 June if limits are lifted prematurely The World Health Organization (WHO) says the search for the original source of the virus had been ""poisoned by politics"" India reports its lowest single-day rise of coronavirus cases in 45 days, with a further 173,790 cases reported on Saturday The remainder of the Indian Premier League cricket season will resume in the UAE in September, having been suspended when players tested positive for coronavirus Restrictions in the capital Delhi are to ease from Monday as cases reduce A further 3,398 coronavirus cases are recorded in the UK and seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Lauren Turner Thank you for joining us today. We are now ending our coronavirus live page coverage. Today's live page was written by George Bowden, Emma Harrison and Joshua Nevett. It was edited by Julian Joyce and Lauren Turner. Here's a round-up of today's coronavirus headlines: Thousands of fans are converging on the Portuguese city of Porto, for this evening's all-English Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester City at 20:00 BST. A total of 6,000 supporters from each side have been allocated tickets, but our sports correspondent in Porto, Olly Foster, says considerably more have made the journey. Portugal is on England's travel ""green list"" meaning no quarantine is required on return, though three private Covid tests are still needed. But some Porto residents fear a spike in infections because of the highly contagious virus variant spreading in parts of England, after first being identified in India. After a substantial decline since the start of the year, the average number of daily cases is now slowly rising. A further 3,398 confirmed cases in the UK were announced by the government on Saturday. Several areas are experiencing a rise in cases linked to the variant first detected in India, also known as B.1.617.2. But the number of deaths reported daily remains low and nearly 25 million people have now received both jabs. This video can not be played Footage shows flight attendant being attacked by passenger in the US A dispute over Southwest Airlines' mask policy led to a passenger punching a flight attendant, as shown in the video above. Incidents like these have been on the rise in the US, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The UK's latest vaccine figures show 74.2% of adults have been vaccinated once for Covid-19, while 47.3% have had both jabs. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweets: ""Thank you to everyone working incredibly hard in our vaccine rollout. ""When you get the call, get the jab."" France is holding its first concert in the country in a little over a year - since the start of the pandemic - Reuters news agency is reporting. The show, which features French rock band Indochine, will also help determine whether there's an increased risk of contracting coronavirus and will test health measures. ""It's a bit like the return to normal life. We're a bit less depressed because of this,"" concert-goer Sandra Terrin tells Reuters. A total of 5,000 people, who volunteered for the experiment and tested negative for coronavirus, will attend. They have to wear a face mask during the show and will remain standing, while a camera will monitor whether people remove their masks or wear it improperly. They will have to take a test seven days after the event. There will be a control group of 2,500 people who will also take tests. The playwright Shakespeare has been confused on TV in Argentina with the first man to receive the Pfizer Covid vaccine, who shares his name. William Shakespeare, 81, got the jab in December, but died of an unrelated illness this week. ""One of the most important writers in the English language"" has died, said the presenter - but 405 years late. Read more on this story here. Another 197,146 first doses of the vaccine were administered on Friday and 414,364 second doses, according to the latest figures. In total almost 25 million people have now had two jabs. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says it was ""another big day"" and urges people to get the jab when called. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More research needs to be done into effective clear masks to help deaf people communicate during Covid, a campaigner says. Melissa Julings, 35, from Norwich, says the wearing of face coverings has left deaf people feeling ""isolated"" and ""lost"" throughout the past year. The government is due to review face coverings before 21 June, but Ms Julings says more work is needed to find better clear masks. The Department of Health and Social Care says: ""Transparent face coverings may be worn by those who communicate through lip-reading or facial expressions. ""However, their effectiveness is not supported by evidence so the government does not recommend their use by the wider public at this time.""

As we reported earlier, the centre at the New Victoria Hospital minor injuries unit car park is aimed at those in the city aged over 40 yet to have a first vaccine dose or who have waited over 10 weeks for a second dose of AstraZeneca.

Lauren Mannell, 21, from Barrow in Suffolk, had baby Ollie Codd by emergency Caesarean at West Suffolk Hospital. But Ollie did not breathe for an estimated six minutes after the birth and was rushed to intensive care at Addenbroke's in Cambridge. Ms Mannell then subsequently tested positive for coronavirus, meaning she could not be with him for nine days while she self-isolated elsewhere. Sharing an update, she said Ollie was now ""always laughing and smiling, he's just a happy, content boy"". ""We're going to keep an eye on him, but at his first check-up at the West Suffolk Hospital, they said if they hadn't read his notes they would have had no idea he was as sick as he was,"" she added.

Earlier this month, it was the turn of her husband, the Duke of Cambridge, who also received a first jab at London's Science Museum - a short drive from the couple's home at Kensington Palace. Her father-in-law, the Prince of Wales, and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, received their coronavirus jabs in February. The Queen received hers in January. Read morehere. As we've been hearing today, concern remains over a variant first discovered in India that is thought to be more transmissible. What do we know about this variant? This version - or mutation - of the Covid virus was first spotted in India last October and has since spread to a number of countries. Viruses mutate all the time. Most variants are insignificant, but some can make a virus more contagious. In the UK it's thought the Indian variant - or rather a particular type of it known as B.1.617.2 - could be spreading more quickly than the Kent variant, which was responsible for the surge in cases over the winter. There have been almost 8,000 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in England, just over 1,000 in Scotland, 82 in Wales and 19 in Northern Ireland. In some areas of England - including in Bolton, Blackburn, and Sefton in north-west England and Bedford, Chelmsford and Canterbury in the South East - it is causing the majority of infections. In London it makes up the lion's share of cases in Croydon, Hounslow and Hillingdon. A surge in Glasgow may also be driven by the variant. Read more about the variant in our explainer here. Mary McCoolBBC Scotland While most of the UK is opening up, Glasgow is nearing nine months with some of the strictest Covid restrictions in the country. People are forbidden from mixing in each other's homes, pubs are closed for indoor drinking and no-one is allowed to visit or leave the city without good reason. Rising case rates driven by the Indian variant have seen restrictions remain in Glasgow, while rules ease across the rest of Scotland. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds reportedly oversaw the flat refurbishment Boris Johnson acted ""unwisely"" by not being more ""rigorous"" in finding out who had funded refurbishment work on the Downing Street flat, a report says. Lord Geidt, the PM's adviser on standards, said a Tory donor had paid an invoice for some of the costs. But he cleared Mr Johnson - who was seemingly unaware of the arrangement - of breaking ministerial conduct rules. The works on the flat, overseen by the PM's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds, are thought to have cost around Â£90,000. The report did not say how much former Conservative vice-chairman Lord Brownlow had put up to fund the refurbishment, but a figure of Â£58,000 has been widely reported. What is the row over Boris Johnson's flat about? Johnson appoints new standards adviser What investigations is the government facing? Downing Street confirmed the prime minister had funded the ""wider refurbishment"", suggesting Lord Brownlow had been repaid. But Labour said it was ""staggering"" that Mr Johnson could ""rack up"" a bill ""yet have no knowledge of how it was eventually paid"". Separately, the Electoral Commission iscarrying out an investigationinto whether the Conservative Party broke the law on political donations regarding the funding of the flat. And Health SecretaryMatt Hancock has been found guiltyof a ""minor breach"" of the ministerial code, which sets the rules for behaviour in public office, over shares in an NHS supplier. Prime ministers receive an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on their Downing Street living quarters, which are publicly-owned. Mr Johnson has faced repeated questions over how refurbishments to the flat above 11 Downing Street, where he lives with Ms Symonds, were financed. The renovation work began in spring last year when Mr Johnson was in hospital with Covid. The prime minister has previously said he paid the difference between the taxpayer-funded contribution and the full costs. But he did not specify whether this involved paying the bills up-front or repaying money loaned to him or the government for the project. In his report, Lord Geidt found ""no evidence"" that Lord Brownlow had told Mr Johnson ""he had personally settled"" costs. And, when Lord Brownlow informed government officials about the money, they had not ""acted on this information to the extent of informing the prime minister"", it said. But Lord Geidt - who was appointed by Mr Johnson last month as standards adviser following the resignation of Sir Alex Allen - did criticise the prime minister's conduct. He had, said the peer, ""unwisely... allowed the refurbishment of the apartment... to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded"". Lord Geidt also said that ""in the middle of a pandemic"", Mr Johnson ""simply accepted"" that a trust he was hoping to set up to handle the Downing Street work ""would be capable of satisfactorily resolving the situation without further interrogation"". Although this report clears Boris Johnson of breaking the ministerial code, parts of it will be awkward reading in Downing Street. Lord Geidt questions why Boris Johnson didn't pay more attention to who was paying for the work in his flat. Why wasn't the prime minister more curious, he wonders? It is also critical of officials - saying the prime minister was ""ill-served"" by those around him when it came to this project. But, crucially, there is no sense from this report that the arrangement led to a conflict of interest. Downing Street is also keen to point out the costs - beyond an annual allowance - have not been met by the taxpayer. But Lord Geidt concluded that ""no conflict (or reasonably perceived conflict) arises"" from the involvement of Lord Brownlow or the Conservative Party in the refurbishment. He said of Lord Brownlow that ""there is no evidence that he acted with anything other than altruistic and philanthropic motives"". Speaking in Swindon, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said no public money was used in an improper way. He said because the arrangement involved private money, the ""facts speak for themselves in favour of"" the prime minister. And responding to the report, Downing Street said it showed the prime minister had ""acted in accordance with the ministerial code at all times"". Lord Geidt was appointed last month as the PM's standards adviser A spokesperson added: ""Cabinet Office officials were engaged and informed throughout and official advice was followed. ""Other than works funded through the annual allowance, the costs of the wider refurbishment of the flat are not being financed by taxpayers and have been settled by the prime minister personally."" If a politician or party accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public. The Electoral Commission is investigating whether this rule was followed by the Conservative Party in relation to the Downing Street refurbishment. If the commission finds it was not, it has the power to issue a fine of up to Â£20,000. Meanwhile, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, the UK's top civil servant, is also looking into the refurbishment, including whether donations were properly declared.

"Saskia Jones, 23, and Jack Merritt, 25, were killed by Usman Khan at a conference on offender rehabilitation Failings by the police, probation service and MI5 contributed to the deaths of two graduates killed by a convicted terrorist, a jury has found. University of Cambridge alumni Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were stabbed by Usman Khan at a rehabilitation event at Fishmongers' Hall on 29 November 2019. Khan, 28, had been released from prison 11 months previously, the inquests at London's Guildhall heard. The jury concluded that both victims were unlawfully killed. Khan, who had spent eight years in jail for planning to set up a terrorist training camp in Pakistan, was chased on to London Bridge by people at the event who were armed with a fire extinguisher and a narwhal tusk plucked from a wall. The terrorist, who wounded three others in the attack, was shot dead on the bridge by police. Could Fishmongers' Hall attacker have been stopped? 'They clearly touched the lives of so many' Jurors found there had been unacceptable management and a lack of accountability in the oversight of Khan, who had been allowed to travel on his own to London from his hometown of Stafford. They concluded there had been failures in the sharing of information between state agencies responsible for monitoring him. Deficiencies in the organisation of the event at Fishmongers' Hall, including inadequate security measures, were also found to have been a factor in the deaths. One man pursued Khan on to London Bridge armed with a narwhal tusk he had removed from a wall at Fishmongers' Hall After the conclusions were delivered, the jury forewoman said the jurors wanted to send ""heartfelt condolences to the families of Saskia and Jack"" who ""clearly touched the lives of so many, ours included"". ""We are so incredibly sorry. The world lost two bright stars that dreadful day,"" she said. The forewoman added the jury wanted to ""thank the astonishing individuals who put themselves in real danger to help and our incredible emergency services for their response, both that day and every day"". This video can not be played Jack Merritt was killed by Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist still considered dangerous by MI5 At the conclusion of the inquests, Ms Jones's family, from Stratford-upon-Avon, said there were still ""unanswered questions relating to failures of a number of organisations and individuals"". ""It is beyond understanding and astonishing that not one of the state agencies sufficiently considered the associated risk and therefore questioned the wisdom of sending Usman Khan unaccompanied to London,"" the family said in a statement. The Guildhall heard Khan had been wearing a fake suicide vest They also criticised Learning Together, which ran the prisoner rehabilitation programme, and the Fishmongers' Company over failures to keep those at the event safe. Mr Merritt's father David, from Cottenham in Cambridgeshire, said it was ""clear... that the arrangements put in place for managing Usman Khan after his release from prison in 2019 were not fit for purpose, despite the authorities having had six years to plan for this"". ""We hope that all other agencies and organisations involved with Khan will learn the lessons highlighted by the inquest and will make changes to their systems and working practices,"" he added. Fishmongers' Hall, beside London Bridge, was the venue for the event where Khan struck By Dominic Casciani, home and legal correspondent These verdicts are so clear and damning that they have far wider implications than this terrible tragedy. They raise questions about the competence and ability of state agencies to properly manage the risk of men as dangerous as Usman Khan. If they wanted to, the families could now try to sue the agencies involved for a finding they breached their duty to take reasonable steps to protect life. The mistakes and omissions were clear to the jury - from the inexperience of the officers managing Khan in the community, through to a dreadful muddle over who should have passed them critical MI5 intelligence. All of it, in the jury's view, was ""unacceptable"". There are questions too for Cambridge University, where the chiefs of a rehabilitation scheme believed Khan was such a success he could come to their reunion in London, despite the city being such an obvious target for a convicted, deviant and unrepentant terrorist. Read more from Dominichere. A Court of Appeal ruling meant Khan had to be automatically released on licence from prison, with the Parole Board having no say as to whether he was safe to be freed. Throughout his time in jail, he was classed among the 70 highest-risk inmates in the country, was frequently involved in violence and radicalisation and spent a significant period under investigation by MI5. Upon his release, Khan was assessed as being more dangerous than when he went into prison, and there was seen to be an imminent risk of him causing serious harm to the public. While he was still an inmate, the security services launched a new covert investigation, which became a priority inquiry after intelligence was received that Khan would carry out an attack once he was freed. But the intelligence was never shared with Khan's probation officer nor the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) panel that managed him in the community. MAPPA did not even know that Khan was being investigated by MI5 - one of whose officers often secretly attended the panel's meetings. This video can not be played Saskia Jones' uncle says the conclusion of  the inquest ""does not in any way ease the pain"" While in HMP Whitemoor, Khan was allowed to attend a prisoner education project run by Cambridge University called Learning Together. After his release, he remained in touch with Learning Together staff, even appearing as a case study of successful change in a project video and publication. He was consequently invited to the anniversary celebration at Fishmongers' Hall. Police, MI5 and probation services all knew that Khan was going to attend the event, which was his first unescorted trip out of Staffordshire after leaving prison. But the inquests heard none of them considered the potential risks nor took any steps to guard against them. In the days before the event, Khan bought knives and items for a fake suicide vest. He made his way to London having had his licence conditions relaxed to allow unaccompanied travel by train. Usman Khan, seen here in a video recorded for Learning Together, took his first post-release unescorted trip out of Staffordshire on the day of the killings Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the national lead for Counter Terrorism Policing, said the way offenders were managed in the community had been improved but he was ""so deeply sorry we weren't better than this in November 2019"". He added: ""The jury has today concluded that Jack and Saskia were unlawfully killed. ""This reflects the fact that whilst we, along with our partners, will constantly strive to improve, the ultimate responsibility for this barbaric act lies with the attacker."" Home Secretary Priti Patel said it was ""important that the government and operational partners learn lessons to prevent further incidents like this"" and she would ""consider the inquest findings"". In a statement, the co-founders of Learning Together -a University of Cambridge programme- said they were ""determined to reflect on the lessons of these inquests as we move forwards"". The university also said it would consider the ""lessons to be learned"". MI5 did not see terror attacker as threat Police 'daunted' by taking on terror offenders Terrorist posed 'high risk' after jail release Terror attacker shouted 'I'm going to blow you up' Hall porter 'stabbed terror attacker with spear' Terror witness thought killer was 'play-fighting' Office manager begged terrorist not to stab her 'I quickly realised something bad had happened' Terror attack victim's life 'was a triumph' Killer called education project a 'kind of family' Police should have raised risk posed by terrorist London Bridge attacker known as high-risk inmate HM Courts & Tribunals Service Mystery surrounds East End assembly member's sudden suspension from Labour Lambeth heroes stepping up for 2025 Civic Awards You can now use your phone on this tube line on the London Underground Ten reasons to embrace winter walks in London this January from Britainâs walking charity, The Ramblers Coroner warning after deaths from 'designer drug' mixed with heroin Strike tutors tell Starmer: Sort it out!
