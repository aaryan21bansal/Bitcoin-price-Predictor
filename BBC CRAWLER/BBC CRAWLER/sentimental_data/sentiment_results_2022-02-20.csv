Edwards, who has died at the age of 31, is the son of singer and presenter Brenda Edwards, who said she was ""completely devastated"". The Prince of Walespaid tribute,externalto his work for The Prince's Trust. Davesimply wrote,external: ""Thank you for everything. Words can't explain"" whileTracey said,externalhe was a ""legend"". Prince Charles was among the figures paying tribute to Jamal Edwards Edwards was the founder of SBTV, an online grime and rap music platform which helped launch the careers of artists like Dave, Ed Sheeran and Skepta. He first got into film-making after his parents gave him a video camera as a Christmas present when he was 15. Born in Luton and later moving to west London, he was appointed an MBE for services to music in 2014. A pioneering figure in British rap and grime music, Edwards attended the Brit Awards earlier this month, and was understood to have performed as a DJ at a gig in north London on Saturday night. His company confirmed his death to the BBC on Sunday, saying he died that morning. His mother said he ""passed away after a sudden illness"". Allow Twitter content?

The Prince's Trustdescribed him in a tweet as,external""an incredible innovator and entrepreneur."" Actor Idris Elbatweeted,externalthat Edwards would ""be missed"", while businessman Sir Richard Branson, who wrote the forward for Edwards' 2013 book, Self Belief: The Vision,tweeted,externalthat the star was ""a truly extraordinary young man who made a huge difference to so many people's lives"". 'Every young guy wanted to do what Jamal was doing' I May Destroy You starMichaela Coel said,external: ""May his passion, joy and relentless desire to platform British artists be an inspiration."" Former prime minister David Cameron, who is chair of the National Citizen Service's Board of Patrons,paid tribute,externalto Edwards for ""supporting and inspiring young people to be the best they could be, leading from the front and showing what's possible with hard work and determination"". London Mayor Sadiq Khantweeted,externalthat British music and entertainment ""has lost one of its brightest stars"", while Chelsea Football Clubadded,externalthat Edwards - a Chelsea fan - was ""an inspiration to many, we're honoured that he was part of our Chelsea family"". In 2019, he directed theChelsea FC remix video,externalof grime artist Capo Lee's Style and Swag, and the video featured several of the team's players. It's impossible to overstate how important Jamal Edwards was to British rap. His YouTube channel, which was started ""on a Â£20 phone"" while he was still at school, has given early exposure to almost every key player in the game. Stormzy, Skepta, JME, J Hus, Lady Leshurr, Dave, AJ Tracey, Krept & Konan, Headie Oneâ¦ the list is endless. To an extent, SBTV was formed out of frustration. ""Everyone in my area was an MC and I remember thinking, 'Why can't I find these online? I'm going to film people in my area and upload it to Youtube',""Edwards told BBC Radio 1Xtra in 2017,external. ""And from there it just started building and growing."" SBTV arrived at a crucial time, showing that grime could thrive online, while police were attempting to shut down gigs with the controversial risk-assessment form 696. The channel's success meant Edwards became known as an entrepreneur and businessman - but he was a reluctant frontman. ""I wanted to be the Banksy,"" he said. ""I wanted no-one to know who I was."" That changed in 2011, when he featured in an advert for Google Chrome. His name was searched more than a million times. and people started approaching him for selfies. But he put his fame to good use - raising awareness of mental health, funding youth centres and encouraging other young entrepreneurs. Music remained his true passion, though, and he never stopped supporting the artists he loved. As recently as December, he encouraged Ed Sheeran to record a new verse for a song he'd discovered by Nigerian artist Fireboy DML. That track,Peru,external, climbed to number two in the UK charts, giving the African star his first international hit. Edwards took no credit - he never did - but hundreds of artists have similar stories. His loss will be felt throughout the UK music scene. BBC 1Xtra DJ and presenter Nadia Jae told Newsbeat that Edwards ""helped me with my career"", adding: ""He's helped so many people, put them in places that they never would have been and did a lot of the pushing of doors to make sure that our industry is as fruitful as it is now."" She added: ""He had a heart of gold, I don't know anyone who has a bad word to say about Jamal. ""He broke so many barriers, I don't know if we're ever going to get another Jamal."" Presenter and comedian Mo Gilligan, who hosted this year's Brit awards,tweeted,external: ""A truly humble and blessed soul. Your legacy will live on for years and you've inspired a whole generation."" Rapper Lady Leshurrsaid,external: ""He gave me opportunity after opportunity to showcase my talent from Brum into London. We need to keep his name and brand alive."" Singer Jessie J, whose early appearances on SBTV helped get her noticed, said her ""heart is broken"".

""He will be remembered in every conversation when it comes to pioneers. This will be the person that put me on or gave me my first opportunity."" At a vigil in west London, fans and friends also paid tribute. ""He was the hero of Acton. He was the guy who showed you could make it out without being a drug dealer, without getting involved in crime or anything,"" Zachary Thomas told the BBC. Dominic Magliore said: ""It's hard to accept it. I heard about it yesterday and I saw him on Friday, we was hugging, laughing and having a good time & everything seemed ok."" Sam Borelli said: ""Jamal was the guy that showed kids from low-income households that you are not limited to what your grades might tell you. He made the musicians that made me, if you know what I mean, with a camera he got for Christmas.""

Helped me sometimes without even speaking of it."" In a 2013 interview with the BBC, Edwards said he filmed friends rapping or singing and began to upload the videos to YouTube to allow other friends to see them. ""You can say my videos had mixed reviews to begin with, some people didn't get them, but others thought they were sick [good],"" he said. ""So I started to put them up on YouTube so everyone could see them, and it just grew from there.""

"The River Wharfe in Otley, West Yorkshire, after bursting its banks Storm Franklin has hammered parts of the UK with strong winds and heavy rain. There issevere flooding in parts of Northern Irelandand flood warnings remain in place across England, Scotland and Wales. ""Severe disruption"" means Network Rail is advising customers to check before they travel on the railways. Franklin comes days afterStorm Eunicekilled three people and left 1.4 million homes without power. The highest wind gust speeds on Monday morningreached,external79mph in Capel Curig in Wales, and 78mph in Orlock Head, Northern Ireland. On Sunday night, 87mph was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight. TheMet Office issued two weather warnings,externalfor earlier on Monday: an amber warning for wind in Northern Ireland, and a milder yellow warning for wind covering Wales, Northern Ireland, most of England and parts of south-west Scotland. Storm Franklin is the third named storm in a week - following Dudley and Eunice - the first time this has happened since the storm-naming system was introduced in 2015. This video can not be played Windy conditions at Birmingham Airport On Monday evening,UK Power Networks said,externalit had restored electricity to 98% of properties across east and south-east England but 8,500 remained without power. Energy minister Greg Hands said power outages were a ""horrible thing"" to happen to households and lessons would be learned for the energy network. He said: ""Quite often very significant lessons do get learned - the 105 emergency number for power outages was a lesson learned from a previous storm."" Manchester Airport diverted nine flights on Monday morning because of storm winds.

Elsewhere, the O2 arena in London willremain closeduntil Friday, when a UB40 concert is expected to go ahead as planned, after Storm Eunice shredded sections of the roof. George Goodfellow, from BBC weather, says the forecast for the rest of the week is best described as unsettled: ""We're expecting further spells of wet and windy weather for most of the coming week, and some parts of the UK will see strong winds at times. ""It looks as though the strongest winds will generally be towards the north west of the UK. Whether the winds will be strong enough to warrant the Met Office naming another storm is a bit uncertain. ""Warnings are usually issued based on the risk of disruption/hazardous weather, so I think the question is will it become significantly windier than normal. If so then warnings are likely, and I wouldn't rule out a named storm."" Storms have been more frequent in the last week because of a strong jet stream running across the Atlantic and the UK - the coming week sees the jet stream move ""a little further north"".

"Credit Suisse has hit out after a massive data leak has brought to light the hidden wealth of several clients of the bank. Data on more than 18,000 bank accounts, holding more than $100bn (Â£73.6bn), was leaked to German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externalby a whistleblower. It includes personal, shared and corporate accounts, as well as those opened as far back as the 1940s. Nearly 50 media organisations have spent months poring over the data. In their investigations, they suggest they have found evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in serious crimes such as money laundering or drug trafficking. But on Sunday, the Swiss bank said it strongly rejected the allegations and insinuations about its alleged business practices or lack of due diligence. ""The matters presented are predominantly historical, in some cases dating back as far as the 1940s, and the accounts of these matters are based on partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context"", it said. 'Public pressure will cause politicians to act' The banker who can't stay out of the headlines World leaders deny wrongdoing after Pandora leaks In reports published by media organisations such as The Guardian and the New York Times, it has been claimed the bank opened or maintained accounts for high-risk clients, including criminals and individuals involved in human trafficking. Holding a Swiss account is not illegal and the leak also reportedly contained data of clients who had done nothing wrong. The data was shared with more than 40 media organisations around the world by non-profit journalism group, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. It includes bank accounts dating back decades. The majority were opened from 2000 onwards, although the bank's current operations are not included. Credit Suisse also said on Sunday that it had reviewed a large volume of accounts potentially associated with the matters raised. ""Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015,"" it said, although it would not comment on specific clients mentioned. The bank added it was ""deeply aware of its responsibility to clients and the financial system as a whole to ensure that the highest standards of conduct are upheld"". ""These media allegations appear to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial market-place as a whole, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years,"" it said. In a statement published by German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, the anonymous source explained their motivation for leaking the records more than a year ago. ""I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral. The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders,"" they wrote. It is not known if the whistleblower is an individual or a group. They also acknowledged ""having an offshore Swiss bank account does not necessarily imply tax evasion or any other financial crime"". Credit Suisse pointed out it had taken ""significant additional measures over the last decade, including considerable further investments in combating financial crime"". It follows other scandals for the Swiss bank, including the departure of two of its top executives after allegedly breaking Covid regulations and spying on former staff.

"Russian and Belarusian soldiers have been training together Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko have extended military drills which were due to end on Sunday. A statement cited the ""deterioration of the situation"" in east Ukraine as one reason for keeping an estimated 30,000 Russian troops in Belarus. The move will add to fears that Russia plans an invasion of Ukraine, which shares a long border with Belarus. Western leaders have accused Moscow of seeking a pretext to send in troops. Russia has denied it plans to invade its neighbour. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the extension of military exercises shows the world is on the brink of war. The BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford said the announcement - made by the Belarus defence ministry - is another strong signal that Russia is not prepared to back down in its stand-off with Western countries over Ukraine. In a phone call on Sunday, Mr Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron the Russian troops would eventually leave Belarus, the French presidency said. Mr Putin blamed the Ukrainian military for the escalation of tensions in the Donbas. France said the pair agreed to work for a ceasefire on the contact line in eastern Ukraine. This video can not be played Watch the moment Ukrainian officials run from apparent shelling in the eastern part of the country There were more explosions in the east Ukrainian conflict zone through the night and into Sunday. Detonations could be heard from the separatist-held city of Donetsk while both sides said they had come under heavy shell fire. As explosions boomed out in Donetsk on Sunday morning, Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk accused government forces of crossing the front line to mount an attack which killed two civilians. No proof was given for the allegation but Russian investigators opened an inquiry. Civilians from separatist-held regions are being evacuated to Russia The rebels and government forces accused each other of violating the ceasefire dozens of time on Sunday. Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed on Saturday as international monitors reported that ceasefire violations had increased dramatically this week. Thousands of civilians are being evacuated from the separatist territories into Russia while men of fighting age are being mobilised to fight. Speaking as she prepared to leave Donetsk for Russia by bus with her four-year-old daughter, an evacuee who gave her name as Tatyana told Reuters news agency: ""It's really scary. I've taken everything I could carry."" By Orla Guerin, BBC News, Novotroitske The frontlines in eastern Ukraine are rarely silent - at the very least there is sniper fire between Kremlin-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces. But now the big guns are back. In recent days there has been a barrage of artillery and mortar fire. We heard it ourselves at frontline positions in Novotroitske. We reached the trenches on foot, crossing flat ground where snow has given way to sucking layers of mud. Two fresh-faced troops led the way, standing stock still at the rumble of shelling a few kilometres away. At a sandbagged lookout position 24-year-old Taras told us there had been three days of heavy incoming fire. ""I think Putin is doing it on purpose to provoke us,"" he said. ""The situation has gotten worse, but we tolerate it, and we wait."" Ukrainian forces say they have orders not to return fire - except in exceptional cases - as Russia is ""looking for any excuse to invade"". Taras had a deadpan expression, and a phlegmatic approach to a possible invasion. ""They might raze us to the ground,"" he told me, ""and they might not. And we don't know if we will have support or not. If it gets too hard, we will open fire too."" Russia has mustered up to 190,000 troops including separatist forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to US estimates. Western leaders, meanwhile, are preparing sanctions against Russia in case of an invasion. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsontold BBC News sanctions would hit ""very very hard"".He said he had seen evidence Russia is planning ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945"". EXPLAINER:What is a false flag attack? CONTEXT:Satellite images show Russian activity near Ukraine BACKGROUND:Is Russia going to invade Ukraine? The President of the European Council Charles Michel has said the EU is ready to impose massive sanctions on the Kremlin - even harming its own economy if necessary - to confront Russian military aggression. But Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky has accused Western leaders of a ""policy of appeasement"" towards Moscow and demanded security guarantees for Ukraine, which officially aspires to join both Nato and the EU. Mr Putin has been demanding assurances that Nato will not admit Ukraine, a former Soviet state with close ties to Russia, while the Western alliance denies it poses any threat to Russia. There are fears that a Russian military intervention could start a war even bloodier than the conflict in eastern Ukraine which has cost at least 14,000 lives.

""Warnings are usually issued based on the risk of disruption/hazardous weather, so I think the question is will it become significantly windier than normal. If so then warnings are likely, and I wouldn't rule out a named storm.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson is asked whether he'll resign if police find he broke the law over No 10 parties Boris Johnson has refused to say whether he will resign if police found he has broken lockdown laws. The prime ministerhas returned his questionnaire to the Metropolitan Police who are investigating Downing Street parties. Asked in a BBC interview whether he would resign if police decide to take action, the PM said: ""I can't comment about a process that is under way."" More than 50 people have been sent the document by the force. Downing Street has not revealed what Mr Johnson said in his written response to the police, only that it was sent to them within the seven-day deadline before he travelled to Munich this weekend. But Mr Johnson was pressed several times on the subject by Sophie Raworth in an interview for BBC One's Sunday Morning Programme. She asked whether he understood why so many people found his on-the-record explanations - including that he believed he was only attending work events - ""implausible"". Mr Johnson said: ""There is literally not a bean I can tell you about that."" PM returns lockdown party questionnaire to police How many parties are police investigating? A timeline of the lockdown parties He was asked if he was ""burying"" his ""head in the sand"" as he was being investigated by the police, had MPs calling on him to resign and might face a no-confidence vote. Mr Johnson replied: ""I am fortunate to live in a democracy. I am fortunate to be the PM of a free independent democratic country where people can take that sort of decision, and where I do face that sort of pressure, that's a wonderful thing."" The police investigation was launched in late January after an internal inquiry led by civil servant Sue Gray passed information to the force. The initial findings of Ms Gray's inquiry criticised ""failures of leadership and judgement"" over the gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall. The police investigation, Operation Hillman, is examining 12 gatherings on eight dates - some of which the PM has already said he attended - to see if Covid regulations were broken. The Met has said a fine would be issued to anyone found to have breached Covid regulations. A decision is not expected for weeks. The questionnaire that was sent to Mr Johnson and scores of others requires an ""account and explanation of the recipient's participation in an event"", the Met has previously said. The survey, sent by email, has the same status as information given in an interview under caution. The Met said  previously that it ""must be answered truthfully"". Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP have all called for Mr Johnson to resign, as have some of his own Conservative MPs. But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told Sky News: ""I don't think what the country needs now is a vacuum at the centre of government."" Asked if that meant he though the prime minister should not quit if fined over Downing Street parties, he replied: ""That's exactly how you should take it."" But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""If he won't resign, Conservative MPs must do the right thing and sack him. ""For a sitting prime minister to be found guilty of breaking the law would be unprecedented and put to bed once and for all the Conservative Party's claim to be the party of law and order."" Separately, Mr Johnson refused to say in the BBC interview whether any public moneywill be used to fund the Prince Andrew financial settlement with Virginia Giuffre. Mr Johnson said: ""No prime minister ever answers questions about the Royal Family and quite right too.""

"The Queen will be 96 when the main Jubilee celebrations kick off in June Buckingham Palace has unveiled the full line-up of celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee this year. Street parties, a concert with some of the world's ""biggest entertainment stars"" and a chance to see the Queen's homes up close are all part of the plan to mark her 70 years on the throne. It will culminate in a four-day UK bank holiday weekend from 2 to 5 June. The first event begins on Monday, with a competition to invent a new pudding to celebrate the Queen's reign. Finalists will be judged by an expert panel including Dame Mary Berry and Masterchef's Monica Galetti. The winning recipe will be made available to the public and the pudding will be enjoyed at Big Jubilee Lunches during the bank holiday weekend. What do people buy the Queen for her Jubilee? On 6 February the Queen will become the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, marking a 70-year reign. A series of celebrations will take place throughout the year. The Queen marked 50 years on the throne in 2002, with the Duke of Edinburgh by her side She rode in the Golden State Coach as part of the celebrations As with the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilees, the first week in June has been chosen for the celebratory weekend, with the summer offering a better chance of good weather than February. To create the four-day weekend, the late May Spring Bank Holiday will be moved to 2 June and an additional one-off bank holiday on 3 June created. It is not clear which events the Queen will attend herself. She was advised by her medical team to rest for several weeks after an overnight hospital stay in October. The majority of the jubilee duties will probably be given to the rest of the family, including the heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, alongside his wife the Duchess of Cornwall. This jubilee will be the Queen's first without her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, who died in April last year. It's going to be puddings, parties, parades and pageants, in honour of the platinum jubilee. There isn't really a template for celebrating a British monarch's 70-year reign, because it's not happened before. The nearest was Queen Victoria's 63 years and elsewhere you have to go back to 18th-Century France and Louis XIV, who reached 72 years. In this current bleak mid-Covid winter, the jubilee offers the warming prospect of a four-day bank holiday in June, with concerts, parties and pubs open until 1am. The ""platinum pudding"" competition is in the tradition of royal-related dishes like Coronation Chicken, invented for the Queen's coronation in 1953. So expect a lot of trifling puns. The celebrations are also a reminder of how much the Queen has been a constant figure. A recent study showed for 85% of the population she's the only monarch they've ever known. This will be a marker for memories in many people's lives. Prince Philip joined the Queen on board the Royal Barge Spirit of Chartwell as part of the celebrations in 2012 The Queen taking part in a Silver Jubilee walkabout in 1977 During the festivities, Sandringham and Balmoral will be open for visitors to enjoy the celebrations across the long weekend in June. And during the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, a River Of Hope - made up of 200 silk flags decorated with images of hope drawn by children - will make its way along the Mall in central London. As part of the Queen's Green Canopy initiative, some 60,000 trees have already been planted to mark the year, as people have been encouraged to""plant a tree for the jubilee"". On10 Januarythe Platinum Pudding Competition starts. Members of the public are invited to create a dish to dedicate to the Queen's reign. From12 to 15 May, more than 500 horses and 1,000 performers will take part in a 90-minute show at Windsor Castle, taking the audience on a journey through history from Elizabeth I to present day. The first day of the long weekend isThursday 2 Juneand will see Trooping the Colour held in full for the first time since the pandemic. There will be more than 1,400 parading soldiers, 200 horses and 400 musicians taking part. Tickets are available to the public from next weekon this site,external. Also that day, Platinum Jubilee beacons will be lit in more than 1,500 locations across the UK, the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories. For the first time, the capital cities of Commonwealth countries will also light beacons. OnFriday 3 June- the second day of the Bank Holiday weekend - a Service of Thanksgiving for the Queen's reign will be held at St Paul's Cathedral. OnSaturday 4 Junethe Queen will be joined by members of the Royal Family at the Derby, held at Epsom Downs. There will also be a Platinum Party at Buckingham Palace, with members of the public invited to apply to attend a live concert. Performers have yet to be named, but it is billed as bringing together some of the world's biggest stars to celebrate the most significant moments from the Queen's seven-decade reign. The ballot for UK residents to secure tickets will be launched in February. OnSunday 5 Junepeople across the country will be invited to sit down together to take part in the Big Jubilee Lunch, with street parties held across the UK. That day's events will also include the Platinum Jubilee Pageant, which will feature 5,000 people from the UK and the Commonwealth performing around the area of Buckingham Palace. The palace promises ""pomp and ceremony, street arts, theatre, music, circus, costumes as well as cutting-edge visual technology"". Primary and secondary school children are invited tocreate a picture of their hopes and aspirations,externalfor the planet over the next 70 years. A selection of these will be transferred on to silk flags, which will carried by secondary school pupils in the pageant. InJuly, three displays marking the Queen's accession to the throne, the coronation and jubilees will be put on at Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. It will include portraits as well as the jewellery and outfits worn for each occasion. What are your plans for the Jubilee?

"Lufthansa and Swiss Air Lines will suspend flights to the Ukraine capital Kyiv from Monday amid growing fears of a Russian invasion. Germany's Lufthansa said it would also stop flights to Odessa, a key port on the Black Sea. ""The safety of our passengers and crew members is our top priority at all times,"" said Lufthansa. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Sunday thatRussia is planning ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945"". Last week, the Dutch airline KLM said that it was suspending flights to Kyiv. The Lufthansa suspension is expected to remain in place until the end of February. Swiss Air Lines - which is a subsidiary of the Lufthansa Group - said on Sunday that it would suspend its flights to Kyiv from Monday up to and including 28 February. Is Russia about to invade Ukraine? Satellite images show Russian activity near Ukraine Both Lufthansa and Swiss say they will continue to monitor the situation closely and that they are in close contact with national and international authorities. Swiss added: ""The safety of our passengers and crew members has top priority at all times... The affected customers will be informed accordingly."" A spokesperson for Lufthansa said: ""Affected guests will be informed and rebooked on alternative flight connections."" The airline usually operates 74 flights to Ukraine every week under its Lufthansa banner or the other carriers it owns which include Austrian Airlines, Eurowings and Swiss. Lufthansa said it would continue to fly to Lviv in Western Ukraine. Mr Johnson told the BBC that evidence suggests that Russia intends to launch an invasion that will encircle Kyiv. ""All the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun,"" he said. Ryanair and Wizz Air also operate flights to Ukraine and last week said they would continue to fly to the country. Ryanair is the largest airline which flies between Europe and Ukraine, followed by Wizz Air. In a statement on Sunday, Wizz Air said it was monitoring the situation closely and reminded passengers to check their inboxes regularly for further information about booked flights. A Wizz Air spokesperson said: ""Currently, we have not made any changes to our schedule and all of our flights to/from Ukraine continue to operate as normal."" Ryanair's chief executive Michael O'Leary said last week: ""It is important not to panic. ""Is it our duty and obligation to support the people of Ukraine as long as there is no war or missiles flying there."" The UK's Foreign Office has advised,externalthat British nationals ""should leave while commercial options remain"". ""In the event of a military incursion, it is likely that commercial routes out of Ukraine will be severely disrupted and roads across Ukraine could be closed,"" it said. Last week, the Ukrainian government pledged to keep the country's airspace open. It said it was ready to assume financial obligations for flight safety amid concerns of rising insurance costs for airlines to keep flying into the region. In July 2014, Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down while flying near eastern Ukraine's conflict zone. All 298 passengers and crew on board the flight between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur were killed. The victims included 80 children. An investigation by the Dutch Safety Board found that the plane crashed after being hit by a Russian-made Buk missile.

"Russian and Belarusian soldiers have been training together Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko have extended military drills which were due to end on Sunday. A statement cited the ""deterioration of the situation"" in east Ukraine as one reason for keeping an estimated 30,000 Russian troops in Belarus. The move will add to fears that Russia plans an invasion of Ukraine, which shares a long border with Belarus. Western leaders have accused Moscow of seeking a pretext to send in troops. Russia has denied it plans to invade its neighbour. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the extension of military exercises shows the world is on the brink of war. The BBC's Eastern Europe correspondent Sarah Rainsford said the announcement - made by the Belarus defence ministry - is another strong signal that Russia is not prepared to back down in its stand-off with Western countries over Ukraine. In a phone call on Sunday, Mr Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron the Russian troops would eventually leave Belarus, the French presidency said. Mr Putin blamed the Ukrainian military for the escalation of tensions in the Donbas. France said the pair agreed to work for a ceasefire on the contact line in eastern Ukraine. This video can not be played Watch the moment Ukrainian officials run from apparent shelling in the eastern part of the country There were more explosions in the east Ukrainian conflict zone through the night and into Sunday. Detonations could be heard from the separatist-held city of Donetsk while both sides said they had come under heavy shell fire. As explosions boomed out in Donetsk on Sunday morning, Russian-backed rebels in Luhansk accused government forces of crossing the front line to mount an attack which killed two civilians. No proof was given for the allegation but Russian investigators opened an inquiry. Civilians from separatist-held regions are being evacuated to Russia The rebels and government forces accused each other of violating the ceasefire dozens of time on Sunday. Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed on Saturday as international monitors reported that ceasefire violations had increased dramatically this week. Thousands of civilians are being evacuated from the separatist territories into Russia while men of fighting age are being mobilised to fight. Speaking as she prepared to leave Donetsk for Russia by bus with her four-year-old daughter, an evacuee who gave her name as Tatyana told Reuters news agency: ""It's really scary. I've taken everything I could carry."" By Orla Guerin, BBC News, Novotroitske The frontlines in eastern Ukraine are rarely silent - at the very least there is sniper fire between Kremlin-backed rebels and Ukrainian forces. But now the big guns are back. In recent days there has been a barrage of artillery and mortar fire. We heard it ourselves at frontline positions in Novotroitske. We reached the trenches on foot, crossing flat ground where snow has given way to sucking layers of mud. Two fresh-faced troops led the way, standing stock still at the rumble of shelling a few kilometres away. At a sandbagged lookout position 24-year-old Taras told us there had been three days of heavy incoming fire. ""I think Putin is doing it on purpose to provoke us,"" he said. ""The situation has gotten worse, but we tolerate it, and we wait."" Ukrainian forces say they have orders not to return fire - except in exceptional cases - as Russia is ""looking for any excuse to invade"". Taras had a deadpan expression, and a phlegmatic approach to a possible invasion. ""They might raze us to the ground,"" he told me, ""and they might not. And we don't know if we will have support or not. If it gets too hard, we will open fire too."" Russia has mustered up to 190,000 troops including separatist forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, according to US estimates. Western leaders, meanwhile, are preparing sanctions against Russia in case of an invasion. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnsontold BBC News sanctions would hit ""very very hard"".He said he had seen evidence Russia is planning ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945"". EXPLAINER:What is a false flag attack? CONTEXT:Satellite images show Russian activity near Ukraine BACKGROUND:Is Russia going to invade Ukraine? The President of the European Council Charles Michel has said the EU is ready to impose massive sanctions on the Kremlin - even harming its own economy if necessary - to confront Russian military aggression. But Ukraine's President Volodymr Zelensky has accused Western leaders of a ""policy of appeasement"" towards Moscow and demanded security guarantees for Ukraine, which officially aspires to join both Nato and the EU. Mr Putin has been demanding assurances that Nato will not admit Ukraine, a former Soviet state with close ties to Russia, while the Western alliance denies it poses any threat to Russia. There are fears that a Russian military intervention could start a war even bloodier than the conflict in eastern Ukraine which has cost at least 14,000 lives.

"Kell Brook (left) came out on top in his grudge match with Amir Khan Kell Brook sensationally beat Amir Khan in the sixth round, with the referee stopping the contest, to settle one of the most bitter and long-running feuds in British boxing. A packed-out Manchester Arena witnessed a demolition job from Sheffield's Brook, 35, who showcased timing and power to win in emphatic fashion. A fight which had been in the making for over 17 years - with the two former world champions having traded words but never punches - ended with Khan and Brook embracing. The thrilling encounter might mark the end of both men's fighting careers, with Brook admitting that, although he felt he was back in top form, retirement was on his mind. ""I can live at peace with Amir Khan on my record,"" Brook said. ""My mojo is back and I love this game. We will listen to loved ones and see, but I'm back, baby. ""I can walk away but I could fight [Chris] Eubank [Jr]. I don't like Eubank. If the fight is right I will fight - I'm a prize fighter."" Khan, also 35, admitted after the sixth defeat of his career that he had struggled to switch on during the fight. ""Forty fights is a lot of fights. Winning two world titles, going to America... I need to sit down with my family, but it's more towards the end of my career,"" he said. ""That love of the sport is not there any more. When I was in the ring [before] I had that excitement, but I didn't have it. I felt quite flat and maybe that's a sign I should be calling it a day."" 'I'm an old man' - Khan considers retirement after loss Jonas fulfils world title dream in stunning style Brook dominated the contest from the first bell The bout may have taken place with both fighters in the twilight of their careers, but a raucous crowd of over 22,000 - which included former Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher and Manchester City footballer Jack Grealish - showed just how big a draw Khan and Brook still are. Brook looked focused as he strutted to the ring to Kanye West's 'All of the Lights', his trademark entrance music almost drowned out by the boos of the crowd. Khan - in a white and gold robe - looked slightly more relaxed as he made his ring walk, accompanied by stablemate, former opponent and current world champion Terence Crawford. Khan and Brook locked eyes in the final seconds before the first bell and after all the wait, there was no caution from either fighter as fans were treated to a thrilling opening round. Khan demonstrated he still had hand speed in his arsenal with quick combinations in the opening half of the round. But Brook continued to stalk his opponent across the ring and caught Khan with a shot which wobbled the Bolton fighter. Khan was then on unsteady legs again towards the end of the round. The referee stepped in to stop the fight in the sixth Rounds two, three and four followed a similar pattern. Khan would start well, coming quickly out of the blocks, throwing feints and jabs, making his opponent miss and occasionally connecting with a single shot. But Brook's relentless, brutal attack continued in the fifth round. He was dragging a marked-up Khan - who seemed to have lost his defence and hand speed - around the ring like a rag doll. By now it was one-way traffic and in the sixth round, two right uppercuts followed by a left hook - all connecting - forced referee Victor Loughlin to intervene. While a loss to his most bitter rival will be a tough pill for Khan to swallow, it should not define a career of which he, his loved ones and fans of British boxing can be proud. The manner of his defeats by Breidis Prescott, Danny Garcia and Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez  - all vicious, stomach-churning knockouts - often made Khan, and the supposed fragility of his chin, the butt of jokes among boxing fans. Khan (right, 40 fights) and Brook (left, 43 fights) have both had long careers in the pro game But his talent, achievements and impact on the sport surpass that of most boxers. Khan is a fighter who single-handedly carried the torch for Team GB's boxing squad at the 2004 Olympics, winning silver in Athens. He is a fighter who paved the way for future Olympic stars such as Anthony Joshua, Nicola Adams and James DeGale. And he is a fighter who, after being thrust into the limelight of professional boxing aged just 17, went on to beat quality champions such as Marcos Maidana, Zab Judah and Devon Alexander and become a unified world champion. For Brook, retiring on a high could be a satisfying way to leave such a gruelling sport, but he has suggested he will take time before confirming his next move. Should he hang up the gloves, he too can leave the sport with his head held high. While Khan is often praised for never ducking a challenge, Brook too has dared to be great. In 2014 he travelled to the champion's home city when he beat American Shawn Porter on points in California to become IBF welterweight champion. Brook also moved up weight divisions when he lost to Kazakhstan's ferocious puncher Gennady Golovkin, and eight months later was defeated by pound-for-pound American star Errol Spence Jr. If Brook does continue, he will not be short of options, and leading the pack could be a blockbuster bout between Brook and Eubank Jr, one that is likely to capture the imagination of both boxing aficionados and casual fans.

"This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson says people need to understand the ""sheer cost in human life"" war could entail Evidence suggests Russia is planning ""the biggest war in Europe since 1945"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He told the BBC's Sophie Raworth in an interview: ""All the signs are that the plan has already in some senses begun."" Intelligence suggests Russia intends to launch an invasion that will encircle Ukrainian capital Kyiv, Mr Johnson said. ""People need to understand the sheer cost in human life that could entail,"" he said. The prime minister was speaking from Munich, where world leaders are meeting for an annual security conference. Ukraine: How big is the Russian military build-up? UK vows to step up support for Ukraine Ukraine invasion would shock the world - PM The latest estimates by the US government suggests that between 169,000 and 190,000 Russian troops are stationed along Ukraine's border, both in Russia and neighbouring Belarus - but this figure also includes Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. Mr Johnson warned that any conflict could be ""bloody and protracted"", saying Russian President Vladimir Putin was possibly ""thinking illogically about this"" and did not ""see the disaster ahead"". ""I think it's vital for us all now to get over what a catastrophe it would be for Russia,"" he added. He indicated that the UK and US would bring further sanctions against Russiathan have been suggested before,including stopping its companies ""trading in pounds and dollars"" - a move that he said would ""hit very, very hard"". Mr Johnson added: ""The lesson of [the Russian seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in] 2014 is that you can't just let Vladimir Putin get away with it."" An invasion of Ukraine would strengthen, rather than weaken, Nato, he predicted, saying Western countries could not allow opposition forces to come to ""the false conclusion that might is right"". ""If [Mr Putin] thinks he's going to get less Nato as a result of this, he's totally wrong,"" Mr Johnson said. ""He's going to get more Nato."" By Peter Saull, political correspondent While a full-blown Russian invasion of Ukraine is yet to materialise, Boris Johnson's latest comments ratchet up the war of words. The prime minister raising the prospect of a conflict as devastating as World War II is designed to focus minds. The ongoing tensions in eastern Europe have given Mr Johnson, who's faced a myriad of problems at home, a chance to show leadership on the world stage. And on the sidelines of the Munich security conference, he seems to have made some progress on the question of sanctions. Stopping Russian companies' ability to trade in pounds and dollars is a new proposal designed to do serious damage to the country's finances. Ukraine is not a member of Nato or the European Union but has close relations with both. Russia is insisting its neighbour should not be allowed to join Nato, which it sees as a threat to its security. Western nations have accused Russia of trying to stage a fake crisis on Ukraine's border, warning in recent weeks Mr Putin's forces could be preparing to invade at any time. But Russia has denied the claims, saying the massed troops are just conducting military exercises. Asked whether a Russian invasion was still thought to be imminent, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm afraid that that is what the evidence points to. There's no burnishing it."" The prime minister said US President Joe Biden had told Western leaders that intelligence suggested Russian forces were not just planning on entering Ukraine from the east, via Donbas, but down from Belarus and the area surrounding Kyiv. ""I'm afraid to say that the plan we are seeing is for something that could be really the biggest war in Europe since 1945, just in terms of sheer scale,"" he said. People needed to not only consider the potential loss of life of Ukrainians, but also of ""young Russians"", he added. Mr Johnson was speaking after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky andtelling world leaders in a speechthat any invasion of Ukraine by Russia would ""echo around the world"". During a phone call on Sunday, the prime minister and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the next week would be ""crucial for diplomacy"". A No 10 spokeswoman said the two leaders updated one another on their ""respective diplomatic efforts"", including Mr Macron's call with Mr Putin on Sunday. ""The prime minister noted that President Putin's commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution,"" the spokeswoman added. She said Mr Johnson stressed Ukraine's ""voice must be central"" in any talks, and that the two leaders ""underscored the need for President Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine's border"". Labour said it stood ""four-square behind the UK government and Nato, with shadow health secretary Wes Streeting telling Sky News: ""There should be no doubt on the resolve of the UK, on a cross-party basis, and the resolve of Nato across the alliance."" But he also urged the government to do more to prevent the City of London being a ""centre"" for ""Russian kleptocrats and money laundering"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Home Secretary Priti Patel warned the crisis could bring an increased risk of cyber attacks in Britain. She said past Russian cyber activity had included interference with UK media, telecommunications, and energy infrastructure, and the government expected to see an escalation of similar operations in the coming months. In the same paper, Lindy Cameron, head of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said that ""attacks targeting Ukraine's digital infrastructure could be felt here in Britain"". She said that, in 2017, malware used by the Russian military to target infrastructure in Ukraine ""spiralled recklessly out of control to affect many other countries, including the UK'.

Khan, also 35, admitted after the sixth defeat of his career that he had struggled to switch on during the fight. ""Forty fights is a lot of fights. Winning two world titles, going to America... I need to sit down with my family, but it's more towards the end of my career,"" he said. ""That love of the sport is not there any more. When I was in the ring [before] I had that excitement, but I didn't have it. I felt quite flat and maybe that's a sign I should be calling it a day."" 'I'm an old man' - Khan considers retirement after loss Jonas fulfils world title dream in stunning style Brook dominated the contest from the first bell The bout may have taken place with both fighters in the twilight of their careers, but a raucous crowd of over 22,000 - which included former Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher and Manchester City footballer Jack Grealish - showed just how big a draw Khan and Brook still are. Brook looked focused as he strutted to the ring to Kanye West's 'All of the Lights', his trademark entrance music almost drowned out by the boos of the crowd. Khan - in a white and gold robe - looked slightly more relaxed as he made his ring walk, accompanied by stablemate, former opponent and current world champion Terence Crawford. Khan and Brook locked eyes in the final seconds before the first bell and after all the wait, there was no caution from either fighter as fans were treated to a thrilling opening round. Khan demonstrated he still had hand speed in his arsenal with quick combinations in the opening half of the round. But Brook continued to stalk his opponent across the ring and caught Khan with a shot which wobbled the Bolton fighter. Khan was then on unsteady legs again towards the end of the round. The referee stepped in to stop the fight in the sixth Rounds two, three and four followed a similar pattern. Khan would start well, coming quickly out of the blocks, throwing feints and jabs, making his opponent miss and occasionally connecting with a single shot. But Brook's relentless, brutal attack continued in the fifth round. He was dragging a marked-up Khan - who seemed to have lost his defence and hand speed - around the ring like a rag doll. By now it was one-way traffic and in the sixth round, two right uppercuts followed by a left hook - all connecting - forced referee Victor Loughlin to intervene. While a loss to his most bitter rival will be a tough pill for Khan to swallow, it should not define a career of which he, his loved ones and fans of British boxing can be proud. The manner of his defeats by Breidis Prescott, Danny Garcia and Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez  - all vicious, stomach-churning knockouts - often made Khan, and the supposed fragility of his chin, the butt of jokes among boxing fans. Khan (right, 40 fights) and Brook (left, 43 fights) have both had long careers in the pro game But his talent, achievements and impact on the sport surpass that of most boxers. Khan is a fighter who single-handedly carried the torch for Team GB's boxing squad at the 2004 Olympics, winning silver in Athens. He is a fighter who paved the way for future Olympic stars such as Anthony Joshua, Nicola Adams and James DeGale. And he is a fighter who, after being thrust into the limelight of professional boxing aged just 17, went on to beat quality champions such as Marcos Maidana, Zab Judah and Devon Alexander and become a unified world champion. For Brook, retiring on a high could be a satisfying way to leave such a gruelling sport, but he has suggested he will take time before confirming his next move. Should he hang up the gloves, he too can leave the sport with his head held high. While Khan is often praised for never ducking a challenge, Brook too has dared to be great. In 2014 he travelled to the champion's home city when he beat American Shawn Porter on points in California to become IBF welterweight champion. Brook also moved up weight divisions when he lost to Kazakhstan's ferocious puncher Gennady Golovkin, and eight months later was defeated by pound-for-pound American star Errol Spence Jr. If Brook does continue, he will not be short of options, and leading the pack could be a blockbuster bout between Brook and Eubank Jr, one that is likely to capture the imagination of both boxing aficionados and casual fans.

"The CBI group is calling for a permanent ""super-deduction"" tax break to boost business investment in the UK. The super-deduction allowance currently gives businesses investing in certain types of equipment, like machinery, a much higher tax reduction than usual. It was introduced at the spring Budget last year, but is due to expire in March 2023. ""It's started the job but cannot be a one-hit wonder,"" CBI director general Tony Danker said. The Treasury acknowledged the tax system has an important role to play in boosting business investment and innovation. When the tax break was originally announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak,external, it was described as necessary ""bold, unprecedented action to get companies investing"". Between 2020 and 2021, business investment was 12% lower than 2019 pre-coronavirus pandemic levels,according to official figures,external. Mr Danker said: ""The chancellor's super-deduction exemplified the boldness in public policy that we need to inspire investment and get the economy moving."" ""Evolving the policy from short-term fix into long-term strategy will give firms confidence that government and industry are aligned,"" he added. Business is not the bogeyman, firms tell Johnson Fairer, greener economy 'offers prizes for all' Tax on company profits to jump to 25% The policy allows companies, but not individuals, to claim 130% relief against investments they make in new plant and machinery items between 1 April 2021 and 31 March 2023. For example, if an eligible company spent Â£100,000 on computer servers, commercial vehicles or office furniture, they would be able to claim Â£130,000 against their profits subject to corporation tax. Recent research by the CBI suggests that 53% of firms plan to claim the super-deduction. Of the 325 companies it surveyed across different sectors, half said they would also revise future investment plans if the relief were made permanent. The CBI suggests that a successor to the policy could boost UK business investment by up to Â£40bn a year by 2026. It called on the government to consider the extension in an effort to increase productivity, particularly ahead of the upcoming rise in the corporation tax main rate to 25% for profits over Â£250,000. ""Firms are facing the highest tax burden in decades,"" Mr Danker said. ""But by rewarding firms who put money into their operations, we can unleash new innovation and productivity - the ingredients we need to escape the low-growth trap and build a stronger, sustainable and more equitable economic future.""â¯â¯â¯ The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has also previously said that the tax break seems ""to have been chosen specifically to counteract this disincentive - allowing 130% of expenditure to be deducted with a 19% tax rate is almost exactly equivalent to allowing 100% of it to be deducted with a 25% tax rate."" But Stuart Adam, senior research economist at the IFS, warned last year that the relief could also be open to tax avoidance, or even fraud, ""as companies essentially try to find ways to dress things up as plant and machinery investment to get this generous deduction"". The CBI is calling on the government to consider a permanent deduction of 100% as part of its proposals to boost economic growth. In response to the CBI's new research, a Treasury spokesperson said: ""The Chancellor announced the super-deduction last March to unlock business investment to spur our economic recovery from the pandemic - and the CBI's analysis reflects this. ""The super-deduction is helping to power our recovery, and we are the fastest growing economy in the G7 this year.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson is asked whether he'll resign if police find he broke the law over No 10 parties Boris Johnson has refused to say whether he will resign if police found he has broken lockdown laws. The prime ministerhas returned his questionnaire to the Metropolitan Police who are investigating Downing Street parties. Asked in a BBC interview whether he would resign if police decide to take action, the PM said: ""I can't comment about a process that is under way."" More than 50 people have been sent the document by the force. Downing Street has not revealed what Mr Johnson said in his written response to the police, only that it was sent to them within the seven-day deadline before he travelled to Munich this weekend. But Mr Johnson was pressed several times on the subject by Sophie Raworth in an interview for BBC One's Sunday Morning Programme. She asked whether he understood why so many people found his on-the-record explanations - including that he believed he was only attending work events - ""implausible"". Mr Johnson said: ""There is literally not a bean I can tell you about that."" PM returns lockdown party questionnaire to police How many parties are police investigating? A timeline of the lockdown parties He was asked if he was ""burying"" his ""head in the sand"" as he was being investigated by the police, had MPs calling on him to resign and might face a no-confidence vote. Mr Johnson replied: ""I am fortunate to live in a democracy. I am fortunate to be the PM of a free independent democratic country where people can take that sort of decision, and where I do face that sort of pressure, that's a wonderful thing."" The police investigation was launched in late January after an internal inquiry led by civil servant Sue Gray passed information to the force. The initial findings of Ms Gray's inquiry criticised ""failures of leadership and judgement"" over the gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall. The police investigation, Operation Hillman, is examining 12 gatherings on eight dates - some of which the PM has already said he attended - to see if Covid regulations were broken. The Met has said a fine would be issued to anyone found to have breached Covid regulations. A decision is not expected for weeks. The questionnaire that was sent to Mr Johnson and scores of others requires an ""account and explanation of the recipient's participation in an event"", the Met has previously said. The survey, sent by email, has the same status as information given in an interview under caution. The Met said  previously that it ""must be answered truthfully"". Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP have all called for Mr Johnson to resign, as have some of his own Conservative MPs. But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told Sky News: ""I don't think what the country needs now is a vacuum at the centre of government."" Asked if that meant he though the prime minister should not quit if fined over Downing Street parties, he replied: ""That's exactly how you should take it."" But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""If he won't resign, Conservative MPs must do the right thing and sack him. ""For a sitting prime minister to be found guilty of breaking the law would be unprecedented and put to bed once and for all the Conservative Party's claim to be the party of law and order."" Separately, Mr Johnson refused to say in the BBC interview whether any public moneywill be used to fund the Prince Andrew financial settlement with Virginia Giuffre. Mr Johnson said: ""No prime minister ever answers questions about the Royal Family and quite right too.""

"Kell Brook (left) came out on top in his grudge match with Amir Khan Kell Brook sensationally beat Amir Khan in the sixth round, with the referee stopping the contest, to settle one of the most bitter and long-running feuds in British boxing. A packed-out Manchester Arena witnessed a demolition job from Sheffield's Brook, 35, who showcased timing and power to win in emphatic fashion. A fight which had been in the making for over 17 years - with the two former world champions having traded words but never punches - ended with Khan and Brook embracing. The thrilling encounter might mark the end of both men's fighting careers, with Brook admitting that, although he felt he was back in top form, retirement was on his mind. ""I can live at peace with Amir Khan on my record,"" Brook said. ""My mojo is back and I love this game. We will listen to loved ones and see, but I'm back, baby. ""I can walk away but I could fight [Chris] Eubank [Jr]. I don't like Eubank. If the fight is right I will fight - I'm a prize fighter.""

Venice is going to host some of the action in 2026, hence ice hockey players on a barge and figure skaters on a gondola in Milan-Cortina's video montage. Lizzy YarnoldTwo-time Olympic champion on BBC TV If it was an easy answer people would have been able to answer it already. I would love to see Winter Sports coming toegther more often. I've enjoyed sharing the passion for sport. Funding is so important - I know we haven't bought the medals home but keep funding it to prove everyone wrong. The next Winter Olympics will be held in 2026 in Milan-Cortina. The opening ceremony will be in the San Siro apparently. The Olympic flag passes to the towns' mayors before two children push a giant globe across a 'sheet of thin and cracking ice' projected onto the stadium floor. And then it is over to another montage. Which does make Italy look suitably lovely though to be honest.  Aside from the curling medals, the Games have been a struggle forTeam GB. There were some high hopes but ultimately medal chances came and went. Nowhere was this seen more than in the skeleton where Great Britain's run of having the Olympic champion in the women's event came to an abrupt end. Biathlon The most successful athlete at the Beijing Games is Norway'sJohannes Thingnes Boe. He leaves China having bagged a remarkable four golds and one bronze in the biathlon. His brotherTarjeinabbed two golds, a silver and a bronze too. Not bad. Spot the medal ribbons! Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Freestyle skiing If you were picking your star of these Olympics then China'sEileen Guwould be right in contention. She stunned everyone in the freestyle skiing events by winning gold in the big air and halfpipe plus silver in the slopestyle. Some suggested it could not be done... BBC Sport What is it like to carry your team's flag on the biggest stage of all. Here is Great Britain's Bruce Mouat to explain... ""They told us as a five and that was an incredible moment, just having all the boys congratulate me as well. That gave me goose-bumps. ""Honestly I can't describe how it felt, overcome with emotion really. ""Unfortunately me and Jen (Dodds) were too busy to go to the opening cerenony so just to have the opportunity to go to the Bird's Nest for the first time, to be holding the GB flag and to close off what has been an incredible month for me here - it's going to mean everything and I hope all of Britain can watch and to be proud of us."" Russian Alexander Bolshunov is also picking up his third gold of the Games, this time for a (shortened) 50km mass start. Quick bit of medal admin before we continue... Two cross country skiing medals will be handed out. First, Norway's Therese Johaug picks up the gong for the 30 km Mass
Start Free event. It is her third gold, her first was the very first of the whole Games. She missed the last Games as she served an 18-month suspension for testing positive for steroids. Everyone loves a montage right? Of course. And so, the closing ceremony is launching into a high-budget recap of some of the action of the past couple of weeks. Strangely, they have picked Rage Against the Machine for the music though... Only joking, anonymous melodramatic strings instead. The spectre of politics has never been far away from the Games. Beijing Games spokesperson Yan Jiarong, having earlier insisted in media briefings that politics would remain off the agenda, switched tack by asserting Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. ""There is only one China,"" she said when an International Olympic Committee spokesperson was asked whether Taiwan, which competes as Chinese Taipei at Beijing's insistence, would attend today's closing ceremony.

divide us: you give peace a chance. ""May the
political leaders around the world be inspired by your example of solidarity
and peace."" Those of you who paid attention in geography will be able to spot the outline of Italy, the next hosts of the Winter Games, on the floor of the Bird's Nest... It is time for Cai Qi, the president of the Beijing 2022 Organising Committee to say a few words. ""With the successful delivery of the Games, Beijing has made history as the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter editions of the Olympic Games,"" he said. ""The Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 opens a new era for winter sport. It is yet another extraordinary example of humanity coming together for a shared future. The Olympic spirit will live on forever. ""Dear friends, I hope you will remember Beijing and Zhangjiakou, and remember the unforgettable time we have spent together at this Olympic Winter Games.
Let us join each other and create a brighter future for all."" Venice is going to host some of the action in 2026, hence ice hockey players on a barge and figure skaters on a gondola in Milan-Cortina's video montage. Lizzy YarnoldTwo-time Olympic champion on BBC TV If it was an easy answer people would have been able to answer it already. I would love to see Winter Sports coming toegther more often. I've enjoyed sharing the passion for sport. Funding is so important - I know we haven't bought the medals home but keep funding it to prove everyone wrong. The next Winter Olympics will be held in 2026 in Milan-Cortina. The opening ceremony will be in the San Siro apparently. The Olympic flag passes to the towns' mayors before two children push a giant globe across a 'sheet of thin and cracking ice' projected onto the stadium floor. And then it is over to another montage. Which does make Italy look suitably lovely though to be honest.  Aside from the curling medals, the Games have been a struggle forTeam GB. There were some high hopes but ultimately medal chances came and went. Nowhere was this seen more than in the skeleton where Great Britain's run of having the Olympic champion in the women's event came to an abrupt end. Biathlon The most successful athlete at the Beijing Games is Norway'sJohannes Thingnes Boe. He leaves China having bagged a remarkable four golds and one bronze in the biathlon. His brotherTarjeinabbed two golds, a silver and a bronze too. Not bad. Spot the medal ribbons! Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This one celebrates athletes from around the world, and how the belief in themselves
and from others helped them achieve
unbelievable performances. The tune's a new one to me but You Can Get It by Arkells, featuring K.Flay,  does the job admirably. Add it to the playlist. Freestyle skiing If you were picking your star of these Olympics then China'sEileen Guwould be right in contention. She stunned everyone in the freestyle skiing events by winning gold in the big air and halfpipe plus silver in the slopestyle. Some suggested it could not be done... BBC Sport What is it like to carry your team's flag on the biggest stage of all. Here is Great Britain's Bruce Mouat to explain... ""They told us as a five and that was an incredible moment, just having all the boys congratulate me as well. That gave me goose-bumps. ""Honestly I can't describe how it felt, overcome with emotion really. ""Unfortunately me and Jen (Dodds) were too busy to go to the opening cerenony so just to have the opportunity to go to the Bird's Nest for the first time, to be holding the GB flag and to close off what has been an incredible month for me here - it's going to mean everything and I hope all of Britain can watch and to be proud of us."" Russian Alexander Bolshunov is also picking up his third gold of the Games, this time for a (shortened) 50km mass start. Quick bit of medal admin before we continue... Two cross country skiing medals will be handed out. First, Norway's Therese Johaug picks up the gong for the 30 km Mass
Start Free event. It is her third gold, her first was the very first of the whole Games. She missed the last Games as she served an 18-month suspension for testing positive for steroids. Everyone loves a montage right? Of course. And so, the closing ceremony is launching into a high-budget recap of some of the action of the past couple of weeks. Strangely, they have picked Rage Against the Machine for the music though... Only joking, anonymous melodramatic strings instead. The spectre of politics has never been far away from the Games. Beijing Games spokesperson Yan Jiarong, having earlier insisted in media briefings that politics would remain off the agenda, switched tack by asserting Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. ""There is only one China,"" she said when an International Olympic Committee spokesperson was asked whether Taiwan, which competes as Chinese Taipei at Beijing's insistence, would attend today's closing ceremony.
