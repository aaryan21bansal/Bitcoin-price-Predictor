"The price of flour and bread is set to rise after what could be the worst UK wheat harvest in 40 years, the industry is warning. Farmers say that the extreme weather over the last year is likely to mean wheat yields are down by up to 40%. As a result, some millers have already increased the price of flour by 10% and they warn a no-deal Brexit could push up prices even further. And we're likely to see more of the same weather in future, experts say. The UK Met Office told BBC News that the extremes of wet and hot conditions that have marked this year are likely to become more common as our climate continues to change. Removing CO2 could spark big rise in food prices Wild wheat genetics offer climate hope for crops Pests to eat more crops in warmer world Wheat farmers have been hit with a triple-whammy of severe weather, according to the National Farmers' Union (NFU). First off, unusually heavy rain in the autumn meant many farmers could not plant as much wheat as they usually would. What they did plant did not thrive in the waterlogged soil. That was followed by the wettest February on record. Storms Ciara and Dennis battered much of the UK in the early and middle of the month, causing widespread flooding. They were followed by Storm Jorge at the end of February. Then we had the very hot and dry spring which caused droughts in many areas of the UK, making it hard for the crop to take up nutrients from the soil. A rise in the price of flour will be passed on to the bread we buy Finally, the heavy rain this August meant many farmers have had to delay harvesting their crops. ""We're looking at a 30% reduction in our good fields, in some of our poor fields it's is even more"", said Matt Culley, an arable farmer from Hampshire who is chair of the NFU's crop board. Some of his grain stores are virtually empty where normally they would be full at this time of year. He said much of the wheat that the rain has forced him to leave in the fields will only be fit for animal feed. It is, said Mr Culley, the worst harvest in the 37 years he's been farming, with the most dramatic variation in the weather he has ever known. A spokesperson for the Met Office explained: ""UK climate projections show a trend towards hotter and drier summers and warmer, wetter winters."" Since 85% of the wheat used for flour is grown here in the UK, flour millers will have to make up the shortages caused by this year's dire harvest with imports. And, because the price of wheat has been increasing steadily since the summer, the price of flour will rise, says Alex Waugh who runs the National Association of British and Irish Millers. Paul Munsey says further rises in the price of flour are to be expected He says wheat prices are already up by Â£40 a tonne - an increase of more than 20%. Because the margins millers operate on are very tight, they will have no choice but to pass some of this increase on to consumers by raising prices. ""It's reached the point where we can't afford to keep selling flour at the price that we are,"" Paul Munsey of Wessex Mill in Oxfordshire told BBC News. He has already increased the price of his flour by 12% and warns there may be further price rises to come. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, wheat imports could be liable for a Â£79 per tonne tariff, said the National Association of British and Irish Millers. This figure is derived from the World Trade Organization (WTO) standard tariff for wheat. Wheat prices are always volatile, but this would represent a further 40% hike in wheat prices which, once again, would be likely to drive up the price of flour. And when the price of flour rises, you can expect the price of bread to rise a little - as well as the price of biscuits, pastries and cakes. Agata Towpik runs Marcopolo Bakery in Wantage which specialises in craft bread. Peter Towpik runs a craft bread bakery with his wife Agata She says she is - very reluctantly - considering raising her prices. It will be only the second time she has done so since she and her husband Peter started the business a decade ago. ""Flour is our main ingredient and all the prices are increasing at the moment, so that will probably force us to put our prices up,"" she said. ""We love our customers and want as many of them as possible to be able to buy from us. But there's less money coming into the company and we've got employees and rent to pay.""

"Tokmac Nguen scored the winner for Ferencvaros Celtic suffered their earliest Champions League exit in 15 years after falling to a shock defeat at the hands of Ferencvaros in Glasgow. It seemed Neil Lennon's side had recovered from David Siger's early goal for the Hungarian champions when Ryan Christie's deflected strike levelled the one-legged tie. However, Tokmac Nguen's breakaway goal snatched victory for Ferencvaros and ensured Celtic's worst performance in the competition since Artmedia Bratislava knocked them out in 2005. The Scottish champions now drop into the Europa League third qualifying round, the draw for which takes place on Tuesday. Celtic 'only have themselves to blame' Podcast: 'Exit will cost Celtic dear' Reaction & as it happened Questions will likely be asked of Celtic and Lennon, just as they were before kick-off when it emerged leading striker Odsonne Edouard was injured and Christie would be deployed in his place. The manager insisted that fellow forwards Albian Ajeti and Patryk Klimala were only fit enough for the bench. Nevertheless, the hosts looked to have plenty of attacking threat as James Forrest forced an early parry from goalkeeper Denes Dibusz. Ferencvaros head coach Sergei Rebrov had sacrificed striker Franck Boli from their 2-0 win over Djurgardens in the previous round, but his side were not intent on sitting back and replacement Siger made an instant impact. Hatem Abd Elhamed was posted missing as Nguen, who scored a double against the Swedes, broke quickly and fed midfielder Somalia to win a corner. When it reached Siger, the midfielder was allowed too much to time to pick out the far corner from 18 yards. Ferencvaros' lack of match fitness began to tell as they defended ever deeper and Celtic peppered their goal with shots but they were efforts that failed to seriously trouble the visiting keeper. Half-time allowed the Hungarians some respite, but the flow of possession continued after the break and a lovely spell of passing around the edge of the visitors' box ended with Christie's side-footed effort clipping a defender's head and soaring over goalkeeper Dibusz. Dibusz turned a Ntcham volley off the underside of the crossbar and then a low Christie drive wide as Celtic turned the screw. But then came the goal that proved their downfall. Nguen outstripped Elhamed to a long ball out of defence, outmuscled the full-back, and slipped a finish past goalkeeper Vasilis Barkas from a narrow angle. On this evidence, Celtic rely too heavily on Edouard and paid for the French striker's absence. Lennon's experiment of using Christie up front instead of Klimala or Ajeti failed to pay dividends against a side who were only playing their third fixture of the season. Christie did his bit by scoring, but too many other chances were squandered. Ferencvaros have shown in recent European fixtures they are hard to beat away from home - they are now eight unbeaten - but Celtic have lost at home to a side who probably lack the quality to progress much further in the Champions League. Tokmac Nguen (left) has scored three goals in two Champions League qualifiers Celtic manager Neil Lennon:""It was easier than I thought it was going to be. We didn't take our chances and we had plenty of them. The second goal is really poor, really poor decision making, and it's individual mistakes that have cost us again. It's not fine going out at this stage of the competition, because we're better than that."" Ferencvaros head coach Sergei Rebrov:""We have beat one of the best teams we have faced in qualification last year and this year. They have quality players, but I think we deserved this. Most of the time we defended, but football is about scoring goals, not about the possession of the ball."" Celtic are left to reflect on another bruising failure to reach the lucrative Champions League group stage and will look to pick themselves up for Sunday's game at home to Motherwell as they continue their quest to win a 10th consecutive domestic league title.

"The group recently returned home from the Greek island of Zante Up to 30 young people in Plymouth could be infected with coronavirus having returned from holiday in Greece, local health officials say. The city's public health team said the group, aged 18 and 19, returned from the island of Zante last week and so far 11 have tested positive. Many of them had no, or ""very minor"", symptoms of the virus, they added. Greece is not currently on the list of countries with quarantine restrictions for UK travellers. Plymouth's director for public health Ruth Harrell said her team were working alongside national systems to contact and trace those thought to have been affected. Some who were not showing symptoms ""carried on as normal"" until they became aware of the risk, including going on a ""night out in Plymouth's bars and restaurants"", she added.

"The chief civil servant at the Department for Education has been sacked following the row over A-level and GCSE results in England. Jonathan Slater was due to stand down next year, but will now leave the department by next week. A government statement said Boris Johnson ""concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". But the civil service union accused No 10 of ""discarding"" its members to ""keep scrutiny from the government's door"". Mr Slater is thefifth permanent secretary to leave his post in six months. The news comes a day after the head of exam regulator Ofqual, Sally Collier, also resigned from her role. Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam fiasco Ofqual chief steps down after exams chaos Why have there been so many U-turns? Thousands of A-level studentssaw their results downgraded earlier this monthdue to an algorithm designed to moderate them. It led to a huge backlash and a u-turn by government ahead of the publication of GCSE results, reverting the grades back to those awarded by teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson faced calls to resign, but No 10 said it had full confidence in him. Mr Slater has been the permanent secretary at the DfE for four years and was due to step down in Spring 2021. He will now be replaced by Susan Acland-Hood, who was brought into the department on a temporary contract last weekto lead on its exam response. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill thanked Mr Slater for his 35 years as a public servant and the government said a permanent replacement would be confirmed in the coming weeks. Mr Williamson also thanked Mr Slater for his ""commitment to public service"", adding: ""Like the prime minister, I appreciate the hard work of officials across government, particularly during this unprecedented time."" The education secretary said he and his new permanent secretary's ""immediate focus remains on making sure every child returns to the classroom full-time at the start of term"". The general secretary of the FDA union, Dave Penman, criticised the decision to sack Mr Slater. He said: ""If it wasn't clear before, then it certainly is now - this administration will throw civil service leaders under bus without a moment's hesitation to shield ministers from any kind of accountability."" He accused the government of ""scapegoating"" civil servants and claimed trust between ministers and civil servants was ""at an all-time low"". The Labour Party also condemned the move, saying civil servants had ""time and time again taken the fall for the incompetence and failures of ministers"". Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools. ""Leadership requires a sense of responsibility and a willingness to be held accountable, qualities this prime minister and his ministers utterly lack."" Former head of the Home Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, who has worked as a Labour advisor, called the sacking ""a disgrace"", telling Times Radio that senior civil servants were ""carrying the can for the failure of ministers"". So, what does the departure of Jonathan Slater mean - and why does it matter? For his union, the FDA - and for Labour - it is straightforwardly a sign that, when things go wrong, the buck now firmly stops with the officials and not government ministers. Angry Conservative MPs were being privately reassured that ""heads would roll"" after the exams controversy. And now, both a senior civil servant and the head of Ofqual have now departed, while Gavin Williamson and his education ministers remain in post. But something of a pattern is now emerging. In February, the most senior official at the Home Office resigned - and took the government to court, claiming there had been a ""vicious and orchestrated campaign"" against him. Other senior civil servants have made less of a fuss, but have nonetheless left their jobs. The most senior Whitehall mandarin - Sir Mark Sedwill - recently moved, the head of the Foreign Office announced an earlier than expected departure, and it was confirmed last month that the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice would be leaving too. So, not-so-permanent secretaries seems to be a feature of this administration. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has talked about reforming the civil service. In a speech in June, he said government departments recruited in their own image and their assumptions were ""inescapably metropolitan"". So a strategic rethink and an increased turnover of senior Whitehall personnel are probably not entirely unrelated. But what might worry senior civil servants more is they might be sacrificed for short-term news management, rather than as the result of any strategic master plan. And there is a risk that this, in turn, might affect the quality of those who apply for senior civil service roles in the future.

"NÃ³ra Quoirin went missing from her room on 4 August 2019 A London schoolgirl who vanished from a Malaysian jungle resort may have been ""alive and moving"" during early searches for her, an inquest has heard. The body of NÃ³ra Quoirin, 15, was found after a huge hunt through dense rainforest last August. A policeman told the hearing that the location where NÃ³ra was eventually discovered had already been searched several times but nothing was found. This suggested she was ""not there"" when search teams were, the court was told. NÃ³ra was first reported missing a day after she and her family arrived at the Dusan eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65 km) south of Kuala Lumpur, on 3 August 2019. Her body was found on 13 August by a group of civilian search volunteers in a hilly part of a palm-oil plantation about 1.5 miles from the holiday home. At the inquest, deputy public prosecutor Muhamad Iskandar Ahmad asked Supt Mohamad Nor Marzukee Besar how many times had the police searched the exact location of the body find. Mr Besar answered: ""Three times. The fourth day, the fifth day, and the sixth day [of the search]."" Mr Ahmad asked Mr Besar what assumptions he could draw from this. ""We can assume that when the search team was in the area, the missing person was still alive and moving,"" Mr Besar said. ""So it is possible that when we were there, the missing person was not there."" According to Mr Besar, police last searched the area where NÃ³ra was found on 9 August. Mr Besar also told the inquest that police had performed a further search after NÃ³ra's family told them she had last been seen wearing underwear. He said that her body was found naked, and this raised the question of where her clothing had ended up. Despite the extra search, NÃ³ra's underwear was never found, the inquest heard. Mr Besar also said police believed NÃ³ra had left through an open window in the resort house where her family was staying. NÃ³ra's family have always insisted it was highly unlikely their daughter - who was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development - would have wandered off alone. Mr Besar said CCTV footage from Kuala Lumpur Airport, screened in the courtroom, had shown NÃ³ra walking ""normally"". Based on this, he said, police had assumed it was possible for her ""to go towards the mountain"". Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate Nora NÃ³ra's mother Meabh, 46, and father Sebastian, 48, are following the inquest via videolink due to the coronavirus pandemic. They disagree with local police, who believe there was no foul play involved in their daughter's death, and have pushed for the inquest being held in the city of Seremban. The inquest is scheduled to last until 18 September. For more London news follow onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, onInstagram,externaland subscribe to ourYouTube,externalchannel.

"Mr Hogan said he did not break any law but he ""should have been more rigorous"" in his adherence to the Covid guidelines EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has resigned after the Irish government accused him of breaching Covid-19 guidelines. Mr Hogan attended a golf dinner with more than 80 people in County Galway on 19 August. He was also criticised for not complying with quarantine rules when he arrived in Ireland from Brussels. Mr Hogan said he did not break any law but he ""should have been more rigorous"" in adherence to the Covid guidelines. In a resignation statement, the outgoing commissioner said he regretted his trip to Ireland had ""caused such concern, unease and upset"". ""I reiterate my heartfelt apology to the Irish people for the mistakes I made during my visit,"" he added. Profile: Phil Hogan GolfGate: The hotel event causing chaos in Ireland On Tuesday, Mr Hogan provided details to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, about his time in Ireland leading up to his attendance at the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) Golf Society event. After arriving in the Republic of Ireland on 31 July, Mr Hogan said he travelled to his temporary residence in Kildare and tested negative for Covid-19 on 5 August during a hospital visit. He had told Irish state broadcaster RTÃ he had not breached regulations and argued the test result meant he was ""not under any subsequent legal requirement to self-isolate or quarantine"". Ireland's Department of Health has said a person is required to restrict their movements for 14 days if they arrive into Ireland from a country not on the green list. It said the guidance does not state that a negative Covid-19 test shortens the 14-days requirement. Phil Hogan was accountable to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The leaders of the Republic of Ireland's governing coalition had said the commissioner had clearly breached guidelines and he should have restricted his movement for 14 days. They said he should also have limited his movements to and from Kildare for essential travel only, and he should not have attended the golf dinner. Following news of the resignation, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, TÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said it was ""the correct course of action given the circumstances of the past week"". ""We all have a responsibility to support and adhere to public health guidelines and regulations,"" a joint statement continued. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she was grateful for Mr Hogan's ""tireless work as a trade commissioner"". ""He was a valuable and respected member of the college,"" she said. ""I wish him all the best for the future."" Mr Hogan - who would have been leading the EU's post-Brexit free trade negotiations with the UK - had been facing calls to quit in the wake of #GolfGate, as it has become known in Ireland. The now infamous golf dinner was attended by a host of high-profile figures from Irish political life. The controversy surrounding it has alreadycost the jobs of Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary and Jerry Buttimer, deputy chairman of the Irish senate.

"More than half a million people have been told to get out of the path of Hurricane Laura Hurricane Laura is expected to cause an ""unsurvivable"" storm surge, extreme winds and floods as it hits the US, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. The category four storm is approaching Texas and Louisiana with maximum sustained wind speeds of 150 miles per hour (240km/h). If it maintains those speeds it would be one of the strongest storms to ever hit the US south coast. Half a million residents have been told to leave the area. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT)the centre of the hurricane was 65 miles (105km) south east of Port Arthur,externalin Texas. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier hit the Caribbean, killing 24. Marco has already struck Louisiana, bringing strong winds and heavy rain on Monday. Initiallyit was feared that both storms would hit Louisiana as hurricanes within 48 hours of each other- an unprecedented event - but Marco was downgraded to a tropical storm. This video can not be played Hurricane Laura approaches Texas Laura, on the other hand, has strengthened rapidly from a category three, gaining 70% in power in just 24 hours, to a category four, maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). It is now close to becoming a category five storm, which would mean maximum sustained winds of 158mph (254km/h). Hurricane Katrina - which devastated New Orleans in 2005, killing more than 1,800 people - was a category five storm before weakening to a category three when made landfall in the US. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms Warming makes bigger hurricanes more damaging US President Donald Trumptold those potentially affected by the storm to ""listen to local officials"",externalas the storm was ""very dangerous and rapidly intensifying"". Evacuations are complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged families who could afford it to take refuge in hotels and motels to be distanced from others. Early on Wednesday the NHC said satellite images had shown that Laura had undergone a remarkable intensification to become a ""formidable hurricane"". In a series of tweets, it said Laura was expected to bring ""life-threatening hazards"" and an ""unsurvivable storm surge"" to parts of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Well-built homes could incur major damage, trees could be snapped or uprooted and electricity and water would be unavailable for days or even weeks, it said. ""Hurricane force winds and widespread damaging wind gusts will also spread well inland into portions of eastern Texas and western Louisiana early Thursday,"" the NHC added. Allow Twitter content?

""To think that there would be a wall of water over two storeys high coming on shore is very difficult for most to conceive, but that is what is going to happen,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott. ""The word 'unsurvivable' is not one that we like to use, and it's one that I've never used before,"" he added. Governor Abbott urged people in the path of the storm to ""take advantage of these final few hours to evacuate"". ""The power of Hurricane Laura is unprecedented, and Texans must take action now to get out of harm's way and protect themselves,"" he said. Laura is expected to reach landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border between midnight and 02:00 local time on Thursday (07:00 GMT). The National Weather Service has also issueda tornado watch for parts of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi,external. A man boards up a Louisiana store as the state braces itself for Hurricane Laura More than 420,000 Texas residents have been ordered to leave, while an additional 200,000 were told to evacuate Calcasieu Parish in south-western Louisiana. Port Arthur, Texas, is home to the nation's largest oil refinery, and workers have been taken off at least 310 offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, reducing oil production by 84% for a second day in a row, officials said. Marco and Laura brought high winds and rough seas to the Caribbean, leaving at least 24 people dead, including a baby and an eight-year-old child in Haiti. Heavy rains have also battered parts of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and the US territory of Puerto Rico. President Trump declared a state of disaster in the territory on Saturday. Laura has brought rough seas and high winds to the Caribbean, including here in Havana, Cuba In Cuba, authorities have evacuated at least 160,000 people from several coastal regions, while thousands have been evacuated in the Dominican Republic.

"A Pizza Pilgrims restaurant in Belgravia Restaurants say they will continue to offer the Eat Out to Help Out scheme in September, funding it themselves, because it has been so successful. The government scheme offers customers 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 during August. But chains such as Pizza Pilgrims now say they will offer the discount next month too. The aim is to draw people nervous about coronavirus back to restaurants at a time when many are struggling. Some 84,000 restaurants, cafes and bars have signed up to the government's scheme, which runs on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August. According to thelatest Treasury figures, diners used it more than 64 million timesin its first three weeks - equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out. Data shows only 27% of UK consumers feel safe eating at a restaurant Commercial landlord Grosvenor - which owns property across central London - said it would reduce rents for tenants that continue to offer diners half-price meals until the end of September. High end restaurants Comptoir and Roka, the Thomas Cubitt pub and Peggy Porschen cafÃ© are among those to sign up. ""Eat Out to Help Out has been a powerful tool in protecting jobs and local economies UK-wide and we are working hard to help the West End and our tenants recover,"" said Amelia Bright, executive director of Grosvenor's London estate. ""Continuing it will not only support cafes, restaurants and bars that we lease space to but also help welcome back more visitors and workers to Mayfair and Belgravia."" How does the scheme work? The highs and lows of the coronavirus discount scheme 'We've had 15,000 bookings' Eat Out to Help Out discount used 64m times in three weeks Others say they will offer different discounts inspired by the scheme. Spanish City, a steak and seafood restaurant in Whitley Bay, told the BBC it would offer a 25% discount on all food and non-alcoholic drinks on Monday to Wednesdays, with no cap on spending. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus. Boss Kate Nicholls welcomed the move by individual restaurants to extend the Eat Out scheme, saying it had been ""a huge success"". ""The hospitality sector is still fragile and faces other challenges, but prolonging the Eat Out scheme could help businesses back to stability and enable them to safeguard jobs and livelihoods,"" she said. A growing list of restaurant chains have had to announce closures in recent months includingPizza Express,Byron Burgerand Frankie & Benny's-owner the Restaurant Group. Spend for the second week of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme rose 9% And on Wednesday, Mexican chain Wahaca said it was closing 10 of its 25 restaurants, and that it would ""try to save jobs"" wherever possible. Spanish City's operations director Rob Smith told the BBC the Eat Out scheme had boosted its sales, but he remains cautious. ""We're forecasting being down about 25-30% for the rest of the year, and we're having to catch up on the three months we lost out - it's still very nervous times for the industry."" Here is a list of the restaurant chains which have confirmed to the BBC they will offer Eat Out to Help Out discounts in September: Pizza Pilgrims Stonehouse Pizza Carvert Applebee's Fish Burger & Lobster Popina The Mayfair Chippy Roka Mayfair NAC (north Audley kitchen) Comptoir Kai Horse & Groom pub Pantechnicon l'ETO London Boisdale Jones Family Kitchen Hunan Peggy Porschen La Poule Pot The Duke of Wellington (pub) UNI Restaurant Shack-Fuyu Flesh & Buns Arabica JosÃ© Pizzaro Benares Kricket Paladar Sticky Mango BOXPARK Pasta Remoli Aqua Kyoto Aqua Shard Hutong at the Shard The Gilbert Scott (St Pancras Renaissance Hotel) Saffron Circle Cecconi's Pizza Bar, Soho Cafe Boheme, Soho The Allis, White City Electric Diner, Portobello Pizza East, Shoreditch Dean Street Townhouse, Soho Hoxton Grill, Shoreditch Mama Shelter London Bala Baya Madera at Treehouse Hotel Brindisa Restaurants Jurema at The Mandrake Hotel Kings Arms Berkhamsted The Penny Farthing Hotel Royal Foresters Ascot House of Darwin Hurt Arms White Hart Horse & Jockey The Beech House The Akeman The Anchor Riverside Banyers House The Betsey Wynne Swanbourne The Blue Boar Witney The Cherry Tree The Crown & Whistle The Four Alls The Globe The King's Head The Lost Boy The Navigation Inn Thrupp Wharf The Old Post Office The Polecat Inn Red Lion The White Hart Ampthill Spanish City Portsmouth Arms, Basingstoke Black Rabbit, Arundel House Martin, New Milton Milk Churn, Melksham Cranberry Farm, Cranbrook Crown, Blandford Grasshopper, Parkstone Lighter, Topsham H&W Portishead Ship, Weymouth H&W Wichelstowe The Anchor Line (1-2 Sept only) Atlantic Bar & Brasserie (1-2 Sept only) The Citizen (1-2 Sept only) Cafe Andaluz (1-2 Sept only) Di Maggio's (1-2 Sept only) Deanes, Belfast The Parson's Nose, Hillsborough Alexander's, Holywood 'I saved Â£200 doing Eat Out to Help Out every day' Eat Out discount used 64m times in three weeks 'We've had 15,000 bookings for eat out to help out' Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Harding shot to fame in 2002 as a contestant on ITV's Popstars: The Rivals Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding has been diagnosed with breast cancer, which she says has spread to other parts of her body. Writing on Twitter, the 38-year-oldtold fans,externalshe was diagnosed with the disease earlier this year. Harding explained she then received the ""devastating news"" this month that the cancer had spread. ""I'm currently undergoing weekly chemotherapy sessions and I am fighting as hard as I possibly can,"" she said. The singer, who was born in Ascot in Berkshire, also shared a photo of herself in hospital. She thanked NHS staff, her family and friends for support, adding that she was ""trying to keep positive"". Harding said she had decided to go public with her diagnosis after being seen in hospital last week. Her Girls Aloud bandmateCheryl responded to the news,externalby posting a broken heart emoji on Twitter. Nadine Coyle commented on Harding's Instagram: ""I love you! You have always been able to achieve miracles when needed! I am here for all the way & always will be!"" Kimberley Walsh added: ""My heart is broken. You are so strong and brave and we are with you every step of the way."" Nicola Roberts tweeted:,external""It goes without saying that this is blindsiding. @SarahNHarding you're so loved and supported."" Hi everyone, I hope you are all keeping safe and well during these uncertain times. I've not posted on here for so long, thank you to everyone who has reached out to check in on me, it really does mean a lot. I feel now is the right time to share what's been going on. There's no easy way to say this and actually it doesn't even feel real writing this, but here goes. Earlier this year I was diagnosed with breast cancer and a couple of weeks ago I received the devastating news that the cancer has advanced to other parts of my body. I'm currently undergoing weekly chemotherapy sessions and I am fighting as hard as I possibly can. Harding also posted a picture of herself in hospital I understand this might be shocking to read on social media and that really isn't my intention. But last week it was mentioned online that I had been seen in hospital, so I feel now is the time to let people know what's going on and this is the best way I can think of to do so. My amazing mum, family and close friends are helping me through this, and I want to say a thank you to the wonderful NHS doctors and nurses who have been and continue to be heroes. I am doing my very best to keep positive and will keep you updated here with how I'm getting on. In the meantime I hope you'll all understand and respect my request for privacy during this difficult time. Sending you all so much loveâ¦.xx Harding shot to fame in 2002 as a contestant on Popstars: The Rivals - an ITV talent show which aimed to find both a new girl band and boy band. She made it to the final and was voted into the group which became Girls Aloud, alongside Nicola Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Kimberley Walsh and Cheryl Tweedy. Girls Aloud L-R: Kimberley Walsh, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts, Cheryl Tweedy and Nadine Coyle The group went on to have several UK hits, including Sound of the Underground, The Promise, Love Machine, Jump and Call The Shots. Girls Aloud reunited in 2012 after a short hiatus, to release and tour a greatest hits album. They announced their split in 2013. Harding has since taken on several acting roles, including appearances in Run for Your Wife, and St. Trinian's 2: The Legend of Fritton's Gold. She appeared on the Channel 4 reality show The Jump in 2016, but was forced to pull out after suffering a knee injury. In 2017, she won Celebrity Big Brother. The most common sign of breast cancer is a lump or thickening in the breast - but there are other symptoms too. They include: Change in size or feel of the breast Changes in the skin of the breast, such as dimpling or redness Fluid leaking from the nipple, outside of pregnancy or breast feeding Change in position of the nipple These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so it is important to get any lumps or changes checked by a doctor. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with women over 50 more at risk than the under 40s. But there are many other factors that can increase a person's risk, including a family history of cancer and being overweight. Many treatments are available for breast cancer and survival is generally good if the disease is detected early.

"Josh was invited for a tour of his local police station A five-year-old boy has been praised by police after calling the number on the side of his toy ambulance when his mum slipped into a diabetic coma. Josh called 112 - a European emergency number which serves the same purpose as 999 - which connected him to a police communications operator. Josh, from Telford in Shropshire, made the call last month when he found his mum lying unconscious on the floor. Local West Mercia police commander Supt Jim Baker said he was ""very brave"". ""This was an incredible thing for Josh to do. His quick thinking saw him ring the number on his toy ambulance as he was worried about his mum,"" Mr Baker said.

"The figures only include the first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown Scotland spent Â£15.1bn more on public services than it raised in taxes last year, according to Scottish government statistics. This public spending deficit was Â£2bn higher than the previous year, and represented 8.6% of the country's GDP. The figures cover the financial year to 5 April 2020, so do not reflect the full impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The deficit for the UK as a whole rose from 1.9% of its GDP to 2.5% for the same period. The statistics also estimated that Scotland raised Â£308 less per person than the UK average in taxation, while public spending was Â£1,633 per person higher in Scotland. Read the full Gers report,external What is Gers and how is it calculated? The figures were contained in the annual Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) statistics which have become a key battleground in the independence debate in recent years. They arecompiled by Scottish government statisticians,externalfree of political interference, and estimate spending that ""benefits the people of Scotland"" by the Scottish government, UK government, and all other parts of the public sector in Scotland. It also estimates the total amount of taxation raised in Scotland, including a proportional share of UK government taxes.  Â£81bnSpending in 2019-20 Â£24bnSocial protection inc state pension Â£14bnHealth Â£9bnEducation Â£4bnTransport The report estimated that a total of Â£81bn was spent by the public sector in Scotland last year - about Â£2.5bn more than the previous year. Meanwhile total revenues were put at Â£65.9bn, which was an increase of 0.7% and the highest on record. But revenues from the North Sea oil and gas industry dropped by Â£642m to Â£724m, which the report said reflected a fall in the oil price towards the end of the year. North Sea tax receipts brought in about Â£11bn a decade ago. The report says that its figures include the ""initial impacts"" of the coronavirus pandemic - but warns that the impact will be greater next year. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said governments across the world were spending more to deal with coronavirus The Scottish government's finance secretary, Kate Forbes, said the pandemic had ""fundamentally changed the fiscal landscape"". She added: ""We are now witnessing an unprecedented health and economic crisis. ""Countries across the world, including the UK, have increased borrowing to record levels and, as we emerge from the pandemic, high fiscal deficits will inevitably be one of the consequences. ""An independent Scotland would have the power to make different choices, with different economic budgetary results."" But the Scottish Conservatives said the figures were a ""massive setback for SNP plans for separation"" and showed that being part of the UK was ""more valuable than ever"" to Scotland. The party's finance spokesman, Murdo Fraser, said Scotland's public spending deficit was now higher than its health budget of Â£13.8bn. He said: ""The SNP and Nicola Sturgeon herself used to hail Gers figures as all the evidence Scotland needed to separate from the UK. ""Now, nationalists will spend the day denying facts from their own government."" His comments were echoed by the UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, who said the ""Union dividend"" was worth Â£1,941 for every person in Scotland. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the figures showed that Scotland's deficit had increased even before the full economic impact of coronavirus were felt. He added: ""With billions draining from the Scottish economy in the event of separation, Scotland would be thrust into years of savage and unrelenting austerity."" The Scottish Greens said the statistics showed that the ""old economic system"" had failed, and that ""independence must come with a determination to build a future for all in a new greener Scotland."" And the Scottish Liberal Democrats said the ""eye-watering"" figures ""really drive home just how economically valuable the partnership across these isles is"". Every part of the UK is out of kilter. Three parts are reckoned to be net contributors: London, south-east England and the east of England. Scotland is one of the net beneficiaries, but the notional deficit per head is lower than Northern Ireland, Wales and the north of England. Its tax take per head is close to that of the UK average, which indicates the economy has been performing nearly as strongly as the UK one. Scotland's spending level per head is significantly higher than the UK figure. So why does this matter so much in Scotland but not elsewhere? Probably because Scots are debating whether to become independent or not. Next August, Gers will look very different. The UK, Scotland and every other country are facing enormous deficits, from lower tax and higher spending, and the damage from having to tackle coronavirus and recession is likely to be felt for several years to come. These figures are acknowledged by most people, on both sides of the debate, as the starting point for a discussion about the affordability of public services and welfare benefits if Scotland's budget were to stand alone. But they only show the starting point if Scotland had become independent last year, and before any changes could be made to tax or spending. With a deficit of 8.6% of total output - well above a sustainable level - many of those early decisions would be difficult.

"Mr Hogan said he did not break any law but he ""should have been more rigorous"" in his adherence to the Covid guidelines EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has resigned after the Irish government accused him of breaching Covid-19 guidelines. Mr Hogan attended a golf dinner with more than 80 people in County Galway on 19 August. He was also criticised for not complying with quarantine rules when he arrived in Ireland from Brussels. Mr Hogan said he did not break any law but he ""should have been more rigorous"" in adherence to the Covid guidelines. In a resignation statement, the outgoing commissioner said he regretted his trip to Ireland had ""caused such concern, unease and upset"". ""I reiterate my heartfelt apology to the Irish people for the mistakes I made during my visit,"" he added. Profile: Phil Hogan GolfGate: The hotel event causing chaos in Ireland On Tuesday, Mr Hogan provided details to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, about his time in Ireland leading up to his attendance at the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) Golf Society event. After arriving in the Republic of Ireland on 31 July, Mr Hogan said he travelled to his temporary residence in Kildare and tested negative for Covid-19 on 5 August during a hospital visit. He had told Irish state broadcaster RTÃ he had not breached regulations and argued the test result meant he was ""not under any subsequent legal requirement to self-isolate or quarantine"". Ireland's Department of Health has said a person is required to restrict their movements for 14 days if they arrive into Ireland from a country not on the green list. It said the guidance does not state that a negative Covid-19 test shortens the 14-days requirement. Phil Hogan was accountable to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The leaders of the Republic of Ireland's governing coalition had said the commissioner had clearly breached guidelines and he should have restricted his movement for 14 days. They said he should also have limited his movements to and from Kildare for essential travel only, and he should not have attended the golf dinner. Following news of the resignation, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, TÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said it was ""the correct course of action given the circumstances of the past week"". ""We all have a responsibility to support and adhere to public health guidelines and regulations,"" a joint statement continued. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she was grateful for Mr Hogan's ""tireless work as a trade commissioner"". ""He was a valuable and respected member of the college,"" she said. ""I wish him all the best for the future."" Mr Hogan - who would have been leading the EU's post-Brexit free trade negotiations with the UK - had been facing calls to quit in the wake of #GolfGate, as it has become known in Ireland. The now infamous golf dinner was attended by a host of high-profile figures from Irish political life. The controversy surrounding it has alreadycost the jobs of Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary and Jerry Buttimer, deputy chairman of the Irish senate. The event took place the day after the Irish government changed its guidelines in the face of an increasing number of Covid-19 cases, with numbers allowed at indoor events cut from 50 to six, with some exceptions. James Sweeney, from the Station House Hotel where the event was held, told RTÃ he had checked with the Irish Hotels Federation to ensure the event complied with regulations. He said he was told it would be, if the guests were in two separate rooms, with fewer than 50 people in each. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) have said they are investigating what happened at the  dinner.

"Jane Midgley says she needs answers about the death of her son, Simon The mother of a man killed in a fire at a hotel on the shores of Loch Lomond more than two years ago has said it is ""torture"" not knowing why he died. Simon Midgley, 32, and Richard Dyson, 38, died in the fire whichfire broke out at the Cameron House Hotel in 2017. Jane Midgley said she needs answers about what led to Simon's death. The Crown Office said it was committed to ensuring the circumstances around the deaths were aired in an ""appropriate legal forum"". Ms Midgley said every day without answers was like the day she found out about his death. ""I just live it every single day and I can't cope with it much longer,"" she said. ""I need to know why they are not here and it's so difficult. ""I need answers. Why are these boys not here anymore? Why did this happen? Nearly three years on, no one is telling me."" Richard Dyson and Simon Midgley were thought to be on a winter break in Scotland She told BBC Scotland she wakes up during the night thinking about her son, asking herself ""has this really happened?"". ""Nearly three years on, should I still be feeling this hurt and pain?"" After the fire, the emergency services conducted investigations. While this can be a lengthy process, reports from the fire service and the police were passed to the Crown months ago. Ms Midgley criticised prosecutors for not providing her with more information. She added she thinks they should be in contact with her more regularly than every four weeks. She said: ""When the Crown say that they regularly update the family and are in regular contact that is always to say... 'it's still ongoing', 'we'll update you with anything significant', 'it's complicated'."" She added that there were many questions she still wanted answers to. ""The most important thing is finding out why Simon couldn't get out of that hotel that night - what went wrong. I have no idea, I've got to understand, I just need the answers. ""I need to know how it happened. I need to know why the boys didn't get out of that hotel when it was on fire, how it started, where it started, why they could not get out, could it have been prevented... it is pure torture."" Fire broke out at the Cameron House hotel in 2017 Mr Midgley was a freelance writer with the Evening Standard. Following his death the newspaper's editor, George Osbourne, paid tribute to Mr Midgley's ""adventurous spirit"". A spokesman for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: ""Our staff have been in regular contact with the nearest relatives and provided them with information at every stage. ""The information that can be shared while a case is being investigated is limited so as not to prejudice any potential proceedings. ""The Crownâ is committed to ensuring that the facts and circumstances surrounding the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson are thoroughly investigated by the relevant agencies, fully considered by COPFS and, in due course, aired in an appropriate legal forum. ""The nearest relatives will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments.""

"The EasyJet flight was from Gibraltar to Gatwick Airport A group of EasyJet passengers returning from Gibraltar are having to self-isolate for two weeks after a flight delay meant they were put up in a hotel across the border in Spain. The flight was due to leave on Monday but was delayed overnight. Easyjet could not book enough rooms for all passengers in Gibraltar so some spent the night in Spain. TheUK's travel rules,externalmean travellers from Gibraltar do not have to quarantine, but arrivals from Spain do. Gibraltar is a British overseas territory and shares a border with Spain. Its airport lies next to the border. Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday? One passenger who was on the flight to London's Gatwick Airport sent a message to the airline on Twitter, calling the situation ""ridiculous"". Alan Orme said: ""My option is to move from low Covid Gibraltar to high Covid Spain. I cannot afford to self-isolate. EasyJet will you pay my loss of earnings?"" Gibraltar, which has a population of about 32,000, has had a total of 246 confirmed cases of coronavirus and no deaths,according to the World Health Organization.,externalThe WHO says Spain has recorded more than 386,000 cases and 28,838 deaths. Spain was taken off the UK government's list of travel corridors last month, following a rise in cases. It meant travellers returning from there must stay at home for 14 days. People who do not self-isolate when required can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. In Scotland the fine is Â£480, and up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. Gibraltar is a limestone outcrop on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula, adjacent to Spain EasyJet said it had booked all available hotel rooms in Gibraltar as well as some near the airport just over the border in Spain. The airline said it was aware of five rooms in Spain that were used by customers. Customers were not required to take the rooms in Spain, it added, saying many customers arranged their own accommodation. In a statement, EasyJet said: ""As a result of low visibility weather conditions in Gibraltar, easyJet had to delay flight EZY8906 to Gatwick overnight. ""The safety and wellbeing of our customers and crew is our highest priority and we would never operate a flight unless it is safe to do so. ""We tried to provide as many hotel rooms in Gibraltar as possible, however due to a shortage of rooms it was not possible to provide these for all customers so we offered accommodation in Spain for those who wanted it.

"Masks will be required in secondary schools in other parts of the UK It will be up to schools and councils to decide if face coverings are used in Welsh schools. Masks are now recommended for children aged 11 and up in communal areas indoors where social distancing is difficult, and on school buses. But Wednesday's Welsh Government announcement did not make their use compulsory. Opposition parties and some education unions accused ministers of passing the responsibility to schools. That was denied by Health Minister Vaughan Gething, who said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not work in Wales. Risk assessments will need to be done to decide if schools or colleges need to ask pupils to wear face coverings. ScotlandandNorthern Irelandare mandating the use of face coverings in secondary school corridors and communal areas. They will be required in secondary school corridors in parts of England under local lockdown,after a U-turn. 'Late' U-turn on school masks frustrates teachers Crime in England and Wales falls during lockdown One further death with coronavirus in Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford told a Senedd meeting there was a ""part to be played"" for face masks in secondary schools in areas that see rising coronavirus cases, and where buildings do not allow pupils to move around safely. In a joint statement issued later by Mr Gething and Education Minister Kirsty Williams, the pair said guidance was being changed to require schools, colleges and councils ""to undertake risk assessments of their estates to determine if face coverings should be recommended for their staff and young people in communal areas"". ""This will also include school and college transport."" The World Health Organisation has updated its advice on face masks for young people It said that Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton had recommended face coverings ""for all members of the public over 11 years in indoor settings in which social distancing cannot be maintained, including schools and school transport"". It said face-to-face teaching without coverings can continue with social distancing. What are the rules for masks in schools? Are teachers more at risk of coronavirus? How are other countries getting children back to class? Governments in the UK have changed their guidance on face masks in schools after the World Health Organisation (WHO) said those over 12should wear masks in the same settings as adults. Teaching union NAHT Cymru said it was ""unacceptable that school leaders are expected to shoulder the responsibility of deciding if face coverings are required in schools"". ""Headteachers are not medical experts and the Welsh Government should not put them in this position,"" the union's director Laura Doel said. University and Colleges Union policy officer Jamie Insole also claimed ministers were passing the buck: ""College students are older than school pupils and ministers cannot simply try and pass on guidance for schools to colleges."" But David Evans, Wales Secretary of the National Education Union Cymru, welcomed the statement. ""To us the statement is clear - in areas where social distancing can't be maintained, face masks need to be worn by everyone over 11 years, including in schools and on school transport,"" he added. Joseph Carter, head of Asthma UK & British Lung Foundation Wales, said Wales was ""out of step with the rest of the UK"". ""Without a clear unified position, this will only lead to confusion and uncertainty for teachers, parents, and pupils,"" he said. The Welsh Government has always taken a different approach to mandating face coverings from their counterparts in the rest of the UK, and that pattern continues here. It's not clear whether leaving it to school leaders to make the decision according to the physical layout of each school will reassure parents or disturb them. With schools returning next week we'll soon find out. But different rules in different schools seems to be exactly what Labour in England doesn't like about the approach that Boris Johnson's government has taken there. Delyth Jewell, Plaid Cymru spokeswoman for the transformation of public services, said ""This is the latest example of the Welsh Government passing the buck rather than leading the way. ""It's not good enough that ministers aren't setting national policy."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said the Welsh Government announcement ""is the worst of both worlds, putting the responsibility on the shoulders of schools and councils, while trying to absolve itself of responsibility for the decision"". The way the Welsh Government publicised the decision - following the end of a day's virtual Senedd and not directly to Senedd politicians - was also criticised by the Welsh Conservatives. Vaughan Gething said a mandatory approach would not be appropriate in Wales while there were low levels of coronavirus in the country. He denied that the Welsh Government was putting the responsibility for masks on headteachers. Vaughan Gething (pictured) said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not work in Wales Speaking to the BBC News Channel, he said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not take into account differences between schools built in the last decade - which have bigger corridors - to those that are older. He added: ""In Wales, we continue to have very low transmission rates, that's why it's not appropriate for us to mandate a one-size-fits-all policy requiring face masks in every single school."" Mr Gething said there could be localised outbreaks that affect one school community but not others. The health minister agreed that schools had a ""shorter period of time than any of our schools would want"" to consider the risk assessments. ""The World Health Organisation provided their revised advice guidance within the last few days so the Welsh Government hasn't had a lot of time to consider this issue in further detail,"" he said.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has blamed a ""mutant algorithm"" for this summer's exam results fiasco. ""I am afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm and I know how stressful that must have been,"" he told pupils at a school. An algorithm - a maths calculation - was initially used to determine A-level and GCSE results this year but it was scrapped after problems emerged. The top civil servant at the Department for Educationhas also now been sacked. Jonathan Slater was due to stand down next year, but will now leave the department by next week. Read more: Chief civil servant sacked after exams row How did the exam algorithm decide grades? What went wrong with the exam algorithm? Mr Johnson made his comments about the algorithm during a visit to a secondary school in Coalville, Leicestershire, on Wednesday. The National Education Union (NEU) called Mr Johnson's comments ""brazen"" and accused him of trying to ""idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created"". The prime minister had previously defended the controversial exam results as a ""robust set of grades"". His government later made a U-turn following anger over the algorithm and decided to use predicted grades from teachers instead. Speaking to pupils earlier, Mr Johnson empathised with the problems young people had faced with their exam grades but said he was ""very, very glad that it has finally been sorted out"". Results for this year's exams were caught up in confusion The prime minister said education was the ""great liberator"" and the biggest risk for young people was not Covid-19 - but was ""continuing to be out of school"". Mr Johnson told pupils they needed to be in school to think about ideas and questions - such as ""Is Harry Potter sexist? The answer is no, by the way."" Ofqual chief steps down after exam chaos Record results for GCSE with estimated grades 'Huge mess' over exam appeals But the remarks on exam problems angered the biggest teachers' union, who saw it as evading responsibility. Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the NEU, said parents and teachers would be ""horrified to see the leader of this country treat his own exams fiasco like some minor passing fad"". ""It is certain to put a long-lasting dent in the government's reputation on education."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The exam chaos has also led to the Boris Johnson removing the most senior civil servant at the Department for Education, permanent secretary Jonathan Slater. A statement said ""the prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"" at the department. The role as the department's most senior civil servant will be taken on in an interim basis by Susan Acland-Hood. It follows theresignation of Sally Collier as head of the Ofqual exam watchdogfor England. So what does the departure of Jonathan Slater mean - and why does it matter? For his union, the FDA - and for Labour - it is straightforwardly a sign that, when things go wrong, the buck now firmly stops with the officials and not government ministers. Angry Conservative MPs were being privately reassured that ""heads would roll"" after the exams controversy - and both a senior civil servant, and the head of Ofqual, have now departed while Gavin Williamson and his education ministers remain in post. But something of a pattern is emerging. In February the most senior official at the Home Office resigned - and took the government to court claiming there had been a ""vicious and orchestrated campaign"" against him. Other senior civil servants have made less of a fuss but have nonetheless left their jobs: the most senior Whitehall mandarin - Sir Mark Sedwill - recently moved; the head of the Foreign Office announced an earlier than expected departure; and it was announced last month that the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice would be leaving, too. Cabinet office minister Michael Gove has talked about reforming the civil service - in a speech in June, he said government departments recruited in their own image and their assumptions were ""inescapably metropolitan"". So a strategic rethink and an increased turnover of senior Whitehall personnel are probably not entirely unrelated. But what might worry senior civil servants more is that they might be sacrificed for short term news management, rather than as the result of a strategic master plan. And there is a risk this, in turn, might affect the quality of those who apply for senior civil service roles. Both departures followed the high-profile problems caused by replacement grades for A-levels, GCSEs and vocational qualifications for exams cancelled in the pandemic. This focused on an ""algorithm"" which was accused of producing unfair results - which after a U-turn was replaced by teachers' estimated grades. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""It is abundantly clear that things have not gone well at the Department for Education and Ofqual, culminating in the debacle over this year's GCSE and A-level grades. ""But it is pretty unsavoury that civil servants appear to be carrying the can while ministers remain unscathed."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools.""

"Self-contained tourist accommodation was allowed to reopen on 13 July More than three-quarters of tourism businesses have reopened after lockdown but half are still not operating at full capacity, according to research. The Welsh Government survey of 801 tourism operators,externalfound the average business in the sector in Wales has lost almost half of its annual income. Almost all restaurants and campsites have reopened, but only 53% of tourism attractions are currently operating. Two-thirds of businesses still have staff on furlough. Tourism tensions 'could put industry at risk' What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Of the 22% of businesses which had not yet reopened when the survey was conducted in the first week of August, almost half said the reason was due to existing coronavirus restrictions, while a third said they had temporarily closed their business. Of those which have opened, 13% said they have had more bookings than usual for August. Just 1% of staff have been made redundant so far in the sector, but two-thirds of businesses have staff on the furlough scheme, which is due to end in October. Enjoying the beach in the sunshine at Barry Island on Sunday Tourism in Wales directly supports about 120,000 jobs - almost 10% of Wales' workforce - andcontributes 6% of all Gross Value Added to the Welsh economy,external. Across Wales, the sector is estimated to be worth more than Â£3bn - and Â£585m to the Pembrokeshire economy alone. The industry had been on course to increase its overnight spend by visitors in Wales this year by 10% compared with eight years ago. The Federation of Small Businesses Wales said it had already called on the Welsh Government to start a tourism hibernation scheme, a mix of loans and grants to tourism firms at preferential rates which would be repayable once firms were back in the profitable part of the 2021 season. Policy chairman Ben Francis said: ""With the average tourism business having lost half of its annual income, it is clear that the concerns of these seasonal businesses facing three consecutive winters is beginning to be borne out in many places. ""Unless significant measures are now taken to support this industry, then it is clear that there could be difficult decisions ahead for many small firms."" With quarantines introduced for holiday makers who return to the UK from a host of popular resorts abroad, it's not surprising that more people have been staying in the UK and tourism businesses in Wales are very busy. As we can see from this survey some are more busy than usual but it does follow four months of being shut because of lockdown. More alarmingly, when asked how much income they have lost because of the pandemic, the average loss was equivalent to nearly half their usual annual income. Accommodation and food businesses have had the highest proportion of workers furloughed - the Job Retention Scheme introduced by the UK government to encourage employers to hold on to staff. Three-quarters of the 801 businesses surveyed for this report have furloughed staff and only a handful of employees have been made redundant. The scheme is planned to finish at the end of October although Chancellor Rishi Sunak is under pressure to extend it. It's too early to tell how many of those furloughed employees in tourism will have a job to go back to when the scheme finally ends.

"A mistake in a spreadsheet set in motion a series of events that delayed the opening of a Â£150m hospital, a new report has revealed. Last-minute issues with ventilationprevented the opening of Edinburgh's new children's hospitallast July. An NHS Lothian-commissioned review found a ""human error"" in a 2012 spreadsheet with the specifications for air flow in critical care rooms. The mistake was missed in what auditors describe as a ""collective failure"". It was only when the hospital had been handed over to NHS Lothian, andÂ£1.4m monthly repayments had started, that independent checks found the critical care rooms were operating with the wrong air flow. Remedial work worth Â£16m has since been carried out and the new Sick Kids building started hosting outpatient appointments in July. But the hospital's full opening date, previously pencilled in for the autumn, is under review in light of the coronavirus crisis. NHS Lothian said it had already made a number of the recommendations for improvement in the report to ""ensure that future capital projects will benefit"". Apublic inquiry into the issues at the Sick Kids hospitaland Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus in Glasgow is also under way. Millions paid out for unused Sick Children's Hospital in Edinburgh Thousands of building snags found at unusable hospital Health boss 'dumbfounded' by hospital's woes NHS Lothian asked audit firm Grant Thornton toconduct a review of the health board's role in the Sick Kids project,,externalthe first NHS hospital to be built using the Scottish government's private financing model known as Non-Profit Distribution (NPD). The new hospital will provide care for children and young people NHS Lothian set the requirements for the hospital but private consortium IHSL designed, built, and financed the facility in a deal which over the next 25 years, including maintenance and facilities management fees, will cost Â£432m. The Grant Thornton review concluded there was ""collective failure from the parties involved"" and that it was ""not possible to identify one single event which resulted in the errors"". The crux of the Sick Kids saga is that the hospital's critical care rooms need 10 air changes per hour to comply with ventilation guidelines designed to control infections. Complying with these guidelines was in the project contract but the critical care rooms were completed with a ventilation system that only did four air changes per hour. The Grant Thornton report spells out how this oversight was not spotted. A spreadsheet called the ""environmental matrix"" and dated from 2012 contained the ""four air changes"" error for critical care. The Grant Thornton report states: ""This looks to be, based on our review, human error in copying across the four-bedded room generic ventilation criteria into the critical care room detail"". None of the independent contractors involved in the matrix picked up on the oversight The environmental matrix was then included in the 2013 tendering process where three firms were bidding to build the hospital. One of the three bidders submitted a revised environmental matrix with the correct air changes for critical care but they did not win the contract and the correction was not picked up on by the team evaluating the bids In 2019a contract row between NHS Lothian and IHSLwas settled for Â£11.9m amidst concerns about the consortium's cash flow, according to the report. However, this ""cemented the error contractually"" because the ""four air changes"" error for critical care was written into this deal Another error in the environmental matrix, the inclusion of en-suite bathrooms in critical care, was spotted in 2016 but the air changes mistake was not identified at this stage An independent tester appointed by both sides ""did not identify the non-compliance with the guidance within critical care"", according to the report The Grant Thornton report cites the complexity of the project as being a big factor in its repeated problems. It notes the new hospital was switched from a traditionally financed project to the NPD model in 2010, adding ""NHS Lothian were not consulted on the change in funding model in advance of the decision being taken"". This move came after four years of work by NHS Lothian on the project. The health board handed over its work to potential bidders to try and speed up the procurement process but made clear the responsibility for the design and build would be with the winning consortium. But the move, approved by the Scottish government, created ""potential ambiguity"" over design requirements, according to the report. Former NHS Lothian chief executive Tim Davison previously said a collective failure of ""many senior and expert staff"" was behind the delays to the new hospital Calum Campbell, chief executive of NHS Lothian, praised the extent of analysis in the review given the ""complex and significant"" range of documentation associated with the 12-year-old project. He said: ""Recommendations in relation to decision making, clarity, clinical engagement and involvement of external advisers have been made. ""Some areas identified have already been addressed and others will be implemented within the agreed timeframes to ensure that future capital projects will benefit. ""The Department of Clinical Neurosciences and children's outpatient services have already settled into their new home and we are looking forward to the full opening as soon as possible."" In a statement, the Scottish government said the safety and well-being of patients and their families was their top priority and should be the ""primary consideration in all NHS construction projects"". ""A public inquiry is under way to help us understand the issues that affected both the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus site in Glasgow and the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People and Department of Clinical Neurosciences site in Edinburgh. ""It will also make recommendations to ensure that any past mistakes are not repeated in future NHS infrastructure projects.""

"DIY beauty trends popular on TikTok could be dangerous and harmful, healthcare groups have warned. Examples include applying bleach to whiten teeth, removing moles at home, and using eyelash glue to make lips appear larger, BBC News has discovered. When these videos went viral, they encouraged others to copy the so-called ""beauty hacks"", which could cause permanent harm, the groups warned. TikTok told BBC News the videos did not violate its community guidelines. However, the British Association of Dermatologists, the British Dental Association and the British Skin Foundation - who viewed the videos - have today issued warnings about copying these treatments on social media. ""It is important to remind people that social media should not be used as a primary source for dermatology issues,"" Dr Anjali Mahto spokesperson for the British Association of Dermatologists said. ""When it comes to skin, it can lead to unnecessary fear or panic where it is not needed, wasting of resources such as money on products unable to treat medical problems, potential delay in treatment, as well as potentially worsening one's psychological health. A government spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was ""concerned by reports of dangerous and misleading cosmetic beauty 'hacks' circulating on social media."" Some videos the BBC saw promote using chemical or physical ways to remove moles. Experts advise all moles bechecked by a professional before removal. ""There is no 'safe' way to remove a mole at home,"" Dr Ross Perry, NHS GP and medical director of Cosmedics skin clinics, said. ""This needs to be done by a qualified doctor or dermatologist who is trained and knows what they are doing. ""Using chemicals or attempting to 'scrape' off a mole could lead to infections, bleeding, scarring and deformity of the area."" This video can not be played Experts warn of the potential for blindness and other side-effects One peculiar method recommends applying eyelash glue to skin. British Skin Foundation spokesman consultant dermatologist Dr Adil Sheraz said doing so to create a plumping effect could lead to scarring or permanent disfigurement. ""Eyelash glue contains cyanoacrylate which is known to be a contact allergen,"" he said. ""Applying a potentially allergenic chemical to lips could result in a severe reaction."" Meanwhile, some cosmetic surgeons told BBC News they had also seen social-media videos of at-home Botox or lip-filler kits. TikTok videos with the hashtag ""teethwhitening"" have amassed about 284 million views. Some recommend applying bleach to teeth, to avoid ""expensive"" over-the-counter treatments. Under UK law,teeth-whitening products can be sold directly to the public only if they contain no more than 0.1% hydrogen peroxide. And anything above this level should supplied, or used, under the supervision of a dentist. This video can not be played There are warnings that some online teeth whitening kits are dangerous, as Nick Beake reports Household bleaches may also contain other bleaching compounds. The British Dental Association said administering the wrong products at home could cause ""permanent damage."" ""The BDA is concerned about the DIY trend to whiten teeth with levels of hydrogen peroxide that are higher than that permitted in over-the-counter products,"" a representative said. ""Using higher concentrations unsupervised, as some videos advocate, raises the risk of damage to teeth and gums, including burns to the mouth, tooth and gum sensitivity, as well as irritated or inflamed gums."" One viral video copied throughout TikTok suggests a way of applying sun cream to create a contour affect. ""Skin cancers affect all areas of the face,"" Dr Vishal Madan, of Stratum Dermatology Clinics, said. ""Using sunscreen on certain areas and missing others to create a pattern may be trendy - but the UV damage to the tanned area will invariably increase the risk of skin cancers in that site. ""Not only that, repeated exposure to UV light in these areas will make them age prematurely, so, in time, the skin will appear mottled and uneven."" Some cosmetic-mask treatments promoted in TikTok videos could also be harmful, Adonia Medical Clinic founder and medical director Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme said. ""It is dangerous to put citrus fruits on to the skin and then go into the sun,"" she said. ""It can cause inflammation of the skin expressed in burning, redness and blisters."" The BBC shared these videos with medical experts and TikTok, but the firm said these videos did not break their rules. ""Keeping people on TikTok safe is a top priority,"" a representative added. ""Our community guidelines make clear that we will remove content promoting dangerous behaviour or activities that might lead to serious injury or physical harm. ""We are continuously evaluating our policies and processes to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep our users safe.""

Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Washington DC Weâve been in Johnstown, Pennsylvania - what has become the heart of Trump country. For generations, this historic steel town reliably voted for Democrats - but that all changed with President Trumpâs surprise victory here in 2016. Jackie Kulback, a local Republican official, said before Trump, the Republican party âwas really good at losing.â But now, theyâve had to add extra hours to the local party headquarters to accommodate the surge in voter interest and enthusiasm. Construction company owner James Vasilko says ""there's no way"" Joe Biden will win And that same surge is also dramatically reshaping the stateâs political landscape. In the last year alone, election officials here said more than 47,000 voters have changed their registration from Democrat to Republican - a permanent sign of support for Trump. And though the president may be behind in national polls, his support here appears to be undimmed. âIt used to be the building unions, the working man, were all Democrats,â said James Vasilko, a proud Republican who owns a local construction company. âNow, the working guys realise what President Trump has done for all of us.â Campaigning is fierce in Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016 by less than a 1% margin Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by an incredibly narrow margin - less than one percent. And though Pennsylvania is former Vice-President Joe Bidenâs home state, this small rust belt city is brimming with confidence about Trumpâs chances in November. Mr Vasilko said, âI do not think there's any possible way that the Biden/Harris ticket can win.â Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played For three and a half years, Vice-President Mike Pence has been Donald Trumpâs most loyal sidekick â extolling his virtues and executing his directives. On Wednesday night, Penceâs mission was to pitch for the presidentâs re-election by touting his accomplishments, attacking his Democratic opponent and trying to reframe his sometimes sharp edges as an asset, not a shortcoming. âHeâs certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly heâs kept his word,â he said. Pence, like many of the Republicans this week, had to perform a delicate dance â talking up the presidentâs record, and then explaining the turmoil that has hit the nation in the past six months. Pence tried to cast this âtime of testing,â as he put it, in the best light. âWe are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives, and we are opening up American again,â he said. Pence drew a sharp contrast with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, who he said would âset America on a path of socialism and declineâ. âYou wonât be safe in Joe Bidenâs America,â Pence added, in case his point wasnât clear. And in a line that some will find patriotic and others will view as a racially tinged dog-whistle, he said: âThe choice in this election is whether America remains America."" The Democrats and the Republicans over the past two weeks have shared decidedly different views of what is right â and wrong â with America today. In 69 days, voters will have a chance to register their opinion, as well. Mr Trump mingled with supporters after Pence spoke President Trump, who is not slated to speak until he gives his speech on Thursday accepting the Republican nomination, has just taken the stage. After he arrives with First Lady Melania Trump to the sound of ""Hail to the Chief"", country star Trace Atkins begins singing the US national anthem. The First and Second couples then mingled with supporters from behind a short divider and took selfies. The live feed of the event showed very few people wearing masks, and Pence fist-bumping with some people in the crowd. In a word: no. That's despite a claim from Vice-President Pence this evening. Pence said that Joe Biden ""has pledged to defund the police"". Adovcates of ""defunding"" want police departments' budgets to be slashed and the funds diverted to social programmes. But in an interview with CBS News in June, Joe Biden (the Democratic presidential nominee) said: ""I don't support defunding the policeâ. Instead, Mr Biden is backing police reform.
He has said: ""The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms"". He has pledged to devote $300m to community policing. Vice-President Mike Pence was one of the few speakers tonight to address the pandemic. He praised President Trump for suspending all travel from China at the end of January after the first coronavirus case was reported in the US. ""That action saved an untold number of American lives. And bought us time to launch the greatest national mobilisation since World War 2,"" he told supporters. While Pence went on to tout a partnership with private industry to ""reinvent testing"", critics say any time that travel ban bought was quickly wasted because of a series of errors and inaction. In this video, we explored the lost six weeks that allowed the virus to spread across the country. This video can not be played Pence has demanded law and order in his speech from Baltimore. ""Let me be clear: the violence must stop - whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha,"" he says, referring to the protests that have erupted just this past week in Kenosha in the wake ofanother police killing of a black man. ""Too many heroes have died defending our freedoms to see Americans
strike each other down. ""We will have law and order on the streets of America. ""We're not going to defund police. Not now. Not ever,"" he adds. Here's what Joe Biden had to say about the protests in an interview earlier today: ""Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary. But burning down communities is not protest, it's needless violence. Violence that endangers lives. ""That's wrong,"" he added. Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent If the past is the prologue to the future then
four more years of President Trump will be four more years of âAmerica firstâ;
four more years of the weakening of the international order; and four more
years of incoherence and bluster in US foreign policy. Beyond the meandering tweet storms, nothing has emerged that you could really call a Trump doctrine. Opposition to Americaâs âforever warsâ is popular at home and a second Trump
term could see US troops withdrawn from a number of trouble spots. Pressure on US
allies in crude terms, to âpay their wayâ, will continue. But the question
remains: does this strengthen or weaken alliances upon which the US depends for
its preeminent place on the global stage? Policy towards Russia and, crucially, China may continue to lack any real guiding principle. 'Strategic rivalry' may
grow, but Washingtonâs overall position may become weaker. Trumpâs first
term has been good for the strong men and despots of global politics. There
seems no reason that this should change during his second.  According to Pence, Trump has ""stood up to our enemies and weâve stood with our allies"". Under Trump's leadership, he says, ""American armed forces took the last inch of Isis territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty."" Pence paints a contrast to Trump's Democratic rival, Joe Biden, saying that Biden opposed the operation that took down Osama Bin Laden, conducted under the Obama administration. This account has been disputed by Biden, who has insisted he expressed scepticism, but ultimately supported Obama's decision. Pence goes further - repeating a claim from the memoir of Obama-era secretary of defence Bob Gates, that Biden had ""been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". Pence is describing the president as a man that fights back in the face of critics. ""For the last four years, I
have watched this president endure unrelenting attacks and get up
every day and fight to keep the promises he made to the American people,"" he says. He notes that under Trump, territories under control of the terror group Isis - a group he points out once controlled ""a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania"" - were taken back. Trump ""sees America for what it
is; a nation that has done more good in this world than any other,"" he says. It is ""a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. And if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted,
then heâs not your man,"" he says. The vice-president has stepped out at Fort McHenry to chants of ""four more years"" from a small crowd, spaced apart for social distancing. Flanked by over a dozen US flags, Pence speaks of his 'gratitude for the confidence the president has placed in me,' as he accepts the nomination for the Trump-Pence 2020 Republican ticket. A visibly emotional Karen Pence sits in the audience next to some of the Pence children, and the vice-president's mother is there as well. He jokes: 'Sometimes I actually think I'm her second favourite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket'. Vice-president Mike Pence takes to the stage at historic Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He begins by noting how the fort withstood a British onslaught 206 years ago, and criticising Democrats for ""attacking America"" at their party convention last week. There are a lot of high-profile Republicans speaking tonight, and many of them have referenced the 19th amendment in the United States - ratified 100 years ago, it granted women the right to vote. What do American voters think of this historic anniversary? The BBCâs Shrai Popat asked a number of women running for office. Texan Beth Van Duyne, a candidate for Congress, said: ""I think about how far we have come,"" Van Duyne said. ""It's incredibly humbling to be one of the record number of Republican women running for Congress this year."" Read more about what some female candidates - both Republican and Democrat - think about what has been achieved and what is left to do. What kind of vice-president is Mike Pence? On the one hand, he does a lot of the typical tasks associated with
modern VPs like the advising, the communications, the weekly lunch with the
president and the foreign travel, says Joel Goldstein, a professor of law at St
Louis University who has written books about the vice-presidency. But on the other hand, Pence has the unique challenge of deputising for a
president who is like no other. That means he often finds himself
cleaning up a controversy, saying Donald Trump hasnât said what heâs said, and
rephrasing it. But whereas all VPs end up being salespeople for the president, Pence
has taken that to new levels, says Mr Goldstein. âHe says President Trump is
going to be the best friend the military has ever had, things like that. There
are no limits on the bounds of his praise for the president.â Perhaps Pence would act differently if he was serving under one of the
Bushes or another Republican president, he adds. Trump is a man who doesnât
like to be challenged. âHe wants to have people sit there in a public meeting singing his
praises, and Pence has been willing to do that. But when you do that, it
demeans the vice-president and also demeans the office.â Mike Pence: From Indiana to the White House Lara Trump made an eyebrow raising claim in her speech just now, when she said Mr Trump appointed the ""secretary of the United Nations"". ""It didnât surprise me when President Donald Trump appointed
the most women to senior level positions of any administration in history,"" she said. ""The
Secretary of the United Nations, Secretary of the Air Force, the first female
CIA Director..."" The UN general secretary is appointed by the UN General Assembly members, not the US president. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher has confirmed that President Trump has just arrived at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where he is apparently accompanying his vice-president, Mike Pence, who is due to give a keynote speech there within the next 45 minutes. Lara Trump - Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and an adviser to the president's re-election team - is up now. The mother-of-two has been married to Trump's second son, Eric Trump, since 2014. And since joining the Trump family, the 37-year-old has proven to be a loyal supporter of the elder Trump's political career. During the 2016 election, she led the Trump-Pence Women's Empowerment tour, a role she has reprised the second time around. Lara Trump has established herself as a top spokesperson for the president, traveling around the country and holding ""MAGA mommy"" gatherings as part of the ""Women for Trump"" initiative. It's a crucial role: white suburban women were key to delivering the White House to Trump in 2016, and he'll need that support again. She has promised to keep a ""hopeful and inspirational and patriotic"" tone at tonight's event. We've also heard from Madison
Cawthorn, a congressional candidate from North Carolina, running for his first term this November. If he wins, the 25-year-old would be the youngest congressman elected in over 200 years. Cawthorn had his athletic dreams derailed after a car accident left him paralysed. Sitting in a wheelchair, the young Republican made a charismatic pitch for his own candidacy as he also gave his support to Trump. ""I was given a one percent chance of surviving. Thanks to the power of prayer, a loving community, and skilled doctors, I made it,"" he said. ""At 20, I thought about giving up. However, I knew I could still make a difference,"" he says. ""In 2020, our country has a choice. We can give up on the American idea, or we can work together to make our imperfect union more perfect."" ""While the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trumpâs leadership, want to rebuild, restore and renew."" He capped his appearance by standing up, with the aid of a support, from his chair, in what will surely be a re-played moment from the convention. His is an important pitch: support from young people like Cawthorn is currently lacking for President Trump. A poll from the Harvard Kennedy School in April showed 18- to 29-year-olds supporting Democratic candidate Joe Biden by a margin of 23 points. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Being obese doubles the risk of hospital treatment from Covid-19 and increases the risk of dying by nearly 50%, a global analysis suggests. Obesity makes other diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure more likely, the US researchers say. Along with a weakened immune system, this can make these individuals more vulnerable to severe Covid-19. They also warn a vaccine against coronavirus could be less effective in obese people. This is based on the fact that flu vaccines don't work as well in those with a body mass index (BMI) of over 30. The team, from the University of North Carolina,looked at data from 75 studies,externalfrom around the world for their research, including nearly 400,000 patients. They found that people with obesity and Covid-19 were twice as likely to end up in hospital and 74% more likely to be admitted to intensive care. They were also more at risk of dying from the disease caused by coronavirus. Studies from the UK have shown similar risks for people carrying excess weight, prompting the government to introducenew measures to curb obesity. Obesity increases risks from Covid-19, experts say Has coronavirus exposed our underlying ill health? How bad is our obesity problem? Professor Barry Popkin, who led the study from the department of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, said the increased risks of being obese and having Covid-19 were ""much higher than expected"". He said healthier eating had to be a priority in many countries, with fewer sugary drinks and much less junk and processed food in people's diets. Obesity is linked to a number of diseases which also put people at higher risk of being ill with Covid-19. It can also lead to more inflammation in the body, reduce the body's ability to fight off infections and put more strain on other organs, as well as the breathing. ""Vaccine researchers should look at how it affects obese individuals,"" Prof Popkin says ofa coronavirus vaccine to protect against Covid-19. He is concerned that a vaccine, when it is ready to be used, may be less effective in a population with a high percentage of people with obesity. With obesity rising around the world and 20% of people overweight or obese in nearly all countries - in the UK and US it's close to 66% - understanding how treatments and vaccines work in this group is ""critical"", the research says.

Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Washington DC Weâve been in Johnstown, Pennsylvania - what has become the heart of Trump country. For generations, this historic steel town reliably voted for Democrats - but that all changed with President Trumpâs surprise victory here in 2016. Jackie Kulback, a local Republican official, said before Trump, the Republican party âwas really good at losing.â But now, theyâve had to add extra hours to the local party headquarters to accommodate the surge in voter interest and enthusiasm. Construction company owner James Vasilko says ""there's no way"" Joe Biden will win And that same surge is also dramatically reshaping the stateâs political landscape. In the last year alone, election officials here said more than 47,000 voters have changed their registration from Democrat to Republican - a permanent sign of support for Trump. And though the president may be behind in national polls, his support here appears to be undimmed. âIt used to be the building unions, the working man, were all Democrats,â said James Vasilko, a proud Republican who owns a local construction company. âNow, the working guys realise what President Trump has done for all of us.â Campaigning is fierce in Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016 by less than a 1% margin Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by an incredibly narrow margin - less than one percent. And though Pennsylvania is former Vice-President Joe Bidenâs home state, this small rust belt city is brimming with confidence about Trumpâs chances in November. Mr Vasilko said, âI do not think there's any possible way that the Biden/Harris ticket can win.â Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played For three and a half years, Vice-President Mike Pence has been Donald Trumpâs most loyal sidekick â extolling his virtues and executing his directives. On Wednesday night, Penceâs mission was to pitch for the presidentâs re-election by touting his accomplishments, attacking his Democratic opponent and trying to reframe his sometimes sharp edges as an asset, not a shortcoming. âHeâs certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly heâs kept his word,â he said. Pence, like many of the Republicans this week, had to perform a delicate dance â talking up the presidentâs record, and then explaining the turmoil that has hit the nation in the past six months. Pence tried to cast this âtime of testing,â as he put it, in the best light. âWe are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives, and we are opening up American again,â he said. Pence drew a sharp contrast with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, who he said would âset America on a path of socialism and declineâ. âYou wonât be safe in Joe Bidenâs America,â Pence added, in case his point wasnât clear. And in a line that some will find patriotic and others will view as a racially tinged dog-whistle, he said: âThe choice in this election is whether America remains America."" The Democrats and the Republicans over the past two weeks have shared decidedly different views of what is right â and wrong â with America today. In 69 days, voters will have a chance to register their opinion, as well. Mr Trump mingled with supporters after Pence spoke President Trump, who is not slated to speak until he gives his speech on Thursday accepting the Republican nomination, has just taken the stage. After he arrives with First Lady Melania Trump to the sound of ""Hail to the Chief"", country star Trace Atkins begins singing the US national anthem. The First and Second couples then mingled with supporters from behind a short divider and took selfies. The live feed of the event showed very few people wearing masks, and Pence fist-bumping with some people in the crowd. In a word: no. That's despite a claim from Vice-President Pence this evening. Pence said that Joe Biden ""has pledged to defund the police"". Adovcates of ""defunding"" want police departments' budgets to be slashed and the funds diverted to social programmes. But in an interview with CBS News in June, Joe Biden (the Democratic presidential nominee) said: ""I don't support defunding the policeâ. Instead, Mr Biden is backing police reform.
He has said: ""The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms"". He has pledged to devote $300m to community policing. Vice-President Mike Pence was one of the few speakers tonight to address the pandemic. He praised President Trump for suspending all travel from China at the end of January after the first coronavirus case was reported in the US. ""That action saved an untold number of American lives. And bought us time to launch the greatest national mobilisation since World War 2,"" he told supporters. While Pence went on to tout a partnership with private industry to ""reinvent testing"", critics say any time that travel ban bought was quickly wasted because of a series of errors and inaction. In this video, we explored the lost six weeks that allowed the virus to spread across the country. This video can not be played Pence has demanded law and order in his speech from Baltimore. ""Let me be clear: the violence must stop - whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha,"" he says, referring to the protests that have erupted just this past week in Kenosha in the wake ofanother police killing of a black man. ""Too many heroes have died defending our freedoms to see Americans
strike each other down. ""We will have law and order on the streets of America. ""We're not going to defund police. Not now. Not ever,"" he adds. Here's what Joe Biden had to say about the protests in an interview earlier today: ""Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary. But burning down communities is not protest, it's needless violence. Violence that endangers lives. ""That's wrong,"" he added. Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent If the past is the prologue to the future then
four more years of President Trump will be four more years of âAmerica firstâ;
four more years of the weakening of the international order; and four more
years of incoherence and bluster in US foreign policy. Beyond the meandering tweet storms, nothing has emerged that you could really call a Trump doctrine. Opposition to Americaâs âforever warsâ is popular at home and a second Trump
term could see US troops withdrawn from a number of trouble spots. Pressure on US
allies in crude terms, to âpay their wayâ, will continue. But the question
remains: does this strengthen or weaken alliances upon which the US depends for
its preeminent place on the global stage? Policy towards Russia and, crucially, China may continue to lack any real guiding principle. 'Strategic rivalry' may
grow, but Washingtonâs overall position may become weaker. Trumpâs first
term has been good for the strong men and despots of global politics. There
seems no reason that this should change during his second.  According to Pence, Trump has ""stood up to our enemies and weâve stood with our allies"". Under Trump's leadership, he says, ""American armed forces took the last inch of Isis territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty."" Pence paints a contrast to Trump's Democratic rival, Joe Biden, saying that Biden opposed the operation that took down Osama Bin Laden, conducted under the Obama administration. This account has been disputed by Biden, who has insisted he expressed scepticism, but ultimately supported Obama's decision. Pence goes further - repeating a claim from the memoir of Obama-era secretary of defence Bob Gates, that Biden had ""been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". Pence is describing the president as a man that fights back in the face of critics. ""For the last four years, I
have watched this president endure unrelenting attacks and get up
every day and fight to keep the promises he made to the American people,"" he says. He notes that under Trump, territories under control of the terror group Isis - a group he points out once controlled ""a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania"" - were taken back. Trump ""sees America for what it
is; a nation that has done more good in this world than any other,"" he says. It is ""a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. And if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted,
then heâs not your man,"" he says. The vice-president has stepped out at Fort McHenry to chants of ""four more years"" from a small crowd, spaced apart for social distancing. Flanked by over a dozen US flags, Pence speaks of his 'gratitude for the confidence the president has placed in me,' as he accepts the nomination for the Trump-Pence 2020 Republican ticket. A visibly emotional Karen Pence sits in the audience next to some of the Pence children, and the vice-president's mother is there as well. He jokes: 'Sometimes I actually think I'm her second favourite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket'. Vice-president Mike Pence takes to the stage at historic Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He begins by noting how the fort withstood a British onslaught 206 years ago, and criticising Democrats for ""attacking America"" at their party convention last week. There are a lot of high-profile Republicans speaking tonight, and many of them have referenced the 19th amendment in the United States - ratified 100 years ago, it granted women the right to vote. What do American voters think of this historic anniversary? The BBCâs Shrai Popat asked a number of women running for office. Texan Beth Van Duyne, a candidate for Congress, said: ""I think about how far we have come,"" Van Duyne said. ""It's incredibly humbling to be one of the record number of Republican women running for Congress this year."" Read more about what some female candidates - both Republican and Democrat - think about what has been achieved and what is left to do. What kind of vice-president is Mike Pence? On the one hand, he does a lot of the typical tasks associated with
modern VPs like the advising, the communications, the weekly lunch with the
president and the foreign travel, says Joel Goldstein, a professor of law at St
Louis University who has written books about the vice-presidency. But on the other hand, Pence has the unique challenge of deputising for a
president who is like no other. That means he often finds himself
cleaning up a controversy, saying Donald Trump hasnât said what heâs said, and
rephrasing it. But whereas all VPs end up being salespeople for the president, Pence
has taken that to new levels, says Mr Goldstein. âHe says President Trump is
going to be the best friend the military has ever had, things like that. There
are no limits on the bounds of his praise for the president.â Perhaps Pence would act differently if he was serving under one of the
Bushes or another Republican president, he adds. Trump is a man who doesnât
like to be challenged. âHe wants to have people sit there in a public meeting singing his
praises, and Pence has been willing to do that. But when you do that, it
demeans the vice-president and also demeans the office.â Mike Pence: From Indiana to the White House Lara Trump made an eyebrow raising claim in her speech just now, when she said Mr Trump appointed the ""secretary of the United Nations"". ""It didnât surprise me when President Donald Trump appointed
the most women to senior level positions of any administration in history,"" she said. ""The
Secretary of the United Nations, Secretary of the Air Force, the first female
CIA Director..."" The UN general secretary is appointed by the UN General Assembly members, not the US president. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher has confirmed that President Trump has just arrived at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where he is apparently accompanying his vice-president, Mike Pence, who is due to give a keynote speech there within the next 45 minutes. Lara Trump - Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and an adviser to the president's re-election team - is up now. The mother-of-two has been married to Trump's second son, Eric Trump, since 2014. And since joining the Trump family, the 37-year-old has proven to be a loyal supporter of the elder Trump's political career. During the 2016 election, she led the Trump-Pence Women's Empowerment tour, a role she has reprised the second time around. Lara Trump has established herself as a top spokesperson for the president, traveling around the country and holding ""MAGA mommy"" gatherings as part of the ""Women for Trump"" initiative. It's a crucial role: white suburban women were key to delivering the White House to Trump in 2016, and he'll need that support again. She has promised to keep a ""hopeful and inspirational and patriotic"" tone at tonight's event. We've also heard from Madison
Cawthorn, a congressional candidate from North Carolina, running for his first term this November. If he wins, the 25-year-old would be the youngest congressman elected in over 200 years. Cawthorn had his athletic dreams derailed after a car accident left him paralysed. Sitting in a wheelchair, the young Republican made a charismatic pitch for his own candidacy as he also gave his support to Trump. ""I was given a one percent chance of surviving. Thanks to the power of prayer, a loving community, and skilled doctors, I made it,"" he said. ""At 20, I thought about giving up. However, I knew I could still make a difference,"" he says. ""In 2020, our country has a choice. We can give up on the American idea, or we can work together to make our imperfect union more perfect."" ""While the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trumpâs leadership, want to rebuild, restore and renew."" He capped his appearance by standing up, with the aid of a support, from his chair, in what will surely be a re-played moment from the convention. His is an important pitch: support from young people like Cawthorn is currently lacking for President Trump.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has blamed a ""mutant algorithm"" for this summer's exam results fiasco. ""I am afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm and I know how stressful that must have been,"" he told pupils at a school. An algorithm - a maths calculation - was initially used to determine A-level and GCSE results this year but it was scrapped after problems emerged. The top civil servant at the Department for Educationhas also now been sacked. Jonathan Slater was due to stand down next year, but will now leave the department by next week. Read more: Chief civil servant sacked after exams row How did the exam algorithm decide grades? What went wrong with the exam algorithm? Mr Johnson made his comments about the algorithm during a visit to a secondary school in Coalville, Leicestershire, on Wednesday. The National Education Union (NEU) called Mr Johnson's comments ""brazen"" and accused him of trying to ""idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created"". The prime minister had previously defended the controversial exam results as a ""robust set of grades"". His government later made a U-turn following anger over the algorithm and decided to use predicted grades from teachers instead. Speaking to pupils earlier, Mr Johnson empathised with the problems young people had faced with their exam grades but said he was ""very, very glad that it has finally been sorted out"". Results for this year's exams were caught up in confusion The prime minister said education was the ""great liberator"" and the biggest risk for young people was not Covid-19 - but was ""continuing to be out of school"". Mr Johnson told pupils they needed to be in school to think about ideas and questions - such as ""Is Harry Potter sexist? The answer is no, by the way."" Ofqual chief steps down after exam chaos Record results for GCSE with estimated grades 'Huge mess' over exam appeals But the remarks on exam problems angered the biggest teachers' union, who saw it as evading responsibility. Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the NEU, said parents and teachers would be ""horrified to see the leader of this country treat his own exams fiasco like some minor passing fad"". ""It is certain to put a long-lasting dent in the government's reputation on education."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The exam chaos has also led to the Boris Johnson removing the most senior civil servant at the Department for Education, permanent secretary Jonathan Slater. A statement said ""the prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"" at the department. The role as the department's most senior civil servant will be taken on in an interim basis by Susan Acland-Hood. It follows theresignation of Sally Collier as head of the Ofqual exam watchdogfor England. So what does the departure of Jonathan Slater mean - and why does it matter? For his union, the FDA - and for Labour - it is straightforwardly a sign that, when things go wrong, the buck now firmly stops with the officials and not government ministers. Angry Conservative MPs were being privately reassured that ""heads would roll"" after the exams controversy - and both a senior civil servant, and the head of Ofqual, have now departed while Gavin Williamson and his education ministers remain in post. But something of a pattern is emerging. In February the most senior official at the Home Office resigned - and took the government to court claiming there had been a ""vicious and orchestrated campaign"" against him. Other senior civil servants have made less of a fuss but have nonetheless left their jobs: the most senior Whitehall mandarin - Sir Mark Sedwill - recently moved; the head of the Foreign Office announced an earlier than expected departure; and it was announced last month that the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice would be leaving, too. Cabinet office minister Michael Gove has talked about reforming the civil service - in a speech in June, he said government departments recruited in their own image and their assumptions were ""inescapably metropolitan"". So a strategic rethink and an increased turnover of senior Whitehall personnel are probably not entirely unrelated. But what might worry senior civil servants more is that they might be sacrificed for short term news management, rather than as the result of a strategic master plan. And there is a risk this, in turn, might affect the quality of those who apply for senior civil service roles. Both departures followed the high-profile problems caused by replacement grades for A-levels, GCSEs and vocational qualifications for exams cancelled in the pandemic. This focused on an ""algorithm"" which was accused of producing unfair results - which after a U-turn was replaced by teachers' estimated grades. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""It is abundantly clear that things have not gone well at the Department for Education and Ofqual, culminating in the debacle over this year's GCSE and A-level grades. ""But it is pretty unsavoury that civil servants appear to be carrying the can while ministers remain unscathed."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools.""

Chelsea BaileyBBC News, Washington DC Weâve been in Johnstown, Pennsylvania - what has become the heart of Trump country. For generations, this historic steel town reliably voted for Democrats - but that all changed with President Trumpâs surprise victory here in 2016. Jackie Kulback, a local Republican official, said before Trump, the Republican party âwas really good at losing.â But now, theyâve had to add extra hours to the local party headquarters to accommodate the surge in voter interest and enthusiasm. Construction company owner James Vasilko says ""there's no way"" Joe Biden will win And that same surge is also dramatically reshaping the stateâs political landscape. In the last year alone, election officials here said more than 47,000 voters have changed their registration from Democrat to Republican - a permanent sign of support for Trump. And though the president may be behind in national polls, his support here appears to be undimmed. âIt used to be the building unions, the working man, were all Democrats,â said James Vasilko, a proud Republican who owns a local construction company. âNow, the working guys realise what President Trump has done for all of us.â Campaigning is fierce in Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2016 by less than a 1% margin Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by an incredibly narrow margin - less than one percent. And though Pennsylvania is former Vice-President Joe Bidenâs home state, this small rust belt city is brimming with confidence about Trumpâs chances in November. Mr Vasilko said, âI do not think there's any possible way that the Biden/Harris ticket can win.â Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter This video can not be played For three and a half years, Vice-President Mike Pence has been Donald Trumpâs most loyal sidekick â extolling his virtues and executing his directives. On Wednesday night, Penceâs mission was to pitch for the presidentâs re-election by touting his accomplishments, attacking his Democratic opponent and trying to reframe his sometimes sharp edges as an asset, not a shortcoming. âHeâs certainly kept things interesting, but more importantly heâs kept his word,â he said. Pence, like many of the Republicans this week, had to perform a delicate dance â talking up the presidentâs record, and then explaining the turmoil that has hit the nation in the past six months. Pence tried to cast this âtime of testing,â as he put it, in the best light. âWe are slowing the spread, we are protecting the vulnerable, we are saving lives, and we are opening up American again,â he said. Pence drew a sharp contrast with the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, who he said would âset America on a path of socialism and declineâ. âYou wonât be safe in Joe Bidenâs America,â Pence added, in case his point wasnât clear. And in a line that some will find patriotic and others will view as a racially tinged dog-whistle, he said: âThe choice in this election is whether America remains America."" The Democrats and the Republicans over the past two weeks have shared decidedly different views of what is right â and wrong â with America today. In 69 days, voters will have a chance to register their opinion, as well. Mr Trump mingled with supporters after Pence spoke President Trump, who is not slated to speak until he gives his speech on Thursday accepting the Republican nomination, has just taken the stage. After he arrives with First Lady Melania Trump to the sound of ""Hail to the Chief"", country star Trace Atkins begins singing the US national anthem. The First and Second couples then mingled with supporters from behind a short divider and took selfies. The live feed of the event showed very few people wearing masks, and Pence fist-bumping with some people in the crowd. In a word: no. That's despite a claim from Vice-President Pence this evening. Pence said that Joe Biden ""has pledged to defund the police"". Adovcates of ""defunding"" want police departments' budgets to be slashed and the funds diverted to social programmes. But in an interview with CBS News in June, Joe Biden (the Democratic presidential nominee) said: ""I don't support defunding the policeâ. Instead, Mr Biden is backing police reform.
He has said: ""The better answer is to give police departments the resources they need to implement meaningful reforms, and to condition other federal dollars on completing those reforms"". He has pledged to devote $300m to community policing. Vice-President Mike Pence was one of the few speakers tonight to address the pandemic. He praised President Trump for suspending all travel from China at the end of January after the first coronavirus case was reported in the US. ""That action saved an untold number of American lives. And bought us time to launch the greatest national mobilisation since World War 2,"" he told supporters. While Pence went on to tout a partnership with private industry to ""reinvent testing"", critics say any time that travel ban bought was quickly wasted because of a series of errors and inaction. In this video, we explored the lost six weeks that allowed the virus to spread across the country. This video can not be played Pence has demanded law and order in his speech from Baltimore. ""Let me be clear: the violence must stop - whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha,"" he says, referring to the protests that have erupted just this past week in Kenosha in the wake ofanother police killing of a black man. ""Too many heroes have died defending our freedoms to see Americans
strike each other down. ""We will have law and order on the streets of America. ""We're not going to defund police. Not now. Not ever,"" he adds. Here's what Joe Biden had to say about the protests in an interview earlier today: ""Protesting brutality is a right and absolutely necessary. But burning down communities is not protest, it's needless violence. Violence that endangers lives. ""That's wrong,"" he added. Jonathan MarcusBBC Diplomatic and defence correspondent If the past is the prologue to the future then
four more years of President Trump will be four more years of âAmerica firstâ;
four more years of the weakening of the international order; and four more
years of incoherence and bluster in US foreign policy. Beyond the meandering tweet storms, nothing has emerged that you could really call a Trump doctrine. Opposition to Americaâs âforever warsâ is popular at home and a second Trump
term could see US troops withdrawn from a number of trouble spots. Pressure on US
allies in crude terms, to âpay their wayâ, will continue. But the question
remains: does this strengthen or weaken alliances upon which the US depends for
its preeminent place on the global stage? Policy towards Russia and, crucially, China may continue to lack any real guiding principle. 'Strategic rivalry' may
grow, but Washingtonâs overall position may become weaker. Trumpâs first
term has been good for the strong men and despots of global politics. There
seems no reason that this should change during his second.  According to Pence, Trump has ""stood up to our enemies and weâve stood with our allies"". Under Trump's leadership, he says, ""American armed forces took the last inch of Isis territory, crushed their caliphate and took down their leader without one American casualty."" Pence paints a contrast to Trump's Democratic rival, Joe Biden, saying that Biden opposed the operation that took down Osama Bin Laden, conducted under the Obama administration. This account has been disputed by Biden, who has insisted he expressed scepticism, but ultimately supported Obama's decision. Pence goes further - repeating a claim from the memoir of Obama-era secretary of defence Bob Gates, that Biden had ""been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"". Pence is describing the president as a man that fights back in the face of critics. ""For the last four years, I
have watched this president endure unrelenting attacks and get up
every day and fight to keep the promises he made to the American people,"" he says. He notes that under Trump, territories under control of the terror group Isis - a group he points out once controlled ""a land mass twice the size of Pennsylvania"" - were taken back. Trump ""sees America for what it
is; a nation that has done more good in this world than any other,"" he says. It is ""a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance. And if you want a president who falls silent when our heritage is demeaned or insulted,
then heâs not your man,"" he says. The vice-president has stepped out at Fort McHenry to chants of ""four more years"" from a small crowd, spaced apart for social distancing. Flanked by over a dozen US flags, Pence speaks of his 'gratitude for the confidence the president has placed in me,' as he accepts the nomination for the Trump-Pence 2020 Republican ticket. A visibly emotional Karen Pence sits in the audience next to some of the Pence children, and the vice-president's mother is there as well. He jokes: 'Sometimes I actually think I'm her second favourite candidate on the Trump-Pence ticket'. Vice-president Mike Pence takes to the stage at historic Fort McHenry in Baltimore. He begins by noting how the fort withstood a British onslaught 206 years ago, and criticising Democrats for ""attacking America"" at their party convention last week. There are a lot of high-profile Republicans speaking tonight, and many of them have referenced the 19th amendment in the United States - ratified 100 years ago, it granted women the right to vote. What do American voters think of this historic anniversary? The BBCâs Shrai Popat asked a number of women running for office. Texan Beth Van Duyne, a candidate for Congress, said: ""I think about how far we have come,"" Van Duyne said. ""It's incredibly humbling to be one of the record number of Republican women running for Congress this year."" Read more about what some female candidates - both Republican and Democrat - think about what has been achieved and what is left to do. What kind of vice-president is Mike Pence? On the one hand, he does a lot of the typical tasks associated with
modern VPs like the advising, the communications, the weekly lunch with the
president and the foreign travel, says Joel Goldstein, a professor of law at St
Louis University who has written books about the vice-presidency. But on the other hand, Pence has the unique challenge of deputising for a
president who is like no other. That means he often finds himself
cleaning up a controversy, saying Donald Trump hasnât said what heâs said, and
rephrasing it. But whereas all VPs end up being salespeople for the president, Pence
has taken that to new levels, says Mr Goldstein. âHe says President Trump is
going to be the best friend the military has ever had, things like that. There
are no limits on the bounds of his praise for the president.â Perhaps Pence would act differently if he was serving under one of the
Bushes or another Republican president, he adds. Trump is a man who doesnât
like to be challenged. âHe wants to have people sit there in a public meeting singing his
praises, and Pence has been willing to do that. But when you do that, it
demeans the vice-president and also demeans the office.â Mike Pence: From Indiana to the White House Lara Trump made an eyebrow raising claim in her speech just now, when she said Mr Trump appointed the ""secretary of the United Nations"". ""It didnât surprise me when President Donald Trump appointed
the most women to senior level positions of any administration in history,"" she said. ""The
Secretary of the United Nations, Secretary of the Air Force, the first female
CIA Director..."" The UN general secretary is appointed by the UN General Assembly members, not the US president. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher has confirmed that President Trump has just arrived at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, where he is apparently accompanying his vice-president, Mike Pence, who is due to give a keynote speech there within the next 45 minutes. Lara Trump - Donald Trump's daughter-in-law and an adviser to the president's re-election team - is up now. The mother-of-two has been married to Trump's second son, Eric Trump, since 2014. And since joining the Trump family, the 37-year-old has proven to be a loyal supporter of the elder Trump's political career. During the 2016 election, she led the Trump-Pence Women's Empowerment tour, a role she has reprised the second time around. Lara Trump has established herself as a top spokesperson for the president, traveling around the country and holding ""MAGA mommy"" gatherings as part of the ""Women for Trump"" initiative. It's a crucial role: white suburban women were key to delivering the White House to Trump in 2016, and he'll need that support again. She has promised to keep a ""hopeful and inspirational and patriotic"" tone at tonight's event. We've also heard from Madison
Cawthorn, a congressional candidate from North Carolina, running for his first term this November. If he wins, the 25-year-old would be the youngest congressman elected in over 200 years. Cawthorn had his athletic dreams derailed after a car accident left him paralysed. Sitting in a wheelchair, the young Republican made a charismatic pitch for his own candidacy as he also gave his support to Trump. ""I was given a one percent chance of surviving. Thanks to the power of prayer, a loving community, and skilled doctors, I made it,"" he said. ""At 20, I thought about giving up. However, I knew I could still make a difference,"" he says. ""In 2020, our country has a choice. We can give up on the American idea, or we can work together to make our imperfect union more perfect."" ""While the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trumpâs leadership, want to rebuild, restore and renew."" He capped his appearance by standing up, with the aid of a support, from his chair, in what will surely be a re-played moment from the convention. His is an important pitch: support from young people like Cawthorn is currently lacking for President Trump. A poll from the Harvard Kennedy School in April showed 18- to 29-year-olds supporting Democratic candidate Joe Biden by a margin of 23 points. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mr Hogan said he did not break any law but he ""should have been more rigorous"" in his adherence to the Covid guidelines EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has resigned after the Irish government accused him of breaching Covid-19 guidelines. Mr Hogan attended a golf dinner with more than 80 people in County Galway on 19 August. He was also criticised for not complying with quarantine rules when he arrived in Ireland from Brussels. Mr Hogan said he did not break any law but he ""should have been more rigorous"" in adherence to the Covid guidelines. In a resignation statement, the outgoing commissioner said he regretted his trip to Ireland had ""caused such concern, unease and upset"". ""I reiterate my heartfelt apology to the Irish people for the mistakes I made during my visit,"" he added. Profile: Phil Hogan GolfGate: The hotel event causing chaos in Ireland On Tuesday, Mr Hogan provided details to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, about his time in Ireland leading up to his attendance at the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) Golf Society event. After arriving in the Republic of Ireland on 31 July, Mr Hogan said he travelled to his temporary residence in Kildare and tested negative for Covid-19 on 5 August during a hospital visit. He had told Irish state broadcaster RTÃ he had not breached regulations and argued the test result meant he was ""not under any subsequent legal requirement to self-isolate or quarantine"". Ireland's Department of Health has said a person is required to restrict their movements for 14 days if they arrive into Ireland from a country not on the green list. It said the guidance does not state that a negative Covid-19 test shortens the 14-days requirement. Phil Hogan was accountable to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The leaders of the Republic of Ireland's governing coalition had said the commissioner had clearly breached guidelines and he should have restricted his movement for 14 days. They said he should also have limited his movements to and from Kildare for essential travel only, and he should not have attended the golf dinner. Following news of the resignation, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, TÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said it was ""the correct course of action given the circumstances of the past week"". ""We all have a responsibility to support and adhere to public health guidelines and regulations,"" a joint statement continued. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she was grateful for Mr Hogan's ""tireless work as a trade commissioner"". ""He was a valuable and respected member of the college,"" she said. ""I wish him all the best for the future."" Mr Hogan - who would have been leading the EU's post-Brexit free trade negotiations with the UK - had been facing calls to quit in the wake of #GolfGate, as it has become known in Ireland. The now infamous golf dinner was attended by a host of high-profile figures from Irish political life. The controversy surrounding it has alreadycost the jobs of Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary and Jerry Buttimer, deputy chairman of the Irish senate. The event took place the day after the Irish government changed its guidelines in the face of an increasing number of Covid-19 cases, with numbers allowed at indoor events cut from 50 to six, with some exceptions. James Sweeney, from the Station House Hotel where the event was held, told RTÃ he had checked with the Irish Hotels Federation to ensure the event complied with regulations. He said he was told it would be, if the guests were in two separate rooms, with fewer than 50 people in each. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) have said they are investigating what happened at the  dinner.

"Cornwall is one of the UK's most popular tourist destinations The UK is set to lose up to Â£22bn in tourism revenues this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has predicted. Spending by visitors from overseas could fall by as much as 78%, equivalent to Â£60m a day, said the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). In the worst case scenario, this would put three million jobs in jeopardy. The WTTC said tourists were ""staying away from the UK in droves"" because of uncertainty over travel restrictions. Visitors have been put off coming to the UK because it has been hit harder by the pandemic than any other European country. Travel has also been discouraged by the UK government's quarantine measures imposed on people arriving from nations including France, the Netherlands and Spain. This summer's ""staycation"" boomhas seen UK residents flocking to book holidays in their own country, but the WTTC thinks the lack of foreign visitors will still inflict economic damage. London had been hardest hit by the collapse in visitor numbers, the WTTC said, because about 85% of tourist spending in the capital was from foreign visitors. ""The economic pain and suffering caused to millions of households across the UK, who are dependent upon travel and tourism for their livelihoods, is evident from the latest figures,"" said WTTC President Gloria Guevara. She said the UK could take ""years to recover"" from the slump in demand, which threatened London's position as one of the world's premier hubs for business and leisure travel. ""We urgently need to replace stop-start quarantine measures with rapid, comprehensive and cost-effective test and trace programmes at departure points across the country,"" she added. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the coronavirus crisis was having an impact on travel companies' stock market performance, with airline easyJet and cruise firm Carnival exiting the FTSE 100 after a major collapse in their share prices. She added: ""It also has much wider repercussions for the UK travel industry as a whole. Last year, according to the WTTC, travel and tourism were responsible for almost four million UK jobs or 11% of the country's total workforce, with many businesses relying on high spending overseas visitors. ""Although there has been an increase in the number of domestic holidays being taken in the UK, as UK consumers steer clear of trips abroad, their spend is highly unlikely to offset the collapse of international travel.""

Until then, stay well and thanks for joining us. Now to the latest key global developments: As we near the end of today's coverage, here are the main headlines from around the UK:  Spending for the second week of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme rose 9% Some UK restaurants say they will continue the government-funded Eat Out to Help Out scheme into September with their own cash because it has been so successful. Latest HM Treasury data shows diners used the government scheme more than 64 million timesin its first three weeks. The scheme, which is now in its final week, offers customers in restaurants, pubs and cafes 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 per head. It has been running every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August to encourage support for the hospitality sector. Commercial landlord Grosvenor has said it will subsidise discounted meals for its restaurant tenants in Belgravia and Mayfair, while elsewhere restaurants are individually deciding to extend the offer. ""The scheme has not just benefited businesses commercially, it appears to have really boosted consumer confidence as well, which is just as important,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality.

Health officials are saying that up to 30 young people in Plymouth, on the south coast of England, could be infected with coronavirus having returned from holiday in Greece. Plymouth's public health team said the group of 18 and 19-year-olds returned from the island of Zante last week and so far 11 have tested positive. Many had minor symptoms or none at all, they added. Greece is not currently on the list of countries with quarantine restrictions for UK travellers. The city's director for public health Ruth Harrell said her team were working alongside national systems to contact and trace those thought to have been affected. Read more here.

Staff in care homes are regularly tested for Covid-19 The National Care Forum (NCF) has written an open letter to England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock calling for a reversal of the decision to allow inspectors into care homes without weekly testing. The NCF, which represents 120 social care charities in the UK, called the decision to allow Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors to conduct on-site inspections of care homes without regular testing for Covid-19 ""extraordinary"". âFor months central government and the regulator have been requiring care homes to essentially eradicate the movement of staff and the flow of people, including close family relatives, into homes. ""Having done this, care homes are now being asked to let inspectors into homes without knowing whether or not they are Covid-positive. Understandably they are both shocked and hugely concerned,"" said Vic Rayner, executive director at the NCF. ""If inspectors are coming in, they need to be tested â there should be no further debate about this."" Visitors to Moma will be met by this newly-installed sign Some normality is returning to New York with the imminent reopening of many of its most famous museums and art galleries. The Museum of Modern Art, Moma, opens its doors on Thursday with free timed tickets for those visiting over the next month. Director Glenn Lowrytold ABC News,externalthat the museum was facing significant financial losses because of the coronavirus but deciding not to charge visitors for the first month ""felt like the right gesture"". The Metropolitan Museum of Art is set to reopen on Saturday, and the American Museum of Natural History and 9/11 Memorial Museum will start welcoming back visitors in September.  There have been a further 1,048 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. Sixteen people have died, bringing the total death toll of those who died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 to 41,465, according to figures released by Public Health England. Overall, 328,846 cases have been confirmed in the UK. The test has already been given approval in the US The health service in Scotland has signed a deal for equipment which allows Covid-19 tests to be carried out in just 12 minutes. NHS Scotland is to spend Â£6.76m on 300 rapid testing machines and at least 500,000 tests. The deal with life sciences company LumiraDx will see the test strips made at its Stirling base. The testing machines are said to be highly portable and can be used in local clinics or mobile units. The test, which is going through the final stages of validation for use in Scotland and the rest of Europe, detects the Covid-19 antigen protein from a nasal swab in 12 minutes - considerably faster than the 90 minutes typically needed by other rapid tests which are currently being trialled.

the Gaza Strip after a 61-year-old man became the second person with the
disease to die in the Palestinian territory, and several new cases
were discovered outside its quarantine centres. Early on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry announced
that two people had tested positive at the territoryâs largest hospital -
forcing it to close and causing locals to panic. Police were posted at the gates of Shifa Hospital in Gaza
City, and all its doctors and nurses were tested. The BBCâs Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says the outbreak
has caused alarm because of Gaza's weak healthcare system. After five cases were confirmed in one family living in a refugee camp on Monday, a curfew was imposed across Gaza. Previously, our correspondent adds, the relative
isolation of the territory - kept under blockade by Israel and Egypt - and
strict quarantine controls meant that Covid-19 had not spread among the general
population. The new infections were reported as an envoy from Qatar, which
has been sending aid money to Gaza, arrived for meetings to try to ease rising
tensions with Israel. In recent nights, Israeli warplanes or tanks have struck
what they say are militant targets in Gaza in retaliation for the launch of
rockets and balloons with incendiary devices attached. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to meet with families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said it was the fifth time members had asked to meet the PM, but Mr Johnson said he was ""not aware"" of the group's previous letters. ""Of course I will meet the bereaved,"" the prime minister told Sky News on Wednesday. However, No 10 are yet to confirm that a meeting will take place. The group of 1,600 families are calling for a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. Co-founder Jo Goodman, who lost her father to the virus, said: ""We welcome Boris Johnson finally agreeing to meet with us. ""It shouldn't have taken him months to agree to it, and it should only be a matter of days before it happens. ""If the prime minister had replied to our first letter back in June, a rapid review could be reporting right now, giving crucial lessons on how to save lives as the virus spikes again, as we're seeing in locations across the country."" Jonathan Slater was permanent secretary at the Department for Education Another head has rolled over the UK's exam results fiasco. The Department for Education announced its most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, would step down on 1 September, adding ""the prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". Boris Johnson earlier blamed a ""mutant algorithm"" for creating a situation in which many students' A-level results were unfairly downgraded and they lost out on university and college places. The National Education Union accused Mr Johnson of trying to ""idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created"". Mr Slater's departure comes a day after the resignation of Sally Collier, head of the exams regulating body, Ofqual. Meanwhile Gavin Williamson, education secretary, stays in his job. Police patrolled public spaces to ensure lockdown rules were being followed at the height of the pandemic Crime in England and Wales fell by almost a third in the first two full months of lockdown, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was driven by falls in reported thefts and burglary, the ONS said. Butthe ONS said,externaldrug crime rose by up to 44% compared with the same period last year, due to targeted policing. A survey also suggests the vast majority of adults (91%) are satisfied with the way police have dealt with the coronavirus restrictions. The figures, which are based on telephone research, support earlier data from police forces of a significant decline in offending during April and May. Read the full story here. It will be up to schools and councils in Wales to decide if face coverings need to be wornby pupils in communal areas and on school transport, the Welsh government has said. A government statement says the use of masks is recommended  indoors for older pupils, where social distancing cannot be maintained. But ministers are not mandating their use in schools, suggesting head teachers must take a decision based on ""risk assessments"" of school buildings. Teaching union NAHT Cymru deemed the policy ""unacceptable"", saying ""head teachers are not medical experts and the Welsh government should not put them in this position."" In England, the government has said secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors where a local lockdown is in place, but elsewhere head teachers would have ""flexibility"" on the issue. Pupils in secondary schools in both Scotland and Northern Ireland are recommending the use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next week.  Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green says the government has not been clear in its guidance for schools and ""constant chopping and changing and passing the buck"" has not left parents or staff feeling very reassured. She says it was right for the government to act on changed scientific and medical advice, but it needs to be clear, with discussions and guidance for those impacted. Head teachers needed data like local infection rates and what sort of action they should take if a child was unwell at school or there was a local outbreak, she says - and heads have been pressing government for access to that data. She said the stop-starting and confusion was ""really damaging for students, for the confidence of their parents and their teachers"". ""I am concerned that we shouldn't have to face the fact that these young people become a Covid generation whose long-term prospects are blighted by the effect of the  lockdown and the education they've missed."" Gatwick - the UKâs second largest airport - has announced plans to cut around 600 jobs, as it significantly restructures its business in the wake of the pandemic. The airport is proposing to cut some 24% of the current staff following a dramatic slump in passenger numbers and air traffic since March. In August, usually one of the airport's busiest months, passenger numbers are more than 80% lower than the same month last year, with only the North Terminal operating. The chief executive of Gatwick Airport, Stewart Wingate, said it was a ""stark reminder"" of ""the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry"". ""We will continue to do all we can to preserve as many jobs as possible,"" he added. Katharine Birbalsingh, head teacher of Michaela Community School in London, said there was a ""need to take into account children's behaviour when considering whether or not masks make them safer"". ""What about the children who turn up to school with uniforms that aren't washed? They don't necessarily wash themselves, they come to school hungry, they will be wearing reused dirty masks,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""They'll swap them... they'll wear them incorrectly, they'll lose them. When half of your children show up to school and aren't wearing masks, what to do you, do you exclude them?"" But Liam Powell, head teacher at Manor High in Leicestershire - which was affected by the recent local lockdown - told the programme: ""I think we have to have high expectations of our children and we have to modify the way they behave."" His school has made the use of face coverings optional. ""A lot of our parents are in the medical profession and they know a lot about viruses, and a lot of them are quite anxious,"" he said. ""What we've said to parents is it's sensible to carry a mask anyway because you may be travelling on public transport, the school bus or going into a shop on your way to school or on the way home."" Kenya's education minister has hinted at reopening schools earlier than his initial proposal of January 2021 - if coronavirus cases continue to fall. George Magoha has said tertiary institutions may also reopen earlier than was planned. Kenya scrapped the entire 2020 academic year in March because of the pandemic. The minister said it would be in the interest of learners to reopen schools early if the infection rate maintains its recent downward trend. The ministry of health has been reporting lower numbers in its daily updates, with the director general saying the rate needs to be below 5% for a period of two weeks for the curve to be said to be flattening. The World Health Organization and Unicef last week urged African countries to consider reopening schools but with strict guidelines. The agencies said children were being exposed to violence, teenage pregnancies and poor nutrition while at home during the pandemic. Karina Fuentes helps her seven-year-old daughter Julieta during a televised class School lessons have resumed in Mexico but with the number of coronavirus infections still high, children will not yet return to classrooms. Schools were among the first institutions to close as the virus began to spread through the country in March. As many Mexican families do not have access to the internet, classes will be broadcast on TV. Official figures suggest 93% of homes have access to TV. Mexico has one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in the world. Since the pandemic started, 61,450 people have died with Covid. Only the United States and Brazil have had higher death tolls.

"Mr Hogan said he did not break any law but he ""should have been more rigorous"" in his adherence to the Covid guidelines EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has resigned after the Irish government accused him of breaching Covid-19 guidelines. Mr Hogan attended a golf dinner with more than 80 people in County Galway on 19 August. He was also criticised for not complying with quarantine rules when he arrived in Ireland from Brussels. Mr Hogan said he did not break any law but he ""should have been more rigorous"" in adherence to the Covid guidelines. In a resignation statement, the outgoing commissioner said he regretted his trip to Ireland had ""caused such concern, unease and upset"". ""I reiterate my heartfelt apology to the Irish people for the mistakes I made during my visit,"" he added. Profile: Phil Hogan GolfGate: The hotel event causing chaos in Ireland On Tuesday, Mr Hogan provided details to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, about his time in Ireland leading up to his attendance at the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) Golf Society event. After arriving in the Republic of Ireland on 31 July, Mr Hogan said he travelled to his temporary residence in Kildare and tested negative for Covid-19 on 5 August during a hospital visit. He had told Irish state broadcaster RTÃ he had not breached regulations and argued the test result meant he was ""not under any subsequent legal requirement to self-isolate or quarantine"". Ireland's Department of Health has said a person is required to restrict their movements for 14 days if they arrive into Ireland from a country not on the green list. It said the guidance does not state that a negative Covid-19 test shortens the 14-days requirement. Phil Hogan was accountable to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The leaders of the Republic of Ireland's governing coalition had said the commissioner had clearly breached guidelines and he should have restricted his movement for 14 days. They said he should also have limited his movements to and from Kildare for essential travel only, and he should not have attended the golf dinner. Following news of the resignation, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, TÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said it was ""the correct course of action given the circumstances of the past week"". ""We all have a responsibility to support and adhere to public health guidelines and regulations,"" a joint statement continued. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she was grateful for Mr Hogan's ""tireless work as a trade commissioner"". ""He was a valuable and respected member of the college,"" she said. ""I wish him all the best for the future."" Mr Hogan - who would have been leading the EU's post-Brexit free trade negotiations with the UK - had been facing calls to quit in the wake of #GolfGate, as it has become known in Ireland. The now infamous golf dinner was attended by a host of high-profile figures from Irish political life. The controversy surrounding it has alreadycost the jobs of Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary and Jerry Buttimer, deputy chairman of the Irish senate. The event took place the day after the Irish government changed its guidelines in the face of an increasing number of Covid-19 cases, with numbers allowed at indoor events cut from 50 to six, with some exceptions. James Sweeney, from the Station House Hotel where the event was held, told RTÃ he had checked with the Irish Hotels Federation to ensure the event complied with regulations. He said he was told it would be, if the guests were in two separate rooms, with fewer than 50 people in each. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) have said they are investigating what happened at the  dinner.

"Dua Lipa was the inspiration for dozens of baby girls' names in England and Wales Dua Lipa and Star Wars' Kylo Ren were among the biggest influences on parents' choices for their baby names, according to the latest data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said babies called Dua doubled in 2019 compared with 2017, when the singer had her first UK number one. Kylo's popularity has risen since the new Star Wars films started in 2015. But Oliver and Olivia are still number one in England and Wales, with more than 9,000 babies named in 2019. The ONS said 126 babies were called Dua in 2019, compared with 63 in 2017, suggesting that like her first UK number one single the singer has set New Rules for naming inspiration. The name Kylo appears to have increased in popularity since the first appearance of Kylo Ren in 2015. Since then, the number of boys named Kylo has risen from 10 to 67 in 2019. Meanwhile Alexa has fallen since the introduction of Amazon's Echo, down from 332 in 2016 to just 39 in 2019. Although they were the most popular names, Olivia and Oliver are declining. There were 4,082 Olivias last year, compared with 4,598 the year before. Oliver, which has been the number one boys' name since 2013, fell from 5,390 to 4,392. Younger mothers are picking shortened boys' names while older mothers favour the likes of Jack and Charlotte David Corps, from the ONS, said: ""Oliver and Olivia continued their reign as the top boys' and girls' names in 2019, but analysis shows choices in baby names can differ depending on the mother's age. ""We found younger mothers opted for more modern girls' names like Harper, which has seen a rise since the Beckhams named their daughter so in 2011, and shortened boys' names like Freddie. In contrast, older mothers chose more traditional names such as Jack and Charlotte."" Sarah Redshaw, editor of parenting website BabyCentre UK said she was not surprised to see Oliver and Olivia taking the top spot once again, as they were ""really well loved and popular names"" as well as ""strong and traditional"". ""It isn't unusual to see little change in the top 10, I think the new trends you see happen further down the list,"" she said, adding it was ""great to see more unusual names"" in the top 100 brought about by popular culture and sporting events such as the Women's World Cup. Looking ahead, Ms Redshaw said the top spots were unlikely to change drastically for a few years, with parents opting for the ""steadiness"" of the top 10 amid ""turbulent"" times. However, she added parents were likely to be ""a lot more adventurous"" with middle names, and a list of these could look quite different to the most popular forenames. ""Parents feel a lot of pressure to name their baby, but if you are uncertain you have more than 40 days to decide,"" she said. Although Jack was still the eighth most popular boys' name, it has declined significantly since its heyday in 1996, when more than 10,000 babies were given the name. Among girls, Ruby has been declining since 2007, when it was the most popular name, to 27th in 2019. Lauren is also in steady decline among girls, down from the fifth most popular in 1996 to 453rd in 2019. The ONS said it looked as though the name Matthew may soon fall out of the top 100 for the first time since 1954 after 633 boys were given the name. However, some may be on the verge of extinction. The ONS only provides figures when there were at least three babies given the same spelling of a name. It does not reveal names taken by only one or two babies, in order to protect their privacy. The data does not reveal any entries this year for once-popular names like Stacy. There were dozens of babies with the name in the mid-1990s, but only four in 2018. Nichola, which was the 83rd most popular name for girls in 1974, has not appeared in the list since 2010 when there were seven babies given the name. Figures for Scotland have already been published,with Jack and Olivia being the most popular. The ONS said many commentators had concluded if various spellings of a name, such as Mohammed, were added together it would be the most popular name for boys in England and Wales. However, the ONS does not do this because it would have to do the same for all other names, for example combining the different versions of Oliver, such as Ollie, Oli, Oliwer and Olly. Muhammad was the most popular boys' name in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, the West Midlands and London.

"This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest More reinforcements are being sent to the US city of Kenosha, Wisconsin, following unrest sparked by the police shooting of a black man. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot and injured by police on Sunday as he leaned into his car and as his children watched. Protests since then have turned violent, with two people killed and one injured on Tuesday night. A 17-year-old youth has been arrested. Mr Blake is recovering in hospital and is conscious, his family say. But his lawyers say it will take ""a miracle"" for him to walk again. What do we know about Jacob Blake's shooting? Three facts that help explain anger in the US 'Black people have been through a lot this year' The protests over Mr Blake's shooting have at times turned violent, causing damage to property. Tuesday night's incident was believed to have involved protesters against Mr Blake's shooting and armed men guarding a petrol station. Hours after Mr Blake was shot on Sunday, hundreds rallied outside Kenosha's police headquarters. As the protests went on, cars were set alight, armed robberies were reported and a night-time curfew was eventually put in place. Protesters said police and troops used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs. Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters marched through the city again. A small group threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Professional Police Association told the BBC individuals and groups were exercising their own form of vigilantism because law enforcement was spread very thin across the city. On social media, footage showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire at them. Other videos show armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, congregating outside businesses they said they were protecting. At a news conference on Wednesday, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis confirmed that a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, had been arrested over the deaths of a 26- and 36-year-old during Tuesday's protests. The injured individual is also 26 years of age, and is expected to recover, he said. The teenager, named as Kyle Rittenhouse, has been held on suspicion of first-degree murder. Sheriff David Beth said that there had been calls for him to allow civilians to help with law enforcement - a process known as deputising. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' ""What happened last night was probably the perfect reason why I wouldn't,"" he said. The sheriff added that he was not certain but believed the individual involved in the two deaths belonged to a group that wanted to be deputised. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was sending ""federal law enforcement and the National Guard"" to Kenosha. ""We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets. My team just got off the phone with Governor Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (Portland should do the same!),"" he tweeted. Shortly following Mr Trump's tweet, Mr Evers, the Wisconsin governor, said he had authorised 500 National Guard troops to support law enforcement efforts. This video can not be played Jacob Blake: Mayor says 'violence in the community is not acceptable' Kenosha Mayor John Antaramian said the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), US Marshals as well as police across the state were already involved in efforts to quell the unrest. Mayor Antaramian told reporters on Wednesday: ""I am here today basically to, number one, inform everyone that we are not planning on letting this violence continue. ""Number two, we are going to work together to resolve the racial issues in our community, and we are going to make that work."" A new curfew is to be implemented from 19:00-07:00 and last until Sunday. On Tuesday, Mr Blake's mother, Julia Jackson, said that her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but that if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". Her sister said she was numb with pain. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said was ""sick"" that a black man had been shot by police once again. ""Justice must be done,"" Mr Biden said.

Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland, Oregon and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May sparked Black Lives Matter protests across the US and globally. On Wednesday night, the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team became the first to boycott a match in response to Mr Blake's shooting. They did not appear for game five of their NBA play-off series against the Orlando Magic. Prior to the game, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said: ""Myself, my players and our organisation are very disturbed by what happened in Kenosha."" He added: ""It is a great challenge to have an appreciation and a desire to want change, to want something different and better in Kenosha, Milwaukee and Wisconsin, and then to go out and play a game."" Bucks boycott NBA game after shooting Afterwards, the NBA announced the two remaining games scheduled for Wednesday had also been postponed. The Toronto Raptors, who won last year's NBA championship, were reportedly discussing boycotting an upcoming conference semi-final game as well. Player Norman Powell said the situation had gotten to a point where just saying ""Black Lives Matter"" was not enough. ""I think everybody's at the point of sitting up here and saying 'Black Lives Matter' and sitting up having discussions and Zoom calls... That's not getting the job done.

"GCSE students in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are receiving results based on teacher assessments, after a last-minute change to the system. They were originally due to receive marks worked out in a mathematical model, or algorithm, but this was abandoned following an uproar over last week's A-level results. It followsa similar change in Scotland. Students in the UK did not sit exams this year because schools were closed following the coronavirus lockdown. In England, they were given grades by the official exam regulator, Ofqual. Teachers were asked to supply for each pupil for every subject: An estimated grade A ranking compared with every other pupil at the school within that same estimated grade These were put through an algorithm, which also factored in the school's performances in each subject over the previous three years. The idea was that the grades this year - even without exams - would be consistent with how schools had done in the past. The teachers' rankings would decide which pupils received the top grades in their particular school. Video: What on earth is an algorithm anyway? What are BTec Nationals and how do they work? Can I accept a degree place and sit the exam? And other questions Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Ofqual said this was a more accurate way of awarding grades than simply relying on teachers' assessments. It argued that teachers were likely to be more generous in assigning an estimated mark, and this might lead to grade inflation - a much higher number of pupils getting the top grades. Similar algorithms were applied for pupils in Wales and Northern Ireland. They were also used in Scotland for the Scottish Higher qualification, which is broadly comparable with A-levels. When A-level grades were announced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 August, nearly 40% were lower than teachers' assessments. There were similar issues in Scotland. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers recommended and 3% were down two grades. What's more, the downgrading affected state schools much more than the private sector. The prime minister defended the system as ""robust"", but there was widespread criticism from schools and colleges, as well as from the opposition and some Conservative MPs. Ofqual said thatits objective for A-level results,externalwas to ensure that national results were ""broadly similar to previous years"". However, by basing it so much around previous school performance, a bright student from an underperforming school was likely to have their results downgraded through no fault of their own. Likewise, a school which was in the process of rapid improvement would not have seen this progress reflected in results. In Scotland, figures showed that the Scottish Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds was reduced by 15.2 percentage points, compared with only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. Private schools are usually selective - and better-funded - and in most years will perform well in terms of exam results. An algorithm based on past performance will put students from these schools at an advantage compared with their state-educated equivalents. There was a further factor at workaccording to statisticians Philip Nye and Dave Thompson of FFT Education Datalab.,externalThey said class sizes in independent schools are usually significantly smaller than in state schools. Where there were fewer than five pupils studying a subject at a school, their grades were decided only on the basis of teachers' estimates. Where there were between five and 15 entrants for a subject, teachers' assessments would still be given more weight. On 17 August, the government announced thatA-level results would be changedto reflect the original teachers' estimates - the so-called centre assessed grade or CAG - rather than the result produced by the algorithm. The only exception would be if a student had received a higher grade from the algorithm than the CAG. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson acknowledged ""significant inconsistencies"" in the grading process and apologised for the ""distress"" caused. He also announced that GCSE results would be decided according to teacher assessments. This year has seen a considerable amount of grade inflation as a result of the last week's events. Universities now have to deal with a rush for places by students who had previously been downgraded. Alistair Jarvis, the head of the university body Universities UK, says there are ""challenges"" ahead, such as capacity, staffing and facilities. What's happening with university admissions? Many universities will be able to accept extra students, particularly now the government has withdrawn its cap on the numbers each institution can admit. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that the government is""absolutely looking at""also lifting the cap on the number of places to study medicine. But there could be logistical problems for some oversubscribed universities or courses. Durham University, for example, isoffering financial incentivesto students who defer entry until 2021.

"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police The police shooting of a black man in the state of Wisconsin has led to fresh unrest in US cities. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back as he entered a car where his three children were seated. His family say he has been left paralysed from the waist down - although doctors do not know if it is permanent. The protests turned violent two days after the incident, when two people killed and one injured in a shooting. A 17-year-old has been arrested. The shooting of Mr Blake was captured on video - happened shortly after 17:00 on Sunday 23 August. It was only on Wednesday that authorities gave some details about the incident. Wisconsin's Attorney-General Josh Kaul identified the officer involved as Rusten Sheskey. Three facts about African-Americans and US criminal justice 'Black people have been through a lot this year' Mr Kaul said officers had been called to an address after a woman reported that ""her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises"". While there, they tried to arrest Mr Blake, initially using a taser. After Mr Blake opened his car door, Mr Sheskey - who has been in the Kenosha Police Department for seven years - fired seven shots into Mr Blake's back. ""No other officer fired their weapon,"" Mr Kaul said. Mr Blake has since told investigators that he had a knife in his possession, and Mr Kaul said officers ""recovered a knife from the driver's side floorboard"" of his car. They found no other weapon in the vehicle. This video can not be played The US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin The person who shot the video, Raysean White, told CNN that before he began filming, he saw police wrestle, punch and taser Mr Blake. It was then that he started recording. Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males. As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr White told AP news agency that he heard police officers shout ""Drop the knife!"" before gunfire erupted, but said he didn't see a knife in Mr Blake's hands. Police said that officers had provided immediate aid to Mr Blake, who was taken to hospital afterwards. Lawyers for Mr Blake have said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"" when police drew their weapons. Kenosha Police do not have body cameras, although they do have microphones. Two days on from the shooting, Mr Blake's family gave an emotional statement to the media. ""They shot my son seven times, seven times, like he didn't matter,"" his father, Jacob Blake Snr said. Mr Blake's lawyer said that, because of his injuries, he has needed nearly all of his colon and small intestine removed, and suffered damage to his kidney, liver and arm. The family have demanded the arrest of the officer who shot Mr Blake, and said other officers involved should be fired. There have been two nights of protests so far in Kenosha ""People question why we have to say Black Lives Matter: this is why,"" said lawyer Ben Crump. Mr Blake's mother, Julia Jackson, appealed for an end to violent unrest, which she said ""doesn't reflect my son or my family"". The officers involved have been placed on administrative leave while investigations continue. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. After Mr Blake was shot on Sunday, hundreds of people rallied outside police headquarters in Kenosha. Cars were set alight, armed robberies were reported and a night-time curfew was put in place. The unrest continued for two nights. On the Tuesday, a small group of protesters threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Police said that law enforcement was spread very thinly, and individuals and groups were exercising a form of vigilantism. This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest Tuesday night's shooting was believed to have involved protesters and armed men guarding a petrol station. On social media, footage showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire at them. Other videos show armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, outside businesses they said they were protecting. On Wednesday, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis confirmed that a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, had been arrested over the deaths of a 26- and a 36-year-old during Tuesday's protests. The injured individual is also 26, and is expected to recover. The suspect has been named as Kyle Rittenhouse. Who is US teen accused of Wisconsin protest murders? President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was sending ""federal law enforcement and the National Guard"" to Kenosha. On Wednesday he announced reinforcements of 500 personnel, agreed with Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, doubling the number already sent. Mr Blake was raised in Evanston, near Chicago. His uncle, Justin, told the Chicago Tribune newspaper that he moved to Kenosha several years ago for a job and for his family. ""It was a safer location. He could work and try to save and build a better life,"" said Justin. His family have a long history of community activism. Mr Blake's grandfather, also called Jacob, was a pastor at a church in Evanston, and a local leader in the civil rights movement. He was also a prolific campaigner for affordable housing and led his congregation in constructing a housing block in the city. Justin Blake said Mr Blake continued this tradition of public service and volunteered with Black Urban Recycling - a charity that collects aluminium cans and recycles them to raise money for a community centre in Chicago. Court records show there was an active arrest warrant against Mr Blake, related to charges of sexual assault, trespassing, domestic abuse and disorderly conduct. But it is unclear if police were aware of this at the time of his shooting. Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands US law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society. Debate has reignited this year after another black man, George Floyd, was killed by Minneapolis police in May. Mr Floyd's death sparked protests around the country, and abroad, and has led to calls for extensive police reform in America.

"This video can not be played Two people have been killed and one injured during a third night of unrest Two people have been killed and one injured during a third night of unrest in the US city of Kenosha, sparked by the police shooting of a black man. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot and injured by police as he leaned into his car on Sunday, with his children screaming. Tuesday night's incident was believed to have involved protesters against Mr Blake's shooting and armed men guarding a petrol station. President Donald Trump says federal officers will be sent to Kenosha. The protests have at times turned violent, causing damage to property. On Wednesday, Mr Trump announced  that federal law enforcement and the National Guard would ""restore LAW and ORDER"". ""We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets. My team just got off the phone with Governor Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (Portland should do the same!),"" he said in a tweet. Mr Blake is in hospital, and his mother said he was conscious. Mr Blake's lawyers say it will take ""a miracle"" for him to walk again. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting In their statement, Kenosha Police said officials responded to ""reports of shots being fired and multiple gunshot victims"" in the city at about 23:45 on Tuesday (04:45 Wednesday GMT). ""The shooting resulted in two fatalities and a third gunshot victim was transported to a hospital with serious, but non-life threatening injuries,"" the statement said. It added that the identities of the victims were still being determined and that no further details would be given at this time. An investigation has been opened. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth earlier told the New York Times that an investigation into the shootings would be focused on a group of men armed with guns outside a petrol station. Kenosha, in the state of Wisconsin, has seen three nights of unrest Footage shared online showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire multiple rounds at them. Other video shows armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, congregating outside businesses they said they were protecting. Previous protests have resulted in damage to government offices and private businesses, and there have been reports of vigilantes turning out to protect property. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Professional Police Association told the BBC individuals and groups were exercising their own form of vigilantism because law enforcement was spread very thin across the city. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said on Tuesday he was sending more National Guard troops to the city amid the unrest. Within hours of Mr Blake's shooting on Sunday, hundreds of people had marched on Kenosha's police headquarters. Cars were later set alight, and police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. A night-time curfew was imposed. On Monday, Governor Evers called up the National Guard to help local police. The forces used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs, protesters said. Some demonstrators were seen attacking cars and property with baseball bats, Reuters reported. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters marched through the city. A small group threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' In a message posted on Twitter, police urged people in Kenosha, a city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan, to ""stay off the streets"". Buildings and cars have been burned. A state of emergency has also been declared in Wisconsin. Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland, Oregon and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May sparked Black Lives Matter protests across the US and globally. The Toronto Raptors basketball team, who won last year's NBA championship, have discussed potentially boycotting an upcoming conference semifinal game in response to Mr Blake's shooting. Player Norman Powell said the situation had gotten to a point where just saying ""Black Lives Matter"" was not enough. ""I think everybody's at the point of sitting up here and saying 'Black Lives Matter' and sitting up having discussions and Zoom calls... That's not getting the job done. Taking a knee for the anthem, that's not getting the job done."" Lawyer Ben Crump told a press conference on Tuesday that doctors said Mr Blake had been paralysed by the shooting. ""His family believe in miracles, but the medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralysed and, because those bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered some of his vertebrae, it is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,"" he said. The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death of George Floyd. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident shows Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Mr Blake's father has said he does not have confidence in the investigation. ""Anybody that is white, that is doing an investigation about a black young man that was shot seven times in his back, and haven't come up with an answer or a comment at this point, is not welcome,"" he told reporters.

"This year's GCSE results have already thrown up many questions. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theat the Association of Colleges,,externalare answering them for you. You can send them a question using the form at the bottom of the page. Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next In such an unusual year it was going to be difficult to decide upon the best course of action to support this year's students. After all the twists and turns in the past week or so, at least most students now have grades which they can use to progress, which has to be key after all the uncertainty. This year's students will all be in line with their peers, as were last year's students and, we anticipate, next year's students. The result you received this morning should have been the college centre assessed grade (CAG), or the exam board calculated grade - whichever is higher - and should be the final grade you will receive.  If you have any questions about it the best thing is to speak to your college to double check. I am sure they will be able to help. BTecs are going to be reviewed as a matter of course, so your daughter won't need to appeal. This might mean that her results are delayed for a little longer. I would suggest contacting her school or college to see if they have an update. The best thing to do is for your daughter to speak to the college and explain her concerns. Students are no longer able to use their mock grades to appeal, as this information would have been taken into account in the CAG [the predicted grade awarded by their teacher]. The advice for students who took exams at school is that you should sit the exam at that school, unless you have progressed to college and wish to take English and maths because you got a grade 3 or below. Speak to your school or local college. If you have the grades you need to progress to your next step, you may not need to sit autumn exams. The guidance is that the higher grade of the two will be the official result. If you have got the place you were hoping for then I would speak to your school or college about whether they advise that you consider taking exams in the autumn. You will be busy focusing on your new courses in the autumn and it might be better to concentrate on those. I would suggest that you speak to your college and ask them about the next best steps for you. They will be best placed to advise you. Centre assessed grades should have taken into consideration your son's learning difficulties and the fact that he would have had additional support. He will be able to take his GCSEs in the autumn if he wishes to do so at his school, but he may well have the grades he needs to progress to his next steps. The decision was taken late on Wednesday to review BTec grades in much the same way as has been done for GCSEs and A-levels in order to ensure that no student is disadvantaged. I appreciate this is disappointing, but hopefully you should receive your grades very shortly, and will know that they have been double-checked to make sure that you get the result you deserve. There-issued Ofqual student appeals guidance,externalsays it is felt that teachers know their students best. Therefore students can't appeal simply because they disagree with the CAG unless they suspect malpractice, including bias, or an administrative error. One thing to remember is that all schools and college have their own quality assurance processes, so it is not just an individual teacher making these important decisions. Teachers will have graded and ranked students and then this will have been moderated at department level and signed off by a senior leader. If a student has any concerns, the school or college will be able to advise on next steps. Cambridge International, which awards IGCSEs, has confirmed that the process for these qualifications will be in line with that for GCSEs and use the grades that schools submitted, unless the grade issued by the exam board was higher. You canfind further information here.,external Students will receive the CAG unless the calculated (algorithm) grade was higher. Schools and colleges will have used a variety of evidence to arrive at centre assessed grade, including practical components. GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020. Hopefully though, your results will be what you need to progress to your next course and you might decide that there is no need to take an autumn exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you. Good question. The situation is the same as for A-levels. Students will receive a CAG unless the calculated result is higher, in which case they will receive the calculated result. Universities will be aware of the challenges faced by Year 11 students this year. I am sure that when the time comes they will be mindful of this. The exam regulator, Ofqual, is already considering plans for next year for all qualifications, GCSEs, A-levels and vocational technical qualifications. You can find outmore about A-levels and GCSEs next year here.,external First of all I hope your son gets the grades he needs. Once he has received his results, the best thing to do is to speak to staff at the school who will be able to advise on next steps and the autumn exams if indeed he needs to take them.

"GCSE students in England, Northern Ireland and Wales are receiving results based on teacher assessments, after a last-minute change to the system. They were originally due to receive marks worked out in a mathematical model, or algorithm, but this was abandoned following an uproar over last week's A-level results. It followsa similar change in Scotland. Students in the UK did not sit exams this year because schools were closed following the coronavirus lockdown. In England, they were given grades by the official exam regulator, Ofqual. Teachers were asked to supply for each pupil for every subject: An estimated grade A ranking compared with every other pupil at the school within that same estimated grade These were put through an algorithm, which also factored in the school's performances in each subject over the previous three years. The idea was that the grades this year - even without exams - would be consistent with how schools had done in the past. The teachers' rankings would decide which pupils received the top grades in their particular school. Video: What on earth is an algorithm anyway? What are BTec Nationals and how do they work? Can I accept a degree place and sit the exam? And other questions Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Ofqual said this was a more accurate way of awarding grades than simply relying on teachers' assessments. It argued that teachers were likely to be more generous in assigning an estimated mark, and this might lead to grade inflation - a much higher number of pupils getting the top grades. Similar algorithms were applied for pupils in Wales and Northern Ireland. They were also used in Scotland for the Scottish Higher qualification, which is broadly comparable with A-levels. When A-level grades were announced in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 13 August, nearly 40% were lower than teachers' assessments. There were similar issues in Scotland. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers recommended and 3% were down two grades. What's more, the downgrading affected state schools much more than the private sector. The prime minister defended the system as ""robust"", but there was widespread criticism from schools and colleges, as well as from the opposition and some Conservative MPs. Ofqual said thatits objective for A-level results,externalwas to ensure that national results were ""broadly similar to previous years"". However, by basing it so much around previous school performance, a bright student from an underperforming school was likely to have their results downgraded through no fault of their own. Likewise, a school which was in the process of rapid improvement would not have seen this progress reflected in results. In Scotland, figures showed that the Scottish Higher pass rate for pupils from the most deprived backgrounds was reduced by 15.2 percentage points, compared with only 6.9 percentage points for the wealthiest pupils. Private schools are usually selective - and better-funded - and in most years will perform well in terms of exam results. An algorithm based on past performance will put students from these schools at an advantage compared with their state-educated equivalents. There was a further factor at workaccording to statisticians Philip Nye and Dave Thompson of FFT Education Datalab.,externalThey said class sizes in independent schools are usually significantly smaller than in state schools. Where there were fewer than five pupils studying a subject at a school, their grades were decided only on the basis of teachers' estimates. Where there were between five and 15 entrants for a subject, teachers' assessments would still be given more weight. On 17 August, the government announced thatA-level results would be changedto reflect the original teachers' estimates - the so-called centre assessed grade or CAG - rather than the result produced by the algorithm. The only exception would be if a student had received a higher grade from the algorithm than the CAG. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson acknowledged ""significant inconsistencies"" in the grading process and apologised for the ""distress"" caused. He also announced that GCSE results would be decided according to teacher assessments. This year has seen a considerable amount of grade inflation as a result of the last week's events. Universities now have to deal with a rush for places by students who had previously been downgraded. Alistair Jarvis, the head of the university body Universities UK, says there are ""challenges"" ahead, such as capacity, staffing and facilities. What's happening with university admissions? Many universities will be able to accept extra students, particularly now the government has withdrawn its cap on the numbers each institution can admit. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that the government is""absolutely looking at""also lifting the cap on the number of places to study medicine. But there could be logistical problems for some oversubscribed universities or courses. Durham University, for example, isoffering financial incentivesto students who defer entry until 2021.

"The chief civil servant at the Department for Education has been sacked following the row over A-level and GCSE results in England. Jonathan Slater was due to stand down next year, but will now leave the department by next week. A government statement said Boris Johnson ""concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". But the civil service union accused No 10 of ""discarding"" its members to ""keep scrutiny from the government's door"". Mr Slater is thefifth permanent secretary to leave his post in six months. The news comes a day after the head of exam regulator Ofqual, Sally Collier, also resigned from her role. Johnson blames 'mutant algorithm' for exam fiasco Ofqual chief steps down after exams chaos Why have there been so many U-turns? Thousands of A-level studentssaw their results downgraded earlier this monthdue to an algorithm designed to moderate them. It led to a huge backlash and a u-turn by government ahead of the publication of GCSE results, reverting the grades back to those awarded by teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson faced calls to resign, but No 10 said it had full confidence in him. Mr Slater has been the permanent secretary at the DfE for four years and was due to step down in Spring 2021. He will now be replaced by Susan Acland-Hood, who was brought into the department on a temporary contract last weekto lead on its exam response. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill thanked Mr Slater for his 35 years as a public servant and the government said a permanent replacement would be confirmed in the coming weeks. Mr Williamson also thanked Mr Slater for his ""commitment to public service"", adding: ""Like the prime minister, I appreciate the hard work of officials across government, particularly during this unprecedented time."" The education secretary said he and his new permanent secretary's ""immediate focus remains on making sure every child returns to the classroom full-time at the start of term"". The general secretary of the FDA union, Dave Penman, criticised the decision to sack Mr Slater. He said: ""If it wasn't clear before, then it certainly is now - this administration will throw civil service leaders under bus without a moment's hesitation to shield ministers from any kind of accountability."" He accused the government of ""scapegoating"" civil servants and claimed trust between ministers and civil servants was ""at an all-time low"". The Labour Party also condemned the move, saying civil servants had ""time and time again taken the fall for the incompetence and failures of ministers"". Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools. ""Leadership requires a sense of responsibility and a willingness to be held accountable, qualities this prime minister and his ministers utterly lack."" Former head of the Home Civil Service, Sir Bob Kerslake, who has worked as a Labour advisor, called the sacking ""a disgrace"", telling Times Radio that senior civil servants were ""carrying the can for the failure of ministers"". So, what does the departure of Jonathan Slater mean - and why does it matter? For his union, the FDA - and for Labour - it is straightforwardly a sign that, when things go wrong, the buck now firmly stops with the officials and not government ministers. Angry Conservative MPs were being privately reassured that ""heads would roll"" after the exams controversy. And now, both a senior civil servant and the head of Ofqual have now departed, while Gavin Williamson and his education ministers remain in post. But something of a pattern is now emerging. In February, the most senior official at the Home Office resigned - and took the government to court, claiming there had been a ""vicious and orchestrated campaign"" against him. Other senior civil servants have made less of a fuss, but have nonetheless left their jobs. The most senior Whitehall mandarin - Sir Mark Sedwill - recently moved, the head of the Foreign Office announced an earlier than expected departure, and it was confirmed last month that the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice would be leaving too. So, not-so-permanent secretaries seems to be a feature of this administration. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has talked about reforming the civil service. In a speech in June, he said government departments recruited in their own image and their assumptions were ""inescapably metropolitan"". So a strategic rethink and an increased turnover of senior Whitehall personnel are probably not entirely unrelated. But what might worry senior civil servants more is they might be sacrificed for short-term news management, rather than as the result of any strategic master plan. And there is a risk that this, in turn, might affect the quality of those who apply for senior civil service roles in the future.

At the time, he was largely unknown in the States. His debut album wasn't selling, and booking a six-night residency was a last-ditch  gamble. His US record label, UNI, paid $10,000 to hire the venue, and cajoled some of music's biggest names into attending. On the opening night, Sir Elton was introduced by Neil Diamond, and watched by Quincy Jones, Linda Ronstadt, Brian Wilson and Mike Love of the Beach Boys, Don Henley, Randy Newman, David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash. But perhaps the most important guest was the LA Times' pop critic Robert Hilburn. ""Rejoice!"" he wrote in an effusive review, ""rock music has a new star."" After praising the star's ""uninhibited"" stage presence and ""staggeringly original"" music, he concluded: ""Tuesday night at the Troubadour was just the beginning."" Allow YouTube content?

Within weeks, his self-titled album entered the US charts, eventually reaching number four. By January 1971, Your Song gave the star his first top 10 single. But as Sir Elton celebrates the anniversary of that landmark gig, the Troubadour is in trouble. One of Los Angeles' last independently-owned venues, it has been closed due to the coronavirus pandemic since 11 March - and there are only five shows on the schedule for the rest of 2020. Earlier this year, the venue's owner Christine Karayan said she couldn't ""foresee being able to ride this out"" without significant help from donors. Help came initially from a crowd-funding campaign, which raised more than $70,000 (Â£53,000) to support the venue's staff during the lockdown - but even so, the Troubadour faces an uncertain future. Even when concerts resume, a cap on audience sizes could render the venue unprofitable. Socially distanced trial gig ânot a successâ Music venues welcome extra emergency funding Pandemic 'biggest knock to live music in my life' Unlike bigger concert halls, social distancing poses genuine problems, said Karayan. ""The more I think about it, it's just completely futile,""she told the LA Times,external. ""At least a big seated venue has space where they can keep people apart. But I don't know how that works for a general admission venue. Are you going to stop them from using the restroom?"" Asked about the situation on BBC 6 Music, Sir Elton said preserving venues like the Troubadour was essential. ""I've heard that it might be closing but I think it's going to be OK,"" he told music reporter Matt Everitt. ""I made a few phone calls. There are a few irons in the fire. The Troubadour is one of hundreds of small, independent venues to struggle during the Covid-19 crisis ""If venues like that disappear then it's really grim stuff because they are so important for new people to go [to] and I've seen so many new acts there that have come from Britain. ""I saw Cat Stevens there when he did his first show in America. It's a great launch pad. It's a great room, it has atmosphere, it has everything going for it. If you can't play well at the Troubadour, you can't play well anywhere."" Elton John: 'I still want my dad's approval' Elton John's ex-wife 'attempted suicide' on honeymoon Elton John on the Yellow Brick Road Of course, the Troubadour isn't alone. Music venues across the world are facing hardship and closure, with no real certainty on when gigs might resume. Although socially-distanced shows have been permitted in England since 14 August, the Music Venue Trust has warned that ""only around 100 of the country's 900 small music venues would be able to operate under the current restrictions"". Even those venues will struggle, said the trust, with 96% of them saying the costs of re-opening would outweigh the revenue they would generate. The government has stepped in to provideemergency funding of Â£3.36mto grassroots music venues, and Sir Elton said it was ""vital"" these venues survive. ""I know the lady who owns Ronnie Scott's and I'm sure she's going to put up a battle,"" he told 6 Music. ""You can't lose places like that. ""Small venues are the life and soul of music and they have to be kept afloat some way or another."" ""Small venues are the life and soul of music,"" says the star The Covid-19 crisis has also derailed Sir Elton's farewell tour, with 43 dates postponed so far this year. ""We were half-way through the tour and then that was it and we're on a hiatus,"" said the star. ""But we're no different to anybody else and, as hard as it is and as frustrating as it is for me and the band, it's much more frustrating for the people who are in the crew, who depend on their livelihoods for working like that. ""And you know it just rolls, trickles down to people who do the catering - everybody's affected by it and unfortunately we're going to be the last people to go back to work because we play in large venues."" He says he'll be ""straight out there"" as soon as restrictions are lifted - but, in the meantime, the 73-year-old has been keeping busy at home. ""All I've been doing is finishing off a couple of musicals that I've written,"" he said. ""I did a [Lady] Gaga track. I have a few lyrics from Bernie which are wonderful, but I have no interest in being Elton at the minute. ""So I've been working with other people, which is fun, and staying away from me.""

"More than half a million people have been told to get out of the path of Hurricane Laura Hurricane Laura is expected to cause an ""unsurvivable"" storm surge, extreme winds and floods as it hits the US, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. The category four storm is approaching Texas and Louisiana with maximum sustained wind speeds of 150 miles per hour (240km/h). If it maintains those speeds it would be one of the strongest storms to ever hit the US south coast. Half a million residents have been told to leave the area. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT)the centre of the hurricane was 65 miles (105km) south east of Port Arthur,externalin Texas. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier hit the Caribbean, killing 24. Marco has already struck Louisiana, bringing strong winds and heavy rain on Monday. Initiallyit was feared that both storms would hit Louisiana as hurricanes within 48 hours of each other- an unprecedented event - but Marco was downgraded to a tropical storm. This video can not be played Hurricane Laura approaches Texas Laura, on the other hand, has strengthened rapidly from a category three, gaining 70% in power in just 24 hours, to a category four, maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). It is now close to becoming a category five storm, which would mean maximum sustained winds of 158mph (254km/h). Hurricane Katrina - which devastated New Orleans in 2005, killing more than 1,800 people - was a category five storm before weakening to a category three when made landfall in the US. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms Warming makes bigger hurricanes more damaging US President Donald Trumptold those potentially affected by the storm to ""listen to local officials"",externalas the storm was ""very dangerous and rapidly intensifying"". Evacuations are complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged families who could afford it to take refuge in hotels and motels to be distanced from others. Early on Wednesday the NHC said satellite images had shown that Laura had undergone a remarkable intensification to become a ""formidable hurricane"". In a series of tweets, it said Laura was expected to bring ""life-threatening hazards"" and an ""unsurvivable storm surge"" to parts of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Well-built homes could incur major damage, trees could be snapped or uprooted and electricity and water would be unavailable for days or even weeks, it said. ""Hurricane force winds and widespread damaging wind gusts will also spread well inland into portions of eastern Texas and western Louisiana early Thursday,"" the NHC added. Allow Twitter content?

Storm surges of more than 20ft (6m) are possible. In an update at 14:00 local time, the NHC reported 3.2ft of inundation already on parts of the Louisiana coast. ""To think that there would be a wall of water over two storeys high coming on shore is very difficult for most to conceive, but that is what is going to happen,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott. ""The word 'unsurvivable' is not one that we like to use, and it's one that I've never used before,"" he added. Governor Abbott urged people in the path of the storm to ""take advantage of these final few hours to evacuate"". ""The power of Hurricane Laura is unprecedented, and Texans must take action now to get out of harm's way and protect themselves,"" he said. Laura is expected to reach landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border between midnight and 02:00 local time on Thursday (07:00 GMT). The National Weather Service has also issueda tornado watch for parts of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi,external. A man boards up a Louisiana store as the state braces itself for Hurricane Laura More than 420,000 Texas residents have been ordered to leave, while an additional 200,000 were told to evacuate Calcasieu Parish in south-western Louisiana. Port Arthur, Texas, is home to the nation's largest oil refinery, and workers have been taken off at least 310 offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, reducing oil production by 84% for a second day in a row, officials said. Marco and Laura brought high winds and rough seas to the Caribbean, leaving at least 24 people dead, including a baby and an eight-year-old child in Haiti. Heavy rains have also battered parts of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and the US territory of Puerto Rico. President Trump declared a state of disaster in the territory on Saturday. Laura has brought rough seas and high winds to the Caribbean, including here in Havana, Cuba In Cuba, authorities have evacuated at least 160,000 people from several coastal regions, while thousands have been evacuated in the Dominican Republic.

"The number of shifts are to be reduced because of a ""substantial"" fall in demand Hundreds of people are to lose their jobs at the Mini car factory in Oxford. BMW, which owns the plant, said 400 out of the 950 agency personnel onsite would be affected. Production at the factory in Cowleywas halted in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, with work resuming in May. However, a ""substantial"" fall in customer demand during lockdown has led to a decision to reduce the number of shifts at the plant. The plant is moving from a three-shift pattern to two shifts in mid-October, while still operating five days a week. Agency personnel employed by Gi Group will be retained according to criteria such as length of service, individual skills and disciplinary records. Those affected, all of whom work full time on the production line, will be informed in mid-September. Human resources director Bob Shankly said: ""Like other automotive manufacturers, our volume forecasts for 2020 have had to change accordingly. ""We have, therefore, made the difficult decision to adjust our shift patterns at Mini Plant Oxford from October. ""This will give us the flexibility we need to adapt our production in the short to medium term, according to developments in global markets. ""Our decision has been made after close discussion with trade union representatives and we are aware that our plans will have an impact on people during an uncertain and worrying time. ""We have sought to protect as many jobs as we can, while also taking the necessary steps to ensure the stability of our business in light of this current period of volatile and unpredictable market conditions."" The company said it would also reduce the number of its core employees, but said it would be a ""small"" amount, with voluntary redundancies and early retirement options considered. SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? In a joint statement, Anneliese Dodds, Labour MP for Oxford East, and Susan Brown, leader of Oxford City Council, said they were ""really sorry and concerned"" to hear about the job losses. They added: ""While the plant is very productive, unfortunately the Covid-19 crisis has posed major difficulties for the automotive industry and the ills afflicting industry world-wide are impacting the plant here, too. ""We will both continue to work with BMW Cowley to do what we can to ensure the future of the plant and to protect local jobs."" The shift reductions mean the plant will go from completing about 1,000 cars per day to about 800-900. In total the plant employs about 4,000 people and produced 222,340 Minis in 2019.

"There had been no new deaths following a positive test reported in Scotland since 16 July The deaths of two people in Scotland are the country's first confirmed coronavirus fatalities in six weeks. It is the first time since 16 July that the deaths of patients who have tested positive for the virus has been recorded in daily figures. It brings the total number of deaths in Scotland under this measure to 2,494. However the death toll recorded by the National Records of Scotland, which includes both confirmed and suspected cases of Covid-19, stands at 4,222. It reported an additional six deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate between 17 and 23 August. Four of the deaths were in a care home and two were in a hospital, according to the NRS. Factory cluster cases in Coupar Angus up to 156 Seven test positive in Covid outbreak in Hawick Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Giving her daily update on coronavirus, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs the two deaths were a reminder that coronavirus was still a ""threat"" in Scotland. ""I think all of us have become used to hearing news of no deaths under these daily figures,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""These two new deaths today are of course devastating for those who will be grieving the loss. But they should also be a reminder for all of us that the threat of Covid hasn't yet gone away"". The two deaths are of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 within the past 28 days. Scotland's first coronavirus deathwas reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March. The number of daily deaths following a positive test peaked at 84 on 15 April, with 83 deaths also reported on 29 April and 6 May. But the number has been mainly declining since early May and the figure has not increased at all for six weeks. The NRS death figures are higher because they count all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. They include cases where the person has tested positive for the virus, and where it is suspected but not confirmed. Ms Sturgeon also reported that there had been 67 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland in the last 24 hours. Six more people are in hospital, bringing the total to 249, and two people are in intensive care.

"A Pizza Pilgrims restaurant in Belgravia Restaurants say they will continue to offer the Eat Out to Help Out scheme in September, funding it themselves, because it has been so successful. The government scheme offers customers 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 during August. But chains such as Pizza Pilgrims now say they will offer the discount next month too. The aim is to draw people nervous about coronavirus back to restaurants at a time when many are struggling. Some 84,000 restaurants, cafes and bars have signed up to the government's scheme, which runs on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August. According to thelatest Treasury figures, diners used it more than 64 million timesin its first three weeks - equivalent to nearly every person in the country dining out. Data shows only 27% of UK consumers feel safe eating at a restaurant Commercial landlord Grosvenor - which owns property across central London - said it would reduce rents for tenants that continue to offer diners half-price meals until the end of September. High end restaurants Comptoir and Roka, the Thomas Cubitt pub and Peggy Porschen cafÃ© are among those to sign up. ""Eat Out to Help Out has been a powerful tool in protecting jobs and local economies UK-wide and we are working hard to help the West End and our tenants recover,"" said Amelia Bright, executive director of Grosvenor's London estate. ""Continuing it will not only support cafes, restaurants and bars that we lease space to but also help welcome back more visitors and workers to Mayfair and Belgravia."" How does the scheme work? The highs and lows of the coronavirus discount scheme 'We've had 15,000 bookings' Eat Out to Help Out discount used 64m times in three weeks Others say they will offer different discounts inspired by the scheme. Spanish City, a steak and seafood restaurant in Whitley Bay, told the BBC it would offer a 25% discount on all food and non-alcoholic drinks on Monday to Wednesdays, with no cap on spending. About 80% of hospitality firms stopped trading in April and 1.4 million workers were furloughed - the highest proportions of any sector - according to government data. Industry body UK Hospitality says around a third of restaurants and bars have still not reopened despite the easing of lockdown, as people remain nervous about the spread of the virus. Boss Kate Nicholls welcomed the move by individual restaurants to extend the Eat Out scheme, saying it had been ""a huge success"". ""The hospitality sector is still fragile and faces other challenges, but prolonging the Eat Out scheme could help businesses back to stability and enable them to safeguard jobs and livelihoods,"" she said. A growing list of restaurant chains have had to announce closures in recent months includingPizza Express,Byron Burgerand Frankie & Benny's-owner the Restaurant Group. Spend for the second week of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme rose 9% And on Wednesday, Mexican chain Wahaca said it was closing 10 of its 25 restaurants, and that it would ""try to save jobs"" wherever possible. Spanish City's operations director Rob Smith told the BBC the Eat Out scheme had boosted its sales, but he remains cautious. ""We're forecasting being down about 25-30% for the rest of the year, and we're having to catch up on the three months we lost out - it's still very nervous times for the industry.""

"The red panda cub was born just four days after ZSL Whipsnade Zoo opened following the easing of coronavirus lockdown measures An endangered red panda cub the size of a human finger has been born at Whipsnade Zoo. The cub, which is yet to be named, was born at the zoo in Bedfordshire on 19 June - just days after it reopened following the easing of coronavirus lockdown measures. A spokesman for the zoo said the cub had ""grown quickly"" to the size of a small puppy. The cub's arrival is part of the zoo's conservation breeding programme. The sex of the red panda cub is yet to be determined Its mother, Tashi, has birthed seven cubs at the zoo and her newest addition can now be seen by visitors to the attraction. Red pandas are endangered in the wild ""mainly due to habitat destruction"", the Zoological Society of London said. Their natural habitat is the rainy, mountainous areas of the Himalayas. ZSL Whipsnade Zoo deputy team leader Grant Timberlake said: ""Red panda cubs are surprisingly small when they're first born - about the size of your index finger. ""But the cub has grown quickly and is about the size of a small puppy now: though it will be a full year before the cub reaches adult size. ""It will soon begin testing its incredible climbing skills around its leafy tree-top enclosure - closely guided by mum of course.""

"Residents woke up to the sight of dead dolphins At least 17 dead dolphins have been found on the coast of Mauritius, prompting debates about whether a recent oil spill was to blame. Environmental campaigners say the deaths were either caused by the oil spill from a Japanese-owned ship or by authorities sinking part of the vessel. But the fisheries minister said ""at first glance"" the deaths appeared to be unconnected to the spill. He said at least two of the dolphins had shark bites. The carcasses are currently undergoing a post-mortem. It is rare for so many dead dolphins to be found at the same time. Two were found in May 2019. These are the first reported deaths of dolphins since the shipwreck. Up to now, many fish and crabs have been found dead. The sight of the dolphins caused anger among residents. Many tourists swim with dolphins in Mauritius ""Waking up this morning to witness so many dead dolphins on our seashore is worse than a nightmare,"" resident Nitin Jeeha told the BBC. ""I have seen around eight to 10 dead dolphins. Are there more in the lagoon?"" Although many of the dolphins were found dead, some were discovered weak or dying on the shore. Environmental activists told the BBC they thought so. Africa Live: News and views from the continent Why the Mauritius oil spill is so serious What is Mauritius like? The MV Wakashio ran aground on coral reef on 25 July at Pointe d'Esny, a known sanctuary for rare wildlife. The area contains wetlands designated as a site of international importance by the Ramsar convention on wetlands. Oceanographer Vassen Kauppaymuthoo said the dolphins smelled of fuel. ""In my opinion, this situation will continue to deteriorate as time goes on,"" he was quoted by local media as saying. Environmentalist Sunil Dowarkasing said either the oil spill from the bulk carrier or the sinking of its bow last week caused the deaths. The authorities decided to sink the bow of the vessel last week ""The scuttling probably disturbed marine mammals in their natural habitat. There will be after-effects, and this is just the beginning,"" Mr Dowarkasing added. Greenpeace Africa has warned that ""thousands"" of animal species are ""at risk of drowning in a sea of pollution, with dire consequences for Mauritius's economy, food security and health"". But Sudheer Maudhoo, the nation's fisheries minister, said initial tests on the dolphins indicated that there was no link between the oil spill and their deaths. He noted that there were shark bites on at least two of the mammals but further tests would be needed to identify the cause.

"This video can not be played Two people have been killed and one injured during a third night of unrest Two people have been killed and one injured during a third night of unrest in the US city of Kenosha, sparked by the police shooting of a black man. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot and injured by police as he leaned into his car on Sunday, with his children screaming. Tuesday night's incident was believed to have involved protesters against Mr Blake's shooting and armed men guarding a petrol station. President Donald Trump says federal officers will be sent to Kenosha. The protests have at times turned violent, causing damage to property. On Wednesday, Mr Trump announced  that federal law enforcement and the National Guard would ""restore LAW and ORDER"". ""We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets. My team just got off the phone with Governor Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (Portland should do the same!),"" he said in a tweet. Mr Blake is in hospital, and his mother said he was conscious. Mr Blake's lawyers say it will take ""a miracle"" for him to walk again. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting In their statement, Kenosha Police said officials responded to ""reports of shots being fired and multiple gunshot victims"" in the city at about 23:45 on Tuesday (04:45 Wednesday GMT). ""The shooting resulted in two fatalities and a third gunshot victim was transported to a hospital with serious, but non-life threatening injuries,"" the statement said. It added that the identities of the victims were still being determined and that no further details would be given at this time. An investigation has been opened. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth earlier told the New York Times that an investigation into the shootings would be focused on a group of men armed with guns outside a petrol station. Kenosha, in the state of Wisconsin, has seen three nights of unrest Footage shared online showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire multiple rounds at them. Other video shows armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, congregating outside businesses they said they were protecting. Previous protests have resulted in damage to government offices and private businesses, and there have been reports of vigilantes turning out to protect property. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Professional Police Association told the BBC individuals and groups were exercising their own form of vigilantism because law enforcement was spread very thin across the city. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said on Tuesday he was sending more National Guard troops to the city amid the unrest. Within hours of Mr Blake's shooting on Sunday, hundreds of people had marched on Kenosha's police headquarters. Cars were later set alight, and police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. A night-time curfew was imposed. On Monday, Governor Evers called up the National Guard to help local police. The forces used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs, protesters said. Some demonstrators were seen attacking cars and property with baseball bats, Reuters reported. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters marched through the city. A small group threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' In a message posted on Twitter, police urged people in Kenosha, a city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan, to ""stay off the streets"". Buildings and cars have been burned. A state of emergency has also been declared in Wisconsin. Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland, Oregon and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May sparked Black Lives Matter protests across the US and globally. The Toronto Raptors basketball team, who won last year's NBA championship, have discussed potentially boycotting an upcoming conference semifinal game in response to Mr Blake's shooting. Player Norman Powell said the situation had gotten to a point where just saying ""Black Lives Matter"" was not enough. ""I think everybody's at the point of sitting up here and saying 'Black Lives Matter' and sitting up having discussions and Zoom calls... That's not getting the job done. Taking a knee for the anthem, that's not getting the job done."" Lawyer Ben Crump told a press conference on Tuesday that doctors said Mr Blake had been paralysed by the shooting. ""His family believe in miracles, but the medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralysed and, because those bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered some of his vertebrae, it is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,"" he said. The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death of George Floyd. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident shows Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Mr Blake's father has said he does not have confidence in the investigation. ""Anybody that is white, that is doing an investigation about a black young man that was shot seven times in his back, and haven't come up with an answer or a comment at this point, is not welcome,"" he told reporters.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has blamed a ""mutant algorithm"" for this summer's exam results fiasco. ""I am afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm and I know how stressful that must have been,"" he told pupils at a school. An algorithm - a maths calculation - was initially used to determine A-level and GCSE results this year but it was scrapped after problems emerged. The top civil servant at the Department for Educationhas also now been sacked. Jonathan Slater was due to stand down next year, but will now leave the department by next week. Read more: Chief civil servant sacked after exams row How did the exam algorithm decide grades? What went wrong with the exam algorithm? Mr Johnson made his comments about the algorithm during a visit to a secondary school in Coalville, Leicestershire, on Wednesday. The National Education Union (NEU) called Mr Johnson's comments ""brazen"" and accused him of trying to ""idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created"". The prime minister had previously defended the controversial exam results as a ""robust set of grades"". His government later made a U-turn following anger over the algorithm and decided to use predicted grades from teachers instead. Speaking to pupils earlier, Mr Johnson empathised with the problems young people had faced with their exam grades but said he was ""very, very glad that it has finally been sorted out"". Results for this year's exams were caught up in confusion The prime minister said education was the ""great liberator"" and the biggest risk for young people was not Covid-19 - but was ""continuing to be out of school"". Mr Johnson told pupils they needed to be in school to think about ideas and questions - such as ""Is Harry Potter sexist? The answer is no, by the way."" Ofqual chief steps down after exam chaos Record results for GCSE with estimated grades 'Huge mess' over exam appeals But the remarks on exam problems angered the biggest teachers' union, who saw it as evading responsibility. Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the NEU, said parents and teachers would be ""horrified to see the leader of this country treat his own exams fiasco like some minor passing fad"". ""It is certain to put a long-lasting dent in the government's reputation on education."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The exam chaos has also led to the Boris Johnson removing the most senior civil servant at the Department for Education, permanent secretary Jonathan Slater. A statement said ""the prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"" at the department. The role as the department's most senior civil servant will be taken on in an interim basis by Susan Acland-Hood. It follows theresignation of Sally Collier as head of the Ofqual exam watchdogfor England. So what does the departure of Jonathan Slater mean - and why does it matter? For his union, the FDA - and for Labour - it is straightforwardly a sign that, when things go wrong, the buck now firmly stops with the officials and not government ministers. Angry Conservative MPs were being privately reassured that ""heads would roll"" after the exams controversy - and both a senior civil servant, and the head of Ofqual, have now departed while Gavin Williamson and his education ministers remain in post. But something of a pattern is emerging. In February the most senior official at the Home Office resigned - and took the government to court claiming there had been a ""vicious and orchestrated campaign"" against him. Other senior civil servants have made less of a fuss but have nonetheless left their jobs: the most senior Whitehall mandarin - Sir Mark Sedwill - recently moved; the head of the Foreign Office announced an earlier than expected departure; and it was announced last month that the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice would be leaving, too. Cabinet office minister Michael Gove has talked about reforming the civil service - in a speech in June, he said government departments recruited in their own image and their assumptions were ""inescapably metropolitan"". So a strategic rethink and an increased turnover of senior Whitehall personnel are probably not entirely unrelated. But what might worry senior civil servants more is that they might be sacrificed for short term news management, rather than as the result of a strategic master plan. And there is a risk this, in turn, might affect the quality of those who apply for senior civil service roles. Both departures followed the high-profile problems caused by replacement grades for A-levels, GCSEs and vocational qualifications for exams cancelled in the pandemic. This focused on an ""algorithm"" which was accused of producing unfair results - which after a U-turn was replaced by teachers' estimated grades. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""It is abundantly clear that things have not gone well at the Department for Education and Ofqual, culminating in the debacle over this year's GCSE and A-level grades. ""But it is pretty unsavoury that civil servants appear to be carrying the can while ministers remain unscathed."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said: ""Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools.""

"More than half a million people have been told to get out of the path of Hurricane Laura Hurricane Laura is expected to cause an ""unsurvivable"" storm surge, extreme winds and floods as it hits the US, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) says. The category four storm is approaching Texas and Louisiana with maximum sustained wind speeds of 150 miles per hour (240km/h). If it maintains those speeds it would be one of the strongest storms to ever hit the US south coast. Half a million residents have been told to leave the area. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT)the centre of the hurricane was 65 miles (105km) south east of Port Arthur,externalin Texas. Laura and another storm, Marco, earlier hit the Caribbean, killing 24. Marco has already struck Louisiana, bringing strong winds and heavy rain on Monday. Initiallyit was feared that both storms would hit Louisiana as hurricanes within 48 hours of each other- an unprecedented event - but Marco was downgraded to a tropical storm. This video can not be played Hurricane Laura approaches Texas Laura, on the other hand, has strengthened rapidly from a category three, gaining 70% in power in just 24 hours, to a category four, maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). It is now close to becoming a category five storm, which would mean maximum sustained winds of 158mph (254km/h). Hurricane Katrina - which devastated New Orleans in 2005, killing more than 1,800 people - was a category five storm before weakening to a category three when made landfall in the US. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms Warming makes bigger hurricanes more damaging US President Donald Trumptold those potentially affected by the storm to ""listen to local officials"",externalas the storm was ""very dangerous and rapidly intensifying"". Evacuations are complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged families who could afford it to take refuge in hotels and motels to be distanced from others. Early on Wednesday the NHC said satellite images had shown that Laura had undergone a remarkable intensification to become a ""formidable hurricane"". In a series of tweets, it said Laura was expected to bring ""life-threatening hazards"" and an ""unsurvivable storm surge"" to parts of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Well-built homes could incur major damage, trees could be snapped or uprooted and electricity and water would be unavailable for days or even weeks, it said. ""Hurricane force winds and widespread damaging wind gusts will also spread well inland into portions of eastern Texas and western Louisiana early Thursday,"" the NHC added. Allow Twitter content?

Storm surges of more than 20ft (6m) are possible. In an update at 14:00 local time, the NHC reported 3.2ft of inundation already on parts of the Louisiana coast. ""To think that there would be a wall of water over two storeys high coming on shore is very difficult for most to conceive, but that is what is going to happen,"" said National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott. ""The word 'unsurvivable' is not one that we like to use, and it's one that I've never used before,"" he added. Governor Abbott urged people in the path of the storm to ""take advantage of these final few hours to evacuate"". ""The power of Hurricane Laura is unprecedented, and Texans must take action now to get out of harm's way and protect themselves,"" he said. Laura is expected to reach landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border between midnight and 02:00 local time on Thursday (07:00 GMT). The National Weather Service has also issueda tornado watch for parts of Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi,external. A man boards up a Louisiana store as the state braces itself for Hurricane Laura More than 420,000 Texas residents have been ordered to leave, while an additional 200,000 were told to evacuate Calcasieu Parish in south-western Louisiana. Port Arthur, Texas, is home to the nation's largest oil refinery, and workers have been taken off at least 310 offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, reducing oil production by 84% for a second day in a row, officials said. Marco and Laura brought high winds and rough seas to the Caribbean, leaving at least 24 people dead, including a baby and an eight-year-old child in Haiti. Heavy rains have also battered parts of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and the US territory of Puerto Rico. President Trump declared a state of disaster in the territory on Saturday. Laura has brought rough seas and high winds to the Caribbean, including here in Havana, Cuba In Cuba, authorities have evacuated at least 160,000 people from several coastal regions, while thousands have been evacuated in the Dominican Republic.

"The fossil was found in rock on the shoreline of Eigg A scientist has discovered a 166 million-year-old dinosaur fossil while running along the shore of a small Scottish island. Dr Elsa Panciroli was running to meet up with her palaeontology research team on Eigg when she made the discovery. In Scotland, dinosaur bone fossils had only previously been found on the Isle of Skye. The limb bone is about 50cm (19in) long and thought to belong to a stegosaurian dinosaur, like the stegosaurus. 'First' dinosaur footprints on mainland Skye dinosaur prints 'globally important' New study of Jurassic animal found in Skye Scientists have been searching for dinosaur fossils on the island for about 200 years. Previously the only fossils found on Eigg were of marine reptiles and fish. Dr Panciroli said the research team was looking for these fossils and had not expected to find evidence of a dinosaur. Her discovery has been dated to the Middle Jurassic period. Dr Elsa Panciroli made the chance discovery Dr Panciroli, who works at National Museums Scotland, said: ""It was a bit of a serendipitous discovery. ""It was the near the end of the day and I was running to catch up with the rest of the members of the team, who were quite far away. ""I realised I had run over something that didn't look right. It wasn't clear exactly what kind of animal it belonged to at the time, but there was no doubt it was a dinosaur bone."" Dr Panciroli's illustration of what the dinosaur looked like She said it was ""hugely significant"" find, adding: ""Globally, Middle Jurassic fossils are rare and until now the only dinosaur fossils found in Scotland were on the Isle of Skye. ""This bone is 166 million years old and provides us with evidence that stegosaurs were living in Scotland at this time."" The fossil is now in a museum in Edinburgh Dr Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Elsa's discovery of this bone is really remarkable. ""This fossil is additional evidence that plate-backed stegosaurs used to roam Scotland, which corroborates footprints from the Isle of Skye that we identified as being made by a stegosaur."" The bone is now in the collections of National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh.

The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death of George Floyd. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident shows Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Mr Blake's father has said he does not have confidence in the investigation. ""Anybody that is white, that is doing an investigation about a black young man that was shot seven times in his back, and haven't come up with an answer or a comment at this point, is not welcome,"" he told reporters.

"Masks will be required in secondary schools in other parts of the UK It will be up to schools and councils to decide if face coverings are used in Welsh schools. Masks are now recommended for children aged 11 and up in communal areas indoors where social distancing is difficult, and on school buses.

He denied that the Welsh Government was putting the responsibility for masks on headteachers. Vaughan Gething (pictured) said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not work in Wales Speaking to the BBC News Channel, he said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not take into account differences between schools built in the last decade - which have bigger corridors - to those that are older.

"Residents woke up to the sight of dead dolphins At least 17 dead dolphins have been found on the coast of Mauritius, prompting debates about whether a recent oil spill was to blame. Environmental campaigners say the deaths were either caused by the oil spill from a Japanese-owned ship or by authorities sinking part of the vessel. But the fisheries minister said ""at first glance"" the deaths appeared to be unconnected to the spill. He said at least two of the dolphins had shark bites. The carcasses are currently undergoing a post-mortem. It is rare for so many dead dolphins to be found at the same time. Two were found in May 2019. These are the first reported deaths of dolphins since the shipwreck. Up to now, many fish and crabs have been found dead. The sight of the dolphins caused anger among residents. Many tourists swim with dolphins in Mauritius ""Waking up this morning to witness so many dead dolphins on our seashore is worse than a nightmare,"" resident Nitin Jeeha told the BBC. ""I have seen around eight to 10 dead dolphins. Are there more in the lagoon?"" Although many of the dolphins were found dead, some were discovered weak or dying on the shore. Environmental activists told the BBC they thought so. Africa Live: News and views from the continent Why the Mauritius oil spill is so serious What is Mauritius like? The MV Wakashio ran aground on coral reef on 25 July at Pointe d'Esny, a known sanctuary for rare wildlife. The area contains wetlands designated as a site of international importance by the Ramsar convention on wetlands. Oceanographer Vassen Kauppaymuthoo said the dolphins smelled of fuel. ""In my opinion, this situation will continue to deteriorate as time goes on,"" he was quoted by local media as saying. Environmentalist Sunil Dowarkasing said either the oil spill from the bulk carrier or the sinking of its bow last week caused the deaths. The authorities decided to sink the bow of the vessel last week ""The scuttling probably disturbed marine mammals in their natural habitat. There will be after-effects, and this is just the beginning,"" Mr Dowarkasing added. Greenpeace Africa has warned that ""thousands"" of animal species are ""at risk of drowning in a sea of pollution, with dire consequences for Mauritius's economy, food security and health"". But Sudheer Maudhoo, the nation's fisheries minister, said initial tests on the dolphins indicated that there was no link between the oil spill and their deaths. He noted that there were shark bites on at least two of the mammals but further tests would be needed to identify the cause.

"Secondary schools in England might be using face masks after a change of policy Secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors in local lockdown areas of England, after the government reversed its guidance. Head teachers in any secondary school will also have the ""flexibility"" to introduce masks in their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it followed updated advice from the World Health Organization. But Labour accused the government of ""passing the buck"" on decisions back to schools. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new guidance meant that in coronavirus ""hot spot"" areas that ""it probably does make sense in confined areas outside the classroom to use a face covering in the corridor and elsewhere"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says face coverings should be worn ""outside the classroom"" in secondary schools in hotspot areas The change in rules, announced on Tuesday night, will not mean face coverings in the classroom - which Mr Johnson said would have been ""nonsensical"" as ""you can't teach with face coverings and you can't expect people to learn with face coverings."" Mr Johnson, at a school in Leicestershire, told pupils their exam grades were ""almost derailed by a mutant algorithm"" and the biggest risk to them was not Covid-19, but ""continuing to be out of school"". His comments came just before the government announced a change in the leadership at the top of the Department for Education. The most senior civil servant in the department, permanent secretary Jonathan Slater, has been asked to stand down. A statement said the prime minister had concluded there was ""a need for fresh official leadership at the Department for Education"". It added: ""Jonathan Slater has therefore agreed that he will stand down on 1 September in advance of the end of his tenure in Spring 2021."" The policy switch on face coverings, so near to the return to school, had drawn criticism from some Conservative MPs. Huw Merriman said the use of face coverings sent ""the wrong message"" which suggested ""schools are not a safe setting"". Late U-turn on face masks frustrates teachers PM says 'vitally important' pupils back in school Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? Ditch truancy fines, say doctors as pupils return Mr Williamson insisted the government was listening ""to the latest medical and scientific advice"" and taking ""the most precautionary approach"". The Department for Education says it is still keeping its recommendation against using face coverings - but that secondary schools will now be able to make their own decisions whether to ask pupils and staff to wear them. This will be in ""communal areas"" of schools such as corridors, where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, and when schools ""believe that is right in their particular circumstances"". But in parts of the country with high levels of coronavirus transmission, such asthose with local lockdown,externalmeasures, face coverings will be compulsory in such communal areas for adults and pupils. The return to school in Germany - but the PM says masks would be ""nonsensical"" in classrooms and would disrupt learning The new guidelines, which apply from 1 September, also warn that ""stricter guidance"" on face coverings could apply to all schools ""if the rate of transmission increases across the whole country"". On Wednesday the Department for Education said all schools would be supplied with 10 coronavirus testing kits, to be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" when no other way of testing is available. They would also be given a ""small amount"" of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as aprons, gloves, visors and clinical face masks. The change on face coverings follows the WHO updating its advice last week, which now recommends thatchildren aged over 12 should wear masksunder the same conditions as adults. The government had been under pressure over face coverings in England's schools - with secondary schools in Scotland to use them in corridors and communal areas from next week. Northern Ireland isalso now recommending face coveringsfor secondary school corridors, while Wales has left the decision up to head teachers, but highlights advice which recommends them inside where social distancing cannot be maintained, including on school transport. The ASCL head teachers' union had warned of confusion about the rules over face coverings - and said there was a lack of clarity over how schools should respond if teachers or pupils wanted to wear masks. This video can not be played Tulip Siddiq says the government must give âclearer guidanceâ on students wearing face masks in English schools After the government's change of policy, the union's leader, Geoff Barton, said school leaders would ""welcome the flexibility"" of being able to ""decide what best suits their circumstances"". But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""It is neither helpful or fair to ask school leaders to make individual decisions about face coverings in their school. Such decisions should rest with public health officials."" Kevin Courtney, of the National Education Union, welcomed ""the steps now being taken"" but criticised the ""slow, incoherent"" way the decision had been reached - and said it would not inspire confidence with parents or teachers. Conservative MP Huw Merriman said the change in guidance was ""causing uncertainty"". ""My concern is that we just keep making this up as we go along,"" the Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the government ""needs to get a grip"". Asked whether he took responsibility for the decisions made on face coverings and exam grades, Mr Williamson admitted it had been ""incredibly difficult and incredibly tough"". ""At every stage, everyone takes responsibility for what they do and how they approach things and what we're focused on is making sure we deliver the best for children right across the country,"" he told BBC Breakfast. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Some parents said they wanted to see face coverings mandatory in communal areas of all secondary schools. Pamela Allen, from Canterbury, said her son's secondary school had told her it would be following government guidance and would not require face coverings to be worn. ""I think [the government] should be leading the charge against the virus as opposed to reacting to it if there is a local lockdown,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make us feel confident that we are sending our children to as safe a place as we can."" She added she would be sending her son to school with a face covering to wear between lessons. A teacher in Northern Ireland wearing a visor as pupils return to school Despite the official guidance against face coverings, some schools had already been preparing to use them. The Oasis academy trust, with more than 50 schools in England, is to provide visors for its teachers - and secondary pupils were going to have to wear masks in corridors. Steve Chalke, chief executive of the trust, said there was a responsibility to make schools ""as safe as we possibly can"" - and that meant using masks and visors. He said that masks might increase the confidence of parents ""nervous"" about sending their children back to school. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said face coverings should be compulsory in communal areas of schools. ""Instead of this half baked U-turn, the government should have given clear guidance and a plan to deliver it,"" she said.

"The fossil was found in rock on the shoreline of Eigg A scientist has discovered a 166 million-year-old dinosaur fossil while running along the shore of a small Scottish island. Dr Elsa Panciroli was running to meet up with her palaeontology research team on Eigg when she made the discovery. In Scotland, dinosaur bone fossils had only previously been found on the Isle of Skye. The limb bone is about 50cm (19in) long and thought to belong to a stegosaurian dinosaur, like the stegosaurus. 'First' dinosaur footprints on mainland Skye dinosaur prints 'globally important' New study of Jurassic animal found in Skye Scientists have been searching for dinosaur fossils on the island for about 200 years. Previously the only fossils found on Eigg were of marine reptiles and fish. Dr Panciroli said the research team was looking for these fossils and had not expected to find evidence of a dinosaur. Her discovery has been dated to the Middle Jurassic period. Dr Elsa Panciroli made the chance discovery Dr Panciroli, who works at National Museums Scotland, said: ""It was a bit of a serendipitous discovery. ""It was the near the end of the day and I was running to catch up with the rest of the members of the team, who were quite far away. ""I realised I had run over something that didn't look right. It wasn't clear exactly what kind of animal it belonged to at the time, but there was no doubt it was a dinosaur bone."" Dr Panciroli's illustration of what the dinosaur looked like She said it was ""hugely significant"" find, adding: ""Globally, Middle Jurassic fossils are rare and until now the only dinosaur fossils found in Scotland were on the Isle of Skye. ""This bone is 166 million years old and provides us with evidence that stegosaurs were living in Scotland at this time."" The fossil is now in a museum in Edinburgh Dr Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Elsa's discovery of this bone is really remarkable. ""This fossil is additional evidence that plate-backed stegosaurs used to roam Scotland, which corroborates footprints from the Isle of Skye that we identified as being made by a stegosaur."" The bone is now in the collections of National Museums Scotland in Edinburgh.

This was driven by falls in reported thefts and burglary, the ONS said. Butthe ONS said,externaldrug crime rose by up to 44% compared with the same period last year, due to targeted policing. A survey also suggests the vast majority of adults (91%) are satisfied with the way police have dealt with the coronavirus restrictions. The figures, which are based on telephone research, support earlier data from police forces of a significant decline in offending during April and May. The ONS data shows drug offences recorded by police rose by 22% in April to 16,570 and 44% in May to 20,687, compared with 13,535 and 14,343 for the respective months in 2019. Can police make me wear a face mask or covering? Rape convictions at record low in England and Wales Fears Covid could fuel youth violence rise The ONS report linked this to ""proactive police activity in pursuing these crimes during lockdown"". It said the rises were driven largely by drugs possession offences with ""early indications"" suggesting this was ""particularly evident"" in London, where the Metropolitan Police had increased the number of drugs-related stop and searches it was carrying out during that time. Meanwhile, there was a 57% rise in computer misuse offences compared with the two-month average from July to December 2019. The ONS said the increase was not ""statistically significant"" because of the small sample size and it will be explored further. Overall police-recorded crime during the coronavirus lockdown was 25% lower in April and 20% lower in May compared with the same period in 2019. It also fell 5% in March compared with February, the research found. Reports of theft fell in April and May to ""almost half the level recorded"" during those months in the previous year, the ONS said. But reports of crime rose again as lockdown restrictions began to ease. Billy Gazard, from the ONS Centre for Crime and Justice, said the ""significant"" fall in crime at the height of the coronavirus lockdown in England and Wales ""was driven by reductions in theft offences, particularly domestic burglary and theft of personal property"". He added that the findings were ""not unexpected"" as the period coincided with the majority of people spending long periods at home. But he said the exception was police recording of drug offences, adding: ""This reflects proactive police activity as overall crime levels reduced."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The report gives the first official indication of some police-recorded crime figures since the pandemic took hold in the UK. However, its findings are limited due to the difficulties in gathering statistics posed by the circumstances caused by the pandemic and because some figures are not yet available. For example, police reports of domestic abuse are recorded quarterly, so official figures indicating the prevalence of this crime during lockdown have not yet been made public.

"Masks will be required in secondary schools in other parts of the UK It will be up to schools and councils to decide if face coverings are used in Welsh schools. Masks are now recommended for children aged 11 and up in communal areas indoors where social distancing is difficult, and on school buses. But Wednesday's Welsh Government announcement did not make their use compulsory. Opposition parties and some education unions accused ministers of passing the responsibility to schools. That was denied by Health Minister Vaughan Gething, who said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not work in Wales. Risk assessments will need to be done to decide if schools or colleges need to ask pupils to wear face coverings. ScotlandandNorthern Irelandare mandating the use of face coverings in secondary school corridors and communal areas. They will be required in secondary school corridors in parts of England under local lockdown,after a U-turn. 'Late' U-turn on school masks frustrates teachers Crime in England and Wales falls during lockdown One further death with coronavirus in Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford told a Senedd meeting there was a ""part to be played"" for face masks in secondary schools in areas that see rising coronavirus cases, and where buildings do not allow pupils to move around safely. In a joint statement issued later by Mr Gething and Education Minister Kirsty Williams, the pair said guidance was being changed to require schools, colleges and councils ""to undertake risk assessments of their estates to determine if face coverings should be recommended for their staff and young people in communal areas"". ""This will also include school and college transport."" The World Health Organisation has updated its advice on face masks for young people It said that Chief Medical Officer Frank Atherton had recommended face coverings ""for all members of the public over 11 years in indoor settings in which social distancing cannot be maintained, including schools and school transport"". It said face-to-face teaching without coverings can continue with social distancing. What are the rules for masks in schools? Are teachers more at risk of coronavirus? How are other countries getting children back to class? Governments in the UK have changed their guidance on face masks in schools after the World Health Organisation (WHO) said those over 12should wear masks in the same settings as adults. Teaching union NAHT Cymru said it was ""unacceptable that school leaders are expected to shoulder the responsibility of deciding if face coverings are required in schools"". ""Headteachers are not medical experts and the Welsh Government should not put them in this position,"" the union's director Laura Doel said. University and Colleges Union policy officer Jamie Insole also claimed ministers were passing the buck: ""College students are older than school pupils and ministers cannot simply try and pass on guidance for schools to colleges."" But David Evans, Wales Secretary of the National Education Union Cymru, welcomed the statement. ""To us the statement is clear - in areas where social distancing can't be maintained, face masks need to be worn by everyone over 11 years, including in schools and on school transport,"" he added. Joseph Carter, head of Asthma UK & British Lung Foundation Wales, said Wales was ""out of step with the rest of the UK"". ""Without a clear unified position, this will only lead to confusion and uncertainty for teachers, parents, and pupils,"" he said. The Welsh Government has always taken a different approach to mandating face coverings from their counterparts in the rest of the UK, and that pattern continues here. It's not clear whether leaving it to school leaders to make the decision according to the physical layout of each school will reassure parents or disturb them. With schools returning next week we'll soon find out. But different rules in different schools seems to be exactly what Labour in England doesn't like about the approach that Boris Johnson's government has taken there. Delyth Jewell, Plaid Cymru spokeswoman for the transformation of public services, said ""This is the latest example of the Welsh Government passing the buck rather than leading the way. ""It's not good enough that ministers aren't setting national policy."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said the Welsh Government announcement ""is the worst of both worlds, putting the responsibility on the shoulders of schools and councils, while trying to absolve itself of responsibility for the decision"". The way the Welsh Government publicised the decision - following the end of a day's virtual Senedd and not directly to Senedd politicians - was also criticised by the Welsh Conservatives. Vaughan Gething said a mandatory approach would not be appropriate in Wales while there were low levels of coronavirus in the country. He denied that the Welsh Government was putting the responsibility for masks on headteachers. Vaughan Gething (pictured) said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not work in Wales Speaking to the BBC News Channel, he said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not take into account differences between schools built in the last decade - which have bigger corridors - to those that are older. He added: ""In Wales, we continue to have very low transmission rates, that's why it's not appropriate for us to mandate a one-size-fits-all policy requiring face masks in every single school."" Mr Gething said there could be localised outbreaks that affect one school community but not others. The health minister agreed that schools had a ""shorter period of time than any of our schools would want"" to consider the risk assessments. ""The World Health Organisation provided their revised advice guidance within the last few days so the Welsh Government hasn't had a lot of time to consider this issue in further detail,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Business owner Tara Tomes: 'We're giving up our office forever' Fifty of the biggest UK employers questioned by BBC have said they have no plans to return all staff to the office full-time in the near future. Some 24 firms said that they did not have any plans in place to return workers to the office. However, 20 have opened their offices for staff unable to work from home. It comes as many employees return to work from the summer holidays with the reality of a prolonged period of home working becoming increasingly likely. The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place. Many companies said they were offering choice and flexibility to those who want to return, particularly in the banking and finance sectors. A few firms have already announced they have no plans to return to the office until late autumn, and Facebook has said it does not plan a return of employees until July 2021. Some smaller businesses are deciding to abandon their offices altogether. Tara Tomes runs a PR agency with an office in the heart of Birmingham's business district. Her team of eight cannot fit in the space they have if they are to obey social distancing guidelines and she will not be renewing the office lease in September. ""I personally don't want to force my team back onto public transport,"" she told the BBC. ""Not having four walls around us won't change the dynamic or culture of the team. If anything it will make us more pioneering in the way the world of work is going."" She said that the money saved on rent and utilities and the time spent not commuting were other benefits to giving up the office. 'I took a pay cut but at least I kept my jobâ Can I work from home overseas? This is what coronavirus will do to our offices and homes Fujitsu announces permanent work-from-home plan Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street acknowledged that the challenges facing city centre businesses were grave but said he was hopeful the climate would gradually improve. ""This is undeniably a very difficult situation for businesses that thrive on the back of the big office occupiers being there. What we are trying to do is steadily build confidence that it is safe to return to the city centre."" He said Birmingham's transport system was currently carrying about 20% of pre-covid numbers but that he hoped this would rise to 50% over the autumn. Still, that means that city centre footfall - which is the lifeblood of businesses that rely on office workers and commuters - would in the best case scenario be half of what it is in normal times. Naomi says the pandemic has been 'devastating' for her business That may be cold comfort to Naomi and her brother James who opened up a new coffee shop in the heart of Birmingham's business district earlier this year. They are now getting less than a fifth of the trade they were banking on. ""It's been devastating really,"" Naomi told the BBC. ""Office workers are absolutely critical to us. We are hoping things improve in September but if they don't we will have to rethink the whole business."" It is, however, too soon to announce the death of the office, according to Rob Groves from office developer Argent, which has just completed the construction of 120,000 feet of office space in Birmingham's Chamberlain Square. While he admitted that some would-be tenants were pressing the pause button, he also insisted there would always be a need for a workplace where people could congregate and collaborate. ""I'd like to challenge people saying they will never need an office and ask them in 12-18 months time whether that was the right decision or just a reaction to what's happening now."" Matthew Hammond, chairman of the Midlands region for PwC One of Argent's blue chip tenants agrees. Accounting and consultancy firm PwC has just moved into the property next door. It is supposed to house 2,000 people but is currently catering to just 150 each day. Nevertheless, Matthew Hammond, chairman of the Midlands region for PwC, said that the office was a must have, particularly for younger workers. ""We have colleagues who may be working at the end of their bed or on a return unit in their kitchen. That is not sustainable or healthy for the longer term. As employers we invest a huge amount in providing the right environment, the right seating, the right technology so people can be at their most productive."" Not everyone has deep enough pockets to afford such flexible working spaces. While many employees want the option of coming to the office, many now see home working as a right, according to Midlands recruitment specialist Kam Vara. ""For many candidates it's now a deal-breaker if there isn't an option for home working, and some are saying they want 100% home working with no physical contact with the office whatsoever."" The knock-on effects of these changes to the world of work could be enormous and long lasting. If people don't need to be in the office, they can be anywhere. And the cost of commuter season tickets and expensive suburban housing within commuting distance of big cities is an expense employers could deduct. Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street is optimistic that what we are witnessing is simply an age old tale of urban evolution, with Covid-19 holding down the fast forward button. ""The calling of the death of the office is very premature. Cities have repurposed themselves before over decades... the coronavirus has just speeded it up."" That may be so, but the short term shock to the city business model feels more like a cardiac arrest than a gentle evolution. And the reluctance on the part of both workers and employers to return to the office poses a grave economic threat to the future of city centres.

"This video can not be played Bereaved relatives call for inquiry: ""It wasn't good enough for our loved ones"" A group of 1,600 families bereaved by coronavirus have urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to meet them and to order a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. In a letter to Mr Johnson, the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group warns it is preparing legal action if he does not agree to such an inquiry. The group says this is the fifth time members have asked to meet the PM. Mr Johnson said he was ""not aware"" of the group's letters. However, he added he would meet anybody who has been bereaved. Following his comments, the group welcomed the prime minister's agreement to meet them but No 10 are yet to confirm that a meeting will take place. Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved families PM promises an independent coronavirus inquiry Calls grow for coronavirus inquiry In July, Mr Johnson said now was not the ""right moment"" for an inquiry. He went on to say: ""Of course we will seek to learn the lessons of this pandemic in the future and certainly we will have an independent inquiry into what happened."" The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group originally wrote to both the prime minister and the health secretary in June asking for a meeting, but say they have ""been met with an outright refusal to meet with the families or involve them in any review process"". They also accuse the government of ""a failure to commit to a rapid review as part of a statutory public inquiry"". Unlike other inquiries, a statutory public inquiry has the power to subpoena people and take evidence under oath. Group founder Jo Goodman says ""there is really no more time to waste"" when it comes to launching an inquiry into the coronavirus response Group co-founder Jo Goodman, whose father Stuart died of coronavirus, told the BBC an inquiry was important ""to learn lessons"" for possible future outbreaks. ""We feel that if different actions had been taken our loved ones could still be here,"" she said. ""Obviously it is now too late for our loved ones but we really feel compelled to speak out and ensure lessons are learnt to save other lives."" She said any meeting with the prime minister needed to happen ""within a matter of days"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says there will be an independent inquiry, but that now is not the time The group's letter says they will resort to taking legal action if the government refuses to order an inquiry ""with an immediate rapid review phase - where the government won't get to mark its own homework"". Leanne Devine, head of civil liberties at Broudie Jackson Canter, said a statutory public inquiry would ""ensure scrutiny and allow the families proper involvement in an independent process to determine what happened to their loved ones and to make recommendations for prevention of further loss of life"". ""These families are being denied access to justice,"" she said. Decisions over holding public inquiries are subject to judicial review and in 2013, the widow of Alexander Litvinenkosuccessfully challengedthe government's decision not to hold an inquiry into the death of her husband. Independent inquiries can take many forms - from full public inquiries that can take years, or in some cases decades, and cost millions of pounds; to smaller scale, more fleet-footed investigations. The idea is to hold the powerful to account and try to learn lessons from decisions that have gone wrong, and how to avoid repeating scandals and tragic events in the future. Recent examples of judge-led inquiries include the Leveson inquiry into media standards, or the ongoing inquiry into the Grenfell Tower catastrophe. Other inquiries, such as 2009 Iraq inquiry, headed by a retired senior civil servant Sir John Chilcot, do not take evidence under oath. The government of the day is normally expected to adopt many, if not all, of the recommendations of an official inquiry, although it does not always work out like that in practice.

University and Colleges Union policy officer Jamie Insole also claimed ministers were passing the buck: ""College students are older than school pupils and ministers cannot simply try and pass on guidance for schools to colleges."" But David Evans, Wales Secretary of the National Education Union Cymru, welcomed the statement. ""To us the statement is clear - in areas where social distancing can't be maintained, face masks need to be worn by everyone over 11 years, including in schools and on school transport,"" he added. Joseph Carter, head of Asthma UK & British Lung Foundation Wales, said Wales was ""out of step with the rest of the UK"". ""Without a clear unified position, this will only lead to confusion and uncertainty for teachers, parents, and pupils,"" he said. The Welsh Government has always taken a different approach to mandating face coverings from their counterparts in the rest of the UK, and that pattern continues here. It's not clear whether leaving it to school leaders to make the decision according to the physical layout of each school will reassure parents or disturb them. With schools returning next week we'll soon find out. But different rules in different schools seems to be exactly what Labour in England doesn't like about the approach that Boris Johnson's government has taken there. Delyth Jewell, Plaid Cymru spokeswoman for the transformation of public services, said ""This is the latest example of the Welsh Government passing the buck rather than leading the way. ""It's not good enough that ministers aren't setting national policy."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said the Welsh Government announcement ""is the worst of both worlds, putting the responsibility on the shoulders of schools and councils, while trying to absolve itself of responsibility for the decision"". The way the Welsh Government publicised the decision - following the end of a day's virtual Senedd and not directly to Senedd politicians - was also criticised by the Welsh Conservatives. Vaughan Gething said a mandatory approach would not be appropriate in Wales while there were low levels of coronavirus in the country. He denied that the Welsh Government was putting the responsibility for masks on headteachers. Vaughan Gething (pictured) said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not work in Wales Speaking to the BBC News Channel, he said a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" would not take into account differences between schools built in the last decade - which have bigger corridors - to those that are older. He added: ""In Wales, we continue to have very low transmission rates, that's why it's not appropriate for us to mandate a one-size-fits-all policy requiring face masks in every single school."" Mr Gething said there could be localised outbreaks that affect one school community but not others. The health minister agreed that schools had a ""shorter period of time than any of our schools would want"" to consider the risk assessments. ""The World Health Organisation provided their revised advice guidance within the last few days so the Welsh Government hasn't had a lot of time to consider this issue in further detail,"" he said.

"Secondary schools in England might be using face masks after a change of policy Secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors in local lockdown areas of England, after the government reversed its guidance. Head teachers in any secondary school will also have the ""flexibility"" to introduce masks in their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it followed updated advice from the World Health Organization. But Labour accused the government of ""passing the buck"" on decisions back to schools. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the new guidance meant that in coronavirus ""hot spot"" areas that ""it probably does make sense in confined areas outside the classroom to use a face covering in the corridor and elsewhere"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says face coverings should be worn ""outside the classroom"" in secondary schools in hotspot areas The change in rules, announced on Tuesday night, will not mean face coverings in the classroom - which Mr Johnson said would have been ""nonsensical"" as ""you can't teach with face coverings and you can't expect people to learn with face coverings."" Mr Johnson, at a school in Leicestershire, told pupils their exam grades were ""almost derailed by a mutant algorithm"" and the biggest risk to them was not Covid-19, but ""continuing to be out of school"". His comments came just before the government announced a change in the leadership at the top of the Department for Education. The most senior civil servant in the department, permanent secretary Jonathan Slater, has been asked to stand down. A statement said the prime minister had concluded there was ""a need for fresh official leadership at the Department for Education"". It added: ""Jonathan Slater has therefore agreed that he will stand down on 1 September in advance of the end of his tenure in Spring 2021."" The policy switch on face coverings, so near to the return to school, had drawn criticism from some Conservative MPs. Huw Merriman said the use of face coverings sent ""the wrong message"" which suggested ""schools are not a safe setting"". Late U-turn on face masks frustrates teachers PM says 'vitally important' pupils back in school Will all UK pupils have to wear face coverings? Ditch truancy fines, say doctors as pupils return Mr Williamson insisted the government was listening ""to the latest medical and scientific advice"" and taking ""the most precautionary approach"". The Department for Education says it is still keeping its recommendation against using face coverings - but that secondary schools will now be able to make their own decisions whether to ask pupils and staff to wear them. This will be in ""communal areas"" of schools such as corridors, where it is difficult to maintain social distancing, and when schools ""believe that is right in their particular circumstances"". But in parts of the country with high levels of coronavirus transmission, such asthose with local lockdown,externalmeasures, face coverings will be compulsory in such communal areas for adults and pupils. The return to school in Germany - but the PM says masks would be ""nonsensical"" in classrooms and would disrupt learning The new guidelines, which apply from 1 September, also warn that ""stricter guidance"" on face coverings could apply to all schools ""if the rate of transmission increases across the whole country"". On Wednesday the Department for Education said all schools would be supplied with 10 coronavirus testing kits, to be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" when no other way of testing is available. They would also be given a ""small amount"" of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as aprons, gloves, visors and clinical face masks. The change on face coverings follows the WHO updating its advice last week, which now recommends thatchildren aged over 12 should wear masksunder the same conditions as adults. The government had been under pressure over face coverings in England's schools - with secondary schools in Scotland to use them in corridors and communal areas from next week. Northern Ireland isalso now recommending face coveringsfor secondary school corridors, while Wales has left the decision up to head teachers, but highlights advice which recommends them inside where social distancing cannot be maintained, including on school transport. The ASCL head teachers' union had warned of confusion about the rules over face coverings - and said there was a lack of clarity over how schools should respond if teachers or pupils wanted to wear masks. This video can not be played Tulip Siddiq says the government must give âclearer guidanceâ on students wearing face masks in English schools After the government's change of policy, the union's leader, Geoff Barton, said school leaders would ""welcome the flexibility"" of being able to ""decide what best suits their circumstances"". But Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ""It is neither helpful or fair to ask school leaders to make individual decisions about face coverings in their school. Such decisions should rest with public health officials."" Kevin Courtney, of the National Education Union, welcomed ""the steps now being taken"" but criticised the ""slow, incoherent"" way the decision had been reached - and said it would not inspire confidence with parents or teachers. Conservative MP Huw Merriman said the change in guidance was ""causing uncertainty"". ""My concern is that we just keep making this up as we go along,"" the Tory MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the government ""needs to get a grip"". Asked whether he took responsibility for the decisions made on face coverings and exam grades, Mr Williamson admitted it had been ""incredibly difficult and incredibly tough"". ""At every stage, everyone takes responsibility for what they do and how they approach things and what we're focused on is making sure we deliver the best for children right across the country,"" he told BBC Breakfast. FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Some parents said they wanted to see face coverings mandatory in communal areas of all secondary schools. Pamela Allen, from Canterbury, said her son's secondary school had told her it would be following government guidance and would not require face coverings to be worn. ""I think [the government] should be leading the charge against the virus as opposed to reacting to it if there is a local lockdown,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make us feel confident that we are sending our children to as safe a place as we can."" She added she would be sending her son to school with a face covering to wear between lessons. A teacher in Northern Ireland wearing a visor as pupils return to school Despite the official guidance against face coverings, some schools had already been preparing to use them. The Oasis academy trust, with more than 50 schools in England, is to provide visors for its teachers - and secondary pupils were going to have to wear masks in corridors. Steve Chalke, chief executive of the trust, said there was a responsibility to make schools ""as safe as we possibly can"" - and that meant using masks and visors. He said that masks might increase the confidence of parents ""nervous"" about sending their children back to school. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said face coverings should be compulsory in communal areas of schools. ""Instead of this half baked U-turn, the government should have given clear guidance and a plan to deliver it,"" she said.

"Ellie Anderson had her sperm frozen at the age of 14 in the hope of one day becoming a parent A Scottish woman is preparing to take legal action to prevent fertility doctors from destroying her transgender daughter's frozen sperm. Louise Anderson wants to use the frozen sperm of her daughter, Ellie, to produce a grandchild. Ellie, who lived in Stirling, died suddenly in July aged 16. She was transgender and identified as a girl. Ellie had her sperm frozen when she was 14 so she could eventually have her own biological children. Her mother wants to honour her wishes posthumously, using Ellie's sperm, an egg donor and a surrogate. Solicitors acting on Louise's behalf plan to take the case to the Court of Session in Edinburgh. Louise Anderson wants to use an egg donor and a surrogate to have her daughter's child Ms Anderson said Ellie had known she was transgender from an early age. ""As a teenager she delayed hormone blockers to save her sperm to enable her to have her own biological children. She had made me promise that if anything were to happen to her, her children would be brought into the world."" She told BBC Scotland: ""I am going to do everything I can to honour her wishes - not just for her but for anyone else who is caught in this position. It kind of sparked a little fire in my belly and I want to make her wishes come true."" Ellie's sperm was frozen at Glasgow Royal Infirmary Fertility Clinic but it has told Ms Anderson the sample cannot be retained. Under present UK human fertilisation rules, if Ellie was in a relationship when she died, her partner would have had the right to ask for her sperm to be retained. Her mother does not have that right. Lawyers may seek a court order preventing it from being destroyed. Solicitor Virgil Crawford, who is acting for Louise, said it was an ""unusual, interesting, important and complex legal issue"". ""What we're trying to achieve would be to get an order from the court that Ellie's mum would be entitled to make use of her sperm for the purpose that Ellie intended - that being to create a genetic child of hers and a grandchild for Ms Anderson."" Failing that, they would hope the court would say the existing law needs to be changed. Ellie Anderson identified as a girl from an early age David Obree, a fellow in medical ethics at the University of Edinburgh, told the BBC that he believes Ellie's transgender status is ""irrelevant"". He said: ""The key question is what did she intend the sperm to be used for? The question the court will need to look at is did she specifically consent or request that her sperm be used by a third party?"" Ellie, who had started taking female hormones, died in Forth Valley Hospital after falling ill in Lower Bridge Street, Stirling. She was a pupil at St Modan's RC High School and had secured a place at City of Glasgow College to study hairdressing. Her death is described as ""unascertained"". A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, which runs the fertility clinic, said: ""We are sorry to hear about this young woman's death and our sympathies are with her family. ""Glasgow Royal Infirmary Assisted Conception Services is licensed and regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. The storage of gametes (sperm) is managed in line with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (1990) and complies with the consents provided by the donors.""

"A survey suggests topless sunbathing is becoming less common in France France's interior minister has defended topless sunbathing after police asked a group of women on a Mediterranean beach to cover up. The three were approached by officers on the beach in Sainte-Marie-La-Mer following a complaint from a holidaying family. The incident generated a huge backlash against the officers. Backing the women, the minister, GÃ©rald Darmanin, tweeted: ""Freedom is a precious commodity"". He said it was wrong the women were asked to put on clothing. A press release posted on Facebook,externalby the Pyrenees-Orientales police said the incident happened last week. Two officers asked three people on the beach to cover their chests, after a request from a family concerned about children present. A brief history of the nipple The freedom to be topless Does the US have a problem with topless women? ""Guided by a desire for appeasement, the police asked the people concerned if they would agree to cover their chest after they explained the reason for their approach,"" it said. ""No municipal order forbids this practice [topless sunbathing] in Sainte-Marie-la-Mer."" Their action prompted a wave of criticism online. Some questioned a wave of ""prudishness"" sweeping France, while others questioned if the practice was now banned. People online questioned whether topless sunbathing was allowed or not Police spokeswomanLt Col Maddy Scheurer blamed the ""clumsiness"" of the two officers,externalfor the incident. ""You will always see me in uniform,"" she wrote, ""but the practice of topless tanning is allowed at the beach of Sainte-Marie-la-Mer."" While Mr Darmanin said it was wrong that the women were asked to cover up,he said it was ""normal for the administration to recognise its mistakes"",external. It is not illegal to sunbathe topless in France, although local authorities can ban the practice with directives about clothing. A survey by the website VieHealthy in 2019 showed the practice is less common in France now than it was in the past, and is less common than in other European countries. The survey said 22% of French women asked had sunbathed topless,external, compared with 48% of Spanish women and 34% of Germans.

"There had been no new deaths following a positive test reported in Scotland since 16 July The deaths of two people in Scotland are the country's first confirmed coronavirus fatalities in six weeks. It is the first time since 16 July that the deaths of patients who have tested positive for the virus has been recorded in daily figures. It brings the total number of deaths in Scotland under this measure to 2,494. However the death toll recorded by the National Records of Scotland, which includes both confirmed and suspected cases of Covid-19, stands at 4,222. It reported an additional six deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate between 17 and 23 August. Four of the deaths were in a care home and two were in a hospital, according to the NRS. Factory cluster cases in Coupar Angus up to 156 Seven test positive in Covid outbreak in Hawick Covid-19 in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Giving her daily update on coronavirus, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs the two deaths were a reminder that coronavirus was still a ""threat"" in Scotland. ""I think all of us have become used to hearing news of no deaths under these daily figures,"" Ms Sturgeon said. ""These two new deaths today are of course devastating for those who will be grieving the loss. But they should also be a reminder for all of us that the threat of Covid hasn't yet gone away"". The two deaths are of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 within the past 28 days. Scotland's first coronavirus deathwas reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March. The number of daily deaths following a positive test peaked at 84 on 15 April, with 83 deaths also reported on 29 April and 6 May. But the number has been mainly declining since early May and the figure has not increased at all for six weeks. The NRS death figures are higher because they count all death certificates that mention Covid-19, even if the person has not been tested for the virus. They include cases where the person has tested positive for the virus, and where it is suspected but not confirmed. Ms Sturgeon also reported that there had been 67 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Scotland in the last 24 hours.

"Online connections cannot fulfil all of our social needs ""Friendships can deteriorate very quickly if you don't invest in them - it probably only takes about three months,"" says evolutionary psychologist Prof Robin Dunbar. So the social strain of lockdown, while hopefully short-term, could have some long-term effects on some friendships, he says. In a paper in the Royal Society journal, Proceedings A, Prof Dunbar has delved into the ways in which our social connections will be changed by lockdown. The University of Oxford academic's insight into those effects comes from a social world far from Zoom quizzes and Whatsapp groups. The roots of our friendships, he says, lie in the social lives of non-human primates. Coronavirus: This is not the last pandemic Child psychologists highlight mental health risks of lockdown Fears for future of endangered chimps in Nigeria For some primates, life depends of being part of a stable group For many of those primates, strong social bonds - being part of a ""stable group"" - means protection from predators and rivals. That goes some way to revealing why many of us treasure our closest friends as though our lives depend on them. In our evolutionary history, they did. And those bonds require a great deal of maintenance. In both monkeys and humans, research shows that the quality of a relationship - measured by how likely a fellow monkey, ape or human is to step up and defend you - depends directly on the time invested in it. ""We have to see people surprisingly often to maintain a friendship,"" explains Prof Dunbar, from the University of Oxford. And, because nurturing friendships requires all that time and cognitive capacity, we can only keep up a limited number of social connections. ""In lockdown, many people are forming new friendships with people on their street and in their community for the first time,"" says Prof Dunbar. ""So when we emerge from lockdown, some of our more marginal friendships might be replaced by some of these new ones."" One impact of this is something that has been called ""relationship funnelling"" - an effect picked up by alarge survey that social scientists carried out in France during the highly restrictive lockdown there,external. Put simply, while some friendships were prioritised and even strengthened through care and increased communication, other more marginal connections just ""fizzled out"". One major problem resulting from this ""fizzling"" is any lasting impact on older people's friendships. ""When we're older, we generally find it more difficult to make new friends,"" says Prof Dunbar. ""And the biggest single factor affecting health, wellbeing, happiness - even the ability to survive surgery or illness - is the number of high-quality friendships you have."" So long as it is temporary, our closer, more valued friendships should survive intact through lockdown - reinforced at least in some part, by the time we are still able to spend with our friends online. Chimpanzees can spend hours grooming one other individual Dr Jenny Groarke from Queen's University, Belfast, has been studying loneliness during the pandemic. ""People are using digital modes of communication to meet their social needs, but they're less satisfied with the quality of this form relative to face-to-face contact,"" she says. ""[This] lower satisfaction with the quality of digital social contact, we found, was associated with higher loneliness."" This concurs with the findings of Prof Dunbar's research into social behaviour. There's no substitute, he says, for close, face-to-face encounters. Part of that is the human need for touch. ""People [in our surveys] also spoke about missing physical touch, and finding it 'bizarre' and 'not normal' to go so long without touching people,"" says Dr Groarke. We are not the only primates that hug And looking to our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees - touch is not only ""normal"", it's socially vital. Chimps often spend hours each day grooming one another. This close, strictly one-to-one, stroking and parasite-picking is not just about hygiene. Research shows it reinforces social bonds and triggers the brain to release innate, pain-relieving and pleasure-boosting chemicals called endorphins. However, as a large number of our modern human interactions move online, our own brains are still wired to respond to a similar gentle touch (providing, of course, that it is wholly invited and appropriate). We, like our primate cousins, have a specialised system of nerve fibres that pick up and transmit the sensation of touch from our skin to those endorphin-releasing bundles of brain cells. Scientists studying this touch-triggered system of pleasure have even carried out experiments revealing that the more ""human-like"" the sensation of being stroked on our forearm is, the ""more pleasant"" it feels. As researchers reported ina recently published study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology,external: ""Perceiving gentle touch as human appears to promote pleasure possibly because this serves to reinforce interpersonal contact as a means for creating and maintaining social bonds."" That gives new physiological meaning to the feeling of needing a hug from a friend. Eating and drinking together triggers the brain's ""pleasure centres"" ""We make physical contact all the time,"" says Prof Dunbar. ""There are strict natural rules about who we can touch, but with close friends and family, we pat on the back, we touch a shoulderâ¦ ""Because it's below the horizon of consciousness, we don't appreciate how important it is to us."" Fortunately though, for humans, there are other social activities that activate the brain's pleasure centres - many of which can be done at a social distance or online. Laughing, singing, dancing and eating and drinking alcohol together have all been found to release endorphins and play a role in the upkeep of our all-important social bonds. For most of us, Prof Dunbar says reassuringly, this time of social distance will be a sad but temporary frustration. But we will have to put in the time to repair locked-down relationships.

The government said it is looking to meet Mrs Harper at the ""earliest opportunity"", but a date has not yet been set. Plans for the meeting come after it was announced the Court of Appeal would hear an application on 28 October by Attorney General Suella Braverman toreview the sentences given to PC Andrew Harper's killers under the unduly lenient sentence scheme. PC Andrew Harper had been married just four weeks before he was killed Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett, the most senior judge in England and Wales, will preside over the hearing to consider whether the sentences handed down to the trio were not long enough. PC Harper's killers had been accused of murder but were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Henry Long, 19,was jailed for 16 years while his passengers Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18, were sentenced to 13 years each. A decision is yet to be made by the court as to when it will hear applications lodged last week by Bowers and Cole for permission to appeal against their manslaughter convictions and their sentences. Mrs Harper has raised 500,000 signatures as part of her campaign. The specific details of the law have not yet been set out, but the campaigners have confirmed it would only apply to the deaths of emergency workers in the line of duty. ""We are delighted that the Home Office have been in touch to arrange the important meeting with Home Secretary Priti Patel. This is vital and it's urgent,"" she said in a statement. Jessie Cole, Henry Long and Albert Bowers (L-R) were convicted of killing PC Harper Speaking toBBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: ""Our emergency service workers go out and do their jobs putting themselves at risk. ""I think if emergency workers are going to a situation where somebody has committed a crime and as a result of that situation they lose their life, then they [the perpetrators] need to be suitably dealt with and that's just not happening at the moment. ""Ultimately we want a life sentence.

"Police patrolled public spaces to ensure lockdown rules were being followed at the height of the pandemic Crime in England and Wales fell by almost a third in the first two full months of lockdown, according to the Office for National Statistics. This was driven by falls in reported thefts and burglary, the ONS said. Butthe ONS said,externaldrug crime rose by up to 44% compared with the same period last year, due to targeted policing. A survey also suggests the vast majority of adults (91%) are satisfied with the way police have dealt with the coronavirus restrictions. The figures, which are based on telephone research, support earlier data from police forces of a significant decline in offending during April and May. The ONS data shows drug offences recorded by police rose by 22% in April to 16,570 and 44% in May to 20,687, compared with 13,535 and 14,343 for the respective months in 2019. Can police make me wear a face mask or covering? Rape convictions at record low in England and Wales Fears Covid could fuel youth violence rise The ONS report linked this to ""proactive police activity in pursuing these crimes during lockdown"". It said the rises were driven largely by drugs possession offences with ""early indications"" suggesting this was ""particularly evident"" in London, where the Metropolitan Police had increased the number of drugs-related stop and searches it was carrying out during that time. Meanwhile, there was a 57% rise in computer misuse offences compared with the two-month average from July to December 2019. The ONS said the increase was not ""statistically significant"" because of the small sample size and it will be explored further. Overall police-recorded crime during the coronavirus lockdown was 25% lower in April and 20% lower in May compared with the same period in 2019. It also fell 5% in March compared with February, the research found. Reports of theft fell in April and May to ""almost half the level recorded"" during those months in the previous year, the ONS said. But reports of crime rose again as lockdown restrictions began to ease. Billy Gazard, from the ONS Centre for Crime and Justice, said the ""significant"" fall in crime at the height of the coronavirus lockdown in England and Wales ""was driven by reductions in theft offences, particularly domestic burglary and theft of personal property"". He added that the findings were ""not unexpected"" as the period coincided with the majority of people spending long periods at home. But he said the exception was police recording of drug offences, adding: ""This reflects proactive police activity as overall crime levels reduced."" FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? The report gives the first official indication of some police-recorded crime figures since the pandemic took hold in the UK. However, its findings are limited due to the difficulties in gathering statistics posed by the circumstances caused by the pandemic and because some figures are not yet available. For example, police reports of domestic abuse are recorded quarterly, so official figures indicating the prevalence of this crime during lockdown have not yet been made public.

"George Floyd's death sparked protests - and donations During the global anti-racism protests in the wake of George Floyd's death, corporations, celebrities and regular people chose to show support for the cause with donations eventually totalling billions of dollars. What comes next? There was a lot going on when Imam Makram El-Amin received a message from some out-of-town friends. His North Minneapolis mosque is home to Al-Maa'uun, a charity that runs food, work and housing programmes in a part of the city with some of the highest rates of disparity in the state. ""Healthcare, wealth gap, education, home ownership. Whatever. You pick it, we got it here. So there's no shortage of need,"" he says. Al-Maa'uun's resources were being stretched by economic shocks caused by the global coronavirus pandemic when Minneapolis was rocked by the 25 May killing ofGeorge Floyd, an unarmed black man whose death in police custody in that Midwestern city launched global protests. Even before those two tragedies - Floyd's death and the pandemic - Mr El-Amin says ""we were struggling mightily in this community to just get the support that everyday common residents needed"". Can viral videos stop police brutality? WATCH:  What happened when a city disbanded its police force? Why are African Americans hit so hard by virus? Then the turbulence and civil unrest in Minneapolis after Floyd's death meant some neighbourhood stores were closed, reducing access to groceries, essential items and medication for the community. At that time, Mr El-Amin took to Facebook with ""just a real time assessment of what was happening and what we were trying to do to combat it"". Soon, offers of help came from friends who told him there was deep concern across the US regarding Floyd's death, and on matters of policing, racism and injustice. Allow Instagram content?

People were ready to help groups that were doing work on the ground in the community, they told him. They helped the charity quickly craft an online fundraising campaign to take advantage of the moment, though the imam told them: ""Let's start small and if it grows, fantastic."" ""And my goodness. I was not expecting the response that we got."" The initial $25,000 (Â£19,650) goal was reached in 24 hours. In another six, they reached $50,000. The campaign eventually closed at $400,000, an amount Mr El-Amin calls a ""game changer"". Seven solutions to US police problems 'My son was also killed by police in Minneapolis' ""This is what we wanted all the time, this is what we prayed for, you know what I mean?"" he says. ""And this moment - as tragic as it is, as hurtful and traumatic as it is - has also blessed us in this moment in terms of being able to help more folks."" A memorial stands at the site of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis Al-Maa'uun was not alone in receiving the largesse of donors around the world seeking to make a difference in the wake of Floyd's death. Since 25 May, roughly $5bn in pledges and commitments were made to racial equity organisations, according to data compiled by Candid, which tracks and analyses global philanthropy. That accounts for over 50% of the racial equity funding that Candid has identified since 2008. The funds come from tech firms Google and Microsoft, finance firms like Morgan Stanley, and entertainment giants like Netflix and YouTube, celebrities and philanthropists, and are pledged to various causes like the Equal Justice Initiative, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the National Urban League. While donations have slowed in recent weeks with many big firms having made their commitments, foundation grants are now beginning to flow in, says Candid's corporate philanthropy manager Andrew Grabois, pointing to a recent $220m commitment by billionaire philanthropist George Soros' Open Society Foundations. This week MacKenzie Bezos, former wife of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos,said she had given over $585m in recent months,externalto racial equity causes as part of her broader philanthropic pursuits. Candid's accounting does not include small donations from individuals that flooded charities, bail funds and GoFundMe campaigns set up for George Floyd's family andfor the families of other black Americans killed in interactions with police. Mr Grabois does not believe they would come close to matching the billions in large corporate and celebrity pledges, but they will still be significant. ActBlue, an online small donations fundraising platform for progressive non-profits and Democrat candidates and committees, confirmed to the BBC that June was its biggest month since its 2004 founding in terms of the volume of donations, and that racial justice charities led the way. Among the most popular places to donate was community bail funds, which pay to free people held on bail and advocate for criminal justice reforms. This video can not be played Leonard, 73, shares his experiences growing up under Jim Crow laws with his nephew and great-nephew Driven in part by the online endorsement of celebrities like singer Lizzo, performer Janelle Monae and actor Don Cheadle, millions of dollars went to bail out protesters nationwide. The National Bail Fund Network - an organisation of over 60 community bail funds - has received over $80m in donations since late May, according to its director, Pilar Weiss. One member, the Minnesota Freedom Fund - a small local fund with an annual budget of about $200,000 - alone raised $35m in two weeks from some 900,000 donors worldwide. In early June they paused donations and, like a number of smaller nonprofits suddenly flooded with funds, referred potential donors to other charities doing work in the racial justice realm. Ms Weiss says while the donated dollar amounts are large ""the bail amounts are also large"", noting the recent total to bail out protesters in Oklahoma City came to $4m. It also allows the bail funds to post bail - an amount some people charged with crimes must pay in order to be released while they fight their case - for people with amounts set at higher levels, she says. Cities like New York showed support for the movement by painting Black Lives Matter on streets Unsurprisingly, the massive influx of donations has not escaped controversy. Millions were pledged - mostly in apparent error - to a California-based organisation called the Black Lives Matter Foundation, which had no affiliation to the broader Black Lives Matter movement. New York's attorney general later ordered the foundation to stop soliciting funds in the state and urged people to do their due diligence before giving. ActBlue had to debunk false online claims that donations to the charities linked to the Black Lives Matter movement were being funnelled to the Democratic campaigns. And the Minnesota Freedom Fund faced an online backlash with the hashtag #wheresthemoney trending as people questioned why they had only spent about $200,000 on bail in the two weeks despite raising millions. The fund released a statement urging donors to remember that ""scaling up to put this amount of resources to use with integrity takes time"". Tyrone Freeman, an assistant professor of philanthropic studies at the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, cautions that when a non-profit is ""suddenly confronted with a massive influx"" it's ""important that donors take a breath and have some grace, if you will"". Donors should remember the social change they wanted to help pursue with their money in ""not like an Amazon purchase"", he says. ""Social change is not going to show up on your doorstep. It takes time. Activism is a long-haul proposition. Activism is all about people, the process, keep showing up and moving an agenda forward. It can be slow work."" This video can not be played Activist explains plea for peaceful protests For some charities, he compares it to a life-changing lottery win, saying ""things will be very different for you tomorrow and you probably want to slow down and capture a sense of how to move forward before you get out there and go crazy with all the money"". For Al-Maa'uun, their influx has allowed them to hire extra staff, including potential permanent positions, to bolster their affordable housing, mentoring and community organising work and to respond to immediate needs in ""a larger way"", says Mr El-Amin. It has heightened their profile, allowing them to look into building collaborations around bringing medical services and legal aid into the neighbourhood. They also want to nurture the relationship with their 7,000 new donors, hoping to get them both to share ideas and to help amplify Al-Maa'uun's message. ""This really gives us an opportunity and space to be able to do that,"" says Mr El-Amin. ""Ultimately make us much stronger down the road.""

"Rules around face coverings are easing across the UK, but they are still required in some settings. Heathrow Airport and a number of airlines are relaxing their rules on masks. But Nicola Sturgeon has said face coverings must still be worn in Scotland after all other legal requirements are lifted on 21 March. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasconfirmed that Scotland's rules on face coverings will remain in place until April, due to a rise in Covid cases. All other restrictions on businesses and services will move from legal requirement to guidance on 21 March. The rules on masks will be reviewed again on 29 March, and are expected to be converted to guidance by 4 April. At the moment,masks must be worn,externalin most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising). They are mandatory in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, as well as in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. They no longer have to be worn bysecondary school students in the classroom- but are still required in ""indoor communal areas"" like corridors. Under-12s are exempt.

"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police The police shooting of a black man in the state of Wisconsin has led to fresh unrest in US cities. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back as he entered a car where his three children were seated. His family say he has been left paralysed from the waist down - although doctors do not know if it is permanent. The protests turned violent two days after the incident, when two people killed and one injured in a shooting. A 17-year-old has been arrested. The shooting of Mr Blake was captured on video - happened shortly after 17:00 on Sunday 23 August. It was only on Wednesday that authorities gave some details about the incident. Wisconsin's Attorney-General Josh Kaul identified the officer involved as Rusten Sheskey. Three facts about African-Americans and US criminal justice 'Black people have been through a lot this year' Mr Kaul said officers had been called to an address after a woman reported that ""her boyfriend was present and was not supposed to be on the premises"". While there, they tried to arrest Mr Blake, initially using a taser. After Mr Blake opened his car door, Mr Sheskey - who has been in the Kenosha Police Department for seven years - fired seven shots into Mr Blake's back. ""No other officer fired their weapon,"" Mr Kaul said. Mr Blake has since told investigators that he had a knife in his possession, and Mr Kaul said officers ""recovered a knife from the driver's side floorboard"" of his car. They found no other weapon in the vehicle. This video can not be played The US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin The person who shot the video, Raysean White, told CNN that before he began filming, he saw police wrestle, punch and taser Mr Blake. It was then that he started recording. Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males. As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr White told AP news agency that he heard police officers shout ""Drop the knife!"" before gunfire erupted, but said he didn't see a knife in Mr Blake's hands. Police said that officers had provided immediate aid to Mr Blake, who was taken to hospital afterwards. Lawyers for Mr Blake have said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"" when police drew their weapons. Kenosha Police do not have body cameras, although they do have microphones. Two days on from the shooting, Mr Blake's family gave an emotional statement to the media. ""They shot my son seven times, seven times, like he didn't matter,"" his father, Jacob Blake Snr said. Mr Blake's lawyer said that, because of his injuries, he has needed nearly all of his colon and small intestine removed, and suffered damage to his kidney, liver and arm. The family have demanded the arrest of the officer who shot Mr Blake, and said other officers involved should be fired. There have been two nights of protests so far in Kenosha ""People question why we have to say Black Lives Matter: this is why,"" said lawyer Ben Crump. Mr Blake's mother, Julia Jackson, appealed for an end to violent unrest, which she said ""doesn't reflect my son or my family"". The officers involved have been placed on administrative leave while investigations continue. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. After Mr Blake was shot on Sunday, hundreds of people rallied outside police headquarters in Kenosha. Cars were set alight, armed robberies were reported and a night-time curfew was put in place. The unrest continued for two nights. On the Tuesday, a small group of protesters threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Police said that law enforcement was spread very thinly, and individuals and groups were exercising a form of vigilantism. This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured on the third night of unrest Tuesday night's shooting was believed to have involved protesters and armed men guarding a petrol station. On social media, footage showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire at them. Other videos show armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, outside businesses they said they were protecting. On Wednesday, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis confirmed that a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, had been arrested over the deaths of a 26- and a 36-year-old during Tuesday's protests. The injured individual is also 26, and is expected to recover. The suspect has been named as Kyle Rittenhouse. Who is US teen accused of Wisconsin protest murders? President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he was sending ""federal law enforcement and the National Guard"" to Kenosha. On Wednesday he announced reinforcements of 500 personnel, agreed with Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers, doubling the number already sent. Mr Blake was raised in Evanston, near Chicago. His uncle, Justin, told the Chicago Tribune newspaper that he moved to Kenosha several years ago for a job and for his family. ""It was a safer location. He could work and try to save and build a better life,"" said Justin. His family have a long history of community activism. Mr Blake's grandfather, also called Jacob, was a pastor at a church in Evanston, and a local leader in the civil rights movement. He was also a prolific campaigner for affordable housing and led his congregation in constructing a housing block in the city. Justin Blake said Mr Blake continued this tradition of public service and volunteered with Black Urban Recycling - a charity that collects aluminium cans and recycles them to raise money for a community centre in Chicago. Court records show there was an active arrest warrant against Mr Blake, related to charges of sexual assault, trespassing, domestic abuse and disorderly conduct. But it is unclear if police were aware of this at the time of his shooting. Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands US law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society. Debate has reignited this year after another black man, George Floyd, was killed by Minneapolis police in May. Mr Floyd's death sparked protests around the country, and abroad, and has led to calls for extensive police reform in America.

"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

"This video can not be played Two people have been killed and one injured during a third night of unrest Two people have been killed and one injured during a third night of unrest in the US city of Kenosha, sparked by the police shooting of a black man. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot and injured by police as he leaned into his car on Sunday, with his children screaming. Tuesday night's incident was believed to have involved protesters against Mr Blake's shooting and armed men guarding a petrol station. President Donald Trump says federal officers will be sent to Kenosha. The protests have at times turned violent, causing damage to property. On Wednesday, Mr Trump announced  that federal law enforcement and the National Guard would ""restore LAW and ORDER"". ""We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets. My team just got off the phone with Governor Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (Portland should do the same!),"" he said in a tweet. Mr Blake is in hospital, and his mother said he was conscious. Mr Blake's lawyers say it will take ""a miracle"" for him to walk again. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting In their statement, Kenosha Police said officials responded to ""reports of shots being fired and multiple gunshot victims"" in the city at about 23:45 on Tuesday (04:45 Wednesday GMT). ""The shooting resulted in two fatalities and a third gunshot victim was transported to a hospital with serious, but non-life threatening injuries,"" the statement said. It added that the identities of the victims were still being determined and that no further details would be given at this time. An investigation has been opened. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth earlier told the New York Times that an investigation into the shootings would be focused on a group of men armed with guns outside a petrol station. Kenosha, in the state of Wisconsin, has seen three nights of unrest Footage shared online showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire multiple rounds at them. Other video shows armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, congregating outside businesses they said they were protecting. Previous protests have resulted in damage to government offices and private businesses, and there have been reports of vigilantes turning out to protect property. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Professional Police Association told the BBC individuals and groups were exercising their own form of vigilantism because law enforcement was spread very thin across the city. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said on Tuesday he was sending more National Guard troops to the city amid the unrest. Within hours of Mr Blake's shooting on Sunday, hundreds of people had marched on Kenosha's police headquarters. Cars were later set alight, and police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. A night-time curfew was imposed. On Monday, Governor Evers called up the National Guard to help local police. The forces used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs, protesters said. Some demonstrators were seen attacking cars and property with baseball bats, Reuters reported. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters marched through the city. A small group threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' In a message posted on Twitter, police urged people in Kenosha, a city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan, to ""stay off the streets"". Buildings and cars have been burned. A state of emergency has also been declared in Wisconsin. Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland, Oregon and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May sparked Black Lives Matter protests across the US and globally. The Toronto Raptors basketball team, who won last year's NBA championship, have discussed potentially boycotting an upcoming conference semifinal game in response to Mr Blake's shooting. Player Norman Powell said the situation had gotten to a point where just saying ""Black Lives Matter"" was not enough. ""I think everybody's at the point of sitting up here and saying 'Black Lives Matter' and sitting up having discussions and Zoom calls... That's not getting the job done. Taking a knee for the anthem, that's not getting the job done."" Lawyer Ben Crump told a press conference on Tuesday that doctors said Mr Blake had been paralysed by the shooting. ""His family believe in miracles, but the medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralysed and, because those bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered some of his vertebrae, it is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,"" he said. The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death of George Floyd. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident shows Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Mr Blake's father has said he does not have confidence in the investigation. ""Anybody that is white, that is doing an investigation about a black young man that was shot seven times in his back, and haven't come up with an answer or a comment at this point, is not welcome,"" he told reporters.

"Countries across Europe have been looking at different measures to allow students and teachers to return safely Pupils in Englandâs secondary schools will have to wear masks in corridors in local lockdown areas Spain is to use 2,000 soldiers trained in tracking to help areas identify people exposed to the virus Cases in the US have been falling as a result of the adoption of face masks and lower testing rates, experts say North Korea's Kim Jong-un has chaired a meeting to assess preparations to prevent the spread of the coronavirus Argentina reports a new record number of cases as the country prepares for the annual Tango World Championships Germany has agreed to extend a scheme that tops up pay for workers affected by the pandemic by another year Edited by Marie Jackson And so our rolling coverage ends there. Today's live page has been the work of Mal Siret, Ashitha Nagesh, Penny Spiller, Tori Lindrea, Hazel Shearing and Marie Jackson. We'll be back with more on Thursday. Until then, stay well and thanks for joining us. Now to the latest key global developments: As we near the end of today's coverage, here are the main headlines from around the UK:  Spending for the second week of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme rose 9% Some UK restaurants say they will continue the government-funded Eat Out to Help Out scheme into September with their own cash because it has been so successful. Latest HM Treasury data shows diners used the government scheme more than 64 million timesin its first three weeks. The scheme, which is now in its final week, offers customers in restaurants, pubs and cafes 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 per head. It has been running every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August to encourage support for the hospitality sector. Commercial landlord Grosvenor has said it will subsidise discounted meals for its restaurant tenants in Belgravia and Mayfair, while elsewhere restaurants are individually deciding to extend the offer. ""The scheme has not just benefited businesses commercially, it appears to have really boosted consumer confidence as well, which is just as important,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality. Want to find out which restaurants are extending the offer? Read on.  Health officials are saying that up to 30 young people in Plymouth, on the south coast of England, could be infected with coronavirus having returned from holiday in Greece. Plymouth's public health team said the group of 18 and 19-year-olds returned from the island of Zante last week and so far 11 have tested positive. Many had minor symptoms or none at all, they added. Greece is not currently on the list of countries with quarantine restrictions for UK travellers. The city's director for public health Ruth Harrell said her team were working alongside national systems to contact and trace those thought to have been affected. Read more here. Cornwall is one of the UK's most popular tourist destinations The UK is set to lose up to Â£22bn in tourism revenues this yearbecause of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has predicted. Spending by visitors from overseas could fall by as much as 78% - equivalent to Â£60m a day, said the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). The WTTC said tourists were ""staying away from the UK in droves"" because of uncertainty over travel restrictions and because it has the highest coronavirus death toll of any European country. This summer's ""staycation"" boomhas seen UK residents flocking to book holidays at home, but the WTTC thinks the lack of foreign visitors will still inflict significant economic damage - with London hit hardest by the collapse in visitor numbers. WTTC President Gloria Guevara said domestic spending was ""highly unlikely to offset the collapse of international travel"". ""We urgently need to replace stop-start quarantine measures with rapid, comprehensive and cost-effective test and trace programmes at departure points across the country,"" she added. Staff in care homes are regularly tested for Covid-19 The National Care Forum (NCF) has written an open letter to England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock calling for a reversal of the decision to allow inspectors into care homes without weekly testing. The NCF, which represents 120 social care charities in the UK, called the decision to allow Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors to conduct on-site inspections of care homes without regular testing for Covid-19 ""extraordinary"". âFor months central government and the regulator have been requiring care homes to essentially eradicate the movement of staff and the flow of people, including close family relatives, into homes. ""Having done this, care homes are now being asked to let inspectors into homes without knowing whether or not they are Covid-positive. Understandably they are both shocked and hugely concerned,"" said Vic Rayner, executive director at the NCF. ""If inspectors are coming in, they need to be tested â there should be no further debate about this."" Visitors to Moma will be met by this newly-installed sign Some normality is returning to New York with the imminent reopening of many of its most famous museums and art galleries. The Museum of Modern Art, Moma, opens its doors on Thursday with free timed tickets for those visiting over the next month. Director Glenn Lowrytold ABC News,externalthat the museum was facing significant financial losses because of the coronavirus but deciding not to charge visitors for the first month ""felt like the right gesture"". The Metropolitan Museum of Art is set to reopen on Saturday, and the American Museum of Natural History and 9/11 Memorial Museum will start welcoming back visitors in September.  There have been a further 1,048 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. Sixteen people have died, bringing the total death toll of those who died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 to 41,465, according to figures released by Public Health England. Overall, 328,846 cases have been confirmed in the UK. The test has already been given approval in the US The health service in Scotland has signed a deal for equipment which allows Covid-19 tests to be carried out in just 12 minutes. NHS Scotland is to spend Â£6.76m on 300 rapid testing machines and at least 500,000 tests. The deal with life sciences company LumiraDx will see the test strips made at its Stirling base. The testing machines are said to be highly portable and can be used in local clinics or mobile units. The test, which is going through the final stages of validation for use in Scotland and the rest of Europe, detects the Covid-19 antigen protein from a nasal swab in 12 minutes - considerably faster than the 90 minutes typically needed by other rapid tests which are currently being trialled.

the Gaza Strip after a 61-year-old man became the second person with the
disease to die in the Palestinian territory, and several new cases
were discovered outside its quarantine centres. Early on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry announced
that two people had tested positive at the territoryâs largest hospital -
forcing it to close and causing locals to panic. Police were posted at the gates of Shifa Hospital in Gaza
City, and all its doctors and nurses were tested. The BBCâs Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says the outbreak
has caused alarm because of Gaza's weak healthcare system. After five cases were confirmed in one family living in a refugee camp on Monday, a curfew was imposed across Gaza. Previously, our correspondent adds, the relative
isolation of the territory - kept under blockade by Israel and Egypt - and
strict quarantine controls meant that Covid-19 had not spread among the general
population. The new infections were reported as an envoy from Qatar, which
has been sending aid money to Gaza, arrived for meetings to try to ease rising
tensions with Israel. In recent nights, Israeli warplanes or tanks have struck
what they say are militant targets in Gaza in retaliation for the launch of
rockets and balloons with incendiary devices attached. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to meet with families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said it was the fifth time members had asked to meet the PM, but Mr Johnson said he was ""not aware"" of the group's previous letters. ""Of course I will meet the bereaved,"" the prime minister told Sky News on Wednesday. However, No 10 are yet to confirm that a meeting will take place. The group of 1,600 families are calling for a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. Co-founder Jo Goodman, who lost her father to the virus, said: ""We welcome Boris Johnson finally agreeing to meet with us. ""It shouldn't have taken him months to agree to it, and it should only be a matter of days before it happens. ""If the prime minister had replied to our first letter back in June, a rapid review could be reporting right now, giving crucial lessons on how to save lives as the virus spikes again, as we're seeing in locations across the country."" Jonathan Slater was permanent secretary at the Department for Education Another head has rolled over the UK's exam results fiasco. The Department for Education announced its most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, would step down on 1 September, adding ""the prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". Boris Johnson earlier blamed a ""mutant algorithm"" for creating a situation in which many students' A-level results were unfairly downgraded and they lost out on university and college places. The National Education Union accused Mr Johnson of trying to ""idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created"". Mr Slater's departure comes a day after the resignation of Sally Collier, head of the exams regulating body, Ofqual. Meanwhile Gavin Williamson, education secretary, stays in his job. Police patrolled public spaces to ensure lockdown rules were being followed at the height of the pandemic Crime in England and Wales fell by almost a third in the first two full months of lockdown, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was driven by falls in reported thefts and burglary, the ONS said. Butthe ONS said,externaldrug crime rose by up to 44% compared with the same period last year, due to targeted policing. A survey also suggests the vast majority of adults (91%) are satisfied with the way police have dealt with the coronavirus restrictions. The figures, which are based on telephone research, support earlier data from police forces of a significant decline in offending during April and May. Read the full story here. It will be up to schools and councils in Wales to decide if face coverings need to be wornby pupils in communal areas and on school transport, the Welsh government has said. A government statement says the use of masks is recommended  indoors for older pupils, where social distancing cannot be maintained. But ministers are not mandating their use in schools, suggesting head teachers must take a decision based on ""risk assessments"" of school buildings. Teaching union NAHT Cymru deemed the policy ""unacceptable"", saying ""head teachers are not medical experts and the Welsh government should not put them in this position."" In England, the government has said secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors where a local lockdown is in place, but elsewhere head teachers would have ""flexibility"" on the issue. Pupils in secondary schools in both Scotland and Northern Ireland are recommending the use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next week.  Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green says the government has not been clear in its guidance for schools and ""constant chopping and changing and passing the buck"" has not left parents or staff feeling very reassured. She says it was right for the government to act on changed scientific and medical advice, but it needs to be clear, with discussions and guidance for those impacted. Head teachers needed data like local infection rates and what sort of action they should take if a child was unwell at school or there was a local outbreak, she says - and heads have been pressing government for access to that data. She said the stop-starting and confusion was ""really damaging for students, for the confidence of their parents and their teachers"". ""I am concerned that we shouldn't have to face the fact that these young people become a Covid generation whose long-term prospects are blighted by the effect of the  lockdown and the education they've missed."" Gatwick - the UKâs second largest airport - has announced plans to cut around 600 jobs, as it significantly restructures its business in the wake of the pandemic. The airport is proposing to cut some 24% of the current staff following a dramatic slump in passenger numbers and air traffic since March. In August, usually one of the airport's busiest months, passenger numbers are more than 80% lower than the same month last year, with only the North Terminal operating. The chief executive of Gatwick Airport, Stewart Wingate, said it was a ""stark reminder"" of ""the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry"". ""We will continue to do all we can to preserve as many jobs as possible,"" he added. Katharine Birbalsingh, head teacher of Michaela Community School in London, said there was a ""need to take into account children's behaviour when considering whether or not masks make them safer"". ""What about the children who turn up to school with uniforms that aren't washed? They don't necessarily wash themselves, they come to school hungry, they will be wearing reused dirty masks,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""They'll swap them... they'll wear them incorrectly, they'll lose them. When half of your children show up to school and aren't wearing masks, what to do you, do you exclude them?"" But Liam Powell, head teacher at Manor High in Leicestershire - which was affected by the recent local lockdown - told the programme: ""I think we have to have high expectations of our children and we have to modify the way they behave."" His school has made the use of face coverings optional. ""A lot of our parents are in the medical profession and they know a lot about viruses, and a lot of them are quite anxious,"" he said. ""What we've said to parents is it's sensible to carry a mask anyway because you may be travelling on public transport, the school bus or going into a shop on your way to school or on the way home."" Kenya's education minister has hinted at reopening schools earlier than his initial proposal of January 2021 - if coronavirus cases continue to fall. George Magoha has said tertiary institutions may also reopen earlier than was planned. Kenya scrapped the entire 2020 academic year in March because of the pandemic. The minister said it would be in the interest of learners to reopen schools early if the infection rate maintains its recent downward trend. The ministry of health has been reporting lower numbers in its daily updates, with the director general saying the rate needs to be below 5% for a period of two weeks for the curve to be said to be flattening. The World Health Organization and Unicef last week urged African countries to consider reopening schools but with strict guidelines. The agencies said children were being exposed to violence, teenage pregnancies and poor nutrition while at home during the pandemic. Karina Fuentes helps her seven-year-old daughter Julieta during a televised class School lessons have resumed in Mexico but with the number of coronavirus infections still high, children will not yet return to classrooms.

"This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""Look at things from all perspectives"" US First Lady Melania Trump has made a plea for racial unity, in a live speech from the White House to the Republican party convention. ""Stop the violence and looting,"" she also said as protests continued over a police shooting in Wisconsin. Mrs Trump urged Americans to stop making assumptions based on race and reflected candidly on US history. President Donald Trump currently trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in opinion polls for November's election. Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Republicans scrap party platform. What that means... How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump will address the convention's final night on Thursday. The normally limelight-shunning US first lady delivered Tuesday evening's keynote address before a small audience, including her husband, in the Rose Garden of the White House. ""Like all of you, I have reflected on the racial unrest in our country,"" she said. ""It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history. I encourage you to focus on the future while still learning from the past."" She added: ""I urge people to come together in a civil manner so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals. ""I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice, and never make assumptions based on the colour of a person's skin."" Tuesday's convention schedule began with a prayer for Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old black man shot multiple times in the back by police in Wisconsin on Sunday. Shot US black man 'needs miracle to walk again' Mr Trump tweeted a call for the Midwestern state's governor to bring in the National Guard as unrest continued following the shooting. The president has often been accused by opponents of stoking racial tension, though black speakers at the opening night of the Republican convention emphatically denied he was racist. In her speech, Mrs Trump also expressed compassion for Americans worried about the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans. ""I know many people are anxious,"" she said. ""Some feel helpless. I want you to know you're not alone."" This video can not be played 'Trump's actions speak louder than stickers or slogans' She praised her husband as a someone who ""makes no secrets about how he feels about things"". ""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president. Whether you like it or not you always know what he's thinking."" Her decision to speak from the seat of presidential power has angered Democrats, who said the venue was an inappropriate use of government resources for political purposes. An unusual, traditional First Lady Melania headlines day two of Trump's convention If the first night of the Republican National Convention was about addressing the president's perceived weaknesses among American voters - on the coronavirus pandemic, racial issues and overall empathy - Tuesday focused on motivating his base, from anti-abortion activists to Christian conservatives. Meanwhile, the president flexed his executive powers from the White House in two extraordinary norm-stretching bits of political theatre - issuing a pardon and taking part in a naturalisation ceremony. First Lady Melania Trump wrapped up the evening from the newly renovated Rose Garden. She was one of the few to directly express sympathy for those who have suffered from Covid-19. It was a stark contrast with White House economist Larry Kudlow, who talked about the pandemic in the past tense earlier in the night. Unless something changes in the coming months, coronavirus will be at the top of voters' minds when they cast their ballots. And while red meat for the base is useful, public perception of the president's handling of the virus - and its economic fallout - will factor heavily in deciding his political fate. The second night - which was designed around the theme of ""Land of Opportunity"" - also heard from the president's children, Eric and Tiffany Trump. Eric railed against ""radical Democrats"" - a recurring message of the convention so far. ""They want to disrespect our National Anthem by taking a knee,"" he said, ""while our armed forces lay down their lives every day to protect our freedom."" This video can not be played ""I would crawl through broken glass to vote for Trump in this election"" Tiffany, Mr Trump's daughter with his second wife Marla Maples, accused the media and tech companies of keeping Americans ""mentally enslaved"". This video can not be played Former Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake is backing Democrat Joe Biden In a controversial appearance, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a pre-recorded speech from Jerusalem, praising the president's ""America First vision"". Mr Trump has sought to portray himself as the most pro-Israeli president ever. Normally, the nation's top diplomat does not attend political conventions, withsome making a deliberate point of being out of the country and unavailable during their political parties' presidential nominating events,external, the Associated Press reports. Mike Pompeo in Jerusalem ""It is unprecedented and highly unethical for a sitting secretary of state to address a political convention while on official foreign travel,"" said Halie Soifer, the head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. The state department stressed that no taxpayer money was used to produce Mr Pompeo's video, which was made during an official tour of the Middle East. Though he is not scheduled to deliver his keynote address to the convention until its final night, Mr Trump played a major role in Tuesday's schedule, just as he did on the opening day. The conference featured emotional footage of the president earlier on Tuesday pardoning a Nevada bank robber, Jon Ponder, a black man who founded a charity that helps convicts reintegrate into society. Former bank robber Jon Ponder, left, was pardoned in a video shown to the convention In another surprise moment of the night, Mr Trump appeared live from the White House to preside over a naturalisation ceremony for immigrants. Critics said the segment was hypocritical, as Mr Trump has taken steps during his presidency to restrict legal immigration, as well as crack down on illegal immigration. Mr Biden's campaign accused the president of using the newly coined American citizens as ""props"". ""Immigrants and Latinos are not props, and these empty gestures won't make us forget Donald Trump's failures,"" the Democrat's Latino media director, Jennifer Molina, told AP news agency.

Today's live page has been the work of Mal Siret, Ashitha Nagesh, Penny Spiller, Tori Lindrea, Hazel Shearing and Marie Jackson. We'll be back with more on Thursday. Until then, stay well and thanks for joining us. Now to the latest key global developments: As we near the end of today's coverage, here are the main headlines from around the UK:  Spending for the second week of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme rose 9% Some UK restaurants say they will continue the government-funded Eat Out to Help Out scheme into September with their own cash because it has been so successful. Latest HM Treasury data shows diners used the government scheme more than 64 million timesin its first three weeks. The scheme, which is now in its final week, offers customers in restaurants, pubs and cafes 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 per head. It has been running every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August to encourage support for the hospitality sector. Commercial landlord Grosvenor has said it will subsidise discounted meals for its restaurant tenants in Belgravia and Mayfair, while elsewhere restaurants are individually deciding to extend the offer. ""The scheme has not just benefited businesses commercially, it appears to have really boosted consumer confidence as well, which is just as important,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality. Want to find out which restaurants are extending the offer? Read on.  Health officials are saying that up to 30 young people in Plymouth, on the south coast of England, could be infected with coronavirus having returned from holiday in Greece. Plymouth's public health team said the group of 18 and 19-year-olds returned from the island of Zante last week and so far 11 have tested positive. Many had minor symptoms or none at all, they added. Greece is not currently on the list of countries with quarantine restrictions for UK travellers. The city's director for public health Ruth Harrell said her team were working alongside national systems to contact and trace those thought to have been affected. Read more here. Cornwall is one of the UK's most popular tourist destinations The UK is set to lose up to Â£22bn in tourism revenues this yearbecause of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has predicted. Spending by visitors from overseas could fall by as much as 78% - equivalent to Â£60m a day, said the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). The WTTC said tourists were ""staying away from the UK in droves"" because of uncertainty over travel restrictions and because it has the highest coronavirus death toll of any European country. This summer's ""staycation"" boomhas seen UK residents flocking to book holidays at home, but the WTTC thinks the lack of foreign visitors will still inflict significant economic damage - with London hit hardest by the collapse in visitor numbers. WTTC President Gloria Guevara said domestic spending was ""highly unlikely to offset the collapse of international travel"". ""We urgently need to replace stop-start quarantine measures with rapid, comprehensive and cost-effective test and trace programmes at departure points across the country,"" she added. Staff in care homes are regularly tested for Covid-19 The National Care Forum (NCF) has written an open letter to England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock calling for a reversal of the decision to allow inspectors into care homes without weekly testing. The NCF, which represents 120 social care charities in the UK, called the decision to allow Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors to conduct on-site inspections of care homes without regular testing for Covid-19 ""extraordinary"". âFor months central government and the regulator have been requiring care homes to essentially eradicate the movement of staff and the flow of people, including close family relatives, into homes. ""Having done this, care homes are now being asked to let inspectors into homes without knowing whether or not they are Covid-positive. Understandably they are both shocked and hugely concerned,"" said Vic Rayner, executive director at the NCF. ""If inspectors are coming in, they need to be tested â there should be no further debate about this."" Visitors to Moma will be met by this newly-installed sign Some normality is returning to New York with the imminent reopening of many of its most famous museums and art galleries. The Museum of Modern Art, Moma, opens its doors on Thursday with free timed tickets for those visiting over the next month. Director Glenn Lowrytold ABC News,externalthat the museum was facing significant financial losses because of the coronavirus but deciding not to charge visitors for the first month ""felt like the right gesture"". The Metropolitan Museum of Art is set to reopen on Saturday, and the American Museum of Natural History and 9/11 Memorial Museum will start welcoming back visitors in September.  There have been a further 1,048 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. Sixteen people have died, bringing the total death toll of those who died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 to 41,465, according to figures released by Public Health England. Overall, 328,846 cases have been confirmed in the UK. The test has already been given approval in the US The health service in Scotland has signed a deal for equipment which allows Covid-19 tests to be carried out in just 12 minutes. NHS Scotland is to spend Â£6.76m on 300 rapid testing machines and at least 500,000 tests. The deal with life sciences company LumiraDx will see the test strips made at its Stirling base. The testing machines are said to be highly portable and can be used in local clinics or mobile units. The test, which is going through the final stages of validation for use in Scotland and the rest of Europe, detects the Covid-19 antigen protein from a nasal swab in 12 minutes - considerably faster than the 90 minutes typically needed by other rapid tests which are currently being trialled.

the Gaza Strip after a 61-year-old man became the second person with the
disease to die in the Palestinian territory, and several new cases
were discovered outside its quarantine centres. Early on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry announced
that two people had tested positive at the territoryâs largest hospital -
forcing it to close and causing locals to panic. Police were posted at the gates of Shifa Hospital in Gaza
City, and all its doctors and nurses were tested. The BBCâs Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says the outbreak
has caused alarm because of Gaza's weak healthcare system. After five cases were confirmed in one family living in a refugee camp on Monday, a curfew was imposed across Gaza. Previously, our correspondent adds, the relative
isolation of the territory - kept under blockade by Israel and Egypt - and
strict quarantine controls meant that Covid-19 had not spread among the general
population. The new infections were reported as an envoy from Qatar, which
has been sending aid money to Gaza, arrived for meetings to try to ease rising
tensions with Israel. In recent nights, Israeli warplanes or tanks have struck
what they say are militant targets in Gaza in retaliation for the launch of
rockets and balloons with incendiary devices attached. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to meet with families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said it was the fifth time members had asked to meet the PM, but Mr Johnson said he was ""not aware"" of the group's previous letters. ""Of course I will meet the bereaved,"" the prime minister told Sky News on Wednesday. However, No 10 are yet to confirm that a meeting will take place. The group of 1,600 families are calling for a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. Co-founder Jo Goodman, who lost her father to the virus, said: ""We welcome Boris Johnson finally agreeing to meet with us. ""It shouldn't have taken him months to agree to it, and it should only be a matter of days before it happens. ""If the prime minister had replied to our first letter back in June, a rapid review could be reporting right now, giving crucial lessons on how to save lives as the virus spikes again, as we're seeing in locations across the country."" Jonathan Slater was permanent secretary at the Department for Education Another head has rolled over the UK's exam results fiasco. The Department for Education announced its most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, would step down on 1 September, adding ""the prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". Boris Johnson earlier blamed a ""mutant algorithm"" for creating a situation in which many students' A-level results were unfairly downgraded and they lost out on university and college places. The National Education Union accused Mr Johnson of trying to ""idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created"". Mr Slater's departure comes a day after the resignation of Sally Collier, head of the exams regulating body, Ofqual. Meanwhile Gavin Williamson, education secretary, stays in his job. Police patrolled public spaces to ensure lockdown rules were being followed at the height of the pandemic Crime in England and Wales fell by almost a third in the first two full months of lockdown, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was driven by falls in reported thefts and burglary, the ONS said. Butthe ONS said,externaldrug crime rose by up to 44% compared with the same period last year, due to targeted policing. A survey also suggests the vast majority of adults (91%) are satisfied with the way police have dealt with the coronavirus restrictions. The figures, which are based on telephone research, support earlier data from police forces of a significant decline in offending during April and May. Read the full story here. It will be up to schools and councils in Wales to decide if face coverings need to be wornby pupils in communal areas and on school transport, the Welsh government has said. A government statement says the use of masks is recommended  indoors for older pupils, where social distancing cannot be maintained. But ministers are not mandating their use in schools, suggesting head teachers must take a decision based on ""risk assessments"" of school buildings. Teaching union NAHT Cymru deemed the policy ""unacceptable"", saying ""head teachers are not medical experts and the Welsh government should not put them in this position."" In England, the government has said secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors where a local lockdown is in place, but elsewhere head teachers would have ""flexibility"" on the issue. Pupils in secondary schools in both Scotland and Northern Ireland are recommending the use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next week.  Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green says the government has not been clear in its guidance for schools and ""constant chopping and changing and passing the buck"" has not left parents or staff feeling very reassured. She says it was right for the government to act on changed scientific and medical advice, but it needs to be clear, with discussions and guidance for those impacted. Head teachers needed data like local infection rates and what sort of action they should take if a child was unwell at school or there was a local outbreak, she says - and heads have been pressing government for access to that data. She said the stop-starting and confusion was ""really damaging for students, for the confidence of their parents and their teachers"". ""I am concerned that we shouldn't have to face the fact that these young people become a Covid generation whose long-term prospects are blighted by the effect of the  lockdown and the education they've missed."" Gatwick - the UKâs second largest airport - has announced plans to cut around 600 jobs, as it significantly restructures its business in the wake of the pandemic. The airport is proposing to cut some 24% of the current staff following a dramatic slump in passenger numbers and air traffic since March. In August, usually one of the airport's busiest months, passenger numbers are more than 80% lower than the same month last year, with only the North Terminal operating. The chief executive of Gatwick Airport, Stewart Wingate, said it was a ""stark reminder"" of ""the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry"". ""We will continue to do all we can to preserve as many jobs as possible,"" he added. Katharine Birbalsingh, head teacher of Michaela Community School in London, said there was a ""need to take into account children's behaviour when considering whether or not masks make them safer"". ""What about the children who turn up to school with uniforms that aren't washed? They don't necessarily wash themselves, they come to school hungry, they will be wearing reused dirty masks,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""They'll swap them... they'll wear them incorrectly, they'll lose them. When half of your children show up to school and aren't wearing masks, what to do you, do you exclude them?"" But Liam Powell, head teacher at Manor High in Leicestershire - which was affected by the recent local lockdown - told the programme: ""I think we have to have high expectations of our children and we have to modify the way they behave."" His school has made the use of face coverings optional. ""A lot of our parents are in the medical profession and they know a lot about viruses, and a lot of them are quite anxious,"" he said. ""What we've said to parents is it's sensible to carry a mask anyway because you may be travelling on public transport, the school bus or going into a shop on your way to school or on the way home."" Kenya's education minister has hinted at reopening schools earlier than his initial proposal of January 2021 - if coronavirus cases continue to fall. George Magoha has said tertiary institutions may also reopen earlier than was planned. Kenya scrapped the entire 2020 academic year in March because of the pandemic. The minister said it would be in the interest of learners to reopen schools early if the infection rate maintains its recent downward trend. The ministry of health has been reporting lower numbers in its daily updates, with the director general saying the rate needs to be below 5% for a period of two weeks for the curve to be said to be flattening. The World Health Organization and Unicef last week urged African countries to consider reopening schools but with strict guidelines. The agencies said children were being exposed to violence, teenage pregnancies and poor nutrition while at home during the pandemic. Karina Fuentes helps her seven-year-old daughter Julieta during a televised class School lessons have resumed in Mexico but with the number of coronavirus infections still high, children will not yet return to classrooms. Schools were among the first institutions to close as the virus began to spread through the country in March.

Pupils in secondary schools in both Scotland and Northern Ireland are recommending the use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next week.  Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green says the government has not been clear in its guidance for schools and ""constant chopping and changing and passing the buck"" has not left parents or staff feeling very reassured. She says it was right for the government to act on changed scientific and medical advice, but it needs to be clear, with discussions and guidance for those impacted. Head teachers needed data like local infection rates and what sort of action they should take if a child was unwell at school or there was a local outbreak, she says - and heads have been pressing government for access to that data. She said the stop-starting and confusion was ""really damaging for students, for the confidence of their parents and their teachers"". ""I am concerned that we shouldn't have to face the fact that these young people become a Covid generation whose long-term prospects are blighted by the effect of the  lockdown and the education they've missed."" Gatwick - the UKâs second largest airport - has announced plans to cut around 600 jobs, as it significantly restructures its business in the wake of the pandemic. The airport is proposing to cut some 24% of the current staff following a dramatic slump in passenger numbers and air traffic since March. In August, usually one of the airport's busiest months, passenger numbers are more than 80% lower than the same month last year, with only the North Terminal operating. The chief executive of Gatwick Airport, Stewart Wingate, said it was a ""stark reminder"" of ""the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry"". ""We will continue to do all we can to preserve as many jobs as possible,"" he added. Katharine Birbalsingh, head teacher of Michaela Community School in London, said there was a ""need to take into account children's behaviour when considering whether or not masks make them safer"". ""What about the children who turn up to school with uniforms that aren't washed? They don't necessarily wash themselves, they come to school hungry, they will be wearing reused dirty masks,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""They'll swap them... they'll wear them incorrectly, they'll lose them. When half of your children show up to school and aren't wearing masks, what to do you, do you exclude them?"" But Liam Powell, head teacher at Manor High in Leicestershire - which was affected by the recent local lockdown - told the programme: ""I think we have to have high expectations of our children and we have to modify the way they behave."" His school has made the use of face coverings optional. ""A lot of our parents are in the medical profession and they know a lot about viruses, and a lot of them are quite anxious,"" he said. ""What we've said to parents is it's sensible to carry a mask anyway because you may be travelling on public transport, the school bus or going into a shop on your way to school or on the way home."" Kenya's education minister has hinted at reopening schools earlier than his initial proposal of January 2021 - if coronavirus cases continue to fall. George Magoha has said tertiary institutions may also reopen earlier than was planned. Kenya scrapped the entire 2020 academic year in March because of the pandemic. The minister said it would be in the interest of learners to reopen schools early if the infection rate maintains its recent downward trend. The ministry of health has been reporting lower numbers in its daily updates, with the director general saying the rate needs to be below 5% for a period of two weeks for the curve to be said to be flattening. The World Health Organization and Unicef last week urged African countries to consider reopening schools but with strict guidelines. The agencies said children were being exposed to violence, teenage pregnancies and poor nutrition while at home during the pandemic.

"This video can not be played Two people have been killed and one injured during a third night of unrest Two people have been killed and one injured during a third night of unrest in the US city of Kenosha, sparked by the police shooting of a black man. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot and injured by police as he leaned into his car on Sunday, with his children screaming. Tuesday night's incident was believed to have involved protesters against Mr Blake's shooting and armed men guarding a petrol station. President Donald Trump says federal officers will be sent to Kenosha. The protests have at times turned violent, causing damage to property. On Wednesday, Mr Trump announced  that federal law enforcement and the National Guard would ""restore LAW and ORDER"". ""We will NOT stand for looting, arson, violence, and lawlessness on American streets. My team just got off the phone with Governor Evers who agreed to accept federal assistance (Portland should do the same!),"" he said in a tweet. Mr Blake is in hospital, and his mother said he was conscious. Mr Blake's lawyers say it will take ""a miracle"" for him to walk again. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting In their statement, Kenosha Police said officials responded to ""reports of shots being fired and multiple gunshot victims"" in the city at about 23:45 on Tuesday (04:45 Wednesday GMT). ""The shooting resulted in two fatalities and a third gunshot victim was transported to a hospital with serious, but non-life threatening injuries,"" the statement said. It added that the identities of the victims were still being determined and that no further details would be given at this time. An investigation has been opened. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth earlier told the New York Times that an investigation into the shootings would be focused on a group of men armed with guns outside a petrol station. Kenosha, in the state of Wisconsin, has seen three nights of unrest Footage shared online showed a man with a rifle being chased by a crowd before he fell to the ground and appeared to fire multiple rounds at them. Other video shows armed civilians, many dressed in military fatigues, congregating outside businesses they said they were protecting. Previous protests have resulted in damage to government offices and private businesses, and there have been reports of vigilantes turning out to protect property. A spokesman for the Wisconsin Professional Police Association told the BBC individuals and groups were exercising their own form of vigilantism because law enforcement was spread very thin across the city. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said on Tuesday he was sending more National Guard troops to the city amid the unrest. Within hours of Mr Blake's shooting on Sunday, hundreds of people had marched on Kenosha's police headquarters. Cars were later set alight, and police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. A night-time curfew was imposed. On Monday, Governor Evers called up the National Guard to help local police. The forces used tear gas, rubber bullets and smoke bombs, protesters said. Some demonstrators were seen attacking cars and property with baseball bats, Reuters reported. On Tuesday, hundreds of protesters marched through the city. A small group threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' In a message posted on Twitter, police urged people in Kenosha, a city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan, to ""stay off the streets"". Buildings and cars have been burned. A state of emergency has also been declared in Wisconsin. Protests have also spread to a number of other cities, including Portland, Oregon and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where the police killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May sparked Black Lives Matter protests across the US and globally. The Toronto Raptors basketball team, who won last year's NBA championship, have discussed potentially boycotting an upcoming conference semifinal game in response to Mr Blake's shooting. Player Norman Powell said the situation had gotten to a point where just saying ""Black Lives Matter"" was not enough. ""I think everybody's at the point of sitting up here and saying 'Black Lives Matter' and sitting up having discussions and Zoom calls... That's not getting the job done. Taking a knee for the anthem, that's not getting the job done."" Lawyer Ben Crump told a press conference on Tuesday that doctors said Mr Blake had been paralysed by the shooting. ""His family believe in miracles, but the medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralysed and, because those bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered some of his vertebrae, it is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,"" he said. The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death of George Floyd. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident shows Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave. A petition calling for them to be charged has garnered tens of thousands of signatures. Mr Blake's father has said he does not have confidence in the investigation. ""Anybody that is white, that is doing an investigation about a black young man that was shot seven times in his back, and haven't come up with an answer or a comment at this point, is not welcome,"" he told reporters.

Today's live page has been the work of Mal Siret, Ashitha Nagesh, Penny Spiller, Tori Lindrea, Hazel Shearing and Marie Jackson. We'll be back with more on Thursday. Until then, stay well and thanks for joining us. Now to the latest key global developments: As we near the end of today's coverage, here are the main headlines from around the UK:  Spending for the second week of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme rose 9% Some UK restaurants say they will continue the government-funded Eat Out to Help Out scheme into September with their own cash because it has been so successful. Latest HM Treasury data shows diners used the government scheme more than 64 million timesin its first three weeks. The scheme, which is now in its final week, offers customers in restaurants, pubs and cafes 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 per head. It has been running every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August to encourage support for the hospitality sector. Commercial landlord Grosvenor has said it will subsidise discounted meals for its restaurant tenants in Belgravia and Mayfair, while elsewhere restaurants are individually deciding to extend the offer. ""The scheme has not just benefited businesses commercially, it appears to have really boosted consumer confidence as well, which is just as important,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality. Want to find out which restaurants are extending the offer? Read on.  Health officials are saying that up to 30 young people in Plymouth, on the south coast of England, could be infected with coronavirus having returned from holiday in Greece. Plymouth's public health team said the group of 18 and 19-year-olds returned from the island of Zante last week and so far 11 have tested positive. Many had minor symptoms or none at all, they added. Greece is not currently on the list of countries with quarantine restrictions for UK travellers. The city's director for public health Ruth Harrell said her team were working alongside national systems to contact and trace those thought to have been affected. Read more here. Cornwall is one of the UK's most popular tourist destinations The UK is set to lose up to Â£22bn in tourism revenues this yearbecause of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has predicted. Spending by visitors from overseas could fall by as much as 78% - equivalent to Â£60m a day, said the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). The WTTC said tourists were ""staying away from the UK in droves"" because of uncertainty over travel restrictions and because it has the highest coronavirus death toll of any European country. This summer's ""staycation"" boomhas seen UK residents flocking to book holidays at home, but the WTTC thinks the lack of foreign visitors will still inflict significant economic damage - with London hit hardest by the collapse in visitor numbers. WTTC President Gloria Guevara said domestic spending was ""highly unlikely to offset the collapse of international travel"". ""We urgently need to replace stop-start quarantine measures with rapid, comprehensive and cost-effective test and trace programmes at departure points across the country,"" she added. Staff in care homes are regularly tested for Covid-19 The National Care Forum (NCF) has written an open letter to England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock calling for a reversal of the decision to allow inspectors into care homes without weekly testing. The NCF, which represents 120 social care charities in the UK, called the decision to allow Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors to conduct on-site inspections of care homes without regular testing for Covid-19 ""extraordinary"". âFor months central government and the regulator have been requiring care homes to essentially eradicate the movement of staff and the flow of people, including close family relatives, into homes. ""Having done this, care homes are now being asked to let inspectors into homes without knowing whether or not they are Covid-positive. Understandably they are both shocked and hugely concerned,"" said Vic Rayner, executive director at the NCF. ""If inspectors are coming in, they need to be tested â there should be no further debate about this."" Visitors to Moma will be met by this newly-installed sign Some normality is returning to New York with the imminent reopening of many of its most famous museums and art galleries. The Museum of Modern Art, Moma, opens its doors on Thursday with free timed tickets for those visiting over the next month. Director Glenn Lowrytold ABC News,externalthat the museum was facing significant financial losses because of the coronavirus but deciding not to charge visitors for the first month ""felt like the right gesture"". The Metropolitan Museum of Art is set to reopen on Saturday, and the American Museum of Natural History and 9/11 Memorial Museum will start welcoming back visitors in September.  There have been a further 1,048 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. Sixteen people have died, bringing the total death toll of those who died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 to 41,465, according to figures released by Public Health England. Overall, 328,846 cases have been confirmed in the UK. The test has already been given approval in the US The health service in Scotland has signed a deal for equipment which allows Covid-19 tests to be carried out in just 12 minutes. NHS Scotland is to spend Â£6.76m on 300 rapid testing machines and at least 500,000 tests. The deal with life sciences company LumiraDx will see the test strips made at its Stirling base. The testing machines are said to be highly portable and can be used in local clinics or mobile units. The test, which is going through the final stages of validation for use in Scotland and the rest of Europe, detects the Covid-19 antigen protein from a nasal swab in 12 minutes - considerably faster than the 90 minutes typically needed by other rapid tests which are currently being trialled.

the Gaza Strip after a 61-year-old man became the second person with the
disease to die in the Palestinian territory, and several new cases
were discovered outside its quarantine centres. Early on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry announced
that two people had tested positive at the territoryâs largest hospital -
forcing it to close and causing locals to panic. Police were posted at the gates of Shifa Hospital in Gaza
City, and all its doctors and nurses were tested. The BBCâs Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says the outbreak
has caused alarm because of Gaza's weak healthcare system. After five cases were confirmed in one family living in a refugee camp on Monday, a curfew was imposed across Gaza. Previously, our correspondent adds, the relative
isolation of the territory - kept under blockade by Israel and Egypt - and
strict quarantine controls meant that Covid-19 had not spread among the general
population. The new infections were reported as an envoy from Qatar, which
has been sending aid money to Gaza, arrived for meetings to try to ease rising
tensions with Israel. In recent nights, Israeli warplanes or tanks have struck
what they say are militant targets in Gaza in retaliation for the launch of
rockets and balloons with incendiary devices attached. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to meet with families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said it was the fifth time members had asked to meet the PM, but Mr Johnson said he was ""not aware"" of the group's previous letters. ""Of course I will meet the bereaved,"" the prime minister told Sky News on Wednesday. However, No 10 are yet to confirm that a meeting will take place. The group of 1,600 families are calling for a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. Co-founder Jo Goodman, who lost her father to the virus, said: ""We welcome Boris Johnson finally agreeing to meet with us. ""It shouldn't have taken him months to agree to it, and it should only be a matter of days before it happens. ""If the prime minister had replied to our first letter back in June, a rapid review could be reporting right now, giving crucial lessons on how to save lives as the virus spikes again, as we're seeing in locations across the country."" Jonathan Slater was permanent secretary at the Department for Education Another head has rolled over the UK's exam results fiasco. The Department for Education announced its most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, would step down on 1 September, adding ""the prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". Boris Johnson earlier blamed a ""mutant algorithm"" for creating a situation in which many students' A-level results were unfairly downgraded and they lost out on university and college places. The National Education Union accused Mr Johnson of trying to ""idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created"". Mr Slater's departure comes a day after the resignation of Sally Collier, head of the exams regulating body, Ofqual. Meanwhile Gavin Williamson, education secretary, stays in his job. Police patrolled public spaces to ensure lockdown rules were being followed at the height of the pandemic Crime in England and Wales fell by almost a third in the first two full months of lockdown, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was driven by falls in reported thefts and burglary, the ONS said. Butthe ONS said,externaldrug crime rose by up to 44% compared with the same period last year, due to targeted policing. A survey also suggests the vast majority of adults (91%) are satisfied with the way police have dealt with the coronavirus restrictions. The figures, which are based on telephone research, support earlier data from police forces of a significant decline in offending during April and May. Read the full story here. It will be up to schools and councils in Wales to decide if face coverings need to be wornby pupils in communal areas and on school transport, the Welsh government has said.

"This video can not be played Business owner Tara Tomes: 'We're giving up our office forever' Fifty of the biggest UK employers questioned by BBC have said they have no plans to return all staff to the office full-time in the near future. Some 24 firms said that they did not have any plans in place to return workers to the office. However, 20 have opened their offices for staff unable to work from home. It comes as many employees return to work from the summer holidays with the reality of a prolonged period of home working becoming increasingly likely. The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place. Many companies said they were offering choice and flexibility to those who want to return, particularly in the banking and finance sectors. A few firms have already announced they have no plans to return to the office until late autumn, and Facebook has said it does not plan a return of employees until July 2021. Some smaller businesses are deciding to abandon their offices altogether. Tara Tomes runs a PR agency with an office in the heart of Birmingham's business district. Her team of eight cannot fit in the space they have if they are to obey social distancing guidelines and she will not be renewing the office lease in September. ""I personally don't want to force my team back onto public transport,"" she told the BBC. ""Not having four walls around us won't change the dynamic or culture of the team. If anything it will make us more pioneering in the way the world of work is going."" She said that the money saved on rent and utilities and the time spent not commuting were other benefits to giving up the office. 'I took a pay cut but at least I kept my jobâ Can I work from home overseas? This is what coronavirus will do to our offices and homes Fujitsu announces permanent work-from-home plan Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street acknowledged that the challenges facing city centre businesses were grave but said he was hopeful the climate would gradually improve. ""This is undeniably a very difficult situation for businesses that thrive on the back of the big office occupiers being there. What we are trying to do is steadily build confidence that it is safe to return to the city centre."" He said Birmingham's transport system was currently carrying about 20% of pre-covid numbers but that he hoped this would rise to 50% over the autumn. Still, that means that city centre footfall - which is the lifeblood of businesses that rely on office workers and commuters - would in the best case scenario be half of what it is in normal times. Naomi says the pandemic has been 'devastating' for her business That may be cold comfort to Naomi and her brother James who opened up a new coffee shop in the heart of Birmingham's business district earlier this year. They are now getting less than a fifth of the trade they were banking on. ""It's been devastating really,"" Naomi told the BBC. ""Office workers are absolutely critical to us. We are hoping things improve in September but if they don't we will have to rethink the whole business."" It is, however, too soon to announce the death of the office, according to Rob Groves from office developer Argent, which has just completed the construction of 120,000 feet of office space in Birmingham's Chamberlain Square. While he admitted that some would-be tenants were pressing the pause button, he also insisted there would always be a need for a workplace where people could congregate and collaborate. ""I'd like to challenge people saying they will never need an office and ask them in 12-18 months time whether that was the right decision or just a reaction to what's happening now."" Matthew Hammond, chairman of the Midlands region for PwC One of Argent's blue chip tenants agrees. Accounting and consultancy firm PwC has just moved into the property next door. It is supposed to house 2,000 people but is currently catering to just 150 each day. Nevertheless, Matthew Hammond, chairman of the Midlands region for PwC, said that the office was a must have, particularly for younger workers. ""We have colleagues who may be working at the end of their bed or on a return unit in their kitchen. That is not sustainable or healthy for the longer term. As employers we invest a huge amount in providing the right environment, the right seating, the right technology so people can be at their most productive."" Not everyone has deep enough pockets to afford such flexible working spaces. While many employees want the option of coming to the office, many now see home working as a right, according to Midlands recruitment specialist Kam Vara. ""For many candidates it's now a deal-breaker if there isn't an option for home working, and some are saying they want 100% home working with no physical contact with the office whatsoever."" The knock-on effects of these changes to the world of work could be enormous and long lasting. If people don't need to be in the office, they can be anywhere. And the cost of commuter season tickets and expensive suburban housing within commuting distance of big cities is an expense employers could deduct. Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street is optimistic that what we are witnessing is simply an age old tale of urban evolution, with Covid-19 holding down the fast forward button. ""The calling of the death of the office is very premature. Cities have repurposed themselves before over decades... the coronavirus has just speeded it up."" That may be so, but the short term shock to the city business model feels more like a cardiac arrest than a gentle evolution. And the reluctance on the part of both workers and employers to return to the office poses a grave economic threat to the future of city centres.

"This video can not be played Business owner Tara Tomes: 'We're giving up our office forever' Fifty of the biggest UK employers questioned by BBC have said they have no plans to return all staff to the office full-time in the near future. Some 24 firms said that they did not have any plans in place to return workers to the office. However, 20 have opened their offices for staff unable to work from home. It comes as many employees return to work from the summer holidays with the reality of a prolonged period of home working becoming increasingly likely. The BBC questioned 50 big employers ranging from banks to retailers to get a sense of when they expected to ask employees to return to the office. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place. Many companies said they were offering choice and flexibility to those who want to return, particularly in the banking and finance sectors. A few firms have already announced they have no plans to return to the office until late autumn, and Facebook has said it does not plan a return of employees until July 2021. Some smaller businesses are deciding to abandon their offices altogether. Tara Tomes runs a PR agency with an office in the heart of Birmingham's business district. Her team of eight cannot fit in the space they have if they are to obey social distancing guidelines and she will not be renewing the office lease in September. ""I personally don't want to force my team back onto public transport,"" she told the BBC. ""Not having four walls around us won't change the dynamic or culture of the team. If anything it will make us more pioneering in the way the world of work is going."" She said that the money saved on rent and utilities and the time spent not commuting were other benefits to giving up the office. 'I took a pay cut but at least I kept my jobâ Can I work from home overseas? This is what coronavirus will do to our offices and homes Fujitsu announces permanent work-from-home plan Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street acknowledged that the challenges facing city centre businesses were grave but said he was hopeful the climate would gradually improve. ""This is undeniably a very difficult situation for businesses that thrive on the back of the big office occupiers being there. What we are trying to do is steadily build confidence that it is safe to return to the city centre."" He said Birmingham's transport system was currently carrying about 20% of pre-covid numbers but that he hoped this would rise to 50% over the autumn. Still, that means that city centre footfall - which is the lifeblood of businesses that rely on office workers and commuters - would in the best case scenario be half of what it is in normal times. Naomi says the pandemic has been 'devastating' for her business That may be cold comfort to Naomi and her brother James who opened up a new coffee shop in the heart of Birmingham's business district earlier this year. They are now getting less than a fifth of the trade they were banking on. ""It's been devastating really,"" Naomi told the BBC. ""Office workers are absolutely critical to us. We are hoping things improve in September but if they don't we will have to rethink the whole business."" It is, however, too soon to announce the death of the office, according to Rob Groves from office developer Argent, which has just completed the construction of 120,000 feet of office space in Birmingham's Chamberlain Square. While he admitted that some would-be tenants were pressing the pause button, he also insisted there would always be a need for a workplace where people could congregate and collaborate. ""I'd like to challenge people saying they will never need an office and ask them in 12-18 months time whether that was the right decision or just a reaction to what's happening now."" Matthew Hammond, chairman of the Midlands region for PwC One of Argent's blue chip tenants agrees. Accounting and consultancy firm PwC has just moved into the property next door. It is supposed to house 2,000 people but is currently catering to just 150 each day. Nevertheless, Matthew Hammond, chairman of the Midlands region for PwC, said that the office was a must have, particularly for younger workers. ""We have colleagues who may be working at the end of their bed or on a return unit in their kitchen. That is not sustainable or healthy for the longer term. As employers we invest a huge amount in providing the right environment, the right seating, the right technology so people can be at their most productive."" Not everyone has deep enough pockets to afford such flexible working spaces. While many employees want the option of coming to the office, many now see home working as a right, according to Midlands recruitment specialist Kam Vara. ""For many candidates it's now a deal-breaker if there isn't an option for home working, and some are saying they want 100% home working with no physical contact with the office whatsoever."" The knock-on effects of these changes to the world of work could be enormous and long lasting. If people don't need to be in the office, they can be anywhere. And the cost of commuter season tickets and expensive suburban housing within commuting distance of big cities is an expense employers could deduct. Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street is optimistic that what we are witnessing is simply an age old tale of urban evolution, with Covid-19 holding down the fast forward button. ""The calling of the death of the office is very premature. Cities have repurposed themselves before over decades... the coronavirus has just speeded it up."" That may be so, but the short term shock to the city business model feels more like a cardiac arrest than a gentle evolution. And the reluctance on the part of both workers and employers to return to the office poses a grave economic threat to the future of city centres.

"The First Lady has largely steered clear of the political fray Melania Trump addressed the second night of the 2020 Republican National Convention, making a plea for racial unity. It was a rare - and possibly reluctant - step into the spotlight for the First Lady. In 1998, Donald Trump, already fabulously wealthy and charismatic but possessed of a still ordinary-looking head of hair, was probably used to getting a phone number when he asked. But when the property mogul tried it on that year with a young model, at a party in New York, he couldn't quite close the deal. ""I am not giving you my number,"" countered 28-year-old Melania Knavs. ""You give me yours, and I will call you."" Fast-forward seven years and the pair tied the knot in a star-studded bash at his Florida estate. Fast-forward again and Mrs Trump is now the First Lady of the United States. But who is she? Glamorous and entirely devoted to her husband and his success, Mrs Trump, 50, has been cast as a kind of retro presidential spouse, a modern-day Jackie Kennedy. When Mr Trump first hinted at tilting for the top office, in 1999, she told reporters: ""I would be very traditional, like Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy."" But there are ways in which she has been a less-than-traditional First Lady: she is the first to have previously posed nude for a magazine. During the last presidential race, supporters of Ted Cruz - Mr Trump's rival for the Republican nomination in 2016 - seized on her work as a model, overlaying an image of her posing naked with the warning: ""Meet Melania Trump, your next First Lady. Or you could vote for Ted Cruz"". Donald and Melania Trump have a son, Barron (left) Early in 2016, a lewd phone interview with Mr and Mrs Trump by shock-jock radio presenter Howard Stern resurfaced, in which Mr Stern quizzed Mrs Trump about what she was wearing (""almost nothing"") and how often she had sex with Mr Trump (""every night, sometimes more""), and described her to Mr Trump as ""that broad in your bed"". The interview prompted accusations of misogyny. Mrs Trump has also sued the Daily Mail over an article she claims implies that she was a sex worker in the 1990s.The newspaper agreed to pay damagesand apologised to the First Lady in April 2017. Her treatment has been compared by some commentators to ""slut-shaming"" - the practice of attacking women over certain ways of dressing or acting. Mrs Trump was born Melanija Knavs in Sevnica, a small town about an hour's drive from Slovenia's capital Ljubljana, to a relatively well-off family. Her father Viktor worked for the mayor of nearby Hrastnik before becoming a successful car salesman. Her mother, Amalija, designed prints for a fashion brand. Melania studied design and architecture in Ljubljana. It was claimed on her professional website that she held a degree, but it later emerged that she dropped out during her first year. The website was eventually scrubbed entirely and redirected to Mr Trump's business site. This video can not be played What was Melania Trump like in Slovenia? At 18, she signed with a modelling agency in Milan and began flying around Europe and the US, appearing in high-profile ad campaigns. It was at a party at New York Fashion week that she met Mr Trump. Like her husband, she never drinks, according to reports, and shies away from late-night parties. She had her own branded jewellery business and was reportedly involved in the design process. The pair married in 2005 and had a son, Barron, in 2006. She did not initially move in to the White House with her husband after his election victory, remaining in New York until the end of Barron's school term before joining the president in Washington in 2017. Since moving in she has helped out with the annual White House Christmas decorations. This video can not be played First Lady Melania Trump reveals White House Christmas decorations Mrs Trump has apparently squared her background with her husband's attacks on immigration - declaring that she did everything by the book. ""It never crossed my mind to stay here without papers,"" she told Harpers Bazaar. ""You follow the rules. You follow the law. Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa."" In July 2020, a statue of the First Lady in her native Slovenia - which some compared to a character from The Smurfs - was set alight,prompting a police investigation. Mrs Trump has largely steered clear of the political fray, confining her appearances to standing by her husband's side. ""I chose not to go into politics and policy,"" she said in a 2016 interview withGQ,external. ""Those policies are my husband's job."" Her one big moment of the 2016 campaign came when she took centre stage on the first day of the Republican National Convention in July for the traditional spousal speech, and it did not go well. Commentators quickly noticed remarkable similarities with Michelle Obama's convention speech in 2008, and the ensuing plagiarism scandal overshadowed what she had to say. In 2018she generated huge controversy after wearing a jacketwith the words ""I really don't care, do you?"" written on the back on a trip to a migrant child detention centre. There was intense media speculation about why Melania Trump chose to wear the jacket after her trip ""It was for the people and for the left-wing media who are criticising me,"" she later told ABC news. ""I want to show them I don't care."" Despite these incidents she remains something of an unknown quantity compared with her predecessors. According to GQ, she does advise her husband, but is tight-lipped about what that consists in. ""Nobody knows and nobody will ever know,"" she said. ""Because that's between me and my husband.""

"Chalk this up as one more example of how the Republican Party has become the Party of Trump. One of the traditional duties of the delegates to the quadrennial national party conventions, both Democratic and Republican, is to adopt a platform stating their policy preferences and principles. These documents - akin to British party manifestos - are typically the subject of intense haggling and debate among the delegates, but are largely ignored by the candidates themselves, unless opponents decide to highlight a portion they think general-election voters will find extreme or unpopular. Even with the coronavirus pandemic reshaping political conventions this year, the Democrats adopted a 91-page document with headings such as ""Healing the Soul of America"" and ""Restoring and Strengthening Our Democracy"". The party's liberal wing expressed some displeasure with the absence of language endorsing universal healthcare or the ""Green New Deal"" environmental plan. The Republicans, on the other hand, decided to scrap the whole thing entirely. Instead, the delegates gathering for the limited in-person convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, passed a one-page resolution stating that they weren't going to have a new platform, but instead the party ""has and will continue to enthusiastically support the president's America-first agenda"". The delegates said they made this decision because they did not want their reduced number in Charlotte making policy decisions for the entire party. The resolution also took some swipes at the media for their coverage of a June decision by the party's executive committee to adopt the 2016 platform as-is in 2020. While that might seem a reasonable decision given the circumstances, doing so without any changes meant the document included shots meant for the then in-power Democrats, like ""all international executive agreements and political arrangements entered into by the current Administration must be deemed null and void as mere expressions of the current president's preferences"". A simple guide to the US election How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes At the time, Trump tweeted out that he wanted ""a new and updated platform, short form, if possible"" - but that was a desire the delegates apparently ignored. Earlier this week, however, the Trump campaign did release its own bullet-point outline of the president's second-term agenda. The list was a combination of the concrete (""allow 100% expensing deductions for essential industries... who bring back their manufacturing to the US""), the vague (""return to normal in 2021"" and ""teach American exceptionalism""), the already existing (""cover all pre-existing conditions"") and the unrealistic (""create 10 million jobs in 10 months"" and ""wipe out global terrorists who threaten to harm Americans). It included more money for law enforcement, a crackdown on ""violent extremist groups like Antifa"" and the oft-promised, yet-to-be-delivered ""world's greatest infrastructure system"". It reprised old 2016 campaign slogans, like draining the ""globalist swamp"", but made no mention of that centrepiece of Trump's first presidential bid, the border wall with Mexico. If voters want the party itself to provide any more details on these and other policies, however, it seems they'll have to wait for the next Republican convention - in 2024.

"The learning gap between rich and poor primary age pupils in England has widened for the first time since 2007, analysis of government data suggests. And figures for both primary and secondary education show progress in helping poorer pupils catch up has stalled overall. The figures, from 2019, show the shift began even before the pandemic, says the Education Policy Institute. The government said next month's return to school was a ""national priority"". The analysis highlights that policymakers have not adequately responded to warnings that progress in closing the attainment gap was ""losing momentum"", says the EPI. The researchers identify the increasing proportion of children in persistent poverty as a key cause of the reversal which, they say, is becoming more entrenched each year. It is widely expected that lockdown school closures will widen the gap even further, says the EPI. Better-off children 'study more than poorer pupils' 'Digital poverty' in schools where few have laptops Disadvantaged secondary pupils are more than 18 months behind their better-off classmates by the time they take their GCSEs - the same as five years ago, the researchers found. The study also highlights several strong indications that the overall gap has started to widen, including: disadvantaged primary pupils more than nine months behind, with the gap widening for the first time since 2007 disadvantaged reception pupils nearly five months behind, the same as in 2013 last year's reportsaid it would take more than 500 years to close the gap - now it looks as if it is no longer closing at all, says the EPI The researchers found a strong link between persistent poverty and weaker educational performance. Children on free school meals for more than 80% of their schooldays were almost two years (22.7 months) behind their wealthier classmates. Those children on free school meals for less than 20% of their time at school had a learning gap of just under a year (11.3 months). The learning gap for poor pupils was greatest in: Blackpool (26.3 months) Knowsley (24.7 months) and Plymouth (24.5 months) And the gaps are lowest in some London boroughs: Westminster (0.5 months) Redbridge (2.7 months) and Ealing (4.6 months) ""It is deeply concerning that our country entered the pandemic with such a lack of progress in this key area of social policy, and the government urgently needs to put in place new policy measures to help poor children to start to close the gap again,"" said EPI chairman David Laws. Sam Butters and Gina Cicerone, joint chief executives of the Fair Education Alliance which collaborated on the report, called its findings ""sobering"". ""Without systemic change, this gap will never close,"" they added. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said change must start with the youngest children. ""It's time the government recognised this and committed to giving the early years sector the investment it needs,"" he said. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said with children coming to school too hungry to learn, education staff had been working flat out to tackle the effects of poverty, even before the pandemic. He said the new school term was ""the government's chance to right the wrong of society-wide inequality and its impact on educational achievement"". ""They must grasp it."" In a statement, the Department for Education did not directly respond to the report's finding that progress on narrowing the learning gap was stalling even before lockdown, but said it was determined to counter educational disruption caused by the pandemic. ""Our Â£1bn Covid catch-up package will tackle the impact of lost teaching time, including a Â£650m catch-up premium to help schools support all pupils and the Â£350m National Tutoring Programme for disadvantaged students. ""This includes up to Â£9m available for the Nuffield Early Language intervention programme to support those who have missed out on early education at an essential time for their development,"" said the statement.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST. The government has changed its advice for face coverings in schools, saying secondary pupilswill have to wear them in corridorsin local lockdown areas of England. Head teachers in any secondary school will also be able to introduce masks if they want to. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says the new policy follows updated advice from the World Health Organization. In Scotland, students insecondary schoolsmust wear face coverings in corridors or shared areas from next week.Northern Ireland has followed suit, while in Walesa decision on updating the guidanceis due later. Find out more about therules around masks. Bars, cafes and restaurantsin Aberdeen are opening againfor the first time in three weeks after a local lockdown was lifted. But venues are only able to open once they have passed a site inspection by environmental health officers. Hospitality businesses in the city shut earlier this month after a spike in Covid-19 cases linked to bars and nightlife. Earlier this summer, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said parents who did not send their children to school in England in September would be penalised with truancy fines. But psychiatrists say such fines should be dropped amid a Covid-related spike in mental health issues. More than 250 psychiatrists have written to Mr Williamsonsaying a forced return to schoolwill hit pupils with anxiety hard. More than 3,500 complaints about financial issues relating to the coronavirus outbreak have been submitted to the financial ombudsman. The service saidfirms ""must do more""to ensure consumers and small businesses were treated fairly. Complaints from small businesses were often about insurance cover for interrupted trade, while consumers' complaints often related to ruined holiday plans, cancelled weddings and concerts. Diners used Eat Out to Help Outmore than 64 million timesin its first three weeks, according to the latest Treasury figures.

"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police The lawyers for the family of a black man shot in the back by police in the US state of Wisconsin say he will need a ""miracle"" to walk again. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times opening the door of his car in Kenosha. At least one of the bullets went through his spinal cord, lawyers said. Several people were reportedly shot on Tuesday night amid continuing unrest following the police shooting. The governor of Wisconsin is sending more National Guard troops to Kenosha. As a result of the partial or complete severing of his spinal cord, Mr Blake is paralysed, with doctors unsure if he will recover the use of his legs. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting ""His family believe in miracles, but the medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralysed and, because those bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered some of his vertebrae, it is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,"" lawyer Ben Crump told a press conference on Tuesday. The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". This video can not be played Jacob Blake's mother: ""Letâs use our hearts, love and intelligence to work together"" Buildings and cars have been left damaged following protests over the shooting in the city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan. On Tuesday, Governor Tony Evers said he would send more National Guard troops to Kenosha to protect state buildings and support first responders and firefighters. A state of emergency has also been declared in Wisconsin, as protesters clashed with police for a third night. Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death in police custody in Minneapolis of another black man, George Floyd, in May. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident show Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Buildings have been burnt down during protests in Kenosha Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave.

Cars were later set alight, and police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. On Monday, Governor Evers called up the National Guard to aid local police and imposed a night-time curfew on Kenosha. But some ignored the curfew, and police used tear gas to try to force protesters - some of whom were throwing water bottles - to disperse. Police, backed up by the National Guard, also used rubber bullets and smoke bombs, protesters said.

Hundreds of protesters also marched through the city on Tuesday. A small group of demonstrators threw fireworks and water bottles at police, who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. There are also reports of armed men on the streets vowing to defend private property amid the unrest.

"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back by police The lawyers for the family of a black man shot in the back by police in the US state of Wisconsin say he will need a ""miracle"" to walk again. Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times opening the door of his car in Kenosha. At least one of the bullets went through his spinal cord, lawyers said. Several people were reportedly shot on Tuesday night amid continuing unrest following the police shooting. The governor of Wisconsin is sending more National Guard troops to Kenosha. As a result of the partial or complete severing of his spinal cord, Mr Blake is paralysed, with doctors unsure if he will recover the use of his legs. What we know about Jacob Blake's shooting ""His family believe in miracles, but the medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralysed and, because those bullets severed his spinal cord and shattered some of his vertebrae, it is going to take a miracle for Jacob Blake Jr to ever walk again,"" lawyer Ben Crump told a press conference on Tuesday. The 29-year-old, shot as his young sons sat in the car, was also left with holes in his stomach, an arm injury and damage to his kidney and liver. Most of his colon and small intestine had to be removed, his lawyers told reporters. His mother Julia Jackson told the press conference her son had been ""fighting for his life"", but said if he ""knew what was going on as far as that goes, the violence and the destruction, he would be very unpleased"". This video can not be played Jacob Blake's mother: ""Letâs use our hearts, love and intelligence to work together"" Buildings and cars have been left damaged following protests over the shooting in the city of about 100,000 on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan. On Tuesday, Governor Tony Evers said he would send more National Guard troops to Kenosha to protect state buildings and support first responders and firefighters. A state of emergency has also been declared in Wisconsin, as protesters clashed with police for a third night. Mr Blake's shooting comes as the US grapples with the treatment of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement, as well as wider questions about racism in society, since the death in police custody in Minneapolis of another black man, George Floyd, in May. In her speech, Ms Jackson addressed racism directly and called for ""healing"". ""Do you understand what is going to happen when we fall - because a house that is against each other cannot stand."" Police say they were responding to a domestic incident when they went to the site of Sunday's shooting but have given few other details. So far it is unclear who called the police, how many officers were involved, and what happened before the shooting. Footage of the incident show Mr Blake opening the door and leaning into the car, at which point one officer grabs his shirt and opens fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Buildings have been burnt down during protests in Kenosha Mr Blake's fiancÃ©e Laquisha Booker, said the children - who witnessed everything as they sat in the back of the car - were screaming as their father was shot. Lawyers for Mr Blake said he had been trying to ""de-escalate a domestic incident"". Witnesses said the same to local media. Court records show there was an open arrest warrant against Mr Blake on sexual assault and domestic abuse charges but police have not said if officers were aware of this when they responded to the call on Sunday. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident in Kenosha, while the officers involved have been placed on administrative leave.

Today's live page has been the work of Mal Siret, Ashitha Nagesh, Penny Spiller, Tori Lindrea, Hazel Shearing and Marie Jackson. We'll be back with more on Thursday. Until then, stay well and thanks for joining us. Now to the latest key global developments: As we near the end of today's coverage, here are the main headlines from around the UK:  Spending for the second week of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme rose 9% Some UK restaurants say they will continue the government-funded Eat Out to Help Out scheme into September with their own cash because it has been so successful. Latest HM Treasury data shows diners used the government scheme more than 64 million timesin its first three weeks. The scheme, which is now in its final week, offers customers in restaurants, pubs and cafes 50% off their meal, up to a maximum of Â£10 per head. It has been running every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in August to encourage support for the hospitality sector. Commercial landlord Grosvenor has said it will subsidise discounted meals for its restaurant tenants in Belgravia and Mayfair, while elsewhere restaurants are individually deciding to extend the offer. ""The scheme has not just benefited businesses commercially, it appears to have really boosted consumer confidence as well, which is just as important,"" said Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality. Want to find out which restaurants are extending the offer? Read on.  Health officials are saying that up to 30 young people in Plymouth, on the south coast of England, could be infected with coronavirus having returned from holiday in Greece. Plymouth's public health team said the group of 18 and 19-year-olds returned from the island of Zante last week and so far 11 have tested positive. Many had minor symptoms or none at all, they added. Greece is not currently on the list of countries with quarantine restrictions for UK travellers. The city's director for public health Ruth Harrell said her team were working alongside national systems to contact and trace those thought to have been affected. Read more here. Cornwall is one of the UK's most popular tourist destinations The UK is set to lose up to Â£22bn in tourism revenues this yearbecause of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry body has predicted. Spending by visitors from overseas could fall by as much as 78% - equivalent to Â£60m a day, said the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC). The WTTC said tourists were ""staying away from the UK in droves"" because of uncertainty over travel restrictions and because it has the highest coronavirus death toll of any European country. This summer's ""staycation"" boomhas seen UK residents flocking to book holidays at home, but the WTTC thinks the lack of foreign visitors will still inflict significant economic damage - with London hit hardest by the collapse in visitor numbers. WTTC President Gloria Guevara said domestic spending was ""highly unlikely to offset the collapse of international travel"". ""We urgently need to replace stop-start quarantine measures with rapid, comprehensive and cost-effective test and trace programmes at departure points across the country,"" she added. Staff in care homes are regularly tested for Covid-19 The National Care Forum (NCF) has written an open letter to England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock calling for a reversal of the decision to allow inspectors into care homes without weekly testing. The NCF, which represents 120 social care charities in the UK, called the decision to allow Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors to conduct on-site inspections of care homes without regular testing for Covid-19 ""extraordinary"". âFor months central government and the regulator have been requiring care homes to essentially eradicate the movement of staff and the flow of people, including close family relatives, into homes. ""Having done this, care homes are now being asked to let inspectors into homes without knowing whether or not they are Covid-positive. Understandably they are both shocked and hugely concerned,"" said Vic Rayner, executive director at the NCF. ""If inspectors are coming in, they need to be tested â there should be no further debate about this."" Visitors to Moma will be met by this newly-installed sign Some normality is returning to New York with the imminent reopening of many of its most famous museums and art galleries. The Museum of Modern Art, Moma, opens its doors on Thursday with free timed tickets for those visiting over the next month. Director Glenn Lowrytold ABC News,externalthat the museum was facing significant financial losses because of the coronavirus but deciding not to charge visitors for the first month ""felt like the right gesture"". The Metropolitan Museum of Art is set to reopen on Saturday, and the American Museum of Natural History and 9/11 Memorial Museum will start welcoming back visitors in September.  There have been a further 1,048 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. Sixteen people have died, bringing the total death toll of those who died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 to 41,465, according to figures released by Public Health England. Overall, 328,846 cases have been confirmed in the UK. The test has already been given approval in the US The health service in Scotland has signed a deal for equipment which allows Covid-19 tests to be carried out in just 12 minutes. NHS Scotland is to spend Â£6.76m on 300 rapid testing machines and at least 500,000 tests. The deal with life sciences company LumiraDx will see the test strips made at its Stirling base. The testing machines are said to be highly portable and can be used in local clinics or mobile units. The test, which is going through the final stages of validation for use in Scotland and the rest of Europe, detects the Covid-19 antigen protein from a nasal swab in 12 minutes - considerably faster than the 90 minutes typically needed by other rapid tests which are currently being trialled.

the Gaza Strip after a 61-year-old man became the second person with the
disease to die in the Palestinian territory, and several new cases
were discovered outside its quarantine centres. Early on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry announced
that two people had tested positive at the territoryâs largest hospital -
forcing it to close and causing locals to panic. Police were posted at the gates of Shifa Hospital in Gaza
City, and all its doctors and nurses were tested. The BBCâs Yolande Knell in Jerusalem says the outbreak
has caused alarm because of Gaza's weak healthcare system. After five cases were confirmed in one family living in a refugee camp on Monday, a curfew was imposed across Gaza. Previously, our correspondent adds, the relative
isolation of the territory - kept under blockade by Israel and Egypt - and
strict quarantine controls meant that Covid-19 had not spread among the general
population. The new infections were reported as an envoy from Qatar, which
has been sending aid money to Gaza, arrived for meetings to try to ease rising
tensions with Israel. In recent nights, Israeli warplanes or tanks have struck
what they say are militant targets in Gaza in retaliation for the launch of
rockets and balloons with incendiary devices attached. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to meet with families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said it was the fifth time members had asked to meet the PM, but Mr Johnson said he was ""not aware"" of the group's previous letters. ""Of course I will meet the bereaved,"" the prime minister told Sky News on Wednesday. However, No 10 are yet to confirm that a meeting will take place. The group of 1,600 families are calling for a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic. Co-founder Jo Goodman, who lost her father to the virus, said: ""We welcome Boris Johnson finally agreeing to meet with us. ""It shouldn't have taken him months to agree to it, and it should only be a matter of days before it happens. ""If the prime minister had replied to our first letter back in June, a rapid review could be reporting right now, giving crucial lessons on how to save lives as the virus spikes again, as we're seeing in locations across the country."" Jonathan Slater was permanent secretary at the Department for Education Another head has rolled over the UK's exam results fiasco. The Department for Education announced its most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, would step down on 1 September, adding ""the prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership"". Boris Johnson earlier blamed a ""mutant algorithm"" for creating a situation in which many students' A-level results were unfairly downgraded and they lost out on university and college places. The National Education Union accused Mr Johnson of trying to ""idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created"". Mr Slater's departure comes a day after the resignation of Sally Collier, head of the exams regulating body, Ofqual. Meanwhile Gavin Williamson, education secretary, stays in his job. Police patrolled public spaces to ensure lockdown rules were being followed at the height of the pandemic Crime in England and Wales fell by almost a third in the first two full months of lockdown, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was driven by falls in reported thefts and burglary, the ONS said. Butthe ONS said,externaldrug crime rose by up to 44% compared with the same period last year, due to targeted policing. A survey also suggests the vast majority of adults (91%) are satisfied with the way police have dealt with the coronavirus restrictions. The figures, which are based on telephone research, support earlier data from police forces of a significant decline in offending during April and May. Read the full story here. It will be up to schools and councils in Wales to decide if face coverings need to be wornby pupils in communal areas and on school transport, the Welsh government has said. A government statement says the use of masks is recommended  indoors for older pupils, where social distancing cannot be maintained. But ministers are not mandating their use in schools, suggesting head teachers must take a decision based on ""risk assessments"" of school buildings. Teaching union NAHT Cymru deemed the policy ""unacceptable"", saying ""head teachers are not medical experts and the Welsh government should not put them in this position."" In England, the government has said secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors where a local lockdown is in place, but elsewhere head teachers would have ""flexibility"" on the issue. Pupils in secondary schools in both Scotland and Northern Ireland are recommending the use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next week.  Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green says the government has not been clear in its guidance for schools and ""constant chopping and changing and passing the buck"" has not left parents or staff feeling very reassured. She says it was right for the government to act on changed scientific and medical advice, but it needs to be clear, with discussions and guidance for those impacted. Head teachers needed data like local infection rates and what sort of action they should take if a child was unwell at school or there was a local outbreak, she says - and heads have been pressing government for access to that data. She said the stop-starting and confusion was ""really damaging for students, for the confidence of their parents and their teachers"". ""I am concerned that we shouldn't have to face the fact that these young people become a Covid generation whose long-term prospects are blighted by the effect of the  lockdown and the education they've missed."" Gatwick - the UKâs second largest airport - has announced plans to cut around 600 jobs, as it significantly restructures its business in the wake of the pandemic. The airport is proposing to cut some 24% of the current staff following a dramatic slump in passenger numbers and air traffic since March. In August, usually one of the airport's busiest months, passenger numbers are more than 80% lower than the same month last year, with only the North Terminal operating. The chief executive of Gatwick Airport, Stewart Wingate, said it was a ""stark reminder"" of ""the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry"". ""We will continue to do all we can to preserve as many jobs as possible,"" he added. Katharine Birbalsingh, head teacher of Michaela Community School in London, said there was a ""need to take into account children's behaviour when considering whether or not masks make them safer"". ""What about the children who turn up to school with uniforms that aren't washed? They don't necessarily wash themselves, they come to school hungry, they will be wearing reused dirty masks,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""They'll swap them... they'll wear them incorrectly, they'll lose them. When half of your children show up to school and aren't wearing masks, what to do you, do you exclude them?"" But Liam Powell, head teacher at Manor High in Leicestershire - which was affected by the recent local lockdown - told the programme: ""I think we have to have high expectations of our children and we have to modify the way they behave."" His school has made the use of face coverings optional. ""A lot of our parents are in the medical profession and they know a lot about viruses, and a lot of them are quite anxious,"" he said. ""What we've said to parents is it's sensible to carry a mask anyway because you may be travelling on public transport, the school bus or going into a shop on your way to school or on the way home."" Kenya's education minister has hinted at reopening schools earlier than his initial proposal of January 2021 - if coronavirus cases continue to fall. George Magoha has said tertiary institutions may also reopen earlier than was planned. Kenya scrapped the entire 2020 academic year in March because of the pandemic. The minister said it would be in the interest of learners to reopen schools early if the infection rate maintains its recent downward trend. The ministry of health has been reporting lower numbers in its daily updates, with the director general saying the rate needs to be below 5% for a period of two weeks for the curve to be said to be flattening. The World Health Organization and Unicef last week urged African countries to consider reopening schools but with strict guidelines. The agencies said children were being exposed to violence, teenage pregnancies and poor nutrition while at home during the pandemic. Karina Fuentes helps her seven-year-old daughter Julieta during a televised class School lessons have resumed in Mexico but with the number of coronavirus infections still high, children will not yet return to classrooms. Schools were among the first institutions to close as the virus began to spread through the country in March. As many Mexican families do not have access to the internet, classes will be broadcast on TV. Official figures suggest 93% of homes have access to TV. Mexico has one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in the world. Since the pandemic started, 61,450 people have died with Covid. Only the United States and Brazil have had higher death tolls.

This was driven by falls in reported thefts and burglary, the ONS said. Butthe ONS said,externaldrug crime rose by up to 44% compared with the same period last year, due to targeted policing. A survey also suggests the vast majority of adults (91%) are satisfied with the way police have dealt with the coronavirus restrictions. The figures, which are based on telephone research, support earlier data from police forces of a significant decline in offending during April and May. Read the full story here. It will be up to schools and councils in Wales to decide if face coverings need to be wornby pupils in communal areas and on school transport, the Welsh government has said. A government statement says the use of masks is recommended  indoors for older pupils, where social distancing cannot be maintained. But ministers are not mandating their use in schools, suggesting head teachers must take a decision based on ""risk assessments"" of school buildings. Teaching union NAHT Cymru deemed the policy ""unacceptable"", saying ""head teachers are not medical experts and the Welsh government should not put them in this position."" In England, the government has said secondary pupils will have to wear face coverings in school corridors where a local lockdown is in place, but elsewhere head teachers would have ""flexibility"" on the issue. Pupils in secondary schools in both Scotland and Northern Ireland are recommending the use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next week.  Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green says the government has not been clear in its guidance for schools and ""constant chopping and changing and passing the buck"" has not left parents or staff feeling very reassured. She says it was right for the government to act on changed scientific and medical advice, but it needs to be clear, with discussions and guidance for those impacted. Head teachers needed data like local infection rates and what sort of action they should take if a child was unwell at school or there was a local outbreak, she says - and heads have been pressing government for access to that data. She said the stop-starting and confusion was ""really damaging for students, for the confidence of their parents and their teachers"". ""I am concerned that we shouldn't have to face the fact that these young people become a Covid generation whose long-term prospects are blighted by the effect of the  lockdown and the education they've missed."" Gatwick - the UKâs second largest airport - has announced plans to cut around 600 jobs, as it significantly restructures its business in the wake of the pandemic. The airport is proposing to cut some 24% of the current staff following a dramatic slump in passenger numbers and air traffic since March. In August, usually one of the airport's busiest months, passenger numbers are more than 80% lower than the same month last year, with only the North Terminal operating. The chief executive of Gatwick Airport, Stewart Wingate, said it was a ""stark reminder"" of ""the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry"". ""We will continue to do all we can to preserve as many jobs as possible,"" he added. Katharine Birbalsingh, head teacher of Michaela Community School in London, said there was a ""need to take into account children's behaviour when considering whether or not masks make them safer"". ""What about the children who turn up to school with uniforms that aren't washed? They don't necessarily wash themselves, they come to school hungry, they will be wearing reused dirty masks,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""They'll swap them... they'll wear them incorrectly, they'll lose them. When half of your children show up to school and aren't wearing masks, what to do you, do you exclude them?"" But Liam Powell, head teacher at Manor High in Leicestershire - which was affected by the recent local lockdown - told the programme: ""I think we have to have high expectations of our children and we have to modify the way they behave."" His school has made the use of face coverings optional. ""A lot of our parents are in the medical profession and they know a lot about viruses, and a lot of them are quite anxious,"" he said. ""What we've said to parents is it's sensible to carry a mask anyway because you may be travelling on public transport, the school bus or going into a shop on your way to school or on the way home."" Kenya's education minister has hinted at reopening schools earlier than his initial proposal of January 2021 - if coronavirus cases continue to fall. George Magoha has said tertiary institutions may also reopen earlier than was planned. Kenya scrapped the entire 2020 academic year in March because of the pandemic. The minister said it would be in the interest of learners to reopen schools early if the infection rate maintains its recent downward trend. The ministry of health has been reporting lower numbers in its daily updates, with the director general saying the rate needs to be below 5% for a period of two weeks for the curve to be said to be flattening. The World Health Organization and Unicef last week urged African countries to consider reopening schools but with strict guidelines. The agencies said children were being exposed to violence, teenage pregnancies and poor nutrition while at home during the pandemic. Karina Fuentes helps her seven-year-old daughter Julieta during a televised class School lessons have resumed in Mexico but with the number of coronavirus infections still high, children will not yet return to classrooms. Schools were among the first institutions to close as the virus began to spread through the country in March. As many Mexican families do not have access to the internet, classes will be broadcast on TV. Official figures suggest 93% of homes have access to TV. Mexico has one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in the world. Since the pandemic started, 61,450 people have died with Covid. Only the United States and Brazil have had higher death tolls.

"As the first pupils in England return to school, psychiatrists say truancy fines should be dropped amid a Covid-related spike in mental health issues. More than 250 psychiatrists have written to the education secretary saying a forced return to school will hit pupils with anxiety hard. Pupils in Leicestershire and Leicester are the first to return to regular school since schools shut in March. Some of these areas were under local lockdown restrictions until recently. Earlier this summer, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that parents who did not send their children to school in September would be penalised with truancy fines. School attendance during the summer term, for those pupils who were in year groups that were allowed to return to lessons, had remained optional, with parents reassured by the government that the usual truancy fines would not be applied. The threat of fines, which aims to get all children back in school, was criticised for not taking account of families who have members shielding from coronavirus. There have also been concerns about the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures on the well-being of children, who may have lost relatives to Covid-19. Tamsin Ford, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at Cambridge University, said: ""I'd be extremely surprised if we don't have a spike in the number of children who - for mental health reasons, particularly anxiety - find it very difficult to go back to school regularly or at all."" She described how those suffering from anxiety can have terrifying thoughts that prevent them from functioning in a normal way. ""Catastrophic thoughts like 'I'm going to die' or 'I am going to collapse' or 'if I do this, then something dreadful will happen'. She added: ""Sometimes concerns about family members who might be ill or shielding or vulnerable can trigger really, really terrifying thoughts that can have a physical impact as well. Anxiety could lead to diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach cramps and other conditions that make it difficult to function physically and attend schools, she added. social distancing sign She said: ""Services have seen far more children in crisis, there's far less support around and we do know there are far more families under financial and other stresses."" The letter, organised by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, warns that although many families will be relieved that pupils are returning to school, for others ""it could be a significant source of anxiety"". ""As child and adolescent psychiatrists, we have seen the devastating impact the Covid-19 crisis has had on the mental health of many young people,"" says the letter. ""This is at a time when the lockdown and social distancing has made it even harder for them to access mental health support. It adds: ""The threat of fines could force parents of children who feel anxious to send them back to school even if they're not ready. ""This could have serious consequences on their mental health, especially if they are worried about family shielding."" A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""Schools should work with families to ensure children are attending full time from September. As usual, fines will sit alongside this, but only as a last resort and where there is no valid reason for absence."" Speaking as he launched the DfE's Wellbeing for Education Return programme, Mr Williamson said: ""This pandemic has impacted people in different ways, particularly young people dealing with the disruption of the last few months, but also our dedicated teachers and education staff."" The programme works in part by recruiting mental health experts to deliver training to nominated school staff. It aims to help staff spot the signs of when children are struggling. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said fines were too blunt an instrument to use while coronavirus is still a concern. He said fines ""drive a wedge between schools and families at the best of times"". ""That is something we can ill-afford when the priority is to get more pupils back into class. ""Achieving this will rely on a huge amount of co-operation and understanding between schools and families,"" he added.

"Aberdeen has a local lockdown for three weeks Bars, cafes and restaurants in Aberdeen are opening again for the first time in three weeks after a local lockdown was lifted. Hospitality businesses shut on 5 August after a spike in Covid-19 cases linked to bars and nightlife in the city. Venues are only able to open once they have passed a site inspection by environmental health officers. Stuart McPhee, who runs Siberia Bar and Hotel, predicted things would be ""very different"" this time around. The opening up of the hospitality trade comes after afive-mile restriction on travel ended on Monday. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was grateful to the people of Aberdeen for complying with the rules that had been put in place. 'We will only open again when I think it is safe' Local lockdown in Aberdeen extended Restrictions 'having an impact on cases' Aberdeen lockdown 'feels never-ending' The city council said environmental health teams had so far inspected 327 venues, with more to be completed before the start of trading on Wednesday. Mr McPhee is part of a recently-created group called Aberdeen Hospitality Together, an industry body set up to help the sector recover from the Covid situation. Stuart McPhee said he did not envy those having to make the decisions He said of the fresh re-opening: ""I think it will be very different. The first reopening was very much that kind of release of pressure from that three-month lockdown. ""I think we will have all learned lessons from the local lockdown, and I think we will all be operating in new ways. ""Especially from our own point of view, we are really looking to rebuild that confidence with the customer and just let them know it is safe to come back in to our environments and that we are doing everything that we can to keep them safe."" Lorenzo Maraviglia works at Union Cafe and Bistro. He said of re-opening: ""I'm really happy - this has been a very tough period. The business has suffered a lot. ""We were doing takeaways and deliveries but it wasn't giving the business what it needs to keep running. ""No-one can afford another lockdown."" Lorenzo Maraviglia said less people had been in the city centre He explained: ""After two days of the 'Eat Out to Help Out' offer, everything closed, so we couldn't let people use it. It was a shame. ""This new lockdown has been even harder for us than the previous one. Before when we were just doing takeaways, we were fine, we were managing to operate without much trouble. ""But, this new lockdown was very hard. The amount of business reduced so much because other businesses in the area were closed and there were less people in the city centre again."" Hospitality business owners are being urged to get in touch with Aberdeen City Council if they have not already had an environmental health check. Ahead of Sunday's lockdown lifting announcement, talks were held involving the Scottish government, Aberdeen City Council, NHS Grampian and Police Scotland. By Tuesday, 261 cases had been associated with the cluster linked to Aberdeen pubs, up two from Monday. The local lockdown restrictions, which have affected 228,000 people in Aberdeen, were: bars, cafes, restaurants and pubs were closed no travel for more than five miles for leisure or holidays no travel to the city for leisure or to visit friends and family, even if you lived in Aberdeenshire no indoor visits with other households visiting suspended for most hospitals A Â£1m support fund was set up for the city, with grants of up to Â£1,500 available for hospitality businesses. FACTS F- Face coverings. These should be used in shops and on public transport (buses, trains and taxis) A- Avoid crowded places.

"The row over the US Postal Service has triggered outrage and demonstrations Three US states are suing the Trump administration over changes to the US Postal Service (USPS) ahead of the November election. It is the latest development in a huge row over the federal agency, which is tasked with handling mail-in ballots for the vote. The filing alleges ""partisan meddling"" is slowing deliveries, which could ""endanger"" election plans. Neither the White House nor the USPS have yet commented on the filing. Democrats allege that the head of the USPS, who was appointed by US President Donald Trump, has tried to deliberately ""sabotage"" the election with a series of recent reforms. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy has dismissed the allegations. The top Republican donor told senators on Friday thatall ballots will arrive on timeand announced the reforms would be delayed until after the election. But he has overseen the removal of mail boxes and reduced overtime pay for workers. What is US row over postal service about? Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? An unprecedented number of US voters are expected to vote by post this year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Mr Trump has repeatedly made allegations that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud - something dismissed by experts and voting officials. Hawaii, New Jersey and New York states are all plaintiffs in the lawsuit, as are the cities of San Francisco and New York. ""Thanks to a series of sweeping policy changes beleaguered by partisan meddling, the independent agency has become a political football set to undermine a federal election,""the filing reads,external. It claims President Trump has ""repeatedly, emphatically, and openly attempted to undermine mail-in voting efforts"". Officials appointed by him meanwhile ""eliminated or substantially altered"" processes that kept mail delivered on time, leading to severe delays and a massive backlog. New York state Attorney General Letitia James tweeted on Tuesday about filing the suit. ""The slowdown is nothing more than a voter suppression tactic,"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""Look at things from all perspectives"" US First Lady Melania Trump has made a plea for racial unity, in a live speech from the White House to the Republican party convention. ""Stop the violence and looting,"" she also said as protests continued over a police shooting in Wisconsin. Mrs Trump urged Americans to stop making assumptions based on race and reflected candidly on US history. President Donald Trump currently trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in opinion polls for November's election. Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Republicans scrap party platform. What that means... How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump will address the convention's final night on Thursday. The normally limelight-shunning US first lady delivered Tuesday evening's keynote address before a small audience, including her husband, in the Rose Garden of the White House. ""Like all of you, I have reflected on the racial unrest in our country,"" she said. ""It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history. I encourage you to focus on the future while still learning from the past."" She added: ""I urge people to come together in a civil manner so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals. ""I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice, and never make assumptions based on the colour of a person's skin."" Tuesday's convention schedule began with a prayer for Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old black man shot multiple times in the back by police in Wisconsin on Sunday. Shot US black man 'needs miracle to walk again' Mr Trump tweeted a call for the Midwestern state's governor to bring in the National Guard as unrest continued following the shooting. The president has often been accused by opponents of stoking racial tension, though black speakers at the opening night of the Republican convention emphatically denied he was racist. In her speech, Mrs Trump also expressed compassion for Americans worried about the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans. ""I know many people are anxious,"" she said. ""Some feel helpless. I want you to know you're not alone."" This video can not be played 'Trump's actions speak louder than stickers or slogans' She praised her husband as a someone who ""makes no secrets about how he feels about things"". ""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president. Whether you like it or not you always know what he's thinking."" Her decision to speak from the seat of presidential power has angered Democrats, who said the venue was an inappropriate use of government resources for political purposes. An unusual, traditional First Lady Melania headlines day two of Trump's convention If the first night of the Republican National Convention was about addressing the president's perceived weaknesses among American voters - on the coronavirus pandemic, racial issues and overall empathy - Tuesday focused on motivating his base, from anti-abortion activists to Christian conservatives. Meanwhile, the president flexed his executive powers from the White House in two extraordinary norm-stretching bits of political theatre - issuing a pardon and taking part in a naturalisation ceremony. First Lady Melania Trump wrapped up the evening from the newly renovated Rose Garden. She was one of the few to directly express sympathy for those who have suffered from Covid-19. It was a stark contrast with White House economist Larry Kudlow, who talked about the pandemic in the past tense earlier in the night. Unless something changes in the coming months, coronavirus will be at the top of voters' minds when they cast their ballots. And while red meat for the base is useful, public perception of the president's handling of the virus - and its economic fallout - will factor heavily in deciding his political fate. The second night - which was designed around the theme of ""Land of Opportunity"" - also heard from the president's children, Eric and Tiffany Trump. Eric railed against ""radical Democrats"" - a recurring message of the convention so far. ""They want to disrespect our National Anthem by taking a knee,"" he said, ""while our armed forces lay down their lives every day to protect our freedom."" This video can not be played ""I would crawl through broken glass to vote for Trump in this election"" Tiffany, Mr Trump's daughter with his second wife Marla Maples, accused the media and tech companies of keeping Americans ""mentally enslaved"". This video can not be played Former Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake is backing Democrat Joe Biden In a controversial appearance, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a pre-recorded speech from Jerusalem, praising the president's ""America First vision"". Mr Trump has sought to portray himself as the most pro-Israeli president ever. Normally, the nation's top diplomat does not attend political conventions, withsome making a deliberate point of being out of the country and unavailable during their political parties' presidential nominating events,external, the Associated Press reports. Mike Pompeo in Jerusalem ""It is unprecedented and highly unethical for a sitting secretary of state to address a political convention while on official foreign travel,"" said Halie Soifer, the head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. The state department stressed that no taxpayer money was used to produce Mr Pompeo's video, which was made during an official tour of the Middle East. Though he is not scheduled to deliver his keynote address to the convention until its final night, Mr Trump played a major role in Tuesday's schedule, just as he did on the opening day. The conference featured emotional footage of the president earlier on Tuesday pardoning a Nevada bank robber, Jon Ponder, a black man who founded a charity that helps convicts reintegrate into society. Former bank robber Jon Ponder, left, was pardoned in a video shown to the convention In another surprise moment of the night, Mr Trump appeared live from the White House to preside over a naturalisation ceremony for immigrants. Critics said the segment was hypocritical, as Mr Trump has taken steps during his presidency to restrict legal immigration, as well as crack down on illegal immigration. Mr Biden's campaign accused the president of using the newly coined American citizens as ""props"". ""Immigrants and Latinos are not props, and these empty gestures won't make us forget Donald Trump's failures,"" the Democrat's Latino media director, Jennifer Molina, told AP news agency.

"Holiday refund issues were a common problem More than 3,500 complaints about financial issues relating to the coronavirus outbreak have been submitted to the financial ombudsman. The service said firms ""must do more"" to ensure consumers and small businesses were treated fairly. The number of complaints from small businesses, often about support loans and insurance, already outnumber the total from the last financial year. The cases are still being investigated and some might prove to be unfounded. However, the ombudsman said it expected many more issues to be raised by people left financially stretched by the economic fall-out from the virus. Coronavirus: Can I get travel insurance and what are my travel rights? How the financial shockwave is affecting jobs and money Anyone in the UK has the right to take unresolved complaints to the ombudsman for adjudication. While the service said many financial firms coped well in trying conditions, the list of complaints highlighted consumers' key concerns during recent months. Chief among them were ruined holiday plans, and subsequent claims to insurers and credit card providers. Frustrations over refunds for cancelled weddings and concerts also featured. Complaints from small businesses were often about insurance cover for interrupted trade. Many small businesses had to close their doors during lockdown Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman and chief executive of the service, said: ""Covid-19 has had a huge impact on virtually all elements of our lives, including our finances. ""Since measures to control the virus in the UK were put in place, we've been hearing from people who aren't happy with how their financial provider has treated them. ""Some financial businesses must continue to do more to ensure they are treating their customers fairly."" A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said: ""Despite the unprecedented operational challenges, insurers have been delivering to customers during a very  stressful period. ""This includes expecting to pay a record Â£275m in travel cancellations under travel insurance, Â£900m to those firms covered for Covid-19, as well as settling Â£2bn in motor claims during the second quarter of the year.

"Phil Hogan has been under intense scrutiny since it emerged he attended an Irish parliamentary golf society event last week The Irish government has said it is clear EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan breached coronavirus health guidelines after returning to the Republic. He has faced criticism for attending a golf dinner with more than 80 people, and for not complying with quarantine rules on arrival from Brussels. The leaders of the coalition government in Dublin have welcomed an apology from Mr Hogan, but said concerns remained. Earlier, Mr Hogan published a timeline of his movements in Ireland. He provided details to the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, about his time in Ireland leading up to his attendance at the Oireachtas Golf Society event in County Galway on 19 August. Irish agriculture minister quits over golf dinner EU commissioner 'sorry' for golf dinner attendance However, three party leaders said Mr Hogan's ""delayed and hesitant release of information has undermined public confidence"". In the documents, Mr Hogan said he tested negative for Covid-19 during a hospital visit on 5 August. He said this meant he was ""not under any subsequent legal requirement to self-isolate or quarantine"". Leo Varadkar, MicheÃ¡l Martin and Eamon Ryan issued a joint statement on Tuesday night However, Ireland's Department of Health has said a person is required to restrict their movements for 14 days if they arrive into Ireland from a country not on the green list. It said the guidance does not state that a negative Covid-19 test shortens the 14-days requirement. Mr Hogan's primary residence is in Brussels and he arrived in Ireland on 31 July, travelling to his temporary residence in Kildare. In their joint statement, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, TÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said the guidelines ""clearly required him to restrict his movements for 14 days"". They said he should also have limited his movements to and from Kildare for essential travel only, and he should not have attended the golf dinner. The statement adds that people are ""correctly angered by these actions"". They added that Mr Hogan was accountable to the European Commission and they awaited the outcome of the review being carried out by Ms von der Leyen. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Hogan told the Irish state broadcaster RTÃ that he broke no regulations while in Ireland, was no risk to anybody but made big mistakes and is very embarrassed. Speaking to RTÃ News,he apologised once again for attending the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner. Mr Hogan repeatedly argued that his negative test for Covid-19 exempted him from the requirement to restrict movements for 14 days. It also emerged at the weekend that the commissioner was stopped by gardaÃ­ (Irish police) for using his mobile phone while driving in County Kildare on 17 August.

"This video can not be played Melania Trump: ""Look at things from all perspectives"" US First Lady Melania Trump has made a plea for racial unity, in a live speech from the White House to the Republican party convention. ""Stop the violence and looting,"" she also said as protests continued over a police shooting in Wisconsin. Mrs Trump urged Americans to stop making assumptions based on race and reflected candidly on US history. President Donald Trump currently trails Democratic challenger Joe Biden in opinion polls for November's election. Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? Republicans scrap party platform. What that means... How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump will address the convention's final night on Thursday. The normally limelight-shunning US first lady delivered Tuesday evening's keynote address before a small audience, including her husband, in the Rose Garden of the White House. ""Like all of you, I have reflected on the racial unrest in our country,"" she said. ""It is a harsh reality that we are not proud of parts of our history. I encourage you to focus on the future while still learning from the past."" She added: ""I urge people to come together in a civil manner so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals. ""I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice, and never make assumptions based on the colour of a person's skin."" Tuesday's convention schedule began with a prayer for Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old black man shot multiple times in the back by police in Wisconsin on Sunday. Shot US black man 'needs miracle to walk again' Mr Trump tweeted a call for the Midwestern state's governor to bring in the National Guard as unrest continued following the shooting. The president has often been accused by opponents of stoking racial tension, though black speakers at the opening night of the Republican convention emphatically denied he was racist. In her speech, Mrs Trump also expressed compassion for Americans worried about the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 178,000 Americans. ""I know many people are anxious,"" she said. ""Some feel helpless. I want you to know you're not alone."" This video can not be played 'Trump's actions speak louder than stickers or slogans' She praised her husband as a someone who ""makes no secrets about how he feels about things"". ""Total honesty is what we as citizens deserve from our president. Whether you like it or not you always know what he's thinking."" Her decision to speak from the seat of presidential power has angered Democrats, who said the venue was an inappropriate use of government resources for political purposes. An unusual, traditional First Lady Melania headlines day two of Trump's convention If the first night of the Republican National Convention was about addressing the president's perceived weaknesses among American voters - on the coronavirus pandemic, racial issues and overall empathy - Tuesday focused on motivating his base, from anti-abortion activists to Christian conservatives. Meanwhile, the president flexed his executive powers from the White House in two extraordinary norm-stretching bits of political theatre - issuing a pardon and taking part in a naturalisation ceremony. First Lady Melania Trump wrapped up the evening from the newly renovated Rose Garden. She was one of the few to directly express sympathy for those who have suffered from Covid-19. It was a stark contrast with White House economist Larry Kudlow, who talked about the pandemic in the past tense earlier in the night. Unless something changes in the coming months, coronavirus will be at the top of voters' minds when they cast their ballots. And while red meat for the base is useful, public perception of the president's handling of the virus - and its economic fallout - will factor heavily in deciding his political fate. The second night - which was designed around the theme of ""Land of Opportunity"" - also heard from the president's children, Eric and Tiffany Trump. Eric railed against ""radical Democrats"" - a recurring message of the convention so far. ""They want to disrespect our National Anthem by taking a knee,"" he said, ""while our armed forces lay down their lives every day to protect our freedom."" This video can not be played ""I would crawl through broken glass to vote for Trump in this election"" Tiffany, Mr Trump's daughter with his second wife Marla Maples, accused the media and tech companies of keeping Americans ""mentally enslaved"". This video can not be played Former Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake is backing Democrat Joe Biden In a controversial appearance, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a pre-recorded speech from Jerusalem, praising the president's ""America First vision"". Mr Trump has sought to portray himself as the most pro-Israeli president ever. Normally, the nation's top diplomat does not attend political conventions, withsome making a deliberate point of being out of the country and unavailable during their political parties' presidential nominating events,external, the Associated Press reports. Mike Pompeo in Jerusalem ""It is unprecedented and highly unethical for a sitting secretary of state to address a political convention while on official foreign travel,"" said Halie Soifer, the head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America. The state department stressed that no taxpayer money was used to produce Mr Pompeo's video, which was made during an official tour of the Middle East. Though he is not scheduled to deliver his keynote address to the convention until its final night, Mr Trump played a major role in Tuesday's schedule, just as he did on the opening day. The conference featured emotional footage of the president earlier on Tuesday pardoning a Nevada bank robber, Jon Ponder, a black man who founded a charity that helps convicts reintegrate into society. Former bank robber Jon Ponder, left, was pardoned in a video shown to the convention In another surprise moment of the night, Mr Trump appeared live from the White House to preside over a naturalisation ceremony for immigrants. Critics said the segment was hypocritical, as Mr Trump has taken steps during his presidency to restrict legal immigration, as well as crack down on illegal immigration. Mr Biden's campaign accused the president of using the newly coined American citizens as ""props"". ""Immigrants and Latinos are not props, and these empty gestures won't make us forget Donald Trump's failures,"" the Democrat's Latino media director, Jennifer Molina, told AP news agency.
