"This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Sir Philip Green paid a female employee more than Â£1m to keep quiet after she accused him of kissing and groping her,the Daily Telegraph has reported,external. The paper said the senior female employee was one of five members of staff who signed gagging orders after being bullied or harassed. It reported a black male executive also received Â£1m after Sir Philip said he was ""throwing spears in the jungle"". The Topshop boss denies allegations he behaved wrongly. Lawyers representing Sir Philip told the Telegraph that he was a ""passionate businessman, who can at times be over-exuberant and hot-headed"" and that he could be ""perceived at times as aggressive with senior and trusted staff"". Sir Philip's lawyers added: ""It is further denied that any of Sir Philip's conduct towards employees amounted to any type of crime, or anything that would amount to gross misconduct, or a serious risk to health and safety."" The billionaire had previously used an injunction to stop the paper from publishing the allegations six months ago. But the paper continued fighting a legal battle against the billionaire, and on Friday his action against the paper was formally ended by a High Court judge. Sir Philip Green drops Telegraph injunction What are non-disclosure agreements? In the meantime, last October, Sir Philip's identity became widely known when Lord Hain used the protection of parliamentary privilege to name the businessman in the House of Lords, saying he was ""standing up for human rights"". This video can not be played Lord Hain said the details were ""clearly in the public interest"" Shortly after he was identified,Sir Philip repeated his denial of any wrongdoing,external, telling the Mail on Sunday: ""There has obviously from time to time been some banter, but as far as I'm concerned that's never been offensive."" He said on Friday that his legal action was now ""pointless"" but made the point that the Telegraph had pursued a ""vendetta"" against him. A female employee received more than Â£1m after Sir Philip groped her, kissed her, called her a ""naughty girl"" and made comments about her weight A black male employee received Â£1m after Sir Philip mocked his dreadlocks and suggested he was ""throwing spears in the jungle"" A female employee received hundreds of thousands of pounds after Sir Philip sexually harassed her and grabbed her face A female employee received hundreds of thousands of pounds after Sir Philip put her in a headlock and groped her waist A male employee left his role with one month's pay shortly after Sir Philip smashed his mobile phone The paper said that all five staff had accepted the money in return for signing non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), preventing them from talking about their experiences. The Telegraph's report included testimony from other members of staff that it says witnessed the events. Sir Philip told the paper he ""categorically denies any unlawfulâ¦ sexual behaviour"". He also denied any ""unlawfulâ¦ racist behaviour"". Sometimes known as ""gagging orders"" or ""hush agreements"", they typically prevent staff and ex-staff making information public. Sir Philip had argued that the five former staff would be breaking the law if they breached NDAs they had signed in return for money. His statement said the Telegraph had ""knowingly and shamefully coaxed these [five] individuals to breach their obligations under these lawful agreements"". But the paper's editor, Chris Evans, said the Sir Philip case raised wider questions about the use of NDAs. ""In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein affair, we became aware that gagging orders called NDAs were being used to cover up allegations of sexual misconduct and racial abuse in the workplace. And that led to our investigation into Sir Philip Green and Arcadia. ""We maintain there is a clear public interest in telling people whether a prospective employer has been accused of sexual misconduct and racial abuse."" Sir Philip used to be known as the king of the High Street. Known for his lavish lifestyle, Sir Philip has regularly been pictured at star-studded events surrounded by glamorous women. He built a fortune from a retail empire that included Topshop, BHS, Burton and Miss Selfridge. Sir Philip sits alongside (l-r) Jourdan Dunn, his daughter Chloe Green, Ciara, Anna Wintour, Suki Waterhouse, Cressida Bonas, Alexa Chung, Bella Thorne, at a Topshop fashion show He sold BHS in March 2015 for Â£1, but it went into administration a year later, leaving a Â£571m hole in its pension fund. He later agreed a Â£363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap. In a report into the collapse of BHS, MPs called the episode ""the unacceptable face of capitalism"". He and his wife Christina, also known as Tina, are estimated by Forbes to be worth Â£3.8bn. Sir Philip Green drops Telegraph injunction What are non-disclosure agreements?

"Theresa May arrived at Farmleigh House in Dublin on Friday evening The prime minister has met Leo Varadkar in Dublin for talks focused on Brexit and the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Theresa May has now returned to the UK after having dinner with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister). The talks in Farmleigh House lasted about two hours. The meeting took place after Mr Varadkar met Northern Ireland's main political parties in Belfast on Friday. Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Can technology solve Irish border problem? Labour: MPs will back our Brexit plan Mrs May was accompanied in Dublin by the UK's Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and her chief of staff Gavin Barwell. The Irish government said the two leaders discussed ""the latest Brexit developments"" as well as the ""ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland"". The meeting comes after the EU said it will hold more talks with the UK to help the prime minister get a Brexit deal through the Commons. Earlier, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox met his Irish counterpart after travelling to Dublin for talks. Speaking in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said it was ""not a day for negotiations"" but it was an opportunity to ""share perspectives"". He added that he was looking to restore confidence and trust with the prime minister during their meeting on Friday night. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter A Friday night in Dublin for Theresa May as she continues trying to find a way through for her Brexit deal. The prime minister came face-to-face with her Irish counterpart over a fillet of beef with dauphinoise potatoes and green beans. It's been a diplomatic whirlwind of a week as Mr Varadkar and Mrs May have bounced from Belfast to Brussels, both seeking backing for their respective positions. Allow Twitter content?

It seems certain that the House of Commons will not pass any Brexit deal that includes the current backstop. But the Irish government again today insisted it has to stay, with Mr Varadkar adding that he and the EU speak with one voice on this. On Monday, UK-EU talks begin (again) in Brussels - but there's no sign of a compromise coming down the tracks. Severalcabinet ministers have told the BBC a no-deal Brexit could lead to a voteon Irish unification. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster poured cold water on the prospect, saying that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement sets out ""criteria for a border poll, and it hasn't been met - therefore it will not be called"". On Thursday, Mrs May met EU leaders in Brussels in a bid to secure changes to the Irish border backstop in the Brexit agreement. European Commission President Jean-Claude Junckerruled out legally-binding changes to the backstop clausein the 585-page withdrawal document. But he said the EU would be open to adding words to the non-binding future relations document that goes with the withdrawal agreement. Other officials, including European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, have said the backstop is ""non-negotiable"". Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, Mr Varadkarheld meetings with top EU officialsabout the backstop and Ireland's plans for a no-deal outcome. He said that while he was ""open to further discussions"" with the UK government about post-Brexit relations, the legally-binding withdrawal agreement remained ""the best deal possible"". Speaking in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said ""time is running out"" to agree a deal, but that work needed to continue in order to ensure agreement was reached. ""When it comes to Brexit this is a negotiation that has the UK on one side and EU on the other,"" he said. ""Any negotiation can only happen with Ireland and the EU working together."" It is the insurance policy to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. The UK and EU made a commitment to avoid physical barriers or checks on the border, if no UK-EU trade deal is agreed before the Brexit transition period ends. Many people are concerned that the return of such checks would put the peace process at risk. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But there has been opposition to the backstop from the DUP and Brexiteer MPs, who believe its terms could keep the UK tied to EU rules in the long term. Last month, MPs backed an amendment in Parliament calling for ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the backstop. A group of Conservative MPshas held talks aimed at finding other Brexit optionsthat would avoid a hard border. The taoiseach travelled to Belfast to discuss the ""ongoing political impasse"", the Irish government said. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for more than two years. Mr Varadkar, whose trip came days afterTheresa May met the parties at Stormont to discuss her bid to make changes to the withdrawal agreement, said he travelled north to ""hear the perspective of the main parties"". DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party had a ""wide-ranging"" discussion with the taoiseach. Mrs Foster also said some people were engaging in ""project fear"" with the Brexit negotiations. DUP leader Arlene Foster (centre) speaking after meeting Leo Varadkar in Belfast The party's deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, said the backstop ""is the problem"", but would not specify which possible alternative his party is supporting. Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said her party would ""hold the taoiseach's feet to the fire"" when it comes to defending the backstop. She said he had given her an assurance he would remain firm with his stance. The party also said they have been calling repeatedly for a border poll, and that they had urged Mr Varadkar to begin planning for one. The Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) Brexit spokesperson Steve Aiken said there needed to be ""level-headed conversations"" and that the UUP had told the taoiseach how concerned they are by the terms of the Irish border backstop. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he had been watching recent events in Westminster ""with dismay"" The UUP said it is working on a number of alternative proposals it wants the UK and EU to consider. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said they had a very constructive and wide-ranging discussion with Mr Varadkar. ""It's fairly clear those this week suggesting there is some chance of the UK and Irish government doing a side deal without the EU are chasing after a no-way scenario,"" she said. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that it had been a ""good meeting"" and added that he and the taoiseach are ""on the same side of this argument"". ""We have been watching with some dismay what has been going on in Westminster over the last couple of months,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody within the Irish government or the European Commission sees any opportunity for diluting the protection of citizens in Northern Ireland."" Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker said their meeting was ""robust but constructive"" Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier will hold talks in Strasbourg on Monday, as the EU and UK Brexit negotiating teams discuss proposed changes to the deal. British sources say the talks will include discussion of the legally-binding withdrawal agreement, the BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said. An EU source said the further talks are an opportunity to listen to the UK's ideas. Please upgrade your browser Mrs May and Mr Juncker will meet again before the end of February, to review progress. The prime minister is expected to put the deal to a vote in the Commons towards the end of February. She said the plan must change if it is to win the support of MPs who urged her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop when rejecting the deal last month.

"The FaceTime problem emerged when teenagers were planning Fortnite strategies A US teenager who discovered a security flaw in Apple's FaceTime video-calling system has been given a bug bounty. Apple has not revealed the exact amount it is giving 14-year-old Grant Thompson but it is believed to include money tohelp pay for his education.,external The teenager found a bug that meant he could briefly eavesdrop on recipients to a group FaceTime call. The reward comes as one security researcher refused to tell Apple about a bug because no bounty was on offer. Information aboutthe bug first emerged,externalin late January and revealed that some Apple users could secretly listen to people they called via FaceTime even if the recipient did not accept the call. Apple deemed it so serious that it disabled the group FaceTime feature while it investigated and produced a fix. News reports about the problem initially said it was just being discussed on social media and did not credit any individual with its discovery. Later, it emerged that Apple had been warned about it earlier in January by Grant and his mother. The teenager uncovered the problem when using FaceTime to talk about strategies for the Fortnite game with friends. Mrs Thompson sent several emails and other messages to Apple warning about the vulnerability but initially got no response. Now, Apple has credited Grant, who's from Catalina, in Arizona, with finding the flaw. News about his reward came on the day that Apple issued a software update that fixed the bug. Apple's bug bounty policy has led one security researcher to withhold details on a password-stealing vulnerability in the MacOS operating system.

"This video can not be played CCTV of the group during the shopping trip in Sutton was shown in court A mother accused of not helping her three-year-old son as he was crushed by her boyfriend's car seat has told a court she had let down her son. Alfie Lamb was found unresponsive and later died following a car journey in south London on 1 February last year. The boy's mother Adrian Hoare, 23, told the Old Bailey she would have moved Alfie ""if I thought there was a serious problem"". She and her partner Stephen Waterson, 25, both deny manslaughter. Mr Waterson is accused of pushing the front passenger seat of his Audi into Alfie twice during the journey from Sutton to Croydon. Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare both deny manslaughter In court, prosecutors accused Ms Hoare of putting her boyfriend first before her son as their relationship was ""too important"". Jurors were shown CCTV of the three-year-old apparently having to run to keep up with her and Mr Waterson as they walked along an alleyway and into Asda. Referring to the footage, Duncan Atkinson QC asked Ms Hoare why her son was having to run and ""what allowances were you making for Alfie's little legs?"". The defendant denied she put what her partner wanted first, saying that it was ""just the way I walk"" and ""Alfie always runs."" Alfie Lamb had been in the rear footwell of the Audi with another child during the trip When asked why she had not taken her son out of the footwell and comforted him when he was ""crying"", ""screaming"", and ""coughing"", Ms Hoare said she could have ""but Stephen said we was all going together."" Mr Atkinson later asked whether ""looking back on it now, do you feel you let Alfie down?"", to which Ms Hoare replied: ""Yes."" Earlier, Mr Waterson's lawyer suggested the car seat had nothing to do with the toddler's injuries and Miss Hoare must have ""done something"". This was denied by the 23-year-old. Mr Waterson has told the court he only moved his seat back an inch, before moving forwards again Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was also in the car. Mr Waterson denies manslaughter and the intimidation of the car's driver Marcus Lamb. The couple and 19-year-old Ms Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making false statements to police. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Michael Rice's version of Bigger Than Us Michael Rice, who won BBC talent show All Together Now last year, has been chosen to fly the flag for the UK at this year's Eurovision Song Contest. The 21-year-old from Hartlepool, who was also on The X Factor in 2014, was picked in a TV viewers' vote on Friday. He will now travel to Israel in May in the hope of impressing Eurovision fans with his rousing anthem Bigger Than Us. The UK has struggled in recent years - it has not won for 22 years and has not finished in the top 10 for a decade. Rice won the Â£50,000 prize on All Together Now in March 2018, and used the money to take his family to Disneyland and to set up a shop selling ice cream and waffles. Below, he reveals that he went to Europe for the first time two weeks ago (and broke his toe while away), says his Eurovision song is dedicated to his late father - and insists he has a chance of winning. Are you in it to win it? Yeah, definitely. I believe in this song 100%. It might just be a ballad but that song's got a big message and I can't wait to perform it and show the rest of the world what this song's all about. You weren't born the last time the UK won Eurovision, so all you've ever known is British failure. How do you get such positivity? I think you have to be positive when it comes to stuff like this. Some people do take the mickey out of it and these other countries really do take it seriously. We might have lost loads of times, but I think, why couldn't it change? Why can't we make this different? We've got the best music industry - Adele, Sam Smith, The Beatles - why can't we send someone and hope for the best? What do the song's lyrics mean to you? I grew up with my mam, and my dad had drug problems and stuff like that, and later on I got to know him. He used to know I was singing and he was dead proud of me. When I'm singing them words at the beginning - ""Hear these words that I sing to you"" - it just reminds me of him. He's passed away, and winning All Together Now, and if he could see this today, it would make his world. Have you been to Europe much? Not really - two weeks ago was my first holiday with my friends and we went to Tenerife. It was the best time. I broke my toe as well. I fell in the pool. You couldn't write my life. Did you do karaoke in Tenerife? Yes I did, in the resort. I love Tina Turner, a bit of Whitney, just fling it at me and I'll give it a crack. You used to be a busker. Do you still busk? Yeah, on a weekend sometimes I'll just pop down to York or to Newcastle and go busking. Sometimes it's really nice because people recognise you and say, ""I remember you from that show"" or, ""Do you want to play at my wedding?"" I really love it. Is it a good earner? Yeah, sometimes you can make Â£250, maybe Â£300 for half a day or a day. At York Races, when they do the big races and everyone's dressed up and drunk, they just fling tenners in. What are your ambitions for your longer-term career? I finished my EP just before Christmas so hopefully now I'm doing Eurovision I can experience all this and then hopefully release an album and stuff like that, and see where it takes me because I'm still only young. There might be an odd atmosphere this year because of Brexit - do you think that will play a part? I'm not really into politics and stuff because I just don't have a clue about it. It's a singing competition and I'm just thinking, work hard and get the best result and hopefully turn a few heads and see if we can get a better score. There have been protestsabout the fact Eurovision's being held in Israel, with some saying it should be moved because of the treatment of the Palestinians - what's your response to that? I've seen a lot of things on social media, but it's not really my place to say. I don't know a lot about what's going on over there, and music unites everyone so hopefully we can do something positive. You also fronted an anti-bullying campaign - tell us about that. When I was growing up at secondary school I used to get bullied a lot - in Year 7 and Year 8. When I left school, I did The X Factor and I got loads of hate from that, and it really sparked me on to go to schools and tell people my story and inspire them. Rice will be hoping to improve on last year's UK performance, when singer SuRie finished 24th out of 26. Her performance wasinterrupted by a stage invader, who grabbed her microphone and shouted slogans about the media. The contest was eventuallywon by Israeli singer Nettawith her quirky song Toy, which encouraged people to celebrate their differences. The winning country hosts the following year's competition, and the 2019 event will take place in Tel Aviv on 18 May.

"Princess Ubolratana Mahidol pictured in 2010 Thailand's King Vajiralongkorn has denounced as ""inappropriate"" his sister's unprecedented bid to run for prime minister in March's election. In a palace statement, he said such an act would ""defy the nation's culture"". Princess Ubolratana Mahidol, 67, has been nominated as a candidate for a party allied to divisive former PM Thaksin Shinawatra. Such a move would break with the tradition of the Thai royal family publicly staying out of politics. Analysts say the king's intervention is likely to lead to the election commission disqualifying her from the 24 March election. The vote is being closely watched as the first chance for Thailand to return to democracy after five years under military rule. Thailand army's pivotal role in politics Why Thais backed a military-backed constitution In a palace statement broadcast on all Thai TV networks, the king said: ""Even though she has relinquished her royal titles in writing, she maintained her status and carried herself as a member of the Chakri dynasty. King Vajiralongkorn says the princess retains her status as a member of the royal family ""Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in whatever way, is considered an act that defies the nation's traditions, customs and culture, and therefore is considered extremely inappropriate."" The statement cited a passage of the constitution that says the monarchy should maintain political neutrality. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Hours earlier, Princess Ubolratana defended her decision to run for office. In an Instagram post, she reiterated that she had relinquished all her royal titles and now lived as a commoner. She said she wanted to exercise her rights as an ordinary citizen by offering her candidacy for prime minister. She said she would work with all sincerity and determination for the prosperity of all Thais. Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News Bangkok The entry of flamboyant Princess Ubolratana's into the political fray threatened to upend an election in which the military government has stacked the odds in its own favour through a new constitution and electoral system. Now King Vajiralongkorn has issued an unusually strong statement censuring the nomination of his sister. The decision to nominate the princess now looks like a grave miscalculation. It will weaken the pro-Shinawatra faction seeking to push the military out of politics, which until now seemed likely to win the largest share of seats in the new parliament. It also underlines the power and influence of the new king, whose word on matters of state that he believes concern him is always final. Born in 1951, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi is the oldest child of Thailand's beloved late King Bhumibol Adulyadej.He died in 2016. How King Bhumibol shaped modern Thailand She attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and after marrying an American in 1972 she gave up her royal title. After her divorce she returned to Thailand in 2001 and once again started participating in royal life. The princess engages actively in social media and has also starred in several Thai movies. She has three children, one of whom died in the 2004 Asian tsunami. The other two now also live in Thailand. The princess has registered for the Thai Raksa Chart party, which is closely linked to Mr Thaksin. It will be the first vote since current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in 2014, overthrowing the democratic government and ousting ex-PM Yingluck Shinawatra, the younger sister of Mr Thaksin. Who is Prayuth Chan-ocha? Both Mr Thaksin and his sister live in self-imposed exile but remain a powerful force in Thai politics, with many in the country remaining loyal to them. Prayuth Chan-ocha is running as a candidate for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party In 2016, Thais voted to approve a new constitution created by the country's military leaders, which was designed to perpetuate military influence and block Mr Thaksin's allies from winning another election. But the princess aligning herself with a party allied with Mr Thaksin threatens those plans, correspondents say. Thailand's lese-majeste law explained Who is Thaksin Shinawatra? A former general, Mr Prayuth also announced on Friday that he would be running for prime minister in the forthcoming election as a candidate for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party. Thailand has some of the world's toughest royal defamation ""lese-majeste"" laws but technically the princess is not covered by them. However, the royal family is revered in Thailand and rarely criticised, so there are questions around whether any other candidate would want to challenge a member of the royal family.

"Asim (pictured), whose name means ""protector"" in Arabic, had been matched with Melati through the European Endangered Species Programme An endangered Sumatran tiger has been killed by another tiger at London Zoo. Male tiger Asim was brought to the zoo from a Danish safari park 10 days ago in the hope he would be the ""perfect mate"" for long-term resident Melati. After spending time apart in the tiger enclosure to get used to the new arrangement, the two were then introduced to each other earlier. But tensions ""quickly escalated"", things became ""more aggressive"" and Melati died in a fight, the zoo said. A statement issued by the zoo said Asim was immediately moved to a separate paddock but despite the best efforts of the vets, 10-year-old Melati died. It said: ""Our focus right now is on caring for Asim, as we get through this difficult event."" Staff are ""heartbroken by this turn of events"", the zoo said. Melati had seven cubs with previous partner Jae Jae before he was moved to France last month Seven-year-old Asim was moved to London Zoo as part of the European-wide conservation breeding programme. Heralding his arrival, the zoo described him as ""ahandsome, confident cat,externalwho is known for being very affectionate with the ladies in his life"", adding that ""we're hoping he'll be the perfect mate for our beautiful Melati"". The zoo's previous male, Jae Jae - which had fathered seven cubs previously with Melati - was moved to French zoo Le Parc des FÃ©lins, on 30 January. In 2013, Melati gave birth to two cubs but onefell into a pool and drowned. Melati then gave birth to three cubs in February 2014 and two more in June 2016. This video can not be played The cubs were born at the start of February The Sumatran tiger, which naturally lives in the forests and jungles of Sumatra, Indonesia, is now classified as critically endangered and is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list of threatened animals. Fine quashed in 'too many signs' confusion Council land that cost Â£1m to go for Â£1 Police dog watches MPs pass new law According to London Zoo, the Sumatran tiger faces threats of poaching and habitat loss. When in captivity, they can live for about 20 years. In the 1970s, there were estimated to be 1,000 Sumatran tigers in the wild, while today's figures say there are just 300. Sumatran tigers are the smallest of the five tiger subspecies and have the narrowest black stripes The roar of a tiger can be so loud that it can be heard from two miles away (3.2km) A tiger can bite down with the force of 1,000 pounds per square inch From sitting down, a tiger is able to leap forward 33ft (10m) Fossils found in China show tigers could have been alive two million years ago Source: ZSL London Zoo Meet London Zoo's newest arrivals.

"Andrew Wallace was previously convicted of killing a woman when he was 15 A convicted killer has been jailed for at least 28 years for murdering a woman in Glasgow and dismembering her body. Andrew Wallace was given a mandatory life sentence for killing Julie Reilly, 47, in her Govan flat in February last year. Wallace, 42, cut off her legs with a knife and put the remains in plastic bags and suitcases, before burying them near Ms Reilly's home. Judge Lady Rae told him he was guilty of an ""evil and despicable act"". Ms Reilly was reported missing in February 2018 The judge told Wallace: ""You are a dangerous man who has a considerable propensity for violence."" She passed a life sentence with a minimum of 28 years before he can apply for parole. The judge said she would have set the minimum term at 30 years if it had not been for his guilty plea. It is the second time Wallace has killed a woman. He was just 15 when he was found guilty of culpable homicide in 1992. Part of Ms Reilly's body was found in a garden in Ardshiel Road Wallace was arrested for Ms Reilly's murder after the discovery of two leg bones close to her home. No other body parts have been found and her sister, Lynne Bryce, has appealed to Wallace to reveal the location of her remains. ""I hope that if he has a heart he could now please tell us where he has put my sister and let her come home to be put to rest properly, with the dignity she deserves,"" Ms Bryce said. Ms Reilly's sister and other members of her family were in court to hear the details of the murder as Wallace was sentenced. Parts of Julie's body were found buried in a nearby garden The High Court in Glasgow was told that Ms Reilly had a brain injury which caused problems with her memory, slowed her reactions and affected her speech. She was befriended by Wallace, and had allowed him to stay with her at her home in Shieldhall Road after he had split up with his girlfriend in December 2017. She thought he would help to care for her, but the court heard that he saw her as being ""easy to manipulate and rip off"". After she went missing, a forensic team examined a piece of land close to where Ms Reilly lived The last recorded sighting of Ms Reilly was on 6 February last year. The following day Wallace told a friend he needed ""to get rid of a body"". He also sent texts claiming that Ms Reilly had moved to the Penilee area of Glasgow. In the following days he was seen at the homes of two friends with heavy suitcases. He told one friend he had hit a deer while out driving and wanted to sell the meat. Human remains were found close to Ms Reilly's home He told another friend he had been thrown out by Ms Reilly and the suitcase contained his dirty washing. Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the court that the cases actually contained human remains. Ms Reilly was reported missing by worried relatives on 15 February last year after failing to turn up to several appointments. She also missed her grandson's first birthday. Her mother Margaret Hanlon and sister Ms Bryce madean emotional appeal for her return. Police found traces of blood in Julies flat When police examined Mr Reilly's flat as part of the missing person's investigation, they found traces of blood in the hall, kitchen, bedrooms and living room. On 19 April a member of the public found a bone with flesh attached in his front garden in Ardshiel Road. Days later another person contacted the police about an apparent burial site at Drumoyne Drive. Mr Goddard added: ""The precise circumstances of the murder are not known. To-date neither the suitcases seen in possession of the accused, nor the rest of the body of Julie Reilly, has been recovered."" Wallace's defence lawyer Ian Duguid told the court the killing had come after an argument. ""Julie Reilly had taken a knife and presented it at him,"" he said. ""He took that from her and stabbed her in the chest. This is his explanation as to how she met her death. ""A shocking crime exacerbated by what followed it. Going to such lengths was either desperation or a reflection on his thought process.""

"The MP who infuriated campaigners by objecting to a ban on upskirting has been heavily criticised after blocking another private members' bill. Sir Christopher Chope shouted ""object"" in a debate on laws protecting children from female genital mutilation. His Conservative colleague, Zac Goldsmith, said his actions were ""appalling"" - Lib Dem Tom Brake said the MP had ""reached a new low"". Sir Christopher has argued his aim is to stop badly thought-out legislation. He said he had not been objecting to the substance of the issue, but wanted to see all legislation properly debated. Christopher Chope defends blocking upskirting bill FGM: What is it? FGM 'increasingly performed on UK babies' Friday's Commons debate, brought by crossbench peer Lord Berkley of Knighton, would have allowed the courts to make interim care orders under the Children Act, in cases where children are believed to be at risk of FGM. The bill had already cleared the House of Lords. But Parliamentary rules mean it only requires one MP to shout ""object"" to a private member's bill which is listed for a second reading but not debated to block its progress. Mr Chope has a track record of objecting to them, arguing that he does it on a point of principle, because he does not agree with legislation being brought before Parliament on a Friday without enough time for a full debate. Last year he sparked fury when heobjected to another billto make ""upskirting"" a criminal offence in England and Wales - that became law last month, after the bill got government backing. But his fellow Conservative Mr Goldsmith, who co-sponsored the bill,tweeted,external""please note that once again he did not object to those put forward by his friends"". Among others criticising his actions on Twitter, were the Labour MP David Lammy, who suggested Mr Chope ""embodies a brand of thoughtless, regressive conservatism which can ruin lives"" while anti-FGM campaigner Nimco Ali said she had ""nothing but disgust"" for Mr Chope. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said on Twitter he was ""very disappointed"" that the bill had been blocked adding: ""FGM is child abuse. I am determined to stamp out this despicable and medieval practice. We will do all we can to protect girls at risk."" The BBC's Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said, with a lot of private members' bills in the queue for consideration in Parliament, this one was unlikely to become law unless the government got behind it or decided to attach it to another piece of legislation.

"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has made a bid for cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, which collapsed into administration last month. A Sports Direct statement late on Friday confirmed an offer had been made, but gave no further details. Administrator KPMG closed 70 Patisserie Valerie outlets, but kept 121 open in the hope of finding a buyer. Mr Ashley, who owns House of Fraser and has a big stake in Debenhams, missed out this week on a bid for HMV. The cafe chain employed about 3,000 staff, but some 900 jobs were lost in the initial wave of closures after KPMG was appointed to run the business on 22 January. Last October, Patisserie Valerie, where entrepreneur Luke Johnson is the biggest shareholder, uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". The company said in a statement,externallast month that it did not have enough money to meet its debts. Rescue talks with banks HSBC and Barclays to restructure the business broke down, leaving no option but administration. Mike Ashley: The saviour of the High Street? What is Ashley's plan for the High Street? Scandal worse than thought Cafe chain's auditor faces probe In addition to Patisserie Valerie, the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Finance director Chris Marshwas arrested after having been suspendedby the company when the financial irregularities were uncovered. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton. Mr Ashley, who also owns English Premier League football club Newcastle United, made his name building budget chain Sports Direct into Britain's biggest sporting goods retailer. At a time when retailers are struggling, he is frequently linked as a potential buyer of any that get into financial trouble. He bought House of Fraser last year, and also acquired Evans Cycles and Agent Provocateur. Sports Direct has shareholdings in French Connection and Game Digital, and last week emerged as front runner to buy Sofa.com. Earlier this week, Canada's Sunrise Records beat Mr Ashley in a battle to by the music retailer HMV. Mr Ashley is thought to be facing several competing bids for Patisserie Valerie, including, according to reports, from Costa, the coffee chain bought by Coca-Cola last year. Billionaire Mr Ashley has shown faith in the High Street at a time when many bricks-and-mortar stores are struggling due to a combination of rising rents and increasing online competition. He says that to support the High Street,there should be a tax on firms which generate 20% of revenues from the internet. Despite acquiring several struggling retailers, analysts say that Mr Ashley is more of a opportunist than a strategist. Richard Hyman, a adviser to a number of retailers, recently told the BBC: ""Is [Mr Ashley] following a strategic plan? I don't think he is. Is he positively opportunistic? Yes. Has got the resources to take advantage of opportunities that come his way? Yes."" And, Mr Hyman adds: ""Has he got courage? Yes"". The first cafe was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926 In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores.

"This video can not be played The experiment saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Giving jobless people in Finland a basic income for two years did not lead them to find work, researchers said. From January 2017 until December 2018, 2,000 unemployed Finns got a monthly flat payment of â¬560 (Â£490; $634). The aim was to see if a guaranteed safety net would help people find jobs, and support them if they had to take insecure gig economy work. While employment levels did not improve, participants said they felt happier and less stressed. When it launched the pilot scheme back in 2017, Finland became the first European country to test out the idea of an unconditional basic income. It was run by the Social Insurance Institution (Kela), a Finnish government agency, and involved 2,000 randomly-selected people on unemployment benefits. It immediately attracted international interest - but these results have now raised questions about the effectiveness of such schemes. Universal basic income, or UBI, means that everyone gets a set monthly income, regardless of means. The Finnish trial was a bit different, as it focused on people who were unemployed. Another popular variation is 'universal basic services' - where instead of getting an income, things like education, healthcare and transport are free for all. Although it's enjoying a resurgence in popularity, the idea isn't new. In fact, it was first described in Sir Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516 - a full 503 years ago. Such schemes are being trialled all over the world. Adults in a village in western Kenya are being given $22 a month for 12 years, until 2028, while the Italian government is working on introducing a ""citizens' income"". The city of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, is also carrying out a basic income study called Weten Wat Werkt - ""Know What Works"" - until October. Some 2,000 unemployed people in Finland were randomly selected Supporters of basic income often believe an unconditional safety net can help people out of poverty, by giving them the time to apply for jobs or learn essential new skills. This is seen as increasingly important in the age of automation - that is, put very simply, as robots take people's jobs. Miska Simanainen, one of the Kela researchers behind the Finnish study, tells BBC News that this was what their government had wanted to test, in order ""to see if it would be a way of reforming the social security system"". That depends what you mean by 'work'. Did it help unemployed people in Finland find jobs, as the centre-right Finnish government had hoped? No, not really. Mr Simanainen says that while some individuals found work, they were no more likely to do so than a control group of people who weren't given the money. They are still trying to work out exactly why this is, for the final report that will be published in 2020. Will Finland's basic income trial help the jobless? No expansion of Finland basic income trial But for many people, the original goal of getting people into work was flawed to begin with. If instead the aim were to make people generally happier, the scheme would have been considered a triumph. One participant, former newspaper editor Tuomas, pretty much summed this up when he told BBC News about how the basic income had affected him. ""I am still without a job,"" he explained. ""I can't say that the basic income has changed a lot in my life. OK, psychologically yes, but financially - not so much."" UBI is one of those rare issues that attracts equally strong support - and criticism - from all parts of the political spectrum. For a lot of people on the left, UBI focuses too heavily on individuals' personal wealth and buying power - or rather, their lack of it - without doing anything to stop companies wasting resources by producing far more stuff than people need, and over-working their employees in the process. Economics writer Grace Blakely makes this point in the New Socialist, adding that ""without fundamental structural reforms to our economic system, UBI will only be a sticking plaster papering over the cracks"". Others worry that basic income will be used to cut costs, by setting the rate too low and slashing other, means-tested benefits. Meanwhile, many on the political right and centre worry about the exact opposite - that UBI would be too expensive to implement, and would encourage a ""something for nothing"" culture. Ulrich Spiesshofer, chief executive of ABB engineering company, echoed this sentiment in 2016 when he told the Financial Times that ""economic rewards [for people] should be based on actually creating economic value"". Researchers from Kela are now busy analysing all of their results, to figure out what else - if anything - they can tell us about basic income's uses and shortcomings. Mr Simanainen says that he doesn't like to think of the trial as having ""failed"". From his point of view, ""this is not a failure or success - it is a fact, and [gives us] new information that we did not have before this experiment"". Did Finland's free money experiment work?

"Asim (pictured), whose name means ""protector"" in Arabic, had been matched with Melati through the European Endangered Species Programme An endangered Sumatran tiger has been killed by another tiger at London Zoo. Male tiger Asim was brought to the zoo from a Danish safari park 10 days ago in the hope he would be the ""perfect mate"" for long-term resident Melati. After spending time apart in the tiger enclosure to get used to the new arrangement, the two were then introduced to each other earlier. But tensions ""quickly escalated"", things became ""more aggressive"" and Melati died in a fight, the zoo said. A statement issued by the zoo said Asim was immediately moved to a separate paddock but despite the best efforts of the vets, 10-year-old Melati died. It said: ""Our focus right now is on caring for Asim, as we get through this difficult event."" Staff are ""heartbroken by this turn of events"", the zoo said. Melati had seven cubs with previous partner Jae Jae before he was moved to France last month Seven-year-old Asim was moved to London Zoo as part of the European-wide conservation breeding programme. Heralding his arrival, the zoo described him as ""ahandsome, confident cat,externalwho is known for being very affectionate with the ladies in his life"", adding that ""we're hoping he'll be the perfect mate for our beautiful Melati"". The zoo's previous male, Jae Jae - which had fathered seven cubs previously with Melati - was moved to French zoo Le Parc des FÃ©lins, on 30 January. In 2013, Melati gave birth to two cubs but onefell into a pool and drowned. Melati then gave birth to three cubs in February 2014 and two more in June 2016. This video can not be played The cubs were born at the start of February The Sumatran tiger, which naturally lives in the forests and jungles of Sumatra, Indonesia, is now classified as critically endangered and is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list of threatened animals. Fine quashed in 'too many signs' confusion Council land that cost Â£1m to go for Â£1 Police dog watches MPs pass new law According to London Zoo, the Sumatran tiger faces threats of poaching and habitat loss. When in captivity, they can live for about 20 years. In the 1970s, there were estimated to be 1,000 Sumatran tigers in the wild, while today's figures say there are just 300. Sumatran tigers are the smallest of the five tiger subspecies and have the narrowest black stripes The roar of a tiger can be so loud that it can be heard from two miles away (3.2km) A tiger can bite down with the force of 1,000 pounds per square inch From sitting down, a tiger is able to leap forward 33ft (10m) Fossils found in China show tigers could have been alive two million years ago Source: ZSL London Zoo Meet London Zoo's newest arrivals.

"Sir Philip Green's legal action against the Daily Telegraph has been formally ended by a High Court judge. The Topshop boss had gagged the paper from publishing misconduct allegations, including sexual and racial abuse and bullying, against five employees. He said the action was now ""pointless"" after he was named in Parliament as the businessman behind the injunction. Sir Philip said he was pleased with the judgement, and said the Daily Telegraph had pursued a ""vendetta"" against him. Sir Philip denies allegations he behaved wrongly. The five employees who made allegations about Sir Philip had all received substantial payments after settling their claims in return for saying no more about them - under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). The paper's editor, Chris Evans, said he was delighted the injunction had been lifted. The Telegraph now intends to publish the details of the allegations against Sir Philip and the ""inside story"" of the High Court action on its website at 21:00 GMT on Friday and in Saturday's newspaper. The newspaper has also published an audio recording of Sir Philip in which he threatened to ""bankrupt"" the Telegraph if it printed the allegations. ""I will personally sue your editor for damages that will be long beyond what he'll be able to earn if he lives to 1,000 years old,"" he said on the call. Sir Philip has been left with a reported Â£3m legal bill and has been ordered to pay the ""bulk"" of the Telegraph's legal costs. Sometimes known as ""gagging orders"" or ""hush agreements"", they typically prevent staff and ex-staff making information public. Sir Philip had argued that the five former staff would be breaking the law if they breached NDAs they had signed in return for money. Sir Philip's statement said the Telegraph had ""knowingly and shamefully coaxed these [five] individuals to breach their obligations under these lawful agreements"". What are non-disclosure agreements? Sir Philip Green: From 'king of the High Street' to 'unacceptable face of capitalism' But Mr Evans said the Sir Philip case raised wider questions about the use of NDAs. ""In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein affair, we became aware that gagging orders called NDAs were being used to cover up allegations of sexual misconduct and racial abuse in the workplace. And that led to our investigation into Sir Philip Green and Arcadia. ""We maintain there is a clear public interest in telling people whether a prospective employer has been accused of sexual misconduct and racial abuse."" The chairwoman of the Parliamentary Women and Equality Select Committee, Maria Miller, said the Philip Green case  ""shows how broken the current system is"". ""NDAs are protecting the powerful and silencing victims. Employers and lawyers need to hear a strong message from government that this has to change."" Last August, the Daily Telegraph planned to run a story of allegations of misconduct made against Sir Philip by five employees. Sir Philip approached the court to stop it naming him. Initially, the court refused, but Sir Philip appealed and it did grant an injunction, saying there was a ""real prospect"" that publication would cause ""substantial and possibly irreversible harm"" to the claimants. It then ran a story saying simply that a ""leading businessman"" was involved in a number of NDAs with former employees. However, Sir Philip was named by Lord Hain in the House of Lords two days after the court's ruling. Sir Philip used to be known as the king of the High Street. He built a fortune from a retail empire that included Topshop, BHS, Burton and Miss Selfridge. He sold BHS in March 2015 for Â£1, but it went into administration a year later, leaving a Â£571m hole in its pension fund. He later agreed a Â£363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap. In a report into the collapse,externalof BHS, MPs called the episode ""the unacceptable face of capitalism"".

"A financial technology company whose ""single-shaming"" advertising campaign drew protests is facing scrutiny from the City watchdog over the issue. Revolut, which offers app-based current accounts,sparked complaints with a ""spoof"" adaddressed to people who ordered a takeaway meal for one on Valentine's Day last year. It admits that the figures in the ad should have been labelled fictitious. The complaints have now been forwarded to the Financial Conduct Authority. Revolut launched in 2015 and bills itself as an alternative to banks. It has apologised for the advert, described by critics as ""intrusive"" and ""tone-deaf"", and said it did not mean to poke fun. After the issue was highlighted on Twitter, several people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about the advert. But the ASA decided that the issue was outside its scope, since it found the advert did not breach its codes. However, it added: ""As the complaint touches on the potential misleading financial services provided by the advertiser, we will be referring the matter to the Financial Conduct Authority, whose remit this would fall under."" The ASA said complainants could rest assured that the FCA would ""take any necessary action"". Financial commentator Iona Bain, who was among the first people to draw attention to the advert and who was among the complainants to the ASA, said she was glad that the matter was being taken seriously. Iona Bain is founder of the Young Money Blog Ms Bain, founder ofthe Young Money Blog,external, told the BBC that there was a recognition that the advert was possibly misleading about the financial services that Revolut provided. She objected to the advert for a number of reasons, including the way that it played on people's concerns about improper use of their data and whether their financial activity was private. She added: ""It's not just the crass and tacky tone of the ad, but also the confusion about what banks do with your data."" Revolut offers a current account service which allows people to make and receive payments, withdraw money from cash machines and transfer money abroad. It was not a bank when it started, but it announced in December that it had been granted an EU banking licence by the European Central Bank. It still aims to acquire a full UK banking licence. It has already attained the status of a tech ""unicorn"" - a term used to describe private start-ups valued at more than $1bn (Â£740m). The BBC has approached Revolut for a comment on the latest developments, but no-one was available to respond.

"Terence Filer's funeral was well attended despite him having no living friends or relatives About 60 strangers turned up to the funeral of a man they had never met after an appeal from the vicar. Terence Filer, 85, died at St Martin's House Care Home in Camborne, Cornwall on 2 January. The funeral directors and Cornwall Council attempted to find people who knew him but with no success. This prompted the vicar to appeal for people to attend his funeral in Redruth. Rev Caspar Bush said it was unusual. ""On the form from the funeral directors it said 'this man had no friends or relatives, and nothing is known of his life',"" he said. ""It just struck me as incredibly sad so thought we ought to try and do something to try and give him a good send off."" A local company donated 75 pasties for the wake After some investigation, it was discovered Mr Filer lived in Newquay for a time and had learning difficulties. It is also thought he hailed from Bristol but had no known next of kin or close friends to mourn his death. The only possessions passed to the funeral director was an ice-cream tub full of more than 50 American style belt buckles. For this reason Rev Bush chose the John Denver's song 'Take Me Home Country Roads' to be part of the service. Guests attended the funeral from across Cornwall Little was known of Terence Filer who left a collection of American-style belt buckles One of the guests who attended, called Ann, said: ""Even if he never married or had children he was still somebody's son, somebody's grandson. ""What if they were looking down thinking nobody even saw his passing."" As well as 60 guests from across Cornwall, a local business also donated 75 pasties so a wake could be held in the church afterwards. Strangers turn up to veteran's funeral.

"Motions of no confidence in Labour MP Luciana Berger have been withdrawn by her local party after a bitter row. The Liverpool Wavertree MP has been a critic of leader Jeremy Corbyn's stances on anti-Semitism and Brexit. Activists had accused the Jewish MPof ""undermining"" Mr Corbyn,externalbut several Labour MPs supported her, calling it a ""disgraceful episode"" and ""bullying"". A source close to the Labour leadership said pulling the confidence vote was the right decision. But Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside Louise Ellman, who is also Jewish, called it ""an absolutely disgraceful episode"" and said it was ""very clear the attacks"" on Ms Berger had been down to anti-Semitism. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell had earlier sparked a backlash from supporters of the MP by suggesting she should have pledged loyalty to Labour and saying she had been linked to an alleged Labour ""breakaway"" party. In a statement after the motions were first put forward, Ms Berger said she would fight anti-Semitism wherever she found it, including in Labour, where it was being ""ignored"". Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson wrote to the party's general secretary Jennie Formby, calling for the Liverpool Wavertree Constituency Labour Party (CLP) to be suspended. He wrote: ""It is clear to me that Luciana Berger is being bullied. This behaviour by her local party is intolerable."" Labour row over MP no confidence vote How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Anti-Semitic hate incidents 'rise by 16%' MP Smith 'considering' quitting Labour An email has now been sent to Liverpool Wavertree Constituency Labour Party members, telling them that the meeting planned for next Sunday has been cancelled. ""This is because the two motions to be discussed have both been withdrawn by the members who proposed them,"" it said. Votes of no confidence carry no official force within the Labour Party, but local activists could hold a ""trigger ballot"", where sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comers, ahead of the next general election. John McDonnell suggested Ms Berger should pledge her loyalty to the Labour Party Ms Berger has been the target of online abuse and had a police escort at last year's Labour Party conference following death threats. Earlier this week, she joined other MPs at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Partycalling for details on the party's efforts to tackle anti-Semitism to be released. Ms Berger reiterated her ""long-held view that Brexit will be a disaster for the people of Liverpool Wavertree and the wider country"", and said that, as a Jewish woman representing a city with a Jewish community, she was ""deeply disturbed by the lack of response from Jeremy Corbyn... to the anti-Semitism that stains our party"", claiming it was being ""wilfully ignored."" Former Labour leader Ed Miliband and prominent backbencher Yvette Cooper were among a number of her colleagues to express their support for Ms Berger after the news of a no-confidence vote broke on Tuesday night.

Ms Ellman, accused Mr McDonnell of thinking he and the party ""would get away with this"", and said Labour had been ""shamed"" into reversing the motions. She told Radio 4's PM programme that it was ""too easy [for Labour] to turn a blind eye"" to anti-Semitism and said dropping the motions was ""not the end of the matter"". ""Anti-Semitism is alive in the party [and] insufficient steps had been taken to [tackle it],"" she added. Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said Mr McDonnell ""should never have allowed his allies to have gone after Luciana like that in the first place"". Liverpool Mayor Labour's Joe Anderton also welcomed the decision to pull the votes.

"Labour's plan for a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit can secure a Commons majority, the shadow chancellor has told the BBC. John McDonnell said it was a ""very traditional British compromise"" to avoid a ""catastrophic"" no-deal Brexit. ""We believe that this is a deal that could fly within Parliament,"" he said. Jeremy Corbyn's letter setting out Labour's demands for supporting a Brexit deal was welcomed by some EU figures and Tory MPs. Downing Street is expected to reply to Mr Corbyn's letter later on Friday. Theresa May to meet Irish PM in Dublin May says she can get Brexit deal through What's behind Corbyn's letter to May? What is Labour's customs union policy? Home Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC Wiltshire it was ""good that Jeremy Corbyn has finally started talking"". But, he added: ""In this letter he's put five demands and I think any person reading that letter would know it's far more about politics than it is about actually trying to work with the prime minister in the national interest"". And Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party - who Theresa May relies upon for votes in Parliament - said Mr Corbyn's plan did not have the support of the Labour Party. He added: ""The way to a majority for a deal in the United Kingdom is with the Conservative Party and the DUP. ""I don't believe Theresa May is going to split her party in order to reach out to Jeremy Corbyn, who is going to find it very difficult to bring his own party along, and he cant be relied upon to deliver the Brexit that the prime minister believes people voted for in the referendum."" In contrast to Mrs May's deal, Labour wants the UK to be a member of a customs union with the EU, with an agreement ""that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals"" and close ties to the single market. Under Mrs May's plan, the UK would leave the customs union, which she says would allow it to strike trade deals around the world. Please upgrade your browser A senior No 10 source said the government was looking at Labour's proposals ""with interest"" but added: ""There are obviously very considerable points of difference that exist between us. ""The PM continues to believe an independent trade policy is one of the key advantages of Brexit."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March when the two-year limit on withdrawal negotiations under the Article 50 process expires. But Mrs May has been unable to get the withdrawal deal she has negotiated with the EU through Parliament - it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs last month. In Brussels on Thursday, she told EU leaders that she could get a ""stable majority in Parliament"" for the deal if they agreed to legally-binding changes to the Irish backstop clause - something they have always ruled out. Talks are continuing with EU officials - but senior figures in Brussels gave a warm reception to Mr Corbyn's alternative proposals. The European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said: ""It's important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority, so that we can conclude these negotiations."" This video can not be played Newsnight: Dutch MEP Sophie in ât Veld says renegotiating Brexit deal is 'dead end' European Council President Donald Tusk also described Mr Corbyn's letter as a ""promising way"" out of the impasse, according to an EU source. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has said he is willing to discuss the proposals with Labour's shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer. Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The prime minister has to accept that the only way she will get something through Parliament is a compromise like this. ""I think if Theresa May said 'I will sign up to Labour's deal' and we went to Parliament, I think we would have a secure Parliamentary majority."" Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin was among those suggesting Mr Corbyn's move could open the way to a cross-party consensus, if Mrs May could not get her deal through: Allow Twitter content?

But Labour's position has upset some of the party's own backbenchers who see it as facilitating a ""Tory Brexit"" that they say will harm their constituents. Some Labour members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum have accused Mr Corbyn of abandoning his commitment at Labour's conference to get behind a public vote if he can't force a general election. Owen Smith, who failed in his bid to topple Mr Corbyn in a 2016 leadership vote, has said he and ""lots of other people"" were considering their future in the party as a result. Owen Smith unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for the leadership in 2016 Asked about Labour opposition to Mr Corbyn's offer, Mr McDonnell said ""not everyone's going to get everything they want"" and MPs would have to compromise in the long-term interests of the country - but denied it had effectively killed off the prospect of Labour backing another referendum. He said people had ""looked over the edge of a no-deal Brexit"" and economic growth was already stalling: ""Therefore now in the national interest we have got to come together and secure a compromise. If we can't do that, well yes, we have to go back to the people."" Other Labour backbenchers have welcomed Mr Corbyn's move. Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who backs the ""Norway Plus"" model of a close economic partnership with the EU,tweeted,external: ""This can break the deadlock.""

"The MP who infuriated campaigners by objecting to a ban on upskirting has been heavily criticised after blocking another private members' bill. Sir Christopher Chope shouted ""object"" in a debate on laws protecting children from female genital mutilation. His Conservative colleague, Zac Goldsmith, said his actions were ""appalling"" - Lib Dem Tom Brake said the MP had ""reached a new low"". Sir Christopher has argued his aim is to stop badly thought-out legislation. He said he had not been objecting to the substance of the issue, but wanted to see all legislation properly debated. Christopher Chope defends blocking upskirting bill FGM: What is it? FGM 'increasingly performed on UK babies' Friday's Commons debate, brought by crossbench peer Lord Berkley of Knighton, would have allowed the courts to make interim care orders under the Children Act, in cases where children are believed to be at risk of FGM. The bill had already cleared the House of Lords. But Parliamentary rules mean it only requires one MP to shout ""object"" to a private member's bill which is listed for a second reading but not debated to block its progress. Mr Chope has a track record of objecting to them, arguing that he does it on a point of principle, because he does not agree with legislation being brought before Parliament on a Friday without enough time for a full debate. Last year he sparked fury when heobjected to another billto make ""upskirting"" a criminal offence in England and Wales - that became law last month, after the bill got government backing. But his fellow Conservative Mr Goldsmith, who co-sponsored the bill,tweeted,external""please note that once again he did not object to those put forward by his friends"". Among others criticising his actions on Twitter, were the Labour MP David Lammy, who suggested Mr Chope ""embodies a brand of thoughtless, regressive conservatism which can ruin lives"" while anti-FGM campaigner Nimco Ali said she had ""nothing but disgust"" for Mr Chope. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said on Twitter he was ""very disappointed"" that the bill had been blocked adding: ""FGM is child abuse. I am determined to stamp out this despicable and medieval practice. We will do all we can to protect girls at risk."" The BBC's Parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said, with a lot of private members' bills in the queue for consideration in Parliament, this one was unlikely to become law unless the government got behind it or decided to attach it to another piece of legislation.

"Philippe Coutinho was sold by Liverpool to Barcelona in a Â£142m deal in January 2018 Liverpool have announced a world record profit of Â£106m. In their yearly financial results, the Reds made an annual pre-tax profit of Â£125m - up from Â£40m - as turnover increased in the 12 months to May 2018 by Â£90m to Â£455m, also a record. Liverpool were boosted financially by a run to the Champions League final last season, which earned an estimated Â£72m. They were also helped by midfielderPhilippe Coutinho's Â£142m transfer to Barcelonain January 2018. Leicester City had held the record for net (post-tax) profit of Â£80m in 2016-17 (Â£92m pre-tax) after reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League in 2017. Having topped the Premier League table for much of the season, Liverpool are vying with defending champions Manchester City for a first English top-flight title for 29 years, and that success has been mirrored off the pitch too. Media revenue has increased by Â£66m to Â£220m, commercial revenue by Â£17m to Â£154m and match revenue by Â£7m to Â£81m. In revenue terms, Liverpool will leapfrog Arsenal into third place in the Premier League, behind Manchester United and Manchester City. In total, Â£137m came into the club from player transfers. Liverpool say all of that has been reinvested back into the squad, taking outgoings on new players to more than Â£190m. Andy Hughes, the club's chief operating officer, said: ""What we have seen is a stable and sustained improvement in the club's financial position over recent years. ""This growth and increase in revenue has enabled us to significantly reinvest both in the playing squad and the football operational infrastructure. ""Financial results do fluctuate depending on player trading costs and timing of payments, but what's clear in these latest results is the further strengthening of our underlying financial footing and profits being reinvested in the squad and infrastructure."" The club also say their social media platforms had a 14% growth rate, taking the total to over 60 million followers across digital channels, and that in May 2018 they had the highest viewing figures ever for a Premier League club, and third of any sports club globally. In January, Liverpool climbed two places to seventh in the latest edition ofthe Deloitte Football Money League.

A poll released last April suggested they are the first team for 32.5 million Brazilians. The club owes a great chunk of this support to an incredible run of four Brazilian titles and a victorious Copa Libertadores campaign (the South American version of the Uefa Champions League) in the 1980s. It has also produced arguably one of the greatest all-time Brazilian players - Arthur Antunes ""Zico"" Coimbra, a member of the 1982 World Cup squad that failed to win the title but won worldwide plaudits for its slick style. The club is also proud of the tradition of its youth academy - its motto is ""we make our star players at home"" - which will make this tragedy even sadder. The club's most prominent former players include World Cup winners Ronaldinho, Bebeto and Romario. As well as being one of Brazil's most successful football clubs, Flamengo also has basketball, rowing, swimming and volleyball teams. In a tweet on Friday, the team said it was ""in mourning"".

"Andrew Wallace was previously convicted of killing a woman when he was 15 A convicted killer has been jailed for at least 28 years for murdering a woman in Glasgow and dismembering her body. Andrew Wallace was given a mandatory life sentence for killing Julie Reilly, 47, in her Govan flat in February last year. Wallace, 42, cut off her legs with a knife and put the remains in plastic bags and suitcases, before burying them near Ms Reilly's home. Judge Lady Rae told him he was guilty of an ""evil and despicable act"". Ms Reilly was reported missing in February 2018 The judge told Wallace: ""You are a dangerous man who has a considerable propensity for violence."" She passed a life sentence with a minimum of 28 years before he can apply for parole. The judge said she would have set the minimum term at 30 years if it had not been for his guilty plea. It is the second time Wallace has killed a woman. He was just 15 when he was found guilty of culpable homicide in 1992. Part of Ms Reilly's body was found in a garden in Ardshiel Road Wallace was arrested for Ms Reilly's murder after the discovery of two leg bones close to her home. No other body parts have been found and her sister, Lynne Bryce, has appealed to Wallace to reveal the location of her remains. ""I hope that if he has a heart he could now please tell us where he has put my sister and let her come home to be put to rest properly, with the dignity she deserves,"" Ms Bryce said. Ms Reilly's sister and other members of her family were in court to hear the details of the murder as Wallace was sentenced. Parts of Julie's body were found buried in a nearby garden The High Court in Glasgow was told that Ms Reilly had a brain injury which caused problems with her memory, slowed her reactions and affected her speech. She was befriended by Wallace, and had allowed him to stay with her at her home in Shieldhall Road after he had split up with his girlfriend in December 2017. She thought he would help to care for her, but the court heard that he saw her as being ""easy to manipulate and rip off"". After she went missing, a forensic team examined a piece of land close to where Ms Reilly lived The last recorded sighting of Ms Reilly was on 6 February last year. The following day Wallace told a friend he needed ""to get rid of a body"". He also sent texts claiming that Ms Reilly had moved to the Penilee area of Glasgow. In the following days he was seen at the homes of two friends with heavy suitcases. He told one friend he had hit a deer while out driving and wanted to sell the meat. Human remains were found close to Ms Reilly's home He told another friend he had been thrown out by Ms Reilly and the suitcase contained his dirty washing. Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the court that the cases actually contained human remains. Ms Reilly was reported missing by worried relatives on 15 February last year after failing to turn up to several appointments. She also missed her grandson's first birthday. Her mother Margaret Hanlon and sister Ms Bryce madean emotional appeal for her return. Police found traces of blood in Julies flat When police examined Mr Reilly's flat as part of the missing person's investigation, they found traces of blood in the hall, kitchen, bedrooms and living room. On 19 April a member of the public found a bone with flesh attached in his front garden in Ardshiel Road. Days later another person contacted the police about an apparent burial site at Drumoyne Drive. Mr Goddard added: ""The precise circumstances of the murder are not known. To-date neither the suitcases seen in possession of the accused, nor the rest of the body of Julie Reilly, has been recovered."" Wallace's defence lawyer Ian Duguid told the court the killing had come after an argument. ""Julie Reilly had taken a knife and presented it at him,"" he said. ""He took that from her and stabbed her in the chest. This is his explanation as to how she met her death. ""A shocking crime exacerbated by what followed it. Going to such lengths was either desperation or a reflection on his thought process.""

"The FaceTime problem emerged when teenagers were planning Fortnite strategies A US teenager who discovered a security flaw in Apple's FaceTime video-calling system has been given a bug bounty. Apple has not revealed the exact amount it is giving 14-year-old Grant Thompson but it is believed to include money tohelp pay for his education.,external The teenager found a bug that meant he could briefly eavesdrop on recipients to a group FaceTime call. The reward comes as one security researcher refused to tell Apple about a bug because no bounty was on offer. Information aboutthe bug first emerged,externalin late January and revealed that some Apple users could secretly listen to people they called via FaceTime even if the recipient did not accept the call. Apple deemed it so serious that it disabled the group FaceTime feature while it investigated and produced a fix. News reports about the problem initially said it was just being discussed on social media and did not credit any individual with its discovery. Later, it emerged that Apple had been warned about it earlier in January by Grant and his mother. The teenager uncovered the problem when using FaceTime to talk about strategies for the Fortnite game with friends. Mrs Thompson sent several emails and other messages to Apple warning about the vulnerability but initially got no response. Now, Apple has credited Grant, who's from Catalina, in Arizona, with finding the flaw. News about his reward came on the day that Apple issued a software update that fixed the bug. Apple's bug bounty policy has led one security researcher to withhold details on a password-stealing vulnerability in the MacOS operating system. German bug hunter Linus Henze said he would not release details of the problem to Apple until it included MacOS in its bounty programme. Currently Apple only pays for bugs found in the iOS operating system for phones. In addition, security experts have to be invited to take part in the programme that pays up to $200,000 (Â£154,300) for the most serious bugs. ""My motivation is to get Apple to create a bug bounty program.

"Princess Ubolratana Mahidol pictured in 2010 In an unprecedented move, the sister of Thailand's king has joined the race to be the country's next prime minister. Princess Ubolratana Mahidol, 67, will stand for a party allied to divisive ex-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, according to registration papers. Her decision breaks with the tradition of the Thai royal family publicly staying out of politics. Thailand's election is scheduled to take place on 24 March. The election is being closely watched as the first chance for Thailand to return to democracy after five years under military rule. Born in 1951, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi is the oldest child of Thailand's beloved late King Bhumibol Adulyadej.He died in 2016. She attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and after marrying an American in 1972, she gave up her royal title. After her divorce she returned to Thailand in 2001 and once again started participating in royal life. The princess engages actively in social media and has also starred in several Thai movies. The princess who has upended Thai politics How King Bhumibol shaped modern Thailand She has three children, one of whom died in the 2004 tsunami. The other two now also live in Thailand. The princess has registered for the Thai Raksa Chart party, which is loyal to the controversial Shinawatra family that has dominated Thai politics for years. In an Instagram post on Friday, Princess Ubolratana reiterated that she had relinquished all her royal titles and that she now lives as a commoner. She said she wanted to exercise her rights as an ordinary citizen by offering her candidacy for prime minister. She said she would work with all sincerity and determination for the prosperity of all Thais. King Vajiralongkorn has not made any public comments about his sister's entry into politics. by the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok Thai politics has taken many bizarre turns in recent years. The submission of King Vajiralongkorn's elder sister as a prime ministerial candidate is one of the strangest, and turns politics on its head. If she is confirmed, it is clear that the strategy of the military faction which led the 2014 coup, in the name both of defending the monarchy and keeping pro-Thaksin forces out of government, is in pieces. The constitution it drafted still gives it lasting influence over future governments. But a royal prime minister could help end the protracted political conflict which has troubled Thailand for the past thirteen years, forcing a reconciliation between the competing factions that the military government failed to bring about. But it would also bring the royal family into the heart of government, undermining the official position that the monarchy stays above politics. Read more from Jonathan Supporters of the princess are flooding Thai social media with the hashtag #LongLiveSlender. According to local media outlet Khaosod,external, the hashtag is a reference to a television show the princess appeared in, in which she jokingly said would rather hear the phrase ""Long Live Slender"" - a reference to her appearance - rather than ""Long Live your Highness"". Others compared her to other powerful historical and fictional female leaders. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The March vote will be the first since current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in 2014, overthrowing the democratic government and ousting ex-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the younger sister of Thaksin Shinawatra. Both Mr Shinawatra and his sister currently live in self-imposed exile but still remain a powerful force in Thai politics, with many in the country remaining loyal to them In 2016, Thais voted to approve a new constitution created by the country's military leaders, which was designed to perpetuate military influence and block Mr Thaksin's allies from winning another election. But now that the princess has aligned herself with a party allied with Mr Thaksin, all bets are off the table, our correspondent says. Prayuth, a former general who seized power in a military coup, also announced on Friday that he would be running for prime minister in the current election. Thailand army's pivotal role in politics Why Thais backed a military-backed constitution He will be running as a candidate for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party. Thailand has some of the world's toughest royal defamation laws but technically the princess is not covered by them. However, the royal family is revered in Thailand and rarely criticised, so there are questions around whether any other candidate would want to challenge a member of the royal family. Thailand's lese-majeste law explained Who is Thaksin Shinawatra? Analysts also say the lese majeste laws have been interpreted broadly, meaning media outlets may be careful in their coverage. Thailand's military has a history of intervening in politics and has seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy - and the introduction of the first constitution - in 1932.

Mr Mearns said the plane was identified by sonar, 67m (220ft) below the surface on Sunday, before a submersible with cameras was sent underwater to confirm this. During the recovery operation, the AAIB used a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to aid the search, with no divers involved. The body was moved first on Wednesday, and separately from the wreckage, to maximise the chances of it being successfully brought to the surface. It said efforts to recover the crashed plane as a whole proved unsuccessful, before being abandoned due to poor weather. Mr Mearns told BBC Radio Wales finding Mr Ibbotson's body would be difficult.

The AAIB said efforts to recover the crashed plane as a whole proved unsuccessful, before being abandoned due to poor weather. ""The weather forecast is poor for the foreseeable future and so the difficult decision was taken to bring the overall operation to a close,"" the AAIB said in a statement.

"A financial technology company whose ""single-shaming"" advertising campaign drew protests is facing scrutiny from the City watchdog over the issue. Revolut, which offers app-based current accounts,sparked complaints with a ""spoof"" adaddressed to people who ordered a takeaway meal for one on Valentine's Day last year. It admits that the figures in the ad should have been labelled fictitious. The complaints have now been forwarded to the Financial Conduct Authority. Revolut launched in 2015 and bills itself as an alternative to banks. It has apologised for the advert, described by critics as ""intrusive"" and ""tone-deaf"", and said it did not mean to poke fun. After the issue was highlighted on Twitter, several people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about the advert. But the ASA decided that the issue was outside its scope, since it found the advert did not breach its codes. However, it added: ""As the complaint touches on the potential misleading financial services provided by the advertiser, we will be referring the matter to the Financial Conduct Authority, whose remit this would fall under."" The ASA said complainants could rest assured that the FCA would ""take any necessary action"". Financial commentator Iona Bain, who was among the first people to draw attention to the advert and who was among the complainants to the ASA, said she was glad that the matter was being taken seriously. Iona Bain is founder of the Young Money Blog Ms Bain, founder ofthe Young Money Blog,external, told the BBC that there was a recognition that the advert was possibly misleading about the financial services that Revolut provided. She objected to the advert for a number of reasons, including the way that it played on people's concerns about improper use of their data and whether their financial activity was private. She added: ""It's not just the crass and tacky tone of the ad, but also the confusion about what banks do with your data."" Revolut offers a current account service which allows people to make and receive payments, withdraw money from cash machines and transfer money abroad. It was not a bank when it started, but it announced in December that it had been granted an EU banking licence by the European Central Bank. It still aims to acquire a full UK banking licence. It has already attained the status of a tech ""unicorn"" - a term used to describe private start-ups valued at more than $1bn (Â£740m). The BBC has approached Revolut for a comment on the latest developments, but no-one was available to respond.

"Eric McKenna was linked to the crimes after he was arrested following a dispute with his neighbour The body of the father of a man who is serving a 23-year sentence for two rapes is to be exhumed in a bid to prove the son's innocence. Eric McKennawas jailed last Marchfor raping two women in Newcastle and Gateshead in the 1980s. The 60-year-old's DNA was linked to the crimes after he was cautioned for urinating on a neighbour's plant pot. His family says Thomas McKenna was the rapist and has won permission for the exhumation from the Church of England. Eric McKenna's wife Moira petitioned the CofE to allow the exhumation to take place. Her husband has always denied he carried out the street attacks. His father Thomas McKenna, who died in 1993, is buried in St John's cemetery in the Elswick area of Newcastle. The CofE accepts that digging up the body could ""help settle this matter once and for all"" A spokesman for the Diocese of Newcastle said: ""The Church of England will only grant permission to exhume a person's remains from consecrated ground in exceptional circumstances. ""Recent cases considered by the Consistory Court have laid out principles that each chancellor should follow when considering an application for exhumation. ""Our chancellor Euan Duff has followed these principles when considering this case, although he has been very clear that granting permission in no way supports the accusation being made against the deceased. ""It is recognition that the DNA analysis may help settle this matter once and for all."" Following the conviction last year, Det Con Mick Wilson of Northumbria Police said: ""McKenna thought he had got away with his crimes, but a neighbourly dispute and a moment of stupidity has landed him in prison for 23 years."" After the case, the Crown Prosecution Service said the chance of Eric McKenna not being the source of DNA samples recovered at the two rape scenes was one in one billion. Dr Eva Fernandez-Dominguez, associate professor in ancient DNA at Durham University and former lecturer in forensic anthropology at Liverpool John Moores University, said DNA sampling techniques had changed significantly since the 1980s. ""It is technically possible to extract DNA from bones,"" she said. ""In this particular case, the information of the father may or may not be crucial depending on the type of DNA analysis performed over the sample collected at the crime scene. ""If only Y chromosome information was recovered, then potentially both father or son could have been the perpetrators, as Y chromosome is identical among male relatives of the same family. ""If other chromosomal information was recovered and a positive complete match between the son and the DNA from the crime scene was found, then it would be highly unlikely that the father could have been the perpetrator, as fathers and sons only share 50% of this type of DNA, the other half coming from the mother. ""It is a case of what type of genetic information was used."" Any removal of DNA from exhumed remains must be done so under rules laid down by the Human Tissue Authority. A spokesman said: ""DNA is not considered 'relevant material' under the Human Tissue Act, although the material from which it originates is considered so. ""So any removal of tissue from the deceased needs to take place on licensed premises such as a mortuary. ""In the case of a deceased person, anyone in a qualifying relationship to the deceased can give consent for DNA testing."" Once any DNA is recovered from the remains, police could then investigate if any new evidence emerges.

" Over a period of a few months, the BBC spoke to dozens of young lesbians in a country where homosexuality is illegal. They told us about their day-to-day lives and how they use secret memes to connect with each other onsocial media platforms and chat apps. We have substituted those images with that of a violet for the purpose of this report. The violet does not belong to the group in Burundi or - to the best of our knowledge - any other LGBT+ groups in East Africa or the Great Lakes. The peak of the midday sun has passed. It’s mild enough to kick a ball around, not oppressive enough to feel faint in the heat. It’s a great day to meet friends in the park. The women are in high spirits, chatting animatedly, playfully sketching patterns on each other using body paint, and sharing a picnic. They meet once a month, in different places. Sometimes in public but mostly behind closed doors. Most of them are wearing jeans and T-shirts in various colours, patterns and styles. The T-shirts are important because printed on each one is a discreet, matching symbol. It’s an in-joke – a sign of their identity and independence. Something only they understand. This could be a group of friends in any park, in any country. But this is Burundi, where being who they are is against the law. The women, who are all in their 20s and early 30s, haven’t known each other long. “We’d be in so much trouble if people know who we are,” Nella says. They could be fined or imprisoned. But there is also the danger that people within their own communities may turn on them. “The worst is death,” says Nella. Nella sends a photo to the BBC using an encrypted app. She's pictured sitting on a chair with young children around her. “My kids,” she types. “They are under 10.” They are playing up for the camera, contorting their faces into comical expressions. Nella is wearing a hijab. Another photo appears and this time she is wearing loose jeans and a fitted T-shirt. It’s the same T-shirt she was wearing in the park with the women. Her curled black hair is visible and falling on her shoulders. She’s sitting at a table in an open-air restaurant, her arm around a young woman whose hair is styled in thin cornrows. Both women beam megawatt, toothy smiles. “My girlfriend,” she writes, by way of a virtual introduction. “Aren’t we cute?” It’s the first time she’s been able to introduce her that way to someone, she says. It feels good. The pair met on a social networking site and the relationship is still new. “We’re happy,” she says. Her family don’t know, of course, and she's taking a risk meeting up. Someone who knows her family may see her. But she's sure she won't be recognised, because when she goes to meet her girlfriend, she removes the hijab she wears at home. Nella was 17 years old when she fell in love with a girl for the first time. They met through sport – something Nella had been passionate about since she was a young girl. It didn’t turn into a relationship, Nella says, but she knew then that there was no going back. It wasn’t a phase or a crush. “I knew with certainty that I liked women,” she says. She also knew that she couldn’t tell anyone. She was from a conservative Muslim family. Dating was not an option, let alone with a woman. Nella was born in the city of Bujumbura,  the capital of Burundi. The country, which is one of the world's poorest, is located in the  African Great Lakes region. It has struggled to gain stability since the end of a civil war in 2005, and when it does hit the international headlines, it's mainly this image that is portrayed. But this is one-dimensional, says Nella, it’s as if real people with hopes, dreams, love and desire have no place here. When she was a teenager, Nella dreamed of going to university. But her family were constantly urging her to get married. They would introduce her to members of the extended family, in the hope they could find a match. When her parents died, Nella's brothers increased the pressure. There was no money for an education, they said, and besides they didn't believe a woman needed one. They knew of a rich man who was interested in her. There was little time to lose, they insisted. At 20 she was getting on a bit. A wedding was hastily arranged and Nella resigned herself to becoming a wife. She says she was forced into marriage, but wonders if “forced” is the right word. “Can you even force someone who has no rights to begin with?” she asks. As a woman from a country like hers, Nella says her rights were already diminished. And as one of the 2% of Muslims in a majority Christian nation, she felt even more marginalised. Nella’s husband didn’t know about her sexual identity. It wasn’t a happy marriage. The couple barely communicated and she dreaded intimacy. After the birth of her youngest child, Nella says she began to feel like the most isolated woman in the world. She doesn't want to go into much detail about her marriage. She says it would compromise her children’s safety. She turned to social media and carried out searches for women who like women. Suddenly, she realised she was not alone. She then narrowed her search to Bujumbura. What she discovered was that there is a shorthand, a secret code, that local lesbian women use to reach out to each other.It largely relies on internet shorthand, obscure symbols used by lesbians around the world. Nella would send these images and emoticons to other women. Those in the know would respond. Buoyed by what she found, Nella began connecting with women online. Women like her. Women who soon became her closest friends. In 2016, her husband found out about these conversations and her marriage broke down. He vowed to keep her sexuality a secret from the wider community for the sake of their children. Nella took her children and moved in with relatives. They don’t know about her other life. “There are ‘invisible’ lesbians in every country. We are just one part of it.” “If we exist here, we exist everywhere.” “We need to be heard.” “If you know that we exist, you may start looking for us in your own communities, and in your own families.” Niya has just turned 27, and this is the most comfortable she has felt. But it hasn’t always been this way. She was brought up by strict parents in a suburban neighbourhood of Bujumbura. She and her siblings had to be home earlier than their friends. Niya had to dress conservatively and was expected to act in a demure way. So were her friends. Niya’s father was away a lot, leaving her mother in charge of the family. Niya preferred friendships with boys but these never developed into crushes. At 14, she became a Christian. Thinking that part of her faith meant that she should avoid dating, she put her lack of romantic interest in boys down to a commitment to God. At 22, she met a woman who was also in her early 20s, through mutual friends. Bonding over their love of music, they formed a fast friendship. “We started talking,” says Niya, “Then one day, in the middle of a deep conversation, she turned to me and said, ‘I like women’.” “I thought, ‘Whoa!’” Back at home, thinking about what had happened, Niya realised that she had feelings for her friend. The pair began to date in secret. They’d eat out, go shopping, go to bars. The relationship didn’t last long but one thing was clear: Niya now knew why she was not attracted to men. It had nothing to do with religion. Two years later, Niya felt she had to tell one person in her immediate family. She chose one of her brothers. “He only asked me two questions: ‘How long have you known?’ and ‘Are you sure?’” “I replied, ‘Two years’ and ‘Yes, I’m sure’.” Niya’s brother nodded, ‘OK, you know I’ve always got your back.’” The two hugged. And that was the last time they talked about it. Niya was sure because, like Nella, she had spent a lot of time online. She had looked up YouTube videos of lesbian vloggers in other parts of the world. She watched films featuring same-sex couples and read a lot of reports on lesbian, bisexual and queer (LBQ) communities. She began to understand the language of the internet. “I used memes a lot, specific memes, to reach out to other women,” she says. The BBC messaged Niya to tell her that we would be using images of a violet to illustrate the memes. We chose the symbol - which differs vastly from the symbols the women use - because lesbian women in the 1900s were said to give violets to their girlfriends. “That’s perfect. It’s our secret Viola Revolution,” she replies. A jigsaw was slowly beginning to fit together. Watching the YouTube videos had confirmed to Niya that she was not alone. But where were the other gay women in Burundi? Niya knew they must exist – it was a matter of finding them. Leila was 17 when she realised that she was in love with a female friend. Leila thought about her all the time. She fantasised about her. It could only be love. “At first I thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m in love with a woman. What is happening?’” Leila had grown up in a loving, supportive middle-class family in Bujumbura city. She was popular. She had a boyfriend. And now here she was, in love with a friend. After months of thinking about her continuously, she needed to share her feelings. Leila texted the friend. “Hey, I think I’m in love with you.” There was silence for hours. Then the friend replied. “I’m sorry Leila. But no. I don’t like girls.” Leila was mortified. “What have I done?” she asked herself. But she needn’t have worried. Leila didn’t lose her friendship. The two agreed to draw a line under the embarrassing episode. Relieved, Leila put her months of infatuation down to a phase. It had been a one-off crush, with one woman. “I thought, ‘When I get over her, I’ll be ‘normal’ again,’” she says. Then something happened that she didn’t anticipate. Leila’s brother went through her phone and found the text she had sent to her friend. He showed their mother and an emotional showdown followed. “Mum cried. I cried. We convinced ourselves it was a phase. She asked me to make an effort to be be ‘normal’. I said I would.” Leila started dating a man. But something was wrong. “I wasn’t into it,” she says, “I thought maybe it was because the guy wasn’t cute. So I dumped him and started dating a cute guy.” It still didn’t work. Then a male friend asked her if she didn't prefer women. Leila reluctantly replied, “I’m sure”. But when he looked at her quizzically, she says the full realisation of who she is hit her.  I am a lesbian, Leila told herself. But she still hoped there would be a way out of it. She prayed. She meditated. She became angry with herself. But slowly, she began to come to terms with the truth. When she was 21, she finally came out to herself. “Every gay person comes out twice,” says Leila. “You first come out to yourself. You have the moment when you realise that there is no going back. This is you. You are gay. Your plans and expectations for what you thought life would be need to adjust. Then there is the second coming out, the public coming out, to the people around you.” When she came out to herself, Leila began to look for other gay people. She doubted there would be women like her in Burundi, but she searched videos on Facebook and YouTube seeking lesbians in other countries. “I thought, I might be alone in Bujumbura but I’m not alone in the world.” Her next step was to explain to her mother that it wasn’t a phase - a hetrosexual life was not for her. Initially her mother took it badly. But as the days passed she began to ask more questions. Leila’s father was more supportive than she expected. The family agreed that as a lesbian woman in Burundi, Leila was already in a vulnerable position. They could protect her while she was in the family home, but they could not guarantee her safety outside if the wrong people found out. She knew she had to find the community to which she felt she belonged. There are two ways lesbian and bisexual women find each in Bujumbura - luck and the Internet. Leila and Niya were lucky to meet at work. “We started talking at lunch,” says Niya. “Within that conversation, we knew that we were the same. There was a shorthand, a recognition.” The two quickly became good friends. “It’s hard to describe how exactly gay people meet each other in Africa,” says Leila. “You don’t have a lesbian hotspot that you can Google - a known place we can meet up. “You become an expert in picking up vibes from each other, because so much of your communication is non-verbal. You become an expert in body language, eye contact.” Then there was the internet and social media. “We don’t have dating apps, but we have social media,” says Niya. “There are certain shorthands there too. A meme we may have picked up from somewhere else, or a coded phrase. Nothing that anyone else outside the lesbian community would ever be able to pick up on.” Leila, Niya - and later Nella - formed a community. Now there are dozens of women who see themselves as Burundi’s secret lesbian collective. Some have support from their families. A few are married with children. No-one is openly out. When the group first formed, they mostly hung out. Burundi is well known in the Great Lakes for its vibrant nightlife. Bujumbura has fewer than 500,000 inhabitants, but maintains a vivid youth culture. The city, with its colonial-era Art Deco buildings surrounding a market, a football stadium and places of worship, sits on the shores of Lake Tanganyika. The country has been home to bouts of conflict since independence in 1962. But today, for many young people enjoying the nightlife in Bujumbura, those tensions feel another lifetime away. Tourists from neighbouring Rwanda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo can be found enjoying the nightlife in the clubs or the five-star hotel bars. Leila, Niya, Nella and their friends would often meet at these places. But listening to each other’s life stories led to a sombre realisation. Being a lesbian in Burundi was not just culturally frowned upon - it was dangerous. In 2009, the government signed into law a new criminal code penalising same-sex relations between consenting adults. Penalties include imprisonment of up to two years and/or a fine of up to 100,000 francs (US$55). Very little is known about lesbian rights in Burundi. An often-cited report by Human Rights Watch in 2009 spoke with only 10 members of the LGBT+ community and only one lesbian was interviewed. The BBC has spoken to dozens. There is little data, and there has been no large-scale collection of testimony, so it is almost impossible to get an accurate picture of their lives. US government records say that a lesbian couple was arrested in 2012 but released. Other than that, little else is documented. Nella says she heard of women being killed in rural Burundi for being gay. She also heard of a lesbian who was recently jailed in Bujumbura. Leila, however, believes the case is not as cut and dried as it seems. The woman, while being a lesbian, was not arrested for her sexuality - the authorities were unaware of it, she believes. It was because the woman had retaliated against domestic abuse in her family home, and lashed out against her abuser. Leila thinks domestic abuse in families where a woman is suspected of being lesbian or bisexual is a big cause for concern. The group has heard of abuse as a result of sexuality but it is impossible to verify. Often women withdraw their stories for fear of what might happen to them. Many members of the group say they have experienced violence at the hands of family members who became suspicious about their sexuality. After being hit, one woman went to the police station only to be told that “the man who hit you deserves a prize, he was right to beat you up”. Nella is now divorced but others in the group remain married. Their husbands are not aware of their sexuality. “There is huge pressure for women to get married,” says Leila. “Many just accept it and get married. If you’re in Bujumbura, you’re lucky, because you have the internet and you can try to look for others like you out in the world. But it’s the rural women we’re concerned about.” According to Internet World Stats only 4.4% of Burundi’s 11 million-strong population have access to the internet, and almost all of them are based in Bujumbura. “It's no wonder members of the group are all in the city. But we have a duty to find our sisters who are not,” says Leila. She and a few other women go out to speak to lesbian and bisexual women in the villages. They hear about them through loose local networks, both on and offline, and through friends of friends. “We are thinking of ways we can do outreach there.” “Our community is strong and it’s vibrant,” says Niya. “Growing up, I used to wish that I was ‘normal’,” says Leila. “Now we joke about how we’re not normal. We say we’re aliens and we have superpowers.” They hope this is the beginning of the conversation. The beginning of a Viola Revolution. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.95064163
"This video can not be played The experiment saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Giving jobless people in Finland a basic income for two years did not lead them to find work, researchers said. From January 2017 until December 2018, 2,000 unemployed Finns got a monthly flat payment of â¬560 (Â£490; $634). The aim was to see if a guaranteed safety net would help people find jobs, and support them if they had to take insecure gig economy work. While employment levels did not improve, participants said they felt happier and less stressed. When it launched the pilot scheme back in 2017, Finland became the first European country to test out the idea of an unconditional basic income. It was run by the Social Insurance Institution (Kela), a Finnish government agency, and involved 2,000 randomly-selected people on unemployment benefits. It immediately attracted international interest - but these results have now raised questions about the effectiveness of such schemes. Universal basic income, or UBI, means that everyone gets a set monthly income, regardless of means. The Finnish trial was a bit different, as it focused on people who were unemployed. Another popular variation is 'universal basic services' - where instead of getting an income, things like education, healthcare and transport are free for all. Although it's enjoying a resurgence in popularity, the idea isn't new. In fact, it was first described in Sir Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516 - a full 503 years ago. Such schemes are being trialled all over the world. Adults in a village in western Kenya are being given $22 a month for 12 years, until 2028, while the Italian government is working on introducing a ""citizens' income"". The city of Utrecht, in the Netherlands, is also carrying out a basic income study called Weten Wat Werkt - ""Know What Works"" - until October. Some 2,000 unemployed people in Finland were randomly selected Supporters of basic income often believe an unconditional safety net can help people out of poverty, by giving them the time to apply for jobs or learn essential new skills. This is seen as increasingly important in the age of automation - that is, put very simply, as robots take people's jobs. Miska Simanainen, one of the Kela researchers behind the Finnish study, tells BBC News that this was what their government had wanted to test, in order ""to see if it would be a way of reforming the social security system"". That depends what you mean by 'work'. Did it help unemployed people in Finland find jobs, as the centre-right Finnish government had hoped? No, not really. Mr Simanainen says that while some individuals found work, they were no more likely to do so than a control group of people who weren't given the money. They are still trying to work out exactly why this is, for the final report that will be published in 2020. Will Finland's basic income trial help the jobless? No expansion of Finland basic income trial But for many people, the original goal of getting people into work was flawed to begin with. If instead the aim were to make people generally happier, the scheme would have been considered a triumph. One participant, former newspaper editor Tuomas, pretty much summed this up when he told BBC News about how the basic income had affected him. ""I am still without a job,"" he explained. ""I can't say that the basic income has changed a lot in my life. OK, psychologically yes, but financially - not so much."" UBI is one of those rare issues that attracts equally strong support - and criticism - from all parts of the political spectrum. For a lot of people on the left, UBI focuses too heavily on individuals' personal wealth and buying power - or rather, their lack of it - without doing anything to stop companies wasting resources by producing far more stuff than people need, and over-working their employees in the process. Economics writer Grace Blakely makes this point in the New Socialist, adding that ""without fundamental structural reforms to our economic system, UBI will only be a sticking plaster papering over the cracks"". Others worry that basic income will be used to cut costs, by setting the rate too low and slashing other, means-tested benefits. Meanwhile, many on the political right and centre worry about the exact opposite - that UBI would be too expensive to implement, and would encourage a ""something for nothing"" culture. Ulrich Spiesshofer, chief executive of ABB engineering company, echoed this sentiment in 2016 when he told the Financial Times that ""economic rewards [for people] should be based on actually creating economic value"". Researchers from Kela are now busy analysing all of their results, to figure out what else - if anything - they can tell us about basic income's uses and shortcomings. Mr Simanainen says that he doesn't like to think of the trial as having ""failed"". From his point of view, ""this is not a failure or success - it is a fact, and [gives us] new information that we did not have before this experiment"". Did Finland's free money experiment work?

"Philippe Coutinho was sold by Liverpool to Barcelona in a Â£142m deal in January 2018 Liverpool have announced a world record profit of Â£106m. In their yearly financial results, the Reds made an annual pre-tax profit of Â£125m - up from Â£40m - as turnover increased in the 12 months to May 2018 by Â£90m to Â£455m, also a record. Liverpool were boosted financially by a run to the Champions League final last season, which earned an estimated Â£72m. They were also helped by midfielderPhilippe Coutinho's Â£142m transfer to Barcelonain January 2018. Leicester City had held the record for net (post-tax) profit of Â£80m in 2016-17 (Â£92m pre-tax) after reaching the quarter-finals of the Champions League in 2017. Having topped the Premier League table for much of the season, Liverpool are vying with defending champions Manchester City for a first English top-flight title for 29 years, and that success has been mirrored off the pitch too. Media revenue has increased by Â£66m to Â£220m, commercial revenue by Â£17m to Â£154m and match revenue by Â£7m to Â£81m. In revenue terms, Liverpool will leapfrog Arsenal into third place in the Premier League, behind Manchester United and Manchester City. In total, Â£137m came into the club from player transfers. Liverpool say all of that has been reinvested back into the squad, taking outgoings on new players to more than Â£190m. Andy Hughes, the club's chief operating officer, said: ""What we have seen is a stable and sustained improvement in the club's financial position over recent years. ""This growth and increase in revenue has enabled us to significantly reinvest both in the playing squad and the football operational infrastructure. ""Financial results do fluctuate depending on player trading costs and timing of payments, but what's clear in these latest results is the further strengthening of our underlying financial footing and profits being reinvested in the squad and infrastructure."" The club also say their social media platforms had a 14% growth rate, taking the total to over 60 million followers across digital channels, and that in May 2018 they had the highest viewing figures ever for a Premier League club, and third of any sports club globally. In January, Liverpool climbed two places to seventh in the latest edition ofthe Deloitte Football Money League.

The Air Accidents Investigations Branch (AAIB) said the operation had been carried out in ""as dignified a way as possible"" and the men's families were kept updated throughout. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The Geo Ocean III, which was involved in finding the wreckage, took the body back to the nearest port of Portland in Dorset, where the body was formally identified. The Piper Malibu N264DB was en route from France to Cardiff, after the Argentine striker made a quick trip back to his former club Nantes two days after his Â£15m transfer to Cardiff was announced. In a post on Instagram, Sala's sister Romina paid tribute, saying: ""Your soul in my soul, it will shine forever thus illuminating the time of my existence. I love you, tito."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, was at the controls when the flight lost contact with air traffic controllers on 21 January. He is yet to be found. An official search was called off on 24 January after Guernsey's harbour master said the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". But an online appeal started by Sala's agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search led by marine scientist and oceanographer David Mearns. Working jointly with the AAIB, his ship and the Geo Ocean III, began combing a four square mile area of the English Channel, 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey, to make best use of the available sensors.

""I was glad to provide some small comfort to Romina, Mercedes and the whole Sala family during the past two weeks but my heart goes out to the family and friends of David Ibbotson whose loss is the same,"" Mr Mearns said. Cardiff fans left a sea of flowers outside the Cardiff City Stadium in tribute to Emiliano Sala During the recovery operation, the AAIB used a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) to aid the search, with no divers involved. The body was moved first, and separately from the wreckage, to maximise the chances of it being successfully brought to the surface. It said efforts to recover the crashed plane as a whole proved unsuccessful, before being abandoned due to poor weather. ""The weather forecast is poor for the foreseeable future and so the difficult decision was taken to bring the overall operation to a close,"" the AAIB said in a statement. The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu However, the AAIB said video footage captured by the ROV would provide ""valuable evidence"" for its safety investigation. Mr Mearns told BBC Radio Wales the AAIB could not have continued searching in the current conditions and admitted finding Mr Ibbotson's would be difficult. He added: ""I've been involved in operations when people were lost and the bodies were found days and weeks after, not far from where they were lost. ""But this is a pretty dynamic place. It's got fairly strong currents, it's not that deep water, you've got a lot of fishing activity, a lot of scallop dredgers moving in and out of the location. ""You cannot expect that the body is going to be in that location for an extended period of time."" Meanwhile, it has emerged that Sala's former club, French Ligue 1 side Nantes,has demanded Cardiff City pay his Â£15m transfer fee. Sala was Cardiff's record signing but never played for the club. The fee was due to be paid over three years but Cardiff have withheld the first scheduled payment until they are satisfied with the documentation.

"A Labour MP has accused John McDonnell of ""letting his allies go after"" Luciana Berger after a row erupted over her future in the party. Ms Berger is facing a vote of no confidence from local members for criticising Jeremy Corbyn. Shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said she should reject claims she supported a ""breakaway party"" to show members she was ""sticking with Labour"". But Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie said his response was ""ridiculous"". Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson also backed Ms Berger, telling the Commons she had ""our solidarity and... our support as she battles the bullying hatred from members of her own local party"". And Labour MP Ian Austin -who faced suspension after a row over the party's anti-Semitism code-told PoliticsHome,external: ""It's like something out of the Soviet Union's show trials where people were let off if they confessed their disloyalty and shouted 'Long Live Stalin'."" Ms Berger - an outspoken critic of the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and its stance on Brexit - said she would be not be ""distracted from fighting for the interests of my constituents"". An extraordinary meeting has been called in the Liverpool Wavertree constituency next week to discusstwo no confidence motions,external. The motions accuse Ms Berger of being against Mr Corbyn, saying: ""Instead of fighting for a Labour government, our MP is continually using the media to criticise the man we all want to be prime minister."" Votes of no confidence carry no official force within the Labour Party, but local activists could hold a ""trigger ballot"", where sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comers, ahead of the next general election. How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Anti-Semitic hate incidents 'rise by 16%' MP Smith 'considering' quitting Labour Ms Berger has been the target of online abuse and had a police escort at last year's Labour Party conference following death threats. Earlier this week, she joined other MPs at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Partycalling for details on the party's efforts to tackle anti-Semitism to be released. In a statement, Ms Berger said she believed her constituents would judge her on her record and skills in representing them in Parliament. She reiterated her ""long-held view that Brexit will be a disaster for the people of Liverpool Wavertree and the wider country"", saying she would ""not shy away from standing up"" for her Remain-voting constituency. And she said she had made ""no secret that, as a Jewish woman representing a city with a Jewish community, I have been deeply disturbed by the lack of response from Jeremy Corbyn as party leader and many in the wider leadership of the party to the anti-Semitism that stains our party"". Ms Berger added: ""Nothing will deter me from exposing anti-Semitism wherever it festers, including in the Labour Party where it is being wilfully ignored."" Mr Leslie - a former shadow chancellor himself - told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Mr McDonnell had ""demanded an oath of loyalty from her to those who are attacking her"", adding: ""I have never heard of such of a ridiculous situation. ""He should never have allowed his allies to have gone after Luciana like that in the first place. I have a feeling they will realise this is a terrible, terrible judgement."" Asked if he was considering whether to resign from the party, the MP did not rule it out, and said his ""patience is wearing pretty thin"" - namely around Labour's Brexit policy, as he supports a further referendum on whether to leave or remain in the EU. He said had ""serious worries"" about the direction of the leadership of the party, adding: ""Of course I have my issues with Jeremy Corbyn and the leadership, but the bigger point is there is a country and our constituents to put first here. ""If we keep getting told 'oh well get in line behind your party, shut up don't say anything, in fact, we're going to push you gradually out of the party for various reasons', don't expect us to just go quietly and say nothing. This is a serious moment."" Luciana Berger and Chris Leslie have campaigned together for a ""People's Vote"" on Brexit A number of Labour MPs tweeted their support for Ms Berger after the news of the no confidence motions broke on Thursday night, including former leader Ed Miliband and prominent backbencher Yvette Cooper. However, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr McDonnell said the motion came about because Ms Berger is ""associated"" withrumours of a new centrist party being formed. ""[The motion] is an expression of views,"" he said. ""If people are doing that because Luciana has stood up against [anti-Semitism] that is completely wrong. ""But from what I have seen on social media, it looks as though what has happened is Luciana has been in the media associated with a breakaway party and hasn't been clear that she rejects that."" He condemned a Facebook post from one of the local Labour members calling Ms Berger a ""disruptive Zionist"", saying it was ""completely wrong"". But the shadow chancellor said: ""My advice to Luciana is just tell people you are not supporting a breakaway party, you are sticking with the Labour Party, you are not jumping ship. ""And my advice to the Labour Party members there is if there are differences of opinion there, get together, talk about it and see how you can support the campaign alongside your local MP."" Other Labour MPs criticised Mr McDonnell's response, with Chuka Umunna tweeting to shadow cabinet members: ""Are we going to act? Defend a colleague in the face of this outrage?"" Ms Berger is not the first Labour MP to have faced a no confidence vote from their local parties over their views on Brexit. Others include Frank Field - who now represents Birkenhead as an independent MP - and Kate Hoey. Conservative Nick Boles also believes his constituency party in Grantham and Stamford islooking to oust him as a candidate at the next election. Meanwhile, Labour activists from the ""Another Europe is Possible"" group are targeting the constituencies of MPs who broke the whip and voted with the government over Theresa May's Brexit deal, calling it a ""moment of reckoning"". Seven Labour MPs backed an amendment supported by the government calling for ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop element of Mrs May's plan - which aims to avoid a hard border returning between Northern Ireland and Ireland. And a total of 26 MPs either abstained or voted against an amendment by Yvette Cooper, which was backed by the Labour leadership, which would have allowed for an extension of Article 50 - the mechanism seeing the UK leave the EU on 29 March - by up to nine months, with the aim of avoiding a no-deal. The left-wing group, founded last summer, will campaign in around 30 constituencies to ""apply pressure"" to the MPs to vote against Mrs May's deal. Gordon Watson, the Labour deputy leader of Rotherham Council, warned that the rebels could end up facing de-selection if they don't vote the deal down, adding: ""Failing to vote against the Tory deal is essentially propping up a government that is wrecking our communities.

He went on to star in Tom Jones, as Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express, Erin Brockovich and Skyfall.

"Labour's plan for a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit can secure a Commons majority, the shadow chancellor has told the BBC. John McDonnell said it was a ""very traditional British compromise"" to avoid a ""catastrophic"" no-deal Brexit. ""We believe that this is a deal that could fly within Parliament,"" he said. Jeremy Corbyn's letter setting out Labour's demands for supporting a Brexit deal was welcomed by some EU figures and Tory MPs. Downing Street is expected to reply to Mr Corbyn's letter later on Friday. Theresa May to meet Irish PM in Dublin May says she can get Brexit deal through What's behind Corbyn's letter to May? What is Labour's customs union policy? Home Secretary Sajid Javid told BBC Wiltshire it was ""good that Jeremy Corbyn has finally started talking"". But, he added: ""In this letter he's put five demands and I think any person reading that letter would know it's far more about politics than it is about actually trying to work with the prime minister in the national interest"". And Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party - who Theresa May relies upon for votes in Parliament - said Mr Corbyn's plan did not have the support of the Labour Party. He added: ""The way to a majority for a deal in the United Kingdom is with the Conservative Party and the DUP. ""I don't believe Theresa May is going to split her party in order to reach out to Jeremy Corbyn, who is going to find it very difficult to bring his own party along, and he cant be relied upon to deliver the Brexit that the prime minister believes people voted for in the referendum."" In contrast to Mrs May's deal, Labour wants the UK to be a member of a customs union with the EU, with an agreement ""that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals"" and close ties to the single market. Under Mrs May's plan, the UK would leave the customs union, which she says would allow it to strike trade deals around the world. Please upgrade your browser A senior No 10 source said the government was looking at Labour's proposals ""with interest"" but added: ""There are obviously very considerable points of difference that exist between us. ""The PM continues to believe an independent trade policy is one of the key advantages of Brexit."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March when the two-year limit on withdrawal negotiations under the Article 50 process expires. But Mrs May has been unable to get the withdrawal deal she has negotiated with the EU through Parliament - it was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs last month. In Brussels on Thursday, she told EU leaders that she could get a ""stable majority in Parliament"" for the deal if they agreed to legally-binding changes to the Irish backstop clause - something they have always ruled out. Talks are continuing with EU officials - but senior figures in Brussels gave a warm reception to Mr Corbyn's alternative proposals. The European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt said: ""It's important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority, so that we can conclude these negotiations."" This video can not be played Newsnight: Dutch MEP Sophie in ât Veld says renegotiating Brexit deal is 'dead end' European Council President Donald Tusk also described Mr Corbyn's letter as a ""promising way"" out of the impasse, according to an EU source. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has said he is willing to discuss the proposals with Labour's shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer. Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The prime minister has to accept that the only way she will get something through Parliament is a compromise like this. ""I think if Theresa May said 'I will sign up to Labour's deal' and we went to Parliament, I think we would have a secure Parliamentary majority."" Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin was among those suggesting Mr Corbyn's move could open the way to a cross-party consensus, if Mrs May could not get her deal through: Allow Twitter content?

But Labour's position has upset some of the party's own backbenchers who see it as facilitating a ""Tory Brexit"" that they say will harm their constituents. Some Labour members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum have accused Mr Corbyn of abandoning his commitment at Labour's conference to get behind a public vote if he can't force a general election. Owen Smith, who failed in his bid to topple Mr Corbyn in a 2016 leadership vote, has said he and ""lots of other people"" were considering their future in the party as a result. Owen Smith unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for the leadership in 2016 Asked about Labour opposition to Mr Corbyn's offer, Mr McDonnell said ""not everyone's going to get everything they want"" and MPs would have to compromise in the long-term interests of the country - but denied it had effectively killed off the prospect of Labour backing another referendum. He said people had ""looked over the edge of a no-deal Brexit"" and economic growth was already stalling: ""Therefore now in the national interest we have got to come together and secure a compromise. If we can't do that, well yes, we have to go back to the people."" Other Labour backbenchers have welcomed Mr Corbyn's move. Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who backs the ""Norway Plus"" model of a close economic partnership with the EU,tweeted,external: ""This can break the deadlock.""

"""Big six"" energy giant SSE has seen a sharp drop in customer numbers and has cut its full-year earnings forecast. It said it had lost 160,000 customers in the final three months of last year, leaving it with 5.88 million accounts. SSE also cut its profit forecast for this year after a European court ruled out a UK industry-wide subsidy which had supported emergency fuel supplies. Last November, SSE suffered a blow when it called off its plan to merge its household supply arm with Npower's. The firm blamed ""challenging market conditions"" and the price cap on bills. That deal would have created the UK's second-biggest energy supplier, shrinking the ""big six"" to the ""big five"". SSE said it was assessing options for its domestic supply business. SSE said that the European court judgement would cut income by about Â£60m this year. The company said it expects this to be ""a matter of timing only"" as the government is expected to make the payments in the future. But while it waited for that, the company said that earnings per share - the amount of profit divided by the number of shares in issue - would be 6p lower than previously expected, and in a range of 64-69p, compared with its November forecast of 70-75p. SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said the company was making ""good progress"" on deciding what to do with its retail business, SSE Energy Services. The options it has identified so far include: simply splitting it off and listing it on the stock market; a sale; or an alternative transaction. The shares were down slightly on the news. Donald Brown, from stockbrokers Brewin Dolphin, said the future of SSE Energy Services ""remains unclear"". ""However, it's difficult to see who might be interested in buying the business, which has been in decline for some time,"" he added.

"YouTube has decided to delete singer Austin Jones's channel, after he admitted exchanging sexually explicit images and videos with underage girls. The video-sharing site was criticised after it left the singer's videos online, despite him pleading guilty to charges in court. Other social networks were quick to remove his content but YouTube had decided not to act. It has now deleted the 26-year-old musician's channel. Jones was arrested in 2017 and charged with possession of indecent images of children. He had gained more than half a million subscribers on YouTube uploading cover versions of hit songs. But he was accused of exchanging sexually explicit images and videos with underage girls between 2010 and 2017. Court documents said he had conversations with six different 14 and 15-year-old girls. In one conversation, he is said to have told one of the teenagers that she needed to prove that she was ""his biggest fan"" by sending him videos of herself. He also asked young fans to record videos of themselves dancing sexually. Videos of Jones demonstrating how to ""twerk"" were exposed online. He pleaded guilty to the charges on 1 February and will be sentenced in May. Prosecutors asked for him to be taken immediately into custody, but the judge allowed him to remain free on bail so he can go for psychiatric counselling. YouTube said it took claims of sexual misconduct seriously. It also said it did remove content when a person was convicted of a crime ""in some cases"", particularly if the videos were related to the crime committed. The video-sharing site stopped Jones earning advertising revenue from his videos in 2017, when he was arrested.

"Theresa May arrived at Farmleigh House in Dublin on Friday evening The prime minister has met Leo Varadkar in Dublin for talks focused on Brexit and the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Theresa May has now returned to the UK after having dinner with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister). The talks in Farmleigh House lasted about two hours. The meeting took place after Mr Varadkar met Northern Ireland's main political parties in Belfast on Friday. Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Can technology solve Irish border problem? Labour: MPs will back our Brexit plan Mrs May was accompanied in Dublin by the UK's Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and her chief of staff Gavin Barwell. The Irish government said the two leaders discussed ""the latest Brexit developments"" as well as the ""ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland"". The meeting comes after the EU said it will hold more talks with the UK to help the prime minister get a Brexit deal through the Commons. Earlier, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox met his Irish counterpart after travelling to Dublin for talks. Speaking in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said it was ""not a day for negotiations"" but it was an opportunity to ""share perspectives"". He added that he was looking to restore confidence and trust with the prime minister during their meeting on Friday night. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter A Friday night in Dublin for Theresa May as she continues trying to find a way through for her Brexit deal. The prime minister came face-to-face with her Irish counterpart over a fillet of beef with dauphinoise potatoes and green beans. It's been a diplomatic whirlwind of a week as Mr Varadkar and Mrs May have bounced from Belfast to Brussels, both seeking backing for their respective positions. Allow Twitter content?

It seems certain that the House of Commons will not pass any Brexit deal that includes the current backstop. But the Irish government again today insisted it has to stay, with Mr Varadkar adding that he and the EU speak with one voice on this. On Monday, UK-EU talks begin (again) in Brussels - but there's no sign of a compromise coming down the tracks. Severalcabinet ministers have told the BBC a no-deal Brexit could lead to a voteon Irish unification. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster poured cold water on the prospect, saying that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement sets out ""criteria for a border poll, and it hasn't been met - therefore it will not be called"". On Thursday, Mrs May met EU leaders in Brussels in a bid to secure changes to the Irish border backstop in the Brexit agreement. European Commission President Jean-Claude Junckerruled out legally-binding changes to the backstop clausein the 585-page withdrawal document. But he said the EU would be open to adding words to the non-binding future relations document that goes with the withdrawal agreement. Other officials, including European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, have said the backstop is ""non-negotiable"". Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, Mr Varadkarheld meetings with top EU officialsabout the backstop and Ireland's plans for a no-deal outcome. He said that while he was ""open to further discussions"" with the UK government about post-Brexit relations, the legally-binding withdrawal agreement remained ""the best deal possible"". Speaking in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said ""time is running out"" to agree a deal, but that work needed to continue in order to ensure agreement was reached. ""When it comes to Brexit this is a negotiation that has the UK on one side and EU on the other,"" he said. ""Any negotiation can only happen with Ireland and the EU working together."" It is the insurance policy to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. The UK and EU made a commitment to avoid physical barriers or checks on the border, if no UK-EU trade deal is agreed before the Brexit transition period ends. Many people are concerned that the return of such checks would put the peace process at risk. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But there has been opposition to the backstop from the DUP and Brexiteer MPs, who believe its terms could keep the UK tied to EU rules in the long term. Last month, MPs backed an amendment in Parliament calling for ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the backstop. A group of Conservative MPshas held talks aimed at finding other Brexit optionsthat would avoid a hard border. The taoiseach travelled to Belfast to discuss the ""ongoing political impasse"", the Irish government said. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for more than two years. Mr Varadkar, whose trip came days afterTheresa May met the parties at Stormont to discuss her bid to make changes to the withdrawal agreement, said he travelled north to ""hear the perspective of the main parties"". DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party had a ""wide-ranging"" discussion with the taoiseach. Mrs Foster also said some people were engaging in ""project fear"" with the Brexit negotiations. DUP leader Arlene Foster (centre) speaking after meeting Leo Varadkar in Belfast The party's deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, said the backstop ""is the problem"", but would not specify which possible alternative his party is supporting. Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said her party would ""hold the taoiseach's feet to the fire"" when it comes to defending the backstop. She said he had given her an assurance he would remain firm with his stance. The party also said they have been calling repeatedly for a border poll, and that they had urged Mr Varadkar to begin planning for one. The Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) Brexit spokesperson Steve Aiken said there needed to be ""level-headed conversations"" and that the UUP had told the taoiseach how concerned they are by the terms of the Irish border backstop. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he had been watching recent events in Westminster ""with dismay"" The UUP said it is working on a number of alternative proposals it wants the UK and EU to consider. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said they had a very constructive and wide-ranging discussion with Mr Varadkar. ""It's fairly clear those this week suggesting there is some chance of the UK and Irish government doing a side deal without the EU are chasing after a no-way scenario,"" she said. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that it had been a ""good meeting"" and added that he and the taoiseach are ""on the same side of this argument"". ""We have been watching with some dismay what has been going on in Westminster over the last couple of months,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody within the Irish government or the European Commission sees any opportunity for diluting the protection of citizens in Northern Ireland."" Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker said their meeting was ""robust but constructive"" Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier will hold talks in Strasbourg on Monday, as the EU and UK Brexit negotiating teams discuss proposed changes to the deal. British sources say the talks will include discussion of the legally-binding withdrawal agreement, the BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said. An EU source said the further talks are an opportunity to listen to the UK's ideas. Please upgrade your browser Mrs May and Mr Juncker will meet again before the end of February, to review progress. The prime minister is expected to put the deal to a vote in the Commons towards the end of February. She said the plan must change if it is to win the support of MPs who urged her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop when rejecting the deal last month.

"It is believed the woman was found dead in her room at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst A 21-year-old officer cadet has been found dead in an apparent suicide at the Army's officer training college. The woman's body was believed to have been found in her room at the Sandhurst base, in Berkshire, on Wednesday. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed an ""incident"" occurred which resulted in the ""death of an officer cadet"" at the Royal Military Academy. Thames Valley Police said it was treating the death as unexplained but non-suspicious. A spokesman for the force added officers were called at 15:00 GMT on Wednesday and the woman's family had been informed. He added a file on the death was being prepared for a coroner. It is believed the woman had been involved in a minor disciplinary incident, which was being investigated. The Army had also provided her with mental health support following an event earlier in her training. The cadet was in her last term at the base after joining in May. The Royal Military Academy has trained the leaders of the Army - and other countries' armies - since 1812. Both the Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex graduated at Sandhurst, where all Army officers are trained. Training lasts for 44 weeks and the first five weeks are renowned for being one of the toughest experiences most people will ever go through. The Army website describes the college as ""one of the world's toughest and most revered military training academies"" and its motto is ""Serve to Lead"".

"Ms Bonafede says the experience was ""distressing"" An EE customer has said she was stalked by an ex-partner who worked at the firm, after he accessed her personal data without permission. Francesca Bonafede's number was switched to a new handset and her address and bank details were accessed. She said the company failed to take the data breach seriously and she had to involve police. EE ""sincerely apologised"" to Ms Bonafede, and said the employee no longer worked for the company. Ms Bonafede, from London, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she first contacted EE in February 2018 after her phone suddenly stopped working. After five days with no signal, she was told someone had visited an EE shop, requested a new Sim card and switched the account to a new handset. When the call centre handler read out the new address registered on the system, she recognised it as that of her ex-partner - who worked at one of the firm's High Street stores. It could have meant all texts and calls made to her during that period would have gone to him. ""The agent just didn't seem concerned at all,"" she said. ""I kept asking to speak to a manager who could give me more concrete information, and I was always told no-one was available."" Ms Bonafede does not know for sure why her ex-partner wanted to access her account data, but thinks it may have been related to official documents for which he was applying. She said the man called and texted her ""endless times"" in an attempt to persuade her to withdraw the complaint, and turned up unannounced with his friends on multiple occasions at her new address. ""It was really distressing and I had to go to the police and tell them what was happening,"" she said. ""They asked me repeatedly what EE was doing about all this and I just had to say, 'actually, I don't have a clue because they don't keep me updated'. ""The only way he could have known about my new address was through the data breach, because we broke up quite a long time before that."" Ms Bonafede's ex-partner was eventually arrested and given a harassment warning by police before the contact stopped. Despite being given assurances that EE would investigate, she said it was not until she started publically tweeting about the problem that the company started taking it seriously. ""I spent countless hours at the police station and missed days at work,"" she said. ""He had access to everything: my sort code, my account number, a photocopy of my driver's licence. ""It did put me at risk and I feel all customers should know how poorly something like this will be handled if there is a data breach on their account. ""It was a complete breach of trust. I don't trust the way they handled my data at all."" An EE spokesman said its own internal policies were not followed in this case. ""This matter has been dealt with internally and the employee involved no longer works for us,"" he said. ""While we worked quickly to protect Francesca, we apologise for not keeping her informed of the actions that we took during this time."" The Information Commissioner's Office said that under the Data Protection Act and GDPR it was ""illegal for individuals to access personal data without authorisation"". It said there was also an obligation for companies to ensure data was managed securely, and protect ""against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage"".

"A Labour MP has accused John McDonnell of ""letting his allies go after"" Luciana Berger after a row erupted over her future in the party. Ms Berger is facing a vote of no confidence from local members for criticising Jeremy Corbyn. Shadow chancellor Mr McDonnell said she should reject claims she supported a ""breakaway party"" to show members she was ""sticking with Labour"". But Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie said his response was ""ridiculous"". Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson also backed Ms Berger, telling the Commons she had ""our solidarity and... our support as she battles the bullying hatred from members of her own local party"". And Labour MP Ian Austin -who faced suspension after a row over the party's anti-Semitism code-told PoliticsHome,external: ""It's like something out of the Soviet Union's show trials where people were let off if they confessed their disloyalty and shouted 'Long Live Stalin'."" Ms Berger - an outspoken critic of the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and its stance on Brexit - said she would be not be ""distracted from fighting for the interests of my constituents"". An extraordinary meeting has been called in the Liverpool Wavertree constituency next week to discusstwo no confidence motions,external. The motions accuse Ms Berger of being against Mr Corbyn, saying: ""Instead of fighting for a Labour government, our MP is continually using the media to criticise the man we all want to be prime minister."" Votes of no confidence carry no official force within the Labour Party, but local activists could hold a ""trigger ballot"", where sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comers, ahead of the next general election. How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Anti-Semitic hate incidents 'rise by 16%' MP Smith 'considering' quitting Labour Ms Berger has been the target of online abuse and had a police escort at last year's Labour Party conference following death threats. Earlier this week, she joined other MPs at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Partycalling for details on the party's efforts to tackle anti-Semitism to be released. In a statement, Ms Berger said she believed her constituents would judge her on her record and skills in representing them in Parliament. She reiterated her ""long-held view that Brexit will be a disaster for the people of Liverpool Wavertree and the wider country"", saying she would ""not shy away from standing up"" for her Remain-voting constituency. And she said she had made ""no secret that, as a Jewish woman representing a city with a Jewish community, I have been deeply disturbed by the lack of response from Jeremy Corbyn as party leader and many in the wider leadership of the party to the anti-Semitism that stains our party"". Ms Berger added: ""Nothing will deter me from exposing anti-Semitism wherever it festers, including in the Labour Party where it is being wilfully ignored."" Mr Leslie - a former shadow chancellor himself - told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Mr McDonnell had ""demanded an oath of loyalty from her to those who are attacking her"", adding: ""I have never heard of such of a ridiculous situation. ""He should never have allowed his allies to have gone after Luciana like that in the first place. I have a feeling they will realise this is a terrible, terrible judgement."" Asked if he was considering whether to resign from the party, the MP did not rule it out, and said his ""patience is wearing pretty thin"" - namely around Labour's Brexit policy, as he supports a further referendum on whether to leave or remain in the EU. He said had ""serious worries"" about the direction of the leadership of the party, adding: ""Of course I have my issues with Jeremy Corbyn and the leadership, but the bigger point is there is a country and our constituents to put first here. ""If we keep getting told 'oh well get in line behind your party, shut up don't say anything, in fact, we're going to push you gradually out of the party for various reasons', don't expect us to just go quietly and say nothing. This is a serious moment."" Luciana Berger and Chris Leslie have campaigned together for a ""People's Vote"" on Brexit A number of Labour MPs tweeted their support for Ms Berger after the news of the no confidence motions broke on Thursday night, including former leader Ed Miliband and prominent backbencher Yvette Cooper. However, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr McDonnell said the motion came about because Ms Berger is ""associated"" withrumours of a new centrist party being formed. ""[The motion] is an expression of views,"" he said. ""If people are doing that because Luciana has stood up against [anti-Semitism] that is completely wrong. ""But from what I have seen on social media, it looks as though what has happened is Luciana has been in the media associated with a breakaway party and hasn't been clear that she rejects that."" He condemned a Facebook post from one of the local Labour members calling Ms Berger a ""disruptive Zionist"", saying it was ""completely wrong"". But the shadow chancellor said: ""My advice to Luciana is just tell people you are not supporting a breakaway party, you are sticking with the Labour Party, you are not jumping ship. ""And my advice to the Labour Party members there is if there are differences of opinion there, get together, talk about it and see how you can support the campaign alongside your local MP."" Other Labour MPs criticised Mr McDonnell's response, with Chuka Umunna tweeting to shadow cabinet members: ""Are we going to act? Defend a colleague in the face of this outrage?"" Ms Berger is not the first Labour MP to have faced a no confidence vote from their local parties over their views on Brexit. Others include Frank Field - who now represents Birkenhead as an independent MP - and Kate Hoey. Conservative Nick Boles also believes his constituency party in Grantham and Stamford islooking to oust him as a candidate at the next election. Meanwhile, Labour activists from the ""Another Europe is Possible"" group are targeting the constituencies of MPs who broke the whip and voted with the government over Theresa May's Brexit deal, calling it a ""moment of reckoning"". Seven Labour MPs backed an amendment supported by the government calling for ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop element of Mrs May's plan - which aims to avoid a hard border returning between Northern Ireland and Ireland. And a total of 26 MPs either abstained or voted against an amendment by Yvette Cooper, which was backed by the Labour leadership, which would have allowed for an extension of Article 50 - the mechanism seeing the UK leave the EU on 29 March - by up to nine months, with the aim of avoiding a no-deal. The left-wing group, founded last summer, will campaign in around 30 constituencies to ""apply pressure"" to the MPs to vote against Mrs May's deal. Gordon Watson, the Labour deputy leader of Rotherham Council, warned that the rebels could end up facing de-selection if they don't vote the deal down, adding: ""Failing to vote against the Tory deal is essentially propping up a government that is wrecking our communities. People are running out of patience.""

"Ms Bonafede says the experience was ""distressing"" An EE customer has said she was stalked by an ex-partner who worked at the firm, after he accessed her personal data without permission. Francesca Bonafede's number was switched to a new handset and her address and bank details were accessed. She said the company failed to take the data breach seriously and she had to involve police. EE ""sincerely apologised"" to Ms Bonafede, and said the employee no longer worked for the company. Ms Bonafede, from London, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she first contacted EE in February 2018 after her phone suddenly stopped working. After five days with no signal, she was told someone had visited an EE shop, requested a new Sim card and switched the account to a new handset. When the call centre handler read out the new address registered on the system, she recognised it as that of her ex-partner - who worked at one of the firm's High Street stores. It could have meant all texts and calls made to her during that period would have gone to him. ""The agent just didn't seem concerned at all,"" she said. ""I kept asking to speak to a manager who could give me more concrete information, and I was always told no-one was available."" Ms Bonafede does not know for sure why her ex-partner wanted to access her account data, but thinks it may have been related to official documents for which he was applying. She said the man called and texted her ""endless times"" in an attempt to persuade her to withdraw the complaint, and turned up unannounced with his friends on multiple occasions at her new address. ""It was really distressing and I had to go to the police and tell them what was happening,"" she said. ""They asked me repeatedly what EE was doing about all this and I just had to say, 'actually, I don't have a clue because they don't keep me updated'. ""The only way he could have known about my new address was through the data breach, because we broke up quite a long time before that."" Ms Bonafede's ex-partner was eventually arrested and given a harassment warning by police before the contact stopped. Despite being given assurances that EE would investigate, she said it was not until she started publically tweeting about the problem that the company started taking it seriously. ""I spent countless hours at the police station and missed days at work,"" she said. ""He had access to everything: my sort code, my account number, a photocopy of my driver's licence. ""It did put me at risk and I feel all customers should know how poorly something like this will be handled if there is a data breach on their account. ""It was a complete breach of trust. I don't trust the way they handled my data at all."" An EE spokesman said its own internal policies were not followed in this case. ""This matter has been dealt with internally and the employee involved no longer works for us,"" he said. ""While we worked quickly to protect Francesca, we apologise for not keeping her informed of the actions that we took during this time."" The Information Commissioner's Office said that under the Data Protection Act and GDPR it was ""illegal for individuals to access personal data without authorisation"". It said there was also an obligation for companies to ensure data was managed securely, and protect ""against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage"".

"Moving in or moving out? A million more young adults in the UK are living with their parents than were two decades ago, research suggests. A quarter of 20 to 34-year-olds do so, the study, by think tankCivitas,external, says. Since 1998, this has risen by 41% in London, where housing is most expensive, but by much less in cheaper areas like north-east England (14%) and Yorkshire and the Humber (17%). And for 23-year-olds across the UK, the proportion living with parents has risen from 37% in 1998 to 49% in 2017. Civitas editorial director Daniel Bentley said: ""As owner-occupation and social housing have each become more difficult to enter, hundreds of thousands of young adults have taken one look at the high rents in the private rented sector and decided to stay with their parents a bit longer instead."" Living with mum and dad at 30 Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids' He added that it was essential the government took this into account when forecasting future housing need. Primary school teacher Lauren, 29, from Chesterfield, moved back home after university. She and her partner have been trying to save up to buy a house but she told BBC 5Live: ""It just seems to be impossible"". ""We're hopefully looking [to buy] around this time next yearâ¦ it just seems to be getting put back and put back. ""It is frustrating because we don't want to be at home well into our thirties because it's not fair on our parents, and equally we want to start our lives together."" She says her mum and dad have never asked for any board, but that she gives ""something every month anyway"" as she feels it is the right thing to do. ""They're very good, they never hint at 'when you are you going to move out?""', she says. Aidan, 23, from Durham, is another primary school teacher who moved back home after university. He says: ""I could afford to live in my own house but I love it. ""It means I can save over half my wage for a house deposit and I get to spend time with my family after my mum died whilst I was at university."" The study also suggests youngsters who do move out are much less likely to live on their own than they were in the late 1990s. Single-person households have dropped to 30% in recent years, it says. This is in stark contrast to most of northern and western Europe, the report says, where single living has been increasing rapidly. In France and the Netherlands, 35% of households are single-person. And this rises to more than 40% in Germany and Denmark. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""For the last 30 years, governments of all stripes and types have failed to build enough homes, but we're turning that ship around. ""We still need to deliver more, better, faster, but more than 222,000 homes were delivered in 2017-18, the highest level in all but one of the last 31 years. ""We've also set out an ambitious package of measures to help build 300,000 properties a year by the mid-2020s. ""This includes over Â£44bn investment, rewriting the planning rules and giving local authorities the power to build a new generation of council houses. ""We are also supporting investment in build-to-rent homes to improve supply and affordability in the private rented sector.""

"Mr Bezos also owns the Washington Post newspaper The world's richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has accused the owner of a US gossip magazine of trying to blackmail him over private pictures. He said the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc (AMI), wanted him to stop investigating how they had obtained his private messages. Hours after Mr Bezos announced his divorce last month, the magazine published details, including private messages, of an extramarital affair. AMI says the company ""acted lawfully"". ""American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr Bezos. Further, at the time of the recent allegations made by Mr Bezos, it was in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him,"" the company said in a statement.

In a stunning blog post on Thursday, MrBezos posted an email he said had been sent to his intermediaries by AMI's representatives threatening to publish ""intimate photos"",externalof him and his lover, former TV host Lauren Sanchez. The billionaire, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, said AMI had wanted him to make a ""false public statement"" that the National Enquirer's coverage of him and his mistress was not politically motivated. Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie Bezos announced their separation last month According to emails included by Mr Bezos in his blog, an AMI lawyer proposed on Wednesday that the photos would not be published in return for a public statement ""affirming that [Bezos and his team] have no knowledge or basis"" to suspect such a motive. It comes after Mr Bezos' investigator suggested they had ""strong leads"" to suspect political reasons. ""Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail,"" wrote Mr Bezos, ""I've decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten.""

AMI said that they had been ""in good faith negotiations to resolve all matters with him"" when the allegations were made, and that the board ""has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims"". Mr Bezos said his ownership of the Washington Post was a ""complexifier"" for him because he had made enemies of ""certain powerful people"", including President Trump, who is a friend of AMI's boss, David Pecker. AMI recently admitted in court that it had co-ordinated with the Trump presidential campaign to pay a Playboy model $150,000 (Â£115,000) in hush money to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr Trump. Mr Bezos notes in his blog post how the publisher had confessed to the so-called ""catch and kill"" deal to bury Karen McDougal's politically embarrassing story. AMI's agreement to co-operate with federal authorities means it will not face criminal charges over the payments, Manhattan prosecutors announced in December.

"YouTube has decided to delete singer Austin Jones's channel, after he admitted exchanging sexually explicit images and videos with underage girls. The video-sharing site was criticised after it left the singer's videos online, despite him pleading guilty to charges in court. Other social networks were quick to remove his content but YouTube had decided not to act. It has now deleted the 26-year-old musician's channel. Jones was arrested in 2017 and charged with possession of indecent images of children. He had gained more than half a million subscribers on YouTube uploading cover versions of hit songs. But he was accused of exchanging sexually explicit images and videos with underage girls between 2010 and 2017. Court documents said he had conversations with six different 14 and 15-year-old girls. In one conversation, he is said to have told one of the teenagers that she needed to prove that she was ""his biggest fan"" by sending him videos of herself. He also asked young fans to record videos of themselves dancing sexually. Videos of Jones demonstrating how to ""twerk"" were exposed online. He pleaded guilty to the charges on 1 February and will be sentenced in May. Prosecutors asked for him to be taken immediately into custody, but the judge allowed him to remain free on bail so he can go for psychiatric counselling. YouTube said it took claims of sexual misconduct seriously. It also said it did remove content when a person was convicted of a crime ""in some cases"", particularly if the videos were related to the crime committed. The video-sharing site stopped Jones earning advertising revenue from his videos in 2017, when he was arrested.

""Beer before wine and you'll feel fine, wine before beer and you'll feel queer"" - many of us may swear by this time-honoured tip when ""mixing"" our drinks. But a new study has refuted the idea that the order we have alcoholic drinks in affects the severity of a hangover. To test the theory, they gave 90 students drinks in varying orders, switching the order a week later. The study found that how drunk people felt and whether they vomited provided the best indicators for the next day. People should pay attention to these ""red flags"" to lessen the chances of a bad hangover, scientists say. Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? No, you can't eat your way out of a hangover Drinking water 'no hangover cure' Are parents prepared for holiday hangovers? Many of us will have our own ideas about what prevents a hangover or makes it more bearable when it has started. But surprisingly little is understood about what exactly causes a hangover, and science has found no truly effective remedy. So to test the wisdom that the order in which we have alcoholic drinks affects how we feel the following day, scientists took 90 students aged between 19 and 40 from Witten/Herdecke University in Germany and split them into three groups: the first group drank around two-and-a-half pints of lager, followed by four large glasses of white wine the second had the same amounts of alcohol, but in reverse order the third had only beer or wine (a control group) A week later, participants in the first two groups switched around, while those in the control group changed to the other alcoholic drink. Participants were asked to judge how drunk they were at the end of each study day and were kept under medical supervision overnight. Changing the order of drinks made no significant difference to hangover scores, which were measured using a questionnaire, the study found. Science has found no truly effective remedy for a hangover It was also not possible to predict hangover intensity based on factors such as age, body weight, drinking habits and how often people usually got hangovers. However, there was a difference between the sexes, with women tending to have slightly worse hangovers than men. JÃ¶ran KÃ¶chling, from Witten/Herdecke University in Germany, who was the first author of the paper, said: ""The only reliable way of predicting how miserable you'll feel the next day is by how drunk you feel and whether you are sick. We should all pay attention to these red flags when drinking."" Though hangovers are not well understood by science, it is thought that causes include dehydration, our immune systems, and disturbances of our metabolism and hormones. Colourings and flavourings may also make hangovers worse, which might explain why drinks of the same concentration can cause a more severe hangover. One of the study's findings was that those who vomited were more likely to have a bad hangover. So does that mean that the so-called ""tactical chunder"" - where people deliberately purge themselves of alcohol to lessen a hangover or make themselves less drunk - is also a myth? Dr Kai Hensel, senior author of the study from the University of Cambridge, said ridding yourself of alcohol meant less of it would be absorbed into the body, which might make you feel better the next day. But Dr Hensel said he would still not recommend it. ""If you arrive at a point where you need to be sick you've probably passed the point of no return,"" he added. However, as unpleasant as they are, hangovers do serve a purpose - experts say they are nature's warning system to encourage us to drink less. Thestudy is published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.,external Once you have a hangover, there is no magic cure, although rehydrating, painkillers such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, and sugary foods are some of the things that may ease your discomfort. But there are steps you can take to reduce the chance of getting one in the first place, beyond the obvious - drinking less. These include: not drinking on an empty stomach not drinking dark-coloured drinks if you have found you are sensitive to them (they contain chemicals that irritate blood vessels and tissue in the brain and can make a hangover worse) drinking water or non-fizzy soft drinks in between each alcoholic drink drinking a pint or so of water before you go to sleep Source:NHS website,external Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

"Elderly people are so starved of information after their last local paper closed, an MP has said, they are calling his office for news updates. Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow in Essex, said many older people did not have access to online news and were left ""isolated"" when papers close down. ""I was amazed to have elderly residents ringing my office to say would I keep them informed of the news,"" he said. The loss of newspapers was a ""tragedy"" for local communities, he said. The absence of printed local newspapers had left many older people ""disenfranchised"" and cut off from finding out what was going on around them, said Mr Halfon. The Harlow Star, the last of three local papers in his constituency, had recently stopped printing, the former minister said, cutting an important thread holding the local community together. MP Robert Halfon says it is wrong to assume that everyone has easy access to online news ""I described it as a tragedy - and people accused me of hyperbole but I stand by my words,"" said the Conservative MP, who chairs the Education Select Committee. ""People are completely isolated. ""Especially if they're elderly, they've no idea what's going on, what's happening to the hospital, what the council are deciding, what the schools are doing, what their grandchildren are doing."" Automated checkouts 'miserable' for elderly shoppers Loneliness - the cost of the 'last taboo' If you were lonely would you talk to a stranger? There was a good local news website, Mr Halfon said, but ""you have to be online to look at it"". He warned against an assumption that everyone had the internet and online news at their fingertips. ""So many people do not have this,"" he said ""It's not just older people, because there are a lot of people who don't have access to a computer or the internet. ""They may have a phone but they can't afford the data package or they might only look at it now and then."" A quarter of local and regional papers have closed in the past decade Charities for the elderly have warned that older people can be particularly affected by the loss of local services, such as High Street shops, post offices, libraries and pubs. Nyree Ambarchian, who volunteers with the Contact the Elderly charity, said: ""I see first-hand that these issues are contributing to feelings of isolation. ""Slowly but surely, the local fabric of our communities is being eroded by things like the decline of local newspapers, which older people rely heavily on as a source of information and communication."" The charity's chief executive, Meryl Davies, said: ""We always imagine that the internet is everywhere but half of the older people in the UK have never been online."" A quarter of all regional and local newspapers have closed in the past decade, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. In response, the government has commissioned an independent review into finding a sustainable future for journalism, chaired by Dame Frances Cairncross, which is soon expected to report back. Information gathered for the review showed that income from advertising and circulation for newspapers had fallen sharply and that about 320 local papers had stopped publishing between 2007 and 2017. This reflected changes in technology and ""consumer behaviour"", says evidence for the review, with readers and advertising moving online and away from the printed press.

"The rise in life expectancy in Scotland is grinding to a halt, according to two new reports. In the decades after World War Two, there was a steady increase in the length of time men and women were expected to live. But over the last seven years Scotland has seen the slowest growth in life expectancy since at least the 1970s. New research hasalso revealed that,externaldeath rates have started rising in deprived areas of the country. Experts described it as a ""worrying trend"" and said that the figures were a ""warning light"" for the public's health. Scotland has the worst life expectancy for all UK countries. Life expectancy is an estimate of the average number of years a new born baby would live based on that area's age specific mortality rates. How long are you going to live? Girls born in Scotland between 2015 and 2017 can expect to live until they are 81.1, according to the National Records for Scotland (NRR). Life expectancy for boys born in the same period is 77 years. In England, life expectancy for girls is two years higher, and for boys it is 2.5 years higher. Girls born in Wales and Northern Ireland can expect to live until they are 82.3 years old. For boys the figures are also similar - 78.3 years in Wales and 78.4 years in Northern Ireland. But the NRR revealed last year thatScots' life expectancy had fallen for first time in 35 years. The reports,both published by NHS Health Scotland,external, paint a dismal picture of life expectancy in Scotland. They found that between 1992 and 2011, it took 5.5 years to add a year to a woman's life expectancy and four years for a man. But current trends suggest it will take nearly 21 years for women to start living an extra year, and 11.5 years for men. At the current rate, it will be 2058 before girls born in Scotland can expect to live as long as females in England could in 2016. For males, it will be 2045. Dr Gerry McCartney, head of the public health observatory at NHS Health Scotland, said: ""What we see here is a worrying trend. ""Life expectancy not only gives an indication of how long people are likely to live, but also serves as a 'warning light' for the public's health."" Between 2006 and 2011, death rates were lower across all of society - including in the most deprived areas. But the reports show from 2012 to 2017, death rates in poor areas increased by 1% - a figure which highlights inequalities in health between the richest and the poorest, according to the experts. Dr McCartney said this pattern gave ""cause for concern"". He also said that cuts to council budgets and pressures on key local services like social care could be behind the divide. Dr McCartney continued: ""There are likely to be a number of factors at play. The strongest candidates are recent policies that address recent economic setbacks which have reduced spending on benefits, squeezed incomes and trapped people in poverty - these may all have contributed. ""There have been some severe flu outbreaks in recent years which will have increased demands on services too. ""All of these factors - and more - are likely to be important in explaining the recent trends.  Whilst there is further work to do to clarify the causes, we know enough to recommend action now."" Charity boss Jim McCormick, associate director (Scotland) of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, has criticised the systems that ""sweep people into poverty"". He said: ""As a country we believe in protecting each other from harm. ""But today's findings show our record on tackling poverty and health inequalities in Scotland is unravelling. It cannot be right that someone's life expectancy is held back by where they live or how much money their family has. ""A rising tide of in-work poverty and high housing costs, combined with the benefits freeze, are making it harder for people to achieve a decent life. Dr McCartney called on national and local governments and employers and communities to work together on the issue. He added: ""Protecting budgets for services that determine our health (like social care, housing, social security benefits and so on) and ensuring they are provided according to need is crucial. ""Reducing poverty for all groups across the population and protecting the most vulnerable is also necessary.  And, we need to maximise the take-up of the flu vaccine amongst all those who are eligible. ""With a concerted effort, based on the best available evidence, I believe it is possible to reverse the trends we've highlighted, and create a fairer healthier Scotland for all."" Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick argued that it was ""difficult"" to pinpoint the cause of changing trends, but highlighted that the Scottish government has given local authorities a ""fair funding settlement"" despite cuts from Westminster. He said: ""The issues are complex and relate to an ageing population, inequalities, deprivation and poverty. This report suggests the pattern is similar in England and Wales, the USA, Iceland and Northern Ireland and that austerity is having a hugely adverse impact. ""We remain focussed on addressing the underlying causes that drive health inequalities."" UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped' Scots' life expectancy decreases How long are you going to live?

"Theresa May will travel to Dublin later to discuss the Brexit negotiations' main sticking point with her Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar. The PM is seeking legally binding changes to the backstop - the plan to avoid the return of Irish border checks should no UK-EU trade deal be in place. Both Mr Varadkar and the EU have repeatedly rejected calls for changes. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC he believed there was now a Commons majority for Labour's plan. The party is seeking a permanent UK-wide customs union with the European Union after Brexit, which would allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. ""The prime minister has to accept that the only way she will get something through Parliament is a compromise like this,"" he said. ""We believe that this is a deal that could fly within Parliament."" Meanwhile, a former civil service chief has called for delays to the withdrawal process to avoid a ""blindfold Brexit"". In a report published by the People's Vote campaign for a further EU referendum, Lord Kerslake said the UK was not ready to leave. ""Britain is divided, directionless and hurtling towards a legal deadline, with no idea where we will end up after we cross it,"" said the peer, who is now a Labour adviser. May to EU: Back changes to Brexit deal 'More talks' but no big change New ideas for the Brexit border backstop The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. However, Mrs May is still attempting to negotiate changes to the withdrawal agreement she struck with the EU last year but which has since been rejected by MPs. After meeting EU leaders in Brussels on Thursday, she said she had ""set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement"" to deal with MPs' concerns about the backstop. The backstop is an ""insurance policy"" designed to avoid the return of customs checkpoints at the Irish border after Brexit, which many fear could threaten the peace process. But many MPs object to the arrangement, which they say could leave the UK ""trapped"" under EU rules indefinitely. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I am clear that I am going to deliver Brexit, deliver it on time."" Mr Varadkar will travel to Belfast for talks with Northern Ireland's five main political parties before returning to Dublin to meet Mrs May over dinner. BBC Ireland correspondent Chris Page said: ""Ireland has consistently said it won't negotiate directly with Britain because this can be done only by the EU, so it's describing the meeting today as discussions, not negotiations."" Ahead of the meeting, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox will hold talks in the Irish capital with his Irish counterpart, Seamus Woulfe. Mr Cox has been leading work within Whitehall on providing either a time limit on the backstop or giving the UK an exit mechanism from it. Dublin has insisted the backstop cannot be time-limited if it is to prove effective. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, Downing Street has said ministers are looking ""with interest"" at a letter from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn setting out the terms on which he would offer his party's backing for Mrs May's deal. A senior No 10 source said the government was ""looking at those proposals but there are obviously very considerable points of difference that exist between us. ""The PM continues to believe an independent trade policy is one of the key advantages of Brexit."" The Labour leader's five demands include a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" aligned with the EU's customs rules but with an agreement ""that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington has described the latter point as ""wishful thinking"" but said he would meet Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer. EU's Verhofstadt welcomes Corbyn's offer What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? MP Smith 'considering' quitting Labour And while Mr Corbyn's Brexit stance has angered Labour members of the People's Vote campaign, other backbenchers said it opened the possibility of a closer relationship with the EU than Mrs May was currently proposing. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas told BBC Newsnight this would be favoured by British manufacturers. ""There's a natural majority in the House of Commons for a 'soft' Brexit but the prime minister to date has refused to put that natural majority together. What Jeremy has done today is write a letter which could make that happen,"" he said.

The princess has registered for the Thai Raksa Chart party, which is loyal to the controversial Shinawatra family that has dominated Thai politics for years. In an Instagram post on Friday, Princess Ubolratana reiterated that she had relinquished all her royal titles and that she now lives as a commoner. She said she wanted to exercise her rights as an ordinary citizen by offering her candidacy for prime minister. She said she would work with all sincerity and determination for the prosperity of all Thais. King Vajiralongkorn has not made any public comments about his sister's entry into politics. by the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok Thai politics has taken many bizarre turns in recent years. The submission of King Vajiralongkorn's elder sister as a prime ministerial candidate is one of the strangest, and turns politics on its head. If she is confirmed, it is clear that the strategy of the military faction which led the 2014 coup, in the name both of defending the monarchy and keeping pro-Thaksin forces out of government, is in pieces. The constitution it drafted still gives it lasting influence over future governments. But a royal prime minister could help end the protracted political conflict which has troubled Thailand for the past thirteen years, forcing a reconciliation between the competing factions that the military government failed to bring about. But it would also bring the royal family into the heart of government, undermining the official position that the monarchy stays above politics. Read more from Jonathan Supporters of the princess are flooding Thai social media with the hashtag #LongLiveSlender. According to local media outlet Khaosod,external, the hashtag is a reference to a television show the princess appeared in, in which she jokingly said would rather hear the phrase ""Long Live Slender"" - a reference to her appearance - rather than ""Long Live your Highness"". Others compared her to other powerful historical and fictional female leaders. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The March vote will be the first since current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in 2014, overthrowing the democratic government and ousting ex-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the younger sister of Thaksin Shinawatra. Both Mr Shinawatra and his sister currently live in self-imposed exile but still remain a powerful force in Thai politics, with many in the country remaining loyal to them In 2016, Thais voted to approve a new constitution created by the country's military leaders, which was designed to perpetuate military influence and block Mr Thaksin's allies from winning another election. But now that the princess has aligned herself with a party allied with Mr Thaksin, all bets are off the table, our correspondent says. Prayuth, a former general who seized power in a military coup, also announced on Friday that he would be running for prime minister in the current election. Thailand army's pivotal role in politics Why Thais backed a military-backed constitution He will be running as a candidate for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party. Thailand has some of the world's toughest royal defamation laws but technically the princess is not covered by them. However, the royal family is revered in Thailand and rarely criticised, so there are questions around whether any other candidate would want to challenge a member of the royal family. Thailand's lese-majeste law explained Who is Thaksin Shinawatra? Analysts also say the lese majeste laws have been interpreted broadly, meaning media outlets may be careful in their coverage. Thailand's military has a history of intervening in politics and has seized power 12 times since the end of the absolute monarchy - and the introduction of the first constitution - in 1932.

"Ms Bonafede says the experience was ""distressing"" An EE customer has said she was stalked by an ex-partner who worked at the firm, after he accessed her personal data without permission. Francesca Bonafede's number was switched to a new handset and her address and bank details were accessed. She said the company failed to take the data breach seriously and she had to involve police. EE ""sincerely apologised"" to Ms Bonafede, and said the employee no longer worked for the company. Ms Bonafede, from London, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she first contacted EE in February 2018 after her phone suddenly stopped working. After five days with no signal, she was told someone had visited an EE shop, requested a new Sim card and switched the account to a new handset. When the call centre handler read out the new address registered on the system, she recognised it as that of her ex-partner - who worked at one of the firm's High Street stores. It could have meant all texts and calls made to her during that period would have gone to him. ""The agent just didn't seem concerned at all,"" she said. ""I kept asking to speak to a manager who could give me more concrete information, and I was always told no-one was available."" Ms Bonafede does not know for sure why her ex-partner wanted to access her account data, but thinks it may have been related to official documents for which he was applying. She said the man called and texted her ""endless times"" in an attempt to persuade her to withdraw the complaint, and turned up unannounced with his friends on multiple occasions at her new address. ""It was really distressing and I had to go to the police and tell them what was happening,"" she said. ""They asked me repeatedly what EE was doing about all this and I just had to say, 'actually, I don't have a clue because they don't keep me updated'. ""The only way he could have known about my new address was through the data breach, because we broke up quite a long time before that."" Ms Bonafede's ex-partner was eventually arrested and given a harassment warning by police before the contact stopped. Despite being given assurances that EE would investigate, she said it was not until she started publically tweeting about the problem that the company started taking it seriously. ""I spent countless hours at the police station and missed days at work,"" she said. ""He had access to everything: my sort code, my account number, a photocopy of my driver's licence. ""It did put me at risk and I feel all customers should know how poorly something like this will be handled if there is a data breach on their account. ""It was a complete breach of trust. I don't trust the way they handled my data at all."" An EE spokesman said its own internal policies were not followed in this case. ""This matter has been dealt with internally and the employee involved no longer works for us,"" he said. ""While we worked quickly to protect Francesca, we apologise for not keeping her informed of the actions that we took during this time."" The Information Commissioner's Office said that under the Data Protection Act and GDPR it was ""illegal for individuals to access personal data without authorisation"". It said there was also an obligation for companies to ensure data was managed securely, and protect ""against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage"".

"Robinson stands beside a statue of himself Legendary baseball Hall of Famer Frank Robinson - the first African-American to manage a Major League Baseball team - has died aged 83, officials say. After winning Most Valuable Player awards in both US leagues - the only player in history to do so - he went on to manage Cleveland in 1975. With a total of 586, he is 10th on the list of the most home runs hit in a major league career. Robinson, who holds countless other records, died at home in California. Since his debut, more than half of all teams have had a black manager. Born in Beaumont, Texas, in 1935, Robinson got his start in Major League Baseball in 1956 - just nine years after Jackie Robinson broke the colour barrier by joining a professional team. In his first at-bat for Cleveland he hit a home run. Over his career, he coached the Baltimore Orioles, the San Francisco Giants and Montreal. Robinson became the first manager of the Washington Nationals after the team relocated from Montreal for the 2005 season.

"This video can not be played Instagram boss Adam Mosseri says he hopes new technology will help to flag images All graphic images of self-harm will be removed from Instagram, the head of the social media platform has told the BBC. The move comes after the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017,said Instagram had ""helped kill"" his daughter. Molly's family found she had been viewing graphic images of self-harm on the site prior to her death. Adam Mosseri said Instagram was trying to balance ""the need to act now and the need to act responsibly"". He added the site was ""not where we need to be on the issues of self-harm and suicide"". When asked by the BBC's Angus Crawford when the images would be removed, Mr Mosseri replied: ""As quickly as we can, responsibly."" Molly's father Ian Russell welcomed Instagram's commitment and said he hoped they would act swiftly to implement their plans. ""It is now time for other social media platforms to take action to recognise the responsibility they too have to their users if the internet is to become a safe place for young and vulnerable people,"" he added. Instagram boss in talks over self-harm content Girl, 12, was 'hooked' on self-harm images Facebook 'sorry' for distressing suicide posts Beyond Today podcast: How bad is social media for my mental health? How can governments regulate social media? Health Secretary Matt Hancock described the death of Molly Russell as ""every parents' modern nightmare"". He said it was right for Instagram to take down ""the most graphic material"" but added that ""we need to be led by what the clinicians and experts say need to be taken down"". Speaking after a meeting with social media companies as well as the Samaritans, Mr Hancock said he wanted to see a duty of care for all users of social media and that he was ""perfectly prepared to legislate if necessary"". Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the government would ""have to keep the situation very closely under review to make sure that these commitments are made real - and as swiftly as possible"". Instagram currently relies on users to report graphic images of self-harm, but Mr Mosseri said the company was looking at ways that technology could help solve the problem in the future. He added: ""Historically, we have allowed content related to self-harm that's 'admission' because people sometimes need to tell their story - but we haven't allowed anything that promoted self-harm. ""But, moving forward, we're going to change our policy to not allow any graphic images of self-harm."" This video can not be played After Molly Russell died, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account However, some self-harm images will be allowed to remain on the Facebook-owned site. ""I might have an image of a scar or say, 'I'm 30 days clean,' and that's an important way to tell my story,"" Mr Mosseri said. ""That kind of content can still live on the site but the next change is that it won't show up in any recommendation services so it will be harder to find. ""It won't be in search, it won't be in hashtags, it won't be in recommendations."" When asked if he would resign if graphic self-harm content was still on the platform in six months, Mr Mosseri, 36, said: ""I will certainly have a long thought about how well I am doing in the role that I'm in.""

"Elderly people are so starved of information after their last local paper closed, an MP has said, they are calling his office for news updates. Robert Halfon, MP for Harlow in Essex, said many older people did not have access to online news and were left ""isolated"" when papers close down. ""I was amazed to have elderly residents ringing my office to say would I keep them informed of the news,"" he said. The loss of newspapers was a ""tragedy"" for local communities, he said. The absence of printed local newspapers had left many older people ""disenfranchised"" and cut off from finding out what was going on around them, said Mr Halfon. The Harlow Star, the last of three local papers in his constituency, had recently stopped printing, the former minister said, cutting an important thread holding the local community together. MP Robert Halfon says it is wrong to assume that everyone has easy access to online news ""I described it as a tragedy - and people accused me of hyperbole but I stand by my words,"" said the Conservative MP, who chairs the Education Select Committee. ""People are completely isolated. ""Especially if they're elderly, they've no idea what's going on, what's happening to the hospital, what the council are deciding, what the schools are doing, what their grandchildren are doing."" Automated checkouts 'miserable' for elderly shoppers Loneliness - the cost of the 'last taboo' If you were lonely would you talk to a stranger? There was a good local news website, Mr Halfon said, but ""you have to be online to look at it"". He warned against an assumption that everyone had the internet and online news at their fingertips. ""So many people do not have this,"" he said ""It's not just older people, because there are a lot of people who don't have access to a computer or the internet. ""They may have a phone but they can't afford the data package or they might only look at it now and then."" A quarter of local and regional papers have closed in the past decade Charities for the elderly have warned that older people can be particularly affected by the loss of local services, such as High Street shops, post offices, libraries and pubs. Nyree Ambarchian, who volunteers with the Contact the Elderly charity, said: ""I see first-hand that these issues are contributing to feelings of isolation. ""Slowly but surely, the local fabric of our communities is being eroded by things like the decline of local newspapers, which older people rely heavily on as a source of information and communication."" The charity's chief executive, Meryl Davies, said: ""We always imagine that the internet is everywhere but half of the older people in the UK have never been online."" A quarter of all regional and local newspapers have closed in the past decade, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. In response, the government has commissioned an independent review into finding a sustainable future for journalism, chaired by Dame Frances Cairncross, which is soon expected to report back. Information gathered for the review showed that income from advertising and circulation for newspapers had fallen sharply and that about 320 local papers had stopped publishing between 2007 and 2017. This reflected changes in technology and ""consumer behaviour"", says evidence for the review, with readers and advertising moving online and away from the printed press.

"Prof David Bailey thinks Ford in Bridgend is one of the UK car plants most vulnerable to a no-deal Brexit Winning a contract to build a new 4x4 would not secure all the jobs at risk at Ford Bridgend, according to one of the UK's leading car industry experts. A decision is imminent on whether Ineos Automotive will build its new off-road vehicle in Portugal or Bridgend -where 1,000 jobsare under threat. But Aston University's Prof David Bailey said the contract would create no more than a few hundred jobs. Ford said ""the auto industry is undergoing rapid change"". Prof Bailey, who has written extensively on car industry policy and strategy and has acted as a special advisor to a cross-party group of MPs, said Ineos's plan was seen by some as a ""vanity project"". He said it was unclear how many cars would be produced under the potential deal or how profitable the model would be. Jaguar Land Rover, which previously manufactured the Defender model Ineos Automotive hopes to replace, never made much money from it. Jaguar Land Rover posts Â£3.4bn loss Prof Bailey said the production of electric motors was much more important to securing Ford Bridgend's future. In his view this would require the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU, and agreeing a trading relationship that is as close as possible to the single market. It would also require much more government support for the adoption of electric cars, he said, adding the current situation looked ""very worrying"" for the engine plant in Bridgend. Prof Bailey has acted as a special advisor to a cross-party group of MPs Prof Bailey described a no-deal Brexit as a ""catastrophe"" for the car industry, which he predicted would mean plant closures. He believes Ford in Bridgend, Vauxhall in Ellesmere Port - where many Welsh workers are employed - and Jaguar Land Rover in Castle Bromwich in the Midlands are the three sites which are most vulnerable in the event of no-deal. Ford in talks with Ineos over building new car in Bridgend Ford confirms nearly 400 job losses at Bridgend Bridgend MP Madeleine Moon agreed that a ""hard Brexit or any Brexit that does not keep the UK in the customs union will be devastating for the automotive industry, which is based on just on time processes"". She also called for the UK to remain ""ideally in the single market to maximise any future sales and development"". Unite Wales said it had consistently argued against a no-deal Brexit and it was currently working with Ford and the Welsh Government to try and find alternative investment for Bridgend and maximise employment at the plant. A UK government spokeswoman said it continued to engage with Ford on their European-wide restructuring plans and was working with industry to put the UK ""at the forefront of the next generation of new automotive vehicles and technologies"". She added that the best way to avoid a no-deal scenario was for Parliament to agree a deal and ""that is what we're focused on"". A spokesperson for Ford said the Bridgend engine plant ""has a long-established and successful record in the delivery of world-class engines. .They added: ""Together with our union partners, we continue to look at other high-technology opportunities for the future."" The Welsh Government economy secretary Ken Skates said: ""Whilst there are no immediate implications for the Bridgend Engine Plant, the Welsh Government will continue to work closely with Ford to protect the hundreds of highly skilled jobs at Bridgend and in its supply chain, as well as look for other high-technology opportunities for the site.""

"John Dingell served during the terms of 11 US presidents John Dingell, the longest serving congressman in US history, has died aged 92. ""He was a lion of the United States Congress and a loving son, father, husband, grandfather, and friend,"" the office of his wife Debbie Dingell said. The Michigan Democrat was a driving force behind many key liberal laws, notably health programmes. He was first elected in 1955, serving in the House of Representatives for the next 59 years. He retired in 2015. After leaving Congress, he closely followed all the twists and turns of US politics, often deploying Twitter to express his position on major issues. His last post was the day before his death, in which he wrote: ""You're not done with me just yet."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Dingell died peacefully on Thursday in his home in Dearborn, Michigan. ""It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of John David Dingell, Jr., former Michigan Congressman and longest-serving member of the United States Congress,""Debbie Dingell's office said in a statement,external. It said that Mr Dingell's wife, who was elected to the House in 2015 to succeed him, was at his side. ""He will be remembered for his decades of public service to the people of Southeast Michigan, his razor sharp wit, and a lifetime of dedication to improving the lives of all who walk this earth,"" the statement added. Mrs Dingell did not attend President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday, deciding to stay with her husband as his health deteriorated. Mr Trump ordered the US flag lowered to half-staff at the White House and all public and military buildings as ""a mark of respect for the memory and longstanding service"" of Mr Dingell. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had earlier said flags at the Capitol would fly at half-staff on Friday. The House also observed a moment of silence for Mr Dingell. Mr Dingell was 29 when he won a special election for his father's seat after the latter's sudden death in 1955. Former President Barack Obama has described him as one of the most influential legislators of all time. Mr Dingell served through the terms of 11 US presidents. Explaining his decision to retire in 2015, he said back then: ""I don't want people to be sorry for me. I don't want to be going out feet-first and I don't want to do less than an adequate job."" In 2014, John Dingell was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama He had said his single most important vote in Congress was for the sweeping 1964 Civil Rights Act, which among other provisions forbade discrimination in employment based on race and sex. The vote almost cost him the next election. He also played a key role in the creation of Medicare, the government-sponsored health programme for the elderly and disabled and was an early supporter of universal healthcare legislation, including President Obama's 2010 healthcare law. Mr Dingell's first brush with social media fame began with a 2014 viral tweet involving the Kardashians and an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mistake.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I am clear that I am going to deliver Brexit, deliver it on time."" Theresa May has told EU leaders she can get the Brexit deal through Parliament if they give her legally-binding changes to it. The UK prime minister - who also vowed to deliver Brexit ""on time"" - was speaking after a series of meetings with top EU officials in Brussels. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker again ruled out the kind of changes Mrs May wants to see. But the two sides agreed to further talks to break the deadlock. Mrs May said she had also spoken to European Council President Donald Tusk about hiscomments on Wednesday about there being a ""special place in hell""for those who campaigned for Brexit without a plan to deliver it safely. Laura Kuenssberg: More talks pledge helps May in perception war EU's Verhofstadt welcomes Corbyn's offer What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? Brexit: All you need to know She said Mr Tusk's language ""was not helpful"" and had ""caused widespread dismay in the United Kingdom"". Mrs May said she had told him he should be ""focusing"" on working with the UK to get a Brexit deal. Mr Tusk tweeted that there was ""no breakthrough in sight"" following his talks with the UK prime minister. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mrs May said she had ""set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement in order to deal with Parliament's concerns over the backstop"". That, ""together with the other work that we're doing on workers' rights and other issues, will deliver a stable majority in Parliament,"" she said. Mr Juncker ""underlined that the EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement"" in their talks, according to a joint statement released by the two sides. But he ""expressed his openness"" to adding words to the non-binding future relationship document - that also has to be backed by MPs - to be ""more ambitious in terms of content and speed"". Did anything change? Not that much. But for Downing Street, this has not been a pointless stop-off in the almost never-ending Brexit adventure. Because, while there hasn't been a breakthrough, the EU has agreed to more talks, which at least opens up the possibility of discussing the changes to the troubled backstop that has caused such political difficulty. It might not sound like much, but ""we can talk"", is at least a different message to ""this is over"" . Read more from Laura Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier will hold talks in Strasbourg on Monday, as the EU and UK Brexit negotiating teams discuss proposed changes to the deal. Downing Street said these talks would cover ""alternative arrangements"" for the Irish border, as called for by MPs in a vote last week. A spokeswoman said other UK ministers, such as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox could be involved. Mr Cox is ""working on working on possible ways in which legal texts could be drafted, that gave effect to the objective we want,"" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington told the BBC. Mrs May and Mr Juncker will meet again before the end of February, to review progress. The prime minister is expected to put the deal to a vote in the Commons towards the end of February. Jeremy Corbyn has listed five demands, including a UK-wide customs union Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister setting out his party's price for supporting a Brexit deal and to offer talks to secure ""a sensible agreement that can win the support of Parliament and bring the country together"". The Labour leader's five demands include a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" aligned with the EU's customs rules but with an agreement ""that includes a UK say on future EU trade deals"". Mr Corbyn also wants close alignment with the EU single market and ""dynamic alignment on rights and protections"" for workers so that UK standards do not fall behind those of the EU. He also proposes participation in EU agencies and funding programmes, and agreements on security and keeping access to the European Arrest Warrant. The letter does not mention previous demands that any deal must deliver the ""exact same benefits"" that membership of the single market and customs union currently does - effectively scrapping the party's ""six tests"" that had been its Brexit policy. The BBC's Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer would be meeting Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington to discuss the proposals. Owen Smith says he and others are thinking of quitting Labour But the move was met with dismay by Labour members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum, who accused Mr Corbyn of going back on his commitment, made at the party's conference, to back a public vote if he can't force a general election. Labour MP Owen Smith, who made a failed leadership bid in 2016, has told the BBC he and others were thinking of quitting the party over Mr Corbyn's Brexit stance. But Labour's Stephen Kinnock, who backs the ""Norway Plus"" model of a close economic partnership with the EU, welcomed Mr Corbyn's letter, tweeting: ""This can break the deadlock."" Mr Lidington said he and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay would be willing to discuss Labour's proposals with Sir Keir and other frontbenchers. But he said Labour's call to have a say in trade deals while being in a customs union with the EU was ""wishful thinking"", because Brussels had ruled it out. The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt welcomed Mr Corbyn's proposals, saying ""the broadest possible majority"" was needed for a Brexit deal in the UK and ""cross-party co-operation is the way forward"". It was also backed by Conservative MP Sir Oliver Letwin, who wants to see the UK in a Norway-style relationship with the EU after Brexit. Allow Twitter content?

In January, MPs overwhelmingly rejected the withdrawal deal that the government had negotiated with the EU, backing an amendment for the government to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop.

"Steve Perry, left, and climbing partner Andy Nisbet Two men who lost their lives in a Scottish Highlands mountaineering trip have been described as giants of the climbing world. Aberdeen-born Andy Nisbet and Inverness-based Steve Perry got into difficulty on Ben Hope on Tuesday. Their bodies were recovered from the mountainin Sutherland on Wednesday. Fellow climbers paid tribute to the pair, who were highly experienced and regarded, with one saying they were ""gargantuan characters"". Mr Nisbet, who helped establish 1,000 winter climbing routes, was lauded for his ""boundless enthusiasm"" and ""pioneering attitude"". Mr Perry, an accomplished hillwalker, mountain biker and climber, was originally from Lancaster and grew up in Todmorden in Yorkshire. It is believed that the men, who were regular climbing partners, had finished their ascent and fell while on the upper slopes of the 927m (3,041ft) Munro classed mountain. Both were highly experienced and Mr Nisbet's appearance and climbing style earned him the nicknames ""Honey Monster"" and ""The Droid"". At the 2014 Fort William Mountain Festival hereceived the Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture. Information gathered on climbs by the 65-year-old former Scottish Mountaineering Club president appeared in Scottish Mountaineering Club guidebooks. The bodies of the men were found by a Coastguard helicopter crew on the north-west side of the mountain Munros are Scottish mountains above 3,000ft (914.4 m). The name came from explorer Sir Hugh Munro who made it his mission to create a list of peaks greater than 3,000ft There are 282 Munros and they include Britain's highest mountain Ben Nevis and peaks in Skye. Ben Hope is Scotland's most northerly Munro. Andy Nisbet and Steve Perry are believed to have been establishing new winter climbing routes on the mountain. Munro bagging: How to climb Scotland's mountains Mr Perry, 47, was also a highly experienced climber. Mountaineer and broadcaster Cameron McNeish said he was ""utterly devastated"" at the news of the men's deaths. He told BBC Radio Scotland: ""They were both gargantuan characters."" Mr McNeish said climbers knew there would be risks tackling Scotland's mountains in winter and the pair would have ""managed the risks as well as they could"". This video can not be played Climbing âpioneerâ Andy Nisbet, one of two men who died on Ben Hope, spoke about his love for mountaineering in a 2014 interview. He added that ""sometimes accidents happen"". Giving his tribute, David Whalley, a former RAF mountain rescue team leader, said: ""I knew Andy very well. He was roughly the same age as me, but what an incredible mountaineer in every aspect. ""He was the most active prolific mountaineer that Scotland has ever produced. ""He has climbed over 1,000-plus new winter routes all over Scotland - his enthusiasm was dynamic. ""Never in the history of Scottish mountaineering has anyone been so prolific or enthusiastic and introduced so many to the mountains especially in winter."" Mountain rescue teams, the Coastguard and police were involved in an initial search for the men and the later recovery of their bodies A number of mountain rescue teams were involved in the Ben Hope operation Writing in a UK Climbing blog, climber Natalie Berry, who was winner of 2016's Scottish Youth Ambassador for Mountain Culture award, said the men had a ""strong"" climbing partnership. Mountaineering Scotland, an organisation representing outdoor pursuits enthusiasts, said it was ""shocked and saddened"" to learn of the climbers' deaths. A spokesman said: ""Andy was popular and well respected in the Scottish climbing scene with a vast knowledge and experience of Scotland's mountains. ""He was a prolific climber of new routes and his successful partnership with Steve had resulted in a number of first ascents on Ben Hope in recent years. Andy Nisbet in an image released at the time he won Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture ""Steve Perry was also a well-known mountaineer, who had completed an on-foot round of the Munros in the winter of 2005-06 and was a keen climber in both summer and winter, who listed new routing in winter Scotland as one of his favourite climbing experiences. ""Their deaths are a huge loss to the mountaineering community in Scotland and, in particular, we send our condolences to family and friends of both Andy and Steve."" Mountaineering Scotland also paid tribute to mountain rescue teams and the Coastguard who were involved in responding to the accident. Assynt Mountain Rescue Team was supported by Stornoway and Inverness Coastguard helicopter crews, police and also Dundonnell and Lossiemouth mountain rescue teams in recovering the climbers' bodies. Rescue teams and the Coastguard had earlier been involved in a search for the two men. The Assynt team said: ""Our sincere condolences and thoughts go out to all the family and friends, many of whom are involved in mountain rescue.""

"Artwork: Hayabusa2 arrived at the asteroid Ryugu in June last year The Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa 2 will attempt to collect a sample of rock from an asteroid on 22 February, the country's space agency (Jaxa) says. Hayabusa 2 reached asteroid Ryugu in June 2018 after a three-and-a-half-year journey from Earth. It will descend to the surface and attempt to grab the sample from a pre-chosen site. The spacecraft will return to Earth with the samples in 2020 after its exploration of Ryugu is complete. Jaxa officials had to delay the touchdown last October, after they found the asteroid's surface was more rugged than expected. During sample collection, the spacecraft will approach the 1km-wide asteroid with an instrument called the sampler horn. On touchdown, a 5g projectile made of the metal tantalum is fired into the rocky surface at 300m/s. The particles kicked up by the impact will be caught by a specially-designed section of the sampler horn. Hayabusa 2 will begin descending to the surface on 21 February (local time) and should touch down around 08:00 on the 22nd. Japanese spacecraft reaches cosmic 'diamond' Japanese rovers touch down on asteroid The asteroid 162173 Ryugu is thought to be of a particularly primitive type In September, Hayabusa 2 deployed two robotic ""hoppers"" that propelled themselves across the surface of Ryugu, sending back images and other data. Then, in October, the ""mothership"" despatched a French-German instrument package called Mascot to the surface. Later this year, perhaps in March or April, Jaxa plans to detonate an explosive charge that will punch a crater into the surface of Ryugu. Hayabusa-2 would then descend into the crater to collect fresh samples of material that have not been altered by aeons of exposure to the environment of space. New asteroid rover images released Japan puts another 'rover' on asteroid Ryugu belongs to a particularly primitive type of asteroid, and is therefore a relic left over from the early days of our Solar System. The sample collection operations should allow scientists in labs on Earth to study the material, shedding light on the origin and evolution of our own planet. The 30 billion-yen mission is the successor to another Jaxa asteroid explorer, Hayabusa, which means ""peregrine falcon"" in Japanese. This earlier mission was launched in 2003 and reached the asteroid Itokawa in 2005.
