"Events were held to mark the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd His dying moments were filmed and watched by millions, sparking global protests about policing and racial justice George's brother Philonise said a White House meeting with Biden went well 'The Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage' US President Joe Biden said The impact of Floyd's death was felt in the worlds of politics, business, sport and entertainment in dozens of countries 'More people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago,' says Barack Obama The anniversary was marked in UK cities including Birmingham, Edinburgh, London, Manchester and Swansea Gunfire briefly interrupted the commemorations near the spot where Floyd died but no one was hurt Ex-policeman Derek Chauvin, whose knee was on Floyd's neck area, has been jailed for murder Edited by Ritu Prasad and Marianna Brady That wraps up our coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's death. His murder by a police officer last year sparked global protests and altered perspectives on race and policing.  Our live coverage was provided by Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich, Max Matza and Mal Sirat Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Cortez Rice is wearing a walking cast: healing a bone bruised by a tear gas cannister in a recent protest, he says. But that doesnât slow him down. He hasnât slowed down since the death of his âbeloved friendâ George Floyd, someone he calls a role model. Rice believes that pressure on the streets helped secure a guilty verdict for Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of murdering Floyd. Now heâs focusing on using the law to change the way policing is done. He says he joined the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) so he could familiarise himself with police reform bills. He laughs when I suggest heâs giving himself a legal education, but agrees: âNow thatâs a big changeâ from last year. Many lives have been changed, even if wider reforms have been slow to follow. âWeâve just got to keep going,â says Rice. And at a rally marking the anniversary, he steps up with his cast to carry a box representing George Floydâs coffin, a symbolic pallbearer in a never-ending funeral. ""He's a genuine guy,"" says Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, after leaving a meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris. Floyd's daughter Gianna ""had an absolute ball"", says a lawyer for the family. ""Say his name,"" she said, as the family raised their fists and called out in unison: ""George Floyd."" Meanwhile, Floyd's sister Bridgett denounced Biden for ""breaking a promise"" to pass a police reform bill by today. She spoke at a rally in Minneapolis surrounded by the mayor and other city officials. This video can not be played George Floyd's family speaks on the White House lawn Reality Check In 1963, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr led the March on Washington to demand racial and economic justice. So what's changed since then? The black-white wealth gap was larger in 2019 than it was in 1983, when black family wealth data was first collected. There hasn't been much movement in the disparity between the wages of black and white Americans either. But there have been some upward trends: more African Americans had completed four years of higher education by 2019 than ever before - 26% compared with just 4% in 1962. We've looked at six measures, including poverty, education, wages and congressional representation to answer the question:How far have African Americans come since the 1960s? Miriam Walker-KhanBBC Sport US football player Colin Kaepernick started kneeling to protest racial inequity in 2016 Almost a year on from the death of George Floyd, the world of sport has seen hundreds, if not thousands of athletes protesting against racial injustice on a global scale. But on 22 April 2021, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that acts of protest - such as taking a knee - will continue to be banned at the Olympic Games, which begin in July. During a 10-month consultation process, the IOC asked 3,547 athletes whether its 'Rule 50' - which bans demonstrations - should change. A total of 67% said they wanted to keep the Olympic podium free of protests and 70% were keen to avoid on-field demonstrations. Gwen Berry, who competes in the hammer throw for the USA, responded with a powerful post on Instagram. ""I wished that Botham Jean was afforded that same choice when he was murdered in his home,"" she wrote, referring to a black man killed by an off-duty Dallas police officer who mistook his apartment for her own. ""Not to mention the countless individuals whose names are added to a growing list. This is my reason for not wavering. I will not shut up and throw."" Read the full story:How sport joined the fight for change Koralie BarrauBBC News A mourner at Floyd's funeral wears a shirt saying ""tired"" Black Americans are exhausted, and the anniversary of George Floyd's murder is a reminder that with every police killing of a black person, another cycle of grief and pain is re-triggered. Over the course of the Derek Chauvin trial, I spoke to many activists in the Minneapolis area about this constant exhaustion and how it takes a toll on their mental health continuously reliving past traumas. For them, the death of George Floyd was one of the most brutal images of police brutality and racism, but ultimately is part of a policing system that has always targeted predominately black and brown individuals. During the trial of Derek Chauvin, this exhaustion was on display at George Floyd Square, where Floyd was killed, with signs and graffiti saying: âIâm so tiredâ. One activist, DA Bullock, told us: ""We canât have another George Floyd in a year, two years, three yearsâ¦Because I can't go through another death, like that. It takes too much out of us, it really does harm us as individuals and harms us as a community."" For Deborah Watts, the cousin of Emmet Till - a black boy who was lynched over 60 years ago - time alone does not heal her wounds. She says that with every police killing, her wound is reopened again. Much of her work in Minneapolis seeks to work with families who have lost loved ones in encounters with police. Nearly everyone we spoke to in the city said that true justice equates to a fundamental change in the judicial system. They believe that despite this exhaustion they feel, they must continue to fight for justice, equality, and accountability. This video can not be played Why the Chauvin trial âexhaustsâ black America Kristen Clarke is now overseeing an investigation into Minneapolis police The US Senate has voted to confirm Kristen Clarke as the first black woman to run the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The vote passed narrowly on Tuesday afternoon with only one Republican vote (Maine's Susan Collins). Clarke is a first-generation American whose parents came to the US from Jamaica. She holds degrees from Columbia and Harvard universities. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the timing of her confirmation ""particularly poignant and appropriate"" given today's anniversary. The civil rights department that she now heads is already investigating the Minneapolis Police Department after Floyd's killer was convicted last month. They are also investigating the police in Louisville, Kentucky, for the killing ofBreonna Taylor. Reality Check The figures that are available for incidents in which the police shoot and kill people show that for African-Americans, there's a much higher chance of being fatally shot relative to their overall numbers in the US population. According to the Washington Postâs police shootings database, although African-Americans make up less than 14% of the population, they accounted for almost 24% of over 6,000 fatal shootings by the police since 2015. Further research shows the rate that police fatally shoot unarmed black people in the US is more than three times as high as it is for white people. Other studies have shown that black people are more likely to be pulled over in traffic stops by police. One of the most recent, a 2020 study by Stanford University, analysed 100m traffic stops by police departments across the US and found black drivers were about 20% more likely to be stopped than white drivers. African-Americans are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drugs are used at similar levels. Overall, African-Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans and twice the rate of Hispanic-Americans, according to the latest data. These rates have dropped for African-Americans over the last decade, but they still make up more of the prison population than any other race.

Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News James Bryd Jr's murder led to the creation of a federal hate crime law Twenty-two years before the death of George Floyd, another brutal murder of a black man shocked the conscience of America and forced a racial reckoning. WARNING THIS STORY CONTAINS DISTRESSING DESCRIPTIONS. James Byrd Jr was killed by three white supremacists who drove him down a dark country road and beat him. Then they chained him alive to a pickup truck and dragged his body for three miles - until he was decapitated. Two of the murderers were executed for the crime. The other is serving a life sentence. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed a federal hate crime bill into law which is named after James Byrd Jr (as well as Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in 1998 because he was gay). My colleague AngÃ©lica Casas and I visited the Texas town of Jasper this month to find out how Byrd's family is coping two decades after such an unspeakable crime. His daughter, Jamie, told us how she had reacted to his murder. ""I was numb, I was in denial. I was 16-years-old, so love and forgiveness were no part of my thought process at that moment."" Jamie says she still feels angry but chooses to channel it into positive actions. Now a police officer in Houston, she draws a connection between the murders of her father and George Floyd. ""My dad did not get killed at the hands of a police officer, but in today's world, that is what we're seeing. ""We're seeing a lot of brutality by the hands of officers, unfortunately."" Byrd's daughter, Jamie, says Floyd's killing deeply impacted her She says it was a challenge to put on the uniform after George Floyd's murder as protests against police brutality and racism spread across the world. Ultimately, she decided it was more important to keep serving her community. ""I want to be that officer, just be there in solidarity, and say 'hey, I know what you're going through'. You can watch our film about James Byrd Jr on the BBC News website on Friday. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The latest clashes between Israel and the Palestinians have revealed exactly how much the political centre of gravity in the Democratic Party has moved on the conflict in recent years, and especially after civil rights protests sparked by George Floydâs murder. In a recent column, Jewish-American Senator Bernie Sanders paid tribute to the rise of ""a new generation of activists"". ""We saw these activists in American streets last summer in the wake of the murder of George Floyd,"" he writes. ""We see them in Israel. We see them in the Palestinian territories."" His final words lift a direct line from the Black Lives Matter movement: ""Palestinian lives matter"". Sanders is noting what has become obvious during clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians over the past two weeks. Americans who found their political voice during last summer's activism in US cities are now turning their focus, and their rhetoric, on what they see as similar unchecked oppression in the Middle East. Reality Check More people are killed by police in the US than in any other developed country. Among these killings, black Americans are killed at a higher rate compared with the percentage of the population they represent. Most are shot dead. Part of this is to do with gun culture, but there are also growing calls for improved police training to reduce the use of lethal force. On average, US officers spend around 21 weeks in training before they go on patrol. That is far less than in most other developed countries, according to a report by the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform (ICJTR).  US police academies also spend far more time on firearm training than on de-escalating a situation - 71 hours against 21, on average. Prof Maria Haberfeld at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says: ""This is why you see officers very rapidly escalating from initial communication to the actual physical use of force, because this is how they train."" BBC Reality Check has looked into how the training requirements in the US compare with other countries. Read more here: How US police training compares with the rest of the world Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Activists continue to demand root and branch change of what they say is a brutal, racist policing system. But this past year has also been hard on police. Mylan Masson, a former Minneapolis police trainer, says sheâs never seen morale so low. The department has lost more than 200 officers to early retirement, transfer or medical leave for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). There is confusion over competing proposals for reform, and a backlash from citizens. ""The officers don't know what the community feels about them,â she said. âWhat should we be doing? Everything we do, is it going to be judged? Is everything we're doing going to be put through scrutiny that we've never had before? We have things that we need to discuss with the community and make them feel comfortable with us again.â The department has come under federal investigation and Mylan says there are problems that need to be fixed. But the focus on bad cops is wearing. âWe try to... do the best we can and all of a sudden you see something else just horrible happen,â she says. âAnd it's traumatic.â Joe Biden speaks at the White House earlier this month We heard moments ago from George Floyd's family about their meeting with the president and vice-president, and now Biden's released his own response, praising the family for their ""extraordinary courage"". Floyd's murder ""launched a summer of protests"", Biden said in a statement, which ""peacefully unified people of every race and generation to collectively say enough of the senseless killings"". Biden also called for action, writing that real change will be delivered only when there is accountability in the nation's law enforcement. ""The negotiations on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in Congress are ongoing,"" he said. ""It's my hope that they will get a bill to my desk quickly."" ""We have to act,"" he said. George Floyd's family spoke to reporters briefly after a private hour-long meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris. In quick succession, several members of Floyd's family made comments, many of them thanking Biden and Harris for the meeting. His brother Rodney Floyd said the family was grateful for the concern the president and vice-president showed. ""Being here today is an honour,"" said another brother, Terrence. ""I feel it was a very productive conversation and I'm grateful for it."" The family also addressed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which they called for Congress to pass. Biden has so far failed to push the bill through, missing his own deadline of today. The president is waiting for the ""right"" bill to be passed, Floyd's nephew Brandon said, instead of rushing one through. ""We just want this George Floyd Policing Act to be passed in the future,"" said brother Philonise Floyd. ""If you can make federal laws to protect the bird, the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of colour."" There was also a moment of levity during the meeting, the family said. Joe Biden interacted and played with Gianna Floyd, George's 7-year-old daughter. ""She had an absolute ball,"" a family lawyer said. According to a recent NPR poll, 51% of Americans approve of Democratic President Joe Bidenâs handling of race relations. But the numbers break down as expected along party lines. Among Democrats, about 85% say they approve. About half of independents and only 14% of Republicans approve. About one-third of Americans say they think things will improve under Biden, while another third say race relations will stay the same. Thatâs an uptick from Donald Trumpâs presidency when a majority of Americans said they expected race relations to worsen. Family members of George Floyd are outside the White House now, speaking to reporters after a private meeting with President Joe Biden. The meeting was ""great"" said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother. Bridgett Floyd speaks at a rally this past summer in Washington While several of her family members are in Washington to meet with President Biden, George Floyd's sister Bridgett stayed in Minneapolis, where she is attending a rally for her brother. She said she had passed on the White House meeting because the president has not yet managed to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act through Congress - which Biden had said would be done by today.Democrats first proposed the police reform bill last June. ""He broke his promise, but I am going to give him a couple more weeks,"" Bridgett said, according to local media. And she added this message for the president: ""Get your people in order."" Martin Luther King III said police brutality was continuing (file photo) Martin Luther King III, human rights advocate and son of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr, has told the BBC he fears that not enough has changed one year on from George Floyd's murder. ""This is a marathon,"" he says. ""People's emotions around the world were evoked to see a public servant whose job is to
protect and serve, being judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" he adds, referring to the actions of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. ""Although
one might say a year later it has subsided, the fact of the matter is that
there are still demonstrations going on, and part of it is because [police]
shootings have not stopped. ""So the incidents continue, there has been no
movement or transition"". Welcome to our live coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's murder. President Joe Bidenis currently meeting with members ofFloyd's family. Earlier today, the president wrote on Twitter that they had shown ""extraordinary courage"" in the year since George Floyd died. Demonstrations and marches are happening across the country to commemorate the day. People have taken to the streets inNew York, Los Angeles, PortlandandHouston. And much like the demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death last year, today's memorial is global. Demonstrators have gathered inEdinburgh, GlasgowandLondon,andCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaumarked the day, calling Floyd's death a ""tragedy"" and a reminder that anti-black racism and injustice persists. The memorial in Minneapolis at George Floyd Square was briefly interrupted by reports ofshots firedthough there was only one report of a possible injury from the incident. Stay with us as we bring you more updates from the day. Medical student Mikaela Loach read a poem at the vigil in Edinburgh Here's more from the vigil we reported has been taking place outside the Scottish Parliament
at Holyrood in Edinburgh. Medical
student and activist Mikaela Loach wrote and read a poem at the gathering. It included the lines: ""I want to be me, fully. To be loved, fully. To breathe in
deep, to fill my lungs, feels like an act of rebellion in a world that wants me
to suffocate."" Loach told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that writing helps me take the stuff that is
bubbling up within and express it. ""The
stress of living in a world that doesnât want you to exist in the fullness of
who you are, that harms you."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99205047

The president is waiting for the ""right"" bill to be passed, Floyd's nephew Brandon said, instead of rushing one through. ""We just want this George Floyd Policing Act to be passed in the future,"" said brother Philonise Floyd. ""If you can make federal laws to protect the bird, the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of colour."" There was also a moment of levity during the meeting, the family said. Joe Biden interacted and played with Gianna Floyd, George's 7-year-old daughter. ""She had an absolute ball,"" a family lawyer said. According to a recent NPR poll, 51% of Americans approve of Democratic President Joe Bidenâs handling of race relations. But the numbers break down as expected along party lines. Among Democrats, about 85% say they approve. About half of independents and only 14% of Republicans approve. About one-third of Americans say they think things will improve under Biden, while another third say race relations will stay the same. Thatâs an uptick from Donald Trumpâs presidency when a majority of Americans said they expected race relations to worsen. Family members of George Floyd are outside the White House now, speaking to reporters after a private meeting with President Joe Biden. The meeting was ""great"" said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother. Bridgett Floyd speaks at a rally this past summer in Washington While several of her family members are in Washington to meet with President Biden, George Floyd's sister Bridgett stayed in Minneapolis, where she is attending a rally for her brother. She said she had passed on the White House meeting because the president has not yet managed to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act through Congress - which Biden had said would be done by today.Democrats first proposed the police reform bill last June. ""He broke his promise, but I am going to give him a couple more weeks,"" Bridgett said, according to local media. And she added this message for the president: ""Get your people in order."" Martin Luther King III said police brutality was continuing (file photo) Martin Luther King III, human rights advocate and son of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr, has told the BBC he fears that not enough has changed one year on from George Floyd's murder. ""This is a marathon,"" he says. ""People's emotions around the world were evoked to see a public servant whose job is to
protect and serve, being judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" he adds, referring to the actions of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. ""Although
one might say a year later it has subsided, the fact of the matter is that
there are still demonstrations going on, and part of it is because [police]
shootings have not stopped. ""So the incidents continue, there has been no
movement or transition"". Welcome to our live coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's murder. President Joe Bidenis currently meeting with members ofFloyd's family. Earlier today, the president wrote on Twitter that they had shown ""extraordinary courage"" in the year since George Floyd died. Demonstrations and marches are happening across the country to commemorate the day. People have taken to the streets inNew York, Los Angeles, PortlandandHouston. And much like the demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death last year, today's memorial is global. Demonstrators have gathered inEdinburgh, GlasgowandLondon,andCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaumarked the day, calling Floyd's death a ""tragedy"" and a reminder that anti-black racism and injustice persists. The memorial in Minneapolis at George Floyd Square was briefly interrupted by reports ofshots firedthough there was only one report of a possible injury from the incident. Stay with us as we bring you more updates from the day.

to suffocate."" Loach told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that writing helps me take the stuff that is

"Events were held to mark the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd His dying moments were filmed and watched by millions, sparking global protests about policing and racial justice George's brother Philonise said a White House meeting with Biden went well 'The Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage' US President Joe Biden said The impact of Floyd's death was felt in the worlds of politics, business, sport and entertainment in dozens of countries 'More people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago,' says Barack Obama The anniversary was marked in UK cities including Birmingham, Edinburgh, London, Manchester and Swansea Gunfire briefly interrupted the commemorations near the spot where Floyd died but no one was hurt Ex-policeman Derek Chauvin, whose knee was on Floyd's neck area, has been jailed for murder Edited by Ritu Prasad and Marianna Brady That wraps up our coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's death. His murder by a police officer last year sparked global protests and altered perspectives on race and policing.  Our live coverage was provided by Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich, Max Matza and Mal Sirat Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Cortez Rice is wearing a walking cast: healing a bone bruised by a tear gas cannister in a recent protest, he says. But that doesnât slow him down. He hasnât slowed down since the death of his âbeloved friendâ George Floyd, someone he calls a role model. Rice believes that pressure on the streets helped secure a guilty verdict for Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of murdering Floyd. Now heâs focusing on using the law to change the way policing is done. He says he joined the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) so he could familiarise himself with police reform bills. He laughs when I suggest heâs giving himself a legal education, but agrees: âNow thatâs a big changeâ from last year. Many lives have been changed, even if wider reforms have been slow to follow. âWeâve just got to keep going,â says Rice. And at a rally marking the anniversary, he steps up with his cast to carry a box representing George Floydâs coffin, a symbolic pallbearer in a never-ending funeral. ""He's a genuine guy,"" says Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, after leaving a meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris. Floyd's daughter Gianna ""had an absolute ball"", says a lawyer for the family. ""Say his name,"" she said, as the family raised their fists and called out in unison: ""George Floyd."" Meanwhile, Floyd's sister Bridgett denounced Biden for ""breaking a promise"" to pass a police reform bill by today. She spoke at a rally in Minneapolis surrounded by the mayor and other city officials. This video can not be played George Floyd's family speaks on the White House lawn Reality Check In 1963, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr led the March on Washington to demand racial and economic justice. So what's changed since then? The black-white wealth gap was larger in 2019 than it was in 1983, when black family wealth data was first collected. There hasn't been much movement in the disparity between the wages of black and white Americans either. But there have been some upward trends: more African Americans had completed four years of higher education by 2019 than ever before - 26% compared with just 4% in 1962. We've looked at six measures, including poverty, education, wages and congressional representation to answer the question:How far have African Americans come since the 1960s? Miriam Walker-KhanBBC Sport US football player Colin Kaepernick started kneeling to protest racial inequity in 2016 Almost a year on from the death of George Floyd, the world of sport has seen hundreds, if not thousands of athletes protesting against racial injustice on a global scale. But on 22 April 2021, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that acts of protest - such as taking a knee - will continue to be banned at the Olympic Games, which begin in July. During a 10-month consultation process, the IOC asked 3,547 athletes whether its 'Rule 50' - which bans demonstrations - should change. A total of 67% said they wanted to keep the Olympic podium free of protests and 70% were keen to avoid on-field demonstrations. Gwen Berry, who competes in the hammer throw for the USA, responded with a powerful post on Instagram. ""I wished that Botham Jean was afforded that same choice when he was murdered in his home,"" she wrote, referring to a black man killed by an off-duty Dallas police officer who mistook his apartment for her own. ""Not to mention the countless individuals whose names are added to a growing list. This is my reason for not wavering. I will not shut up and throw."" Read the full story:How sport joined the fight for change Koralie BarrauBBC News A mourner at Floyd's funeral wears a shirt saying ""tired"" Black Americans are exhausted, and the anniversary of George Floyd's murder is a reminder that with every police killing of a black person, another cycle of grief and pain is re-triggered. Over the course of the Derek Chauvin trial, I spoke to many activists in the Minneapolis area about this constant exhaustion and how it takes a toll on their mental health continuously reliving past traumas. For them, the death of George Floyd was one of the most brutal images of police brutality and racism, but ultimately is part of a policing system that has always targeted predominately black and brown individuals. During the trial of Derek Chauvin, this exhaustion was on display at George Floyd Square, where Floyd was killed, with signs and graffiti saying: âIâm so tiredâ. One activist, DA Bullock, told us: ""We canât have another George Floyd in a year, two years, three yearsâ¦Because I can't go through another death, like that. It takes too much out of us, it really does harm us as individuals and harms us as a community."" For Deborah Watts, the cousin of Emmet Till - a black boy who was lynched over 60 years ago - time alone does not heal her wounds. She says that with every police killing, her wound is reopened again. Much of her work in Minneapolis seeks to work with families who have lost loved ones in encounters with police. Nearly everyone we spoke to in the city said that true justice equates to a fundamental change in the judicial system. They believe that despite this exhaustion they feel, they must continue to fight for justice, equality, and accountability. This video can not be played Why the Chauvin trial âexhaustsâ black America Kristen Clarke is now overseeing an investigation into Minneapolis police The US Senate has voted to confirm Kristen Clarke as the first black woman to run the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The vote passed narrowly on Tuesday afternoon with only one Republican vote (Maine's Susan Collins). Clarke is a first-generation American whose parents came to the US from Jamaica. She holds degrees from Columbia and Harvard universities. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the timing of her confirmation ""particularly poignant and appropriate"" given today's anniversary. The civil rights department that she now heads is already investigating the Minneapolis Police Department after Floyd's killer was convicted last month. They are also investigating the police in Louisville, Kentucky, for the killing ofBreonna Taylor. Reality Check The figures that are available for incidents in which the police shoot and kill people show that for African-Americans, there's a much higher chance of being fatally shot relative to their overall numbers in the US population. According to the Washington Postâs police shootings database, although African-Americans make up less than 14% of the population, they accounted for almost 24% of over 6,000 fatal shootings by the police since 2015. Further research shows the rate that police fatally shoot unarmed black people in the US is more than three times as high as it is for white people. Other studies have shown that black people are more likely to be pulled over in traffic stops by police. One of the most recent, a 2020 study by Stanford University, analysed 100m traffic stops by police departments across the US and found black drivers were about 20% more likely to be stopped than white drivers. African-Americans are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drugs are used at similar levels. Overall, African-Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans and twice the rate of Hispanic-Americans, according to the latest data. These rates have dropped for African-Americans over the last decade, but they still make up more of the prison population than any other race. Read the full story here: How are African Americans treated under the law? Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News James Bryd Jr's murder led to the creation of a federal hate crime law Twenty-two years before the death of George Floyd, another brutal murder of a black man shocked the conscience of America and forced a racial reckoning. WARNING THIS STORY CONTAINS DISTRESSING DESCRIPTIONS. James Byrd Jr was killed by three white supremacists who drove him down a dark country road and beat him. Then they chained him alive to a pickup truck and dragged his body for three miles - until he was decapitated. Two of the murderers were executed for the crime. The other is serving a life sentence. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed a federal hate crime bill into law which is named after James Byrd Jr (as well as Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in 1998 because he was gay). My colleague AngÃ©lica Casas and I visited the Texas town of Jasper this month to find out how Byrd's family is coping two decades after such an unspeakable crime. His daughter, Jamie, told us how she had reacted to his murder. ""I was numb, I was in denial. I was 16-years-old, so love and forgiveness were no part of my thought process at that moment."" Jamie says she still feels angry but chooses to channel it into positive actions. Now a police officer in Houston, she draws a connection between the murders of her father and George Floyd. ""My dad did not get killed at the hands of a police officer, but in today's world, that is what we're seeing. ""We're seeing a lot of brutality by the hands of officers, unfortunately."" Byrd's daughter, Jamie, says Floyd's killing deeply impacted her She says it was a challenge to put on the uniform after George Floyd's murder as protests against police brutality and racism spread across the world. Ultimately, she decided it was more important to keep serving her community. ""I want to be that officer, just be there in solidarity, and say 'hey, I know what you're going through'. You can watch our film about James Byrd Jr on the BBC News website on Friday. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The latest clashes between Israel and the Palestinians have revealed exactly how much the political centre of gravity in the Democratic Party has moved on the conflict in recent years, and especially after civil rights protests sparked by George Floydâs murder. In a recent column, Jewish-American Senator Bernie Sanders paid tribute to the rise of ""a new generation of activists"". ""We saw these activists in American streets last summer in the wake of the murder of George Floyd,"" he writes. ""We see them in Israel. We see them in the Palestinian territories."" His final words lift a direct line from the Black Lives Matter movement: ""Palestinian lives matter"". Sanders is noting what has become obvious during clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians over the past two weeks. Americans who found their political voice during last summer's activism in US cities are now turning their focus, and their rhetoric, on what they see as similar unchecked oppression in the Middle East. Reality Check More people are killed by police in the US than in any other developed country. Among these killings, black Americans are killed at a higher rate compared with the percentage of the population they represent. Most are shot dead. Part of this is to do with gun culture, but there are also growing calls for improved police training to reduce the use of lethal force. On average, US officers spend around 21 weeks in training before they go on patrol. That is far less than in most other developed countries, according to a report by the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform (ICJTR).  US police academies also spend far more time on firearm training than on de-escalating a situation - 71 hours against 21, on average. Prof Maria Haberfeld at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says: ""This is why you see officers very rapidly escalating from initial communication to the actual physical use of force, because this is how they train."" BBC Reality Check has looked into how the training requirements in the US compare with other countries. Read more here: How US police training compares with the rest of the world Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Activists continue to demand root and branch change of what they say is a brutal, racist policing system. But this past year has also been hard on police. Mylan Masson, a former Minneapolis police trainer, says sheâs never seen morale so low. The department has lost more than 200 officers to early retirement, transfer or medical leave for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). There is confusion over competing proposals for reform, and a backlash from citizens. ""The officers don't know what the community feels about them,â she said. âWhat should we be doing? Everything we do, is it going to be judged? Is everything we're doing going to be put through scrutiny that we've never had before? We have things that we need to discuss with the community and make them feel comfortable with us again.â The department has come under federal investigation and Mylan says there are problems that need to be fixed. But the focus on bad cops is wearing. âWe try to... do the best we can and all of a sudden you see something else just horrible happen,â she says. âAnd it's traumatic.â Joe Biden speaks at the White House earlier this month We heard moments ago from George Floyd's family about their meeting with the president and vice-president, and now Biden's released his own response, praising the family for their ""extraordinary courage"". Floyd's murder ""launched a summer of protests"", Biden said in a statement, which ""peacefully unified people of every race and generation to collectively say enough of the senseless killings"". Biden also called for action, writing that real change will be delivered only when there is accountability in the nation's law enforcement. ""The negotiations on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in Congress are ongoing,"" he said. ""It's my hope that they will get a bill to my desk quickly."" ""We have to act,"" he said. George Floyd's family spoke to reporters briefly after a private hour-long meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris. In quick succession, several members of Floyd's family made comments, many of them thanking Biden and Harris for the meeting. His brother Rodney Floyd said the family was grateful for the concern the president and vice-president showed. ""Being here today is an honour,"" said another brother, Terrence. ""I feel it was a very productive conversation and I'm grateful for it."" The family also addressed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which they called for Congress to pass.

"UN data says 630 people are known to have died trying to cross the central Mediterranean this year alone Images of dead children and women washed up on a beach in Libya have been shared by a Spanish charity. The NGO Proactiva Open Arms received some of the photos from inside Libya and said they are of people who had tried to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, a dangerous route for migrants. They show the partially clothed bodies of small children and a woman, bloated and half buried in the sand. At least 743 migrants are known to have died in the Mediterranean this year. According to thedata published by UN's International Organization for Migration,external, there have been 630 recorded deaths in the central Mediterranean alone in 2021, compared with 289 deaths for the whole sea in 2020. ""We are in shock,"" Open Arms head of communications Laura Lanuza told the BBC. ""When people try to flee from Libya they shouldn't be taken back or left adrift in the Mediterranean. There should be a search and rescue operation... to protect lives at sea."" ""The Mediterranean is the biggest graveyard in the world,"" she said. ""It shouldn't be like this."" Reacting to the photos, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said: ""Images of bodies of babies and toddlers washed up on a beach in Libya are unacceptable."" Cold welcome for migrant influx at gateway to Europe The photos that captured Spain's migrant story One of the images posted online shows a small child in a polka dot one-piece sleepsuit. Sand has partially obscured the body. Another photo is of a woman in green trousers spread eagle on the sand, her top pulled up over her head. Oscar Camps is the founder of Proactiva Open Arms. He tweeted photos of the bodies on Monday, of ""young children and women who had only dreams and ambitions to live"", saying they had been left there for three days. Freelance journalist Nancy Porsia - who has also posted images of the bodies online - tweeted however that a contact of hers found the bodies on Saturday and informed the authorities, who buried them the same day in Abu Qamash cemetery. Europe is grappling with a fresh influx of people heading to the continent across the Mediterranean. Some 13,000 people have already arrived in Italy this year, with warmer weather in the area raising fears of even more people trying to make the crossing. And in the western Mediterranean last week, some 8,000 people including children swam or waded around a border fence to get to the Spanish territory of Ceuta from Morocco. Authorities returned several thousand soon after. In 2015,the image of drowned three-year-old Aylan Kurdisparked global outrage.

"Jill Killington says she was told as a pregnant 16-year-old being an unmarried mother was a ""fate worse than death"" Hundreds of women forced into giving up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s have called on the prime minister to issue a government apology. Up to 250,000 women in Britain were coerced into handing over their babies because they were unmarried. Many of the women never had more children and say the loss caused them to lead a lifetime of grief. They want the UK to follow Australia, which in 2013 was the first country to apologise for forced adoptions. 'A lifelong legacy of pain and suffering' Irish PM apologises over mother and baby homes 'They called us fallen women, bad women' ""It was the most shameful thing that could happen,"" says Jill Killington from Leeds. She became pregnant in 1967, aged 16, and says being an unmarried mother ""was described as a fate worse than death"". She recalls having to stay upstairs at her home to hide her growing tummy, so she was out of sight when anyone visited. ""My mother asked me to wear a wedding ring when I went out. It was a deeply humiliating time,"" she says. This video can not be played Judy Baker gave birth aged 18 and was pressured into giving up her baby for adoption Veronica Smith became pregnant in 1965 while working as a nurse at a Butlin's Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis in West Sussex. The chilling reality of her situation hit home when she broke the news to her mother. ""My mother told me if my father found out it would kill him, so I never told him, ever."" Instead, Veronica was secretly sent to a mother and baby home in a part of London not far from her parents' house and she would meet up with her mother on Wimbledon railway station every Saturday. ""She would bring a blank airmail envelope and I would write a letter saying I was in Spain enjoying work and life. She would then take the letter home and show it to my father, who believed I was in Spain."" Lawyers examining the birth mothers' cases have focused on the period between 1945 and 1975 - before a change in adoption law - when around 500,000 babies were adopted in Britain, mostly from mothers who were under 24 and unmarried. Their research suggests about half of those women faced sustained pressure to give up their babies from professionals, including doctors, midwives, workers in mother and baby homes and adoption staff in religious and council-run homes. Ann Keen was 17 when she became pregnant in 1966 and recalls a particularly cruel moment during the birth of her son. ""I wasn't given any pain relief,"" she says. ""The midwife said 'you'll remember this, so you won't be wicked again'."" Ann Keen - who later became an MP - was forced to give birth as a teenager without pain relief Ann says she wasn't even given the opportunity to say goodbye to her son. ""Eight days after giving birth, I went to the hospital nursery to see him and he wasn't there,"" she says. ""The midwife told me 'he's gone. He's in that room over there. They'll be happy and that's the last you'll see of him'."" Ann says: ""It was coercion. The phrase they used was, 'This is for the best' and 'if you really love your baby, you should give him up'."" For Diana Defries, who was 16 when she became pregnant, it was a different kind of trauma. She says the moment after she gave birth someone in the delivery room announced, ""this baby is flagged for adoption and I'll take her away"". ""I yelled to bring her back,"" says Diana. ""But the nurse then just walked past me and put my daughter on a table out of my reach. They all then left the room with just me and my crying baby. All I could croak was 'help me, please'. ""At that moment, I remember thinking, it would be better for me to die."" Diana says: ""I do feel my social worker used coercion. The bullying wore me down"". Diana Defries says she pleaded for her baby to be brought back to her To enable an adoption, the women were supposed to sign consent forms. But some experts have doubts about the legality of some of the consent processes.â¯ Solicitor Carolynn Gallwey, who has acted for the birth mothers, says all of those she has spoken to said they had no choice but to sign the consent form. She says there is also evidence to show some mothers' forms may have been signed by other people, such as their parents or even their GP. One document, shown to the BBC by a woman who didn't want to be named, suggests a judge in one of the adoption hearings questioned the authenticity of a signature. Ms Gallwey said the women were also not told they were entitled to financial help or other kinds of support that might have meant they could have kept their children. Many of the adoptees who were given to new families in forced adoptions have also spoken of their shock at what happened to their birth mothers. Some of them say it has added to their own sense of loss. Gaynor Weatherly, whose mother was 16 when she was born in 1963, says: ""It's like a piece of me has been missing. It can eat you up."" Gaynor says she has found happiness through her own marriage and children but that she feels ""cheated out of a different life"". Gaynor Weatherly says the loss of being taken from her mother ""can eat you up"" Some of the adoptees were eventually reunited with their birth mothers, but it often took decades. Rachel Langham, who was born to Veronica Smith, went to live in Canada after she was adopted. She had a loving relationship with her adoptive parents, but says what happened to Veronica was ""inhumane"". ""I feel terrible empathy and sorrow for her and someone should apologise,"" Rachel says. Rachel Langham, pictured as a child and now, says the treatment of her birth mother was ""inhumane"" In her 40s, Rachel was reunited with Veronica. But building a relationship after so many years has been hard, and Veronica says these lifelong repercussions are one more reason why an apology is so essential. Hundreds of women have now written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say they deserve one from the UK government, on behalf of the institutions and individuals who treated them so badly. Birth mothers in Australia received the world's first government apology in 2013 when Julia Gillard, the prime minister at the time, apologised to around 150,000 women whose babies were taken from them. And three years ago, the Canadian Senate recommended the federal government issue an apology to 300,000 Canadian women. In January of this year, the Irish Taoiseach, Micheal Martin, apologised to former residents of mother and baby homes in Ireland for the way they were treated over several decades. The women in Britain, most of whom are now in their 70s and 80s, say an apology would bring lasting comfort. Ann Keen, who went on to become an MP and junior minister, says: ""I did not give up my son or abandon him. An apology would clear my name and my son's name. An historical injustice is what happened. It's time to say sorry."" In a statement, Children and Families minister Vicky Ford said: ""I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those affected by historic forced adoption. We cannot undo the past, but we can be reassured that our legislation and practices have been significantly strengthened since then.""â¯ â¯The 1975â¯and 1989 Children Actsâ¯and the 1976 Adoption Act were among the laws that have made it easier forâ¯adopted childrenâ¯and their birth mothers to regain contact with each other.

"This video can not be played Tracy Brabin on new Covid travel guidelines in Kirklees. Surge testing for Covid will begin in parts of Kirklees on Wednesday, amid criticism of ""chaotic and confusing"" government travel guidance. The advice for areas hardest hit by the Indian variant was published online on Friday without an announcement, with local leaders not formally notified. West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin called the decision to update the guidance without fanfare as ""shocking"". The government said it intended to take a national approach to lifting rules. Read more Yorkshire stories Speaking in Dewsbury, Ms Brabin said: ""The community of Kirklees has absolutely suffered [over] this last year. We've been in some version of restrictions for over a year. ""Businesses have gone bust, people have lost loved ones, they've not been able to see the people they care about - and now a Friday teatime announcement that can change people's lives. ""It just feels so disrespectful."" Meet outside rather than inside where possible Keep two metres apart from people who you do not live with (unless you have formed a support bubble with them), this includes friends and family you don't live with Avoid travelling in and out of affected areas unless it is essential, for example for work (if you cannot work from home) or education Door-to-door testingis going to take place in Savile Town and Thornhill Lees, with people aged over 11 being invited to take PCR tests, Kirklees Council said. All adults in those areas are being offered the chance to be vaccinated if they have not already received a first dose, it added. Jonathan Hughes, 58, lives in Gomersal and planned to go to Edinburgh on 1 June to visit his son, but said the trip is now ""unlikely"" after the latest advice. Mr Hughes, who has terminal cancer, said: ""There is a large point of me that would like to go 'to hell with what the rules are' but I've spent my life caring what the rules are so it's difficult for me to go all cavalier about it and not care about it now. ""A year ago, my oncologist advised that I plan for 'quality of life - not quantity'. The government's lack of clarity means that I'm increasingly unlikely to see much of either."" Jo Richmond at the Old Bridge Inn said there was a lack of clarity about what was expected of the hospitality industry Jo Richmond, general manager of the Old Bridge Inn in Holmfirth, said: ""I don't think this has been communicated very well at all - I only found out about it because it came up on the news on my phone this morning. ""We've just had a brilliant opening week and it's a major worry that bookings could now be affected with people travelling into the area to stay at the hotel."" She said it seemed unfair that Holmfirth, which had a small number of Covid cases, was treated the same as larger towns like Dewsbury and Huddersfield because they were all within the Kirklees district. Rakiya Maqsoon and her husband say they will continue to commute to Dewsbury Rakiya Maqsoon, 45, who commutes with her husband from Bradford to Dewsbury to run a market stall, said: ""If we're not meant to be commuting in and out, we've not been made aware of it. ""If it's not in law, what does it actually mean - how does it affect us? We'll still wear masks, keep hands clean and keep a social distance, but we'll still be commuting in. ""You've got to continue at some point to live a normal life,"" she added. Muhammad Muhammad said residents in Kirklees ""were just have to take every day as it comes at the minute"" Muhammad Muhammad, from Dewsbury, 55, said: ""Not everyone knows how to use the government website, a lot of my friends don't because we're old-school, we still use old mobile phones. ""It is concerning, everyone's getting ready for a grand reopening but I don't think there's going to be normality, is there, how things are going."" Analysis by Rob England, BBC England Data Unit Cases in Kirklees have increased by 45% in the last seven days, compared with the previous week. In the most recent data, the area had the fourth highest rate of infection in England, standing at just below 100 weekly cases per 100,000. This isn't as extreme as some other parts of the country, such as Bolton, but the number of new cases being recorded do not show signs of slowing. The majority of these cases seem to be in the younger age groups and to the north, such as Dewsbury Savile Town and Thornhill Lees, but not exclusively and there are hotspots appearing in the south in places like Honley and Brockholes. Thought by the government to be one of the areas where the variant B.1.617.2 is ""spreading fastest"", according to the most recent data released, three of the 12 cases examined in Kirklees were identified as being from this variant, first identified in India. However, this only covers up to the 15 May, so it is possible more cases have been identified since. Advice against travelling to Bolton in Greater Manchester and nearby Blackburn with Darwen, other than for essential reasons, and for people there to meet outside where possible, was issued on 14 May. It was updated to include six more areas - Kirklees, Bedford, Burnley, Leicester, Hounslow and North Tyneside - on Friday. The prime minister's official spokesman said the government wanted to encourage the public ""to exercise their good judgement"", rather than issuing ""top-down edicts"". Kirklees Council leader Mr Pandor said he hoped it had been ""an error"" as the district's hospital rates and death rates were low. ""We are doing whatever we can to respond to the pandemic but the responsibility overall is the government's, he said. ""We will step up and do our part but we can't do it when there's no trust or no confidence in how they communicate with us. It's not on."" Shabir Pandor said described the lack of an announcement as ""completely unfair"" Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said she was ""surprised"" to hear local leaders declare they had not been told about the fresh guidance. ""We have been working in close contact, so I'm surprised to hear people think this has come out of the blue - it hasn't,"" she told Sky News. ""It is about formalising on the record the guidance we believe people can and should follow in order to make sure we tackle and don't have more spread of the Indian variant.""

"This video can not be played Carey Mulligan: ""We feel a promise has been broken"" An international charity working to prevent children being trafficked from Afghanistan says a delay to promised UK government funding is ""devastating"". The government had agreed to pay War Child Â£500,000 from July this year in a much-publicised donation match scheme. But they now say they will not pay out the money until April 2022. Actress Carey Mulligan, a patron of War Child, said the ""damaging decision"" needed reversing - but the government said it had to take ""tough"" decisions. ""The children at risk of abuse and exploitation need our support now not next year,"" the star of the Great Gatsby and Promising Young Woman told BBC Two's Newsnight. The government must ""keep their word to the public who donated so generously in such a challenging year, and most importantly the children we all committed to helping"", she added. Charities call UK's Â£500m aid cut a tragic blow Foreign aid: What is it used for? UK Aid Match is a government scheme which is designed to allow the British public have a say in how UK aid is spent overseas, whilst helping the poorest people in developing countries. For every Â£1 donated to a UK Aid Match charity appeal, the UK government will also contribute Â£1 of UK aid, up to Â£2 million. Last year War Child launched an urgent appeal in Afghanistan, which it said would have reached 3,430 children and their families. They raised Â£500,000 from the public and the additional funding from the government was due to be used to reunite children with their families and build two multipurpose support centres in the local community to provide training, help children return to formal education. War Child chief executive Rob Williams told Newsnight: ""A delay of a year is a disaster and it is a major breach of faith because all those people who raised money in response to the government's promise that they would match the money have basically been let down."" ""Whilst the government might think a delay of a year is a reasonable proposition, the project means that we won't be able to stop about three thousand children being trafficked into Iran over the next 12 months or so,"" he added. Government sources told Newsnight that all affected charities have been given cast iron guarantees that they will receive the money next year. Newsnight's Political Editor Nick Watt said that, in Whitehall, that is seen as significant in light of what is described as difficult spending decisions. War Child works to help the thousands of Afghan children, some as young as eight, who every year are forced to leave their families in search of work. After decades of war in the country, many families have little financial security and parents stay at home to care for the youngest in their families. Children cross the border to Iran on dangerous journeys to find work to support their families and are left vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. In a statement, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: ""The seismic impact of the pandemic on the UK economy has forced us to take tough but necessary decisions, including temporarily reducing the overall amount we spend on aid. ""We will still spend more than Â£10 billion this year to and improve global health, fight poverty and tackle climate change. ""We have protected War Child's UK Aid Match funding because we value their work and the results they will deliver. ""All UK Aid Match commitments will be protected, as set out in the foreign secretary's written ministerial statement. In some cases there will be a delay in releasing the guaranteed funding"". Following the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis, the chancellor last November cut the UK foreign aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around Â£4bn. Rishi Sunak said the government had to make ""tough choices"". Even with the reduction UK is still be the second-highest aid donor in the G7 group of major economies.

"UN data says 630 people are known to have died trying to cross the central Mediterranean this year alone Images of dead children and women washed up on a beach in Libya have been shared by a Spanish charity. The NGO Proactiva Open Arms received some of the photos from inside Libya and said they are of people who had tried to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, a dangerous route for migrants. They show the partially clothed bodies of small children and a woman, bloated and half buried in the sand. At least 743 migrants are known to have died in the Mediterranean this year. According to thedata published by UN's International Organization for Migration,external, there have been 630 recorded deaths in the central Mediterranean alone in 2021, compared with 289 deaths for the whole sea in 2020. ""We are in shock,"" Open Arms head of communications Laura Lanuza told the BBC. ""When people try to flee from Libya they shouldn't be taken back or left adrift in the Mediterranean. There should be a search and rescue operation... to protect lives at sea."" ""The Mediterranean is the biggest graveyard in the world,"" she said. ""It shouldn't be like this."" Reacting to the photos, Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said: ""Images of bodies of babies and toddlers washed up on a beach in Libya are unacceptable."" Cold welcome for migrant influx at gateway to Europe The photos that captured Spain's migrant story One of the images posted online shows a small child in a polka dot one-piece sleepsuit. Sand has partially obscured the body. Another photo is of a woman in green trousers spread eagle on the sand, her top pulled up over her head. Oscar Camps is the founder of Proactiva Open Arms. He tweeted photos of the bodies on Monday, of ""young children and women who had only dreams and ambitions to live"", saying they had been left there for three days. Freelance journalist Nancy Porsia - who has also posted images of the bodies online - tweeted however that a contact of hers found the bodies on Saturday and informed the authorities, who buried them the same day in Abu Qamash cemetery. Europe is grappling with a fresh influx of people heading to the continent across the Mediterranean. Some 13,000 people have already arrived in Italy this year, with warmer weather in the area raising fears of even more people trying to make the crossing. And in the western Mediterranean last week, some 8,000 people including children swam or waded around a border fence to get to the Spanish territory of Ceuta from Morocco. Authorities returned several thousand soon after. In 2015,the image of drowned three-year-old Aylan Kurdisparked global outrage.

"Police said paramedics tried to save Rayon Pennycook, but he died at the scene A 16-year-old boy has been stabbed to death, with three teenagers arrested on suspicion of his murder. Rayon Pennycook was killed on Constable Road in Corby on Tuesday evening. Northamptonshire Police was called at about 19:00 BST and, despite the best efforts of paramedics, he died at the scene. Officers have arrested three boys, one aged 15 and two aged 17, on suspicion of murder and the force said the inquiry was moving at a ""fast pace"". A police forensics team was working inside a large cordoned-off area on Constable Road/Reynolds Road on Wednesday Rayon's family said his death had left them ""devastated"". ""There are no words which can accurately describe the pain we are suffering,"" they said in a statement. ""It is unbearable."" The family said the teenager had ""his whole life ahead of him"" and was in the process of applying for an apprenticeship. ""Rayon is not a statistic and he will not be remembered as such - he was a unique human being with a beating heart who was loved so dearly by his mum, dad, siblings, niece, nephew and friends."" Floral tributes have been left at the scene on the town's Hazel Leys estate A wide cordon remained in place on Wednesday and an officer was standing guard outside a property on the adjacent Reynolds Road. Det Ch Insp Joe Banfield said he was ""aware that there may be some pertinent video footage of last night's incident taken"" and urged anyone with mobile phone, CCTV or dashcam footage to send it to police. He said: ""Our inquiries into this murder are still progressing at a fast pace and we remain absolutely committed to bringing those responsible for Rayon's death to justice. ""This is an exceptionally sad and tragic incident in which a young boy with his whole life ahead of him has died.

"Regeni's mutilated body was left in a ditch on the outskirts of Cairo More than five years after an Italian student's body was found in Cairo, a Rome judge says four senior Egyptian security officials should face trial over his kidnap, torture and murder. Giulio Regeni, a Cambridge University postgraduate student, disappeared in January 2016. His body was so badly disfigured his mother could barely identify him. The four members of the Egyptian security forces are unlikely to travel to Rome for the 14 October trial. The murder has heightened tensions between the two countries. Italian and Egyptian investigators had originally tried to work on the case together but when Rome prosecutors pushed for a trial in late 2020, their counterparts in Cairo said there was ""insufficient evidence to support the accusation in court"". Egypt said evidence had been found that Regeni had been robbed by a criminal gang but that the killer had not been identified. Egypt shelves probe of Cambridge student's murder Italian murdered in Egypt 'over research' At the time of his disappearance, the 28-year-old PhD student was researching Egypt's independent trade unions, a controversial subject in a country where unofficial protest movements have faced a crackdown in recent years. His body was found dumped in a ditch by a road near Cairo on 3 February 2016. An Italian post-mortem examination found he had been tortured ""in stages"" between 25 January and the day of his death. Giulio Regeni's parents, Claudio and Paola, have campaigned for justice for their son for more than five years Rome prosecutors went further, detailing ""acute physical suffering"" from kicks, punches, beatings, cuts and even burns from red-hot objects. Egyptian officials have admitted Regeni was being monitored and Italian investigators said in 2018 that people he had met while doing his research had betrayed him. The four Egyptians all deny involvement in the student's disappearance and killing. Cairo prosecutors dropped all proceedings against them and a fifth suspect last December. Gen Tariq Sabir, Col Usham Helmi, Col Athar Kamel Mohamed Ibrahim and Maj Magdi Ibrahim Abdelal Sharif all face charges in Italy of kidnapping Regeni. Maj Sharif is also accused of conspiring to inflict aggravated injuries and murder. The student's parents, Paola Deffendi and Claudio Regeni, were at Tuesday's hearing to hear Judge Pierluigi Balestrieri rule that there was sufficient evidence to indict the four men. Their lawyer, Alessandra Ballerini, told reporters that all the young man's rights had been violated, ""but today we have the well-founded hope that at least the right to the truth will not be denied Giulio"". ""It has taken us 64 months. But it is a good goal and a good starting point,"" she said. Egyptian officials did not comment immediately on the decision and as the four suspects' home details have not been given to the Italians, there is little chance of contacting them or that the Cairo government will agree to them attending the trial.

"Lidl's Hampstead gin bottle was redesigned at the end of 2020 Discount supermarket Lidl has been ordered to stop selling a redesigned gin bottle that looks too similar to an upmarket rival. A senior judge has told the retailer the redesign of its Hampstead gin breaches the trademarks of premium brand Hendrick's. At the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Lord Clark awarded an interim interdict to the makers of Hendrick's gin. The temporary order stops Lidl selling the redesigned bottles in Scotland. The decision comes just months afterM&S took action against Aldi over its Colin the Caterpillar cakelookalike. It argued the supermarket's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake infringed its Colin the Caterpillar trademark, that their similarities led consumers to believe they were of the same standard and that the product ""rode on the coat-tails"" of M&S's reputation. William Grant and Sons Irish Brands Ltd instructed lawyers to to take legal steps, believing the retail giant's Hampstead gin brand resembled their own product, which is distilled in the Ayrshire town of Girvan. The company claimed the supermarket redesigned the Hampstead gin bottle to resemble the ""apothecary-style bottle"" used by Hendrick's. The legal team argued that the redesign changed the colour of the diamond-shaped label from white to a similar pale colour used on the bottle in the Hendrick's trademark. They argued that the look of the label was changed to look like the Hendrick's label and the bottle was changed to a similar dark colour. Hendrick's gin and the Lidl Hampstead redesign The lawyers also said the redesign contained images of cucumbers which alluded to the fact that Hendrick's was infused with cucumber. William Grant's lawyers asked for a temporary order which would force Lidl to stop selling the redesigned Hampstead gin. The firm feared sales of Hendrick's gin could be harmed by the cheaper rival. Lord Clark agreed and said that the drinks firm's legal team shown there was a case that Lidl had breached section 10 (3) Trade Marks Act 1994. In a written judgement issued on Tuesday, Lord Clark wrote: ""I accept that the pursuer in the present case has not (as yet) provided a sufficient basis to show a reasonable prospect of success in establishing a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer or a serious likelihood that such a change will occur in the future. I do however recognise that there is at least some risk to the pursuer of harm to the brand. ""I take that factor into account and find that there is a reasonable prospect of success for the pursuer in showing that the defenders intended to benefit from the reputation and goodwill of the pursuer's mark. ""Whether or not there was a deliberate intention to deceive, there is a sufficient basis for showing that there was an intention to benefit. It is difficult to view the re-design, including the change in colour of the bottle, as accidental or coincidental. ""I therefore conclude that there is a reasonable prospect of success on the part of the pursuer in showing a change in economic behaviour or a real likelihood of such a change by customers who buy from Lidl."" During an earlier court hearing, social media comments about the redesign of Hampstead gin, which retails for Â£15.99, were read out. The court acknowledged the brand had a previous design One said: ""Hmmm...Reminds me of another gin, but I just can't put my finger on it..."" - which was followed by laughing emojis). Another person commented: ""Looks a lot like another bottle of gin"" - which was followed by a winking emoji. In his judgement, Lord Clark said that Lidl could sell the Hampstead gin brand but in a form which differs from its current design. Lidl said it was disappointed by the ruling. A spokesman said: ""We note the court's decision and have closely adhered to the requirements outlined within the ruling. ""We continue to liaise directly with the parties involved and hope to reach a satisfactory resolution in due course.""

"Patrick Ennis was one of three paramedics to work at the scene of the blast A paramedic first on the scene of the Manchester Arena bombing did not give immediate treatment to casualties because his role was to assess the scene, an inquiry has heard. Patrick Ennis was one of three paramedics to work at the blast scene. He explained he did not immediately start treating people because it was his job to prepare for a wider major incident response. Mr Ennis said his training was to assess who was most in need of help. Twenty-two people were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert at about 22:30 BST on 22 May 2017. The inquiry heard Mr Ennis arrived at the scene 21 minutes after the bomb had gone off. He said he spent 90 minutes triaging patients and deciding who was most in need of urgent care. Mr Ennis explained to the hearing as the first person from the ambulance service on the scene, treating the injured ""would occur sometime into the incident"", and added ""it was not practical at that stage"". Mr Ennis agreed that some people may see it as a ""brutal way to approach the situation"" but that was the way he had been trained to provide an ""overall grip"" on a major incident. Twenty-two people were killed in the May 2017 bombing The advanced paramedic said although he expected more colleagues to follow him into the foyer, he realised it was going to take some time. ""I think the numbers that we had available at that time just simply didn't allow for any deployment of large number of paramedics into the City Room."" Arena police chief did not share safety situation Abedi brother demands immunity at inquiry Arena police chief 'not the right man for the job' Mr Ennis told the inquiry he was made aware by firearms police officers that they did not think that area was safe. ""I believe that's one of the reasons why it wasn't possible to deploy further paramedics as they arrived into that area,"" he said. Mr Ennis said the decision to move critically injured people from the foyer down to the station concourse was why only two more paramedics went into the bomb scene. The inquiry continues.

"Elliot Page posted the first public picture of himself post-top surgery. Elliot Page has won praise for posing bare-chested for the first time sincecoming out as trans in December. An Instagram post shared by the actor showed him smiling while posing in a pool in swimming shorts alongside the words #transjoy and #transisbeautiful. Page, 34, previously described his top surgery - where breast tissue is removed - as ""life-saving"". Speaking to Oprah Winfrey last monthhe said it made him ""feel comfortable"" in his body ""for probably the first time"". The Umbrella Academy star tearfully explained why his chest had brought him the ""most joy"" in transitioning. ""It's getting out of the shower and the towel's around your waist and you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're just like, 'There I am'. And I'm not having the moment where I'm panicked,"" he said during the Apple TV interview. Page's Instagram post has already received over two million likes and a wave of supportive celebrity comments praising his new appearance. ""Dude I see why you crushed me on that workout!"" actor Justin Cornwell commented. ""Hot"" added singer Miley Cyrus, alongside a heart emoji. The Vampire Diaries' Nina Dobrev said: ""You look amazingâ¦ and most of all happy."" Julianne Moore, who starred with Page in the film Freeheld, wrote: ""Happy summer"" accompanied by a flame emoji. The Good Place star Jameela Jamil also posted in recognition, tweeting that she was pleased to see Page ""thriving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winfrey, meanwhile, shared her support by reposting the image on the Oprah Daily Instagram account. ""This is what happiness looks like!"" she wrote. ""Looks like Elliot will be shining brighter than the sun this summer."" Page, a prominent LGBT advocate, also used the pair's April interview to reveal how the surgery had given him a new energy in fighting for trans rights, ""because it is such a freeing, freeing experience"". ""Not only has it been life-changing for me, I do believe it's been life-saving and it's the case for so many people. And because there is such an attack on trans healthcare right now, when already there's such lack of access,"" he continued. This video can not be played ""I feel comfortable in my body for the first time."" Page was referring tolaws in Arkansasand further legal fights across the US threatening to ban young transgender people from accessing certain medical treatments. Kirrin Medcalf, Trans Community Engagement Lead at LGBT charity Stonewall, said the photo emphasised the positive impact that gender affirmation procedures can have upon a person's mental health. ""It's fantastic to see Elliot looking so comfortable and happy in his latest photo. Elliot's has always been a role model to a huge number of people, and it is wonderful that he can share his trans joy with the world. ""Seeing moments of gender euphoria also highlights how important it is for all trans people to be able to access appropriate and timely gender affirming healthcare,"" he said. Felix, 20 (He/Him): ""Looking at Elliot's image, it makes me feel proud to see another trans person - especially a celebrity in the public eye - proudly showing off their top surgery scars, as it increases a wider scope of positivity. ""However, as a person who has had to delay surgery due to the unbearable waiting times on the NHS, it makes me frustrated that people with more money and resources - such as celebrities - do not have to struggle in the same ways as people relying on state healthcare. ""In the UK, it can often up to 10 years, if not longer, to fully medically transition. We should not have to wait this long to feel comfortable in ourselves. ""I have been waiting to medically transition since I was 14. I am 20 now and haven't got anywhere. I am now planning to go to Poland after crowdsourcing funds to complete the surgery privately. I should not have to be at such inconvenience in order to be myself. ""That said, I think the wider impact of Elliot's post is good, as long as we keep having this conversation about privilege and how it plays into securing a medical transition. With each celebration of Elliot's visibility, I hope people will recognise those relying on personal crowdfunds."" Page, who is Canadian-born, made his film breakthrough starring as a pregnant teenager in 2007's Juno - landing an Oscar nomination. Other major films include Inception and the X-Men series, before most recently starring as Vanya Hargreeves in Netflix superhero show Umbrella Academy.

"This video can not be played Roman Protasevich's father tells the BBC he is fearful his son may be tortured Several European airlines have said that they will not fly over Belarus, days after a dissident journalist was arrested on a flight diverted to Minsk. Ukraine and Poland are stopping all flights to and from the country, while the UK is preventing Belarusian airlines from entering its airspace. Western countries accuse Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane carrying journalist Roman Protasevich on Sunday. The Greece-Lithuania flight was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat. Belarus authorities on Monday released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress. He faces charges related to his reporting of last August's disputed election and subsequent crackdown on mass opposition protests, and has said he fears the death penalty after being placed on a terrorism list. Belarus is the only European country that still executes prisoners. Belarus plane: What we know and what we don't Who is Roman Protasevich? ''Perfect storm' prompts EU to act fast on Belarus At a meeting in Brussels on Monday, the leaders of the27 European Union member states called for the overflight ban, and promised further economic sanctions,external. On Tuesday, the Belarusian transport ministry released a transcript of a conversation said to be between an air traffic controller in Minsk and a pilot on Sunday's Ryanair flight. According to the transcript, which has not been independently verified, Belarus suggested several times that the plane should land in Minsk on ""our recommendation"". This appeared to contradict earlier statements from the Belarusian authorities that said the decision to land was made independently by the pilot. At the Brussels summit, EU leaders told the bloc's airlines not to fly over Belarus. They have also asked member states to suspend operating permits for its national carrier Belavia. The Athens-Vilnius flight was diverted because of a bomb threat, Belarusian officials said Air France said it had ""suspended overflights of Belarusian airspace until further notice"". Finnish airline Finnair also announced a ban. Air France's Dutch subsidiary KLM, along with German carrier Lufthansa, Scandinavia's SAS and others, announced similar suspensions on Monday. Singapore Airlines also said it was rerouting flights to avoid Belarus. Meanwhile Polish national airline Lot said it had suspended both overflights and flights to and from Minsk, and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Ukrainian carriers were banned from flying over or into Belarus. Passengers describe panic on plane What happens with a military jet interception? Why wearing the wrong socks is risky in Belarus The UK, meanwhile, said Belarusian airlines would not be allowed to enter its airspace unless they had specific authorisation. Belavia said it was suspending flights to the UK and France until 30 October. Belarus, though not in the EU, borders three EU countries. Many flights to and from Asia as well as within Europe use its airspace. Earlier on Tuesday, European Council President Charles Michel shared a map of air traffic taken from the flight tracking website Flightradar24 in which there appeared to be no planes in Belarusian airspace. Some flights, however, have continued throughout the day. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some 400 flights use Belarusian airspace daily and 100 of these are by EU or UK carriers, according to the European air traffic agency, Eurocontrol. It has urged the airlines concerned to reroute through nearby countries. ""Frightening Lukashenko with sanctions is doomed to failure,"" declared one Russian newspaper this morning. ""It only eggs him on."" Then the character analysis: ""He's cultivated the image of a thuggish hooligan."" It begs the question - can sanctions change a ""hooligan's"" behaviour? Previous attempts have failed. European leaders clearly felt that after the fake bomb scare, the diversion of Ryanair Flight 4978 to Minsk and the arrest of a political opponent on board, they needed to send a strong message that such a brazen act was unacceptable. Hence the new sanctions. It's unclear, though, how effective they will be. Banning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU territory and calling on EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace is a financial blow to Minsk. But Mr Lukashenko will almost certainly use this as an excuse to say to those around him - and to the Belarusian people - ""Look, I told you so. The West is out to destroy Belarus, if not with bullets, then with sanctions."" He will use it to batten down the hatches even more tightly in the face of an alleged external enemy. Might there come a point when those around the leader pause to consider where Belarus is heading - its isolation, the economic consequences of Mr Lukashenko's policies, not to mention the brutality of the crackdown on his opponents? As long as Moscow is backing him, Mr Lukashenko will feel confident of riding things out. Belarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania - to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday. Police then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was ""super scared"", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. Accusations against Mr Protasevich's girlfriend Sofia Sapega are unclear The incident has drawn sharp condemnation from across the world, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation. Ms Sapega's mother told the BBC that the 23-year-old had been taken to a Minsk jail, adding that the last word she managed to write on her WhatsApp messaging account was 'Mummy'. The accusations against her are unclear. ""I don't know what they can charge her with. For going on holiday with Roman Protasevich? It's his life. What he does is exclusively his choice,"" she said. Belarus said the flight had been diverted because of a bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. But Hamas has denied any involvement. German leader Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Belarusian claim was ""completely implausible"". Dozens of Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents. The 66-year-old leader has cracked down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile. On Tuesday Belarus sentenced seven activists including senior opposition figure Pavel Severinets, to terms of four to seven years for their part in last year's protests, reports say. Mr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots. Nexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote. It has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts. A video of Roman Protasevich appearing to confess to crimes was released by Belarus authorities late on Monday Mr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. In the video clip released after his arrest, he said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with by the Belarusian state. But activists, including the country's main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was under pressure to admit wrongdoing. Mr Protasevich's father has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured. Dmitri Protasevich said on Monday he was ""really afraid"" of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his home country. Where is Belarus?It has its ally Russia to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"" - he has been in power for 27 years. What's going on there?There is a huge opposition movement demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. The opposition movement and Western governments say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election. Officially he won by a landslide. A huge police crackdown has curbed street protests and sent opposition leaders to prison or into exile. What happens with a military jet interception?

"Regeni's mutilated body was left in a ditch on the outskirts of Cairo More than five years after an Italian student's body was found in Cairo, a Rome judge says four senior Egyptian security officials should face trial over his kidnap, torture and murder. Giulio Regeni, a Cambridge University postgraduate student, disappeared in January 2016. His body was so badly disfigured his mother could barely identify him. The four members of the Egyptian security forces are unlikely to travel to Rome for the 14 October trial. The murder has heightened tensions between the two countries. Italian and Egyptian investigators had originally tried to work on the case together but when Rome prosecutors pushed for a trial in late 2020, their counterparts in Cairo said there was ""insufficient evidence to support the accusation in court"". Egypt said evidence had been found that Regeni had been robbed by a criminal gang but that the killer had not been identified. Egypt shelves probe of Cambridge student's murder Italian murdered in Egypt 'over research' At the time of his disappearance, the 28-year-old PhD student was researching Egypt's independent trade unions, a controversial subject in a country where unofficial protest movements have faced a crackdown in recent years. His body was found dumped in a ditch by a road near Cairo on 3 February 2016. An Italian post-mortem examination found he had been tortured ""in stages"" between 25 January and the day of his death. Giulio Regeni's parents, Claudio and Paola, have campaigned for justice for their son for more than five years Rome prosecutors went further, detailing ""acute physical suffering"" from kicks, punches, beatings, cuts and even burns from red-hot objects. Egyptian officials have admitted Regeni was being monitored and Italian investigators said in 2018 that people he had met while doing his research had betrayed him. The four Egyptians all deny involvement in the student's disappearance and killing. Cairo prosecutors dropped all proceedings against them and a fifth suspect last December. Gen Tariq Sabir, Col Usham Helmi, Col Athar Kamel Mohamed Ibrahim and Maj Magdi Ibrahim Abdelal Sharif all face charges in Italy of kidnapping Regeni. Maj Sharif is also accused of conspiring to inflict aggravated injuries and murder. The student's parents, Paola Deffendi and Claudio Regeni, were at Tuesday's hearing to hear Judge Pierluigi Balestrieri rule that there was sufficient evidence to indict the four men. Their lawyer, Alessandra Ballerini, told reporters that all the young man's rights had been violated, ""but today we have the well-founded hope that at least the right to the truth will not be denied Giulio"". ""It has taken us 64 months. But it is a good goal and a good starting point,"" she said. Egyptian officials did not comment immediately on the decision and as the four suspects' home details have not been given to the Italians, there is little chance of contacting them or that the Cairo government will agree to them attending the trial.

"Lidl's Hampstead gin bottle was redesigned at the end of 2020 Discount supermarket Lidl has been ordered to stop selling a redesigned gin bottle that looks too similar to an upmarket rival. A senior judge has told the retailer the redesign of its Hampstead gin breaches the trademarks of premium brand Hendrick's. At the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Lord Clark awarded an interim interdict to the makers of Hendrick's gin. The temporary order stops Lidl selling the redesigned bottles in Scotland. The decision comes just months afterM&S took action against Aldi over its Colin the Caterpillar cakelookalike. It argued the supermarket's Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake infringed its Colin the Caterpillar trademark, that their similarities led consumers to believe they were of the same standard and that the product ""rode on the coat-tails"" of M&S's reputation. William Grant and Sons Irish Brands Ltd instructed lawyers to to take legal steps, believing the retail giant's Hampstead gin brand resembled their own product, which is distilled in the Ayrshire town of Girvan. The company claimed the supermarket redesigned the Hampstead gin bottle to resemble the ""apothecary-style bottle"" used by Hendrick's. The legal team argued that the redesign changed the colour of the diamond-shaped label from white to a similar pale colour used on the bottle in the Hendrick's trademark. They argued that the look of the label was changed to look like the Hendrick's label and the bottle was changed to a similar dark colour. Hendrick's gin and the Lidl Hampstead redesign The lawyers also said the redesign contained images of cucumbers which alluded to the fact that Hendrick's was infused with cucumber. William Grant's lawyers asked for a temporary order which would force Lidl to stop selling the redesigned Hampstead gin. The firm feared sales of Hendrick's gin could be harmed by the cheaper rival. Lord Clark agreed and said that the drinks firm's legal team shown there was a case that Lidl had breached section 10 (3) Trade Marks Act 1994. In a written judgement issued on Tuesday, Lord Clark wrote: ""I accept that the pursuer in the present case has not (as yet) provided a sufficient basis to show a reasonable prospect of success in establishing a change in the economic behaviour of the average consumer or a serious likelihood that such a change will occur in the future. I do however recognise that there is at least some risk to the pursuer of harm to the brand. ""I take that factor into account and find that there is a reasonable prospect of success for the pursuer in showing that the defenders intended to benefit from the reputation and goodwill of the pursuer's mark. ""Whether or not there was a deliberate intention to deceive, there is a sufficient basis for showing that there was an intention to benefit. It is difficult to view the re-design, including the change in colour of the bottle, as accidental or coincidental. ""I therefore conclude that there is a reasonable prospect of success on the part of the pursuer in showing a change in economic behaviour or a real likelihood of such a change by customers who buy from Lidl."" During an earlier court hearing, social media comments about the redesign of Hampstead gin, which retails for Â£15.99, were read out. The court acknowledged the brand had a previous design One said: ""Hmmm...Reminds me of another gin, but I just can't put my finger on it..."" - which was followed by laughing emojis). Another person commented: ""Looks a lot like another bottle of gin"" - which was followed by a winking emoji. In his judgement, Lord Clark said that Lidl could sell the Hampstead gin brand but in a form which differs from its current design. Lidl said it was disappointed by the ruling. A spokesman said: ""We note the court's decision and have closely adhered to the requirements outlined within the ruling. ""We continue to liaise directly with the parties involved and hope to reach a satisfactory resolution in due course.""

"This video can not be played Roman Protasevich's father tells the BBC he is fearful his son may be tortured Several European airlines have said that they will not fly over Belarus, days after a dissident journalist was arrested on a flight diverted to Minsk. Ukraine and Poland are stopping all flights to and from the country, while the UK is preventing Belarusian airlines from entering its airspace. Western countries accuse Belarus of hijacking the Ryanair plane carrying journalist Roman Protasevich on Sunday. The Greece-Lithuania flight was rerouted over a supposed bomb threat. Belarus authorities on Monday released video of Mr Protasevich that appears to have been recorded under duress. He faces charges related to his reporting of last August's disputed election and subsequent crackdown on mass opposition protests, and has said he fears the death penalty after being placed on a terrorism list.

On Tuesday, the Belarusian transport ministry released a transcript of a conversation said to be between an air traffic controller in Minsk and a pilot on Sunday's Ryanair flight. According to the transcript, which has not been independently verified, Belarus suggested several times that the plane should land in Minsk on ""our recommendation"". This appeared to contradict earlier statements from the Belarusian authorities that said the decision to land was made independently by the pilot. At the Brussels summit, EU leaders told the bloc's airlines not to fly over Belarus. They have also asked member states to suspend operating permits for its national carrier Belavia. The Athens-Vilnius flight was diverted because of a bomb threat, Belarusian officials said Air France said it had ""suspended overflights of Belarusian airspace until further notice"". Finnish airline Finnair also announced a ban. Air France's Dutch subsidiary KLM, along with German carrier Lufthansa, Scandinavia's SAS and others, announced similar suspensions on Monday. Singapore Airlines also said it was rerouting flights to avoid Belarus.

Many flights to and from Asia as well as within Europe use its airspace.

Some 400 flights use Belarusian airspace daily and 100 of these are by EU or UK carriers, according to the European air traffic agency, Eurocontrol. It has urged the airlines concerned to reroute through nearby countries. ""Frightening Lukashenko with sanctions is doomed to failure,"" declared one Russian newspaper this morning. ""It only eggs him on."" Then the character analysis: ""He's cultivated the image of a thuggish hooligan."" It begs the question - can sanctions change a ""hooligan's"" behaviour? Previous attempts have failed. European leaders clearly felt that after the fake bomb scare, the diversion of Ryanair Flight 4978 to Minsk and the arrest of a political opponent on board, they needed to send a strong message that such a brazen act was unacceptable. Hence the new sanctions. It's unclear, though, how effective they will be. Banning Belarusian airlines from flying over EU territory and calling on EU-based carriers to avoid Belarusian airspace is a financial blow to Minsk. But Mr Lukashenko will almost certainly use this as an excuse to say to those around him - and to the Belarusian people - ""Look, I told you so. The West is out to destroy Belarus, if not with bullets, then with sanctions."" He will use it to batten down the hatches even more tightly in the face of an alleged external enemy. Might there come a point when those around the leader pause to consider where Belarus is heading - its isolation, the economic consequences of Mr Lukashenko's policies, not to mention the brutality of the crackdown on his opponents? As long as Moscow is backing him, Mr Lukashenko will feel confident of riding things out. Belarus sent a fighter jet to force Ryanair flight FR4978 - which had departed from the Greek capital, Athens, and was bound for Vilnius in Lithuania - to land, claiming there was a bomb threat. It touched down in the capital Minsk at 13:16 local time (10:16 GMT) on Sunday. Police then took Mr Protasevich away when the plane's 126 passengers disembarked. The activist, who witnesses said was ""super scared"", was arrested along with his girlfriend Sofia Sapega. Accusations against Mr Protasevich's girlfriend Sofia Sapega are unclear The incident has drawn sharp condemnation from across the world, with countries urging the immediate release of Mr Protasevich and a full investigation. Ms Sapega's mother told the BBC that the 23-year-old had been taken to a Minsk jail, adding that the last word she managed to write on her WhatsApp messaging account was 'Mummy'. The accusations against her are unclear. ""I don't know what they can charge her with. For going on holiday with Roman Protasevich? It's his life. What he does is exclusively his choice,"" she said. Belarus said the flight had been diverted because of a bomb threat from the Palestinian militant group Hamas. But Hamas has denied any involvement. German leader Chancellor Angela Merkel said the Belarusian claim was ""completely implausible"". Dozens of Belarusian officials, including President Alexander Lukashenko, are already under EU sanctions including travel bans and asset freezes, imposed in response to the repression on opponents. The 66-year-old leader has cracked down on dissenting voices since winning a disputed election last August. Many opposition figures have been arrested, while others fled into exile. On Tuesday Belarus sentenced seven activists including senior opposition figure Pavel Severinets, to terms of four to seven years for their part in last year's protests, reports say. Mr Protasevich is a former editor of Nexta, a media operation with a Telegram channel. He left Belarus in 2019 to live in exile in Lithuania. From there he covered the events of the 2020 presidential election, after which he was charged with terrorism and inciting riots. Nexta played a key role for the opposition during the vote. It has continued to do so in its aftermath, particularly with the government imposing news blackouts. A video of Roman Protasevich appearing to confess to crimes was released by Belarus authorities late on Monday Mr Protasevich now works for a different Telegram channel, Belamova. In the video clip released after his arrest, he said he was in good health and seemingly confessed to crimes he had been charged with by the Belarusian state. But activists, including the country's main opposition leader, criticised the video and suggested Mr Protasevich was under pressure to admit wrongdoing. Mr Protasevich's father has told the BBC he fears his son may be tortured. Dmitri Protasevich said on Monday he was ""really afraid"" of how his son would be treated by the authorities in his home country.

"Patrick Ennis was one of three paramedics to work at the scene of the blast A paramedic first on the scene of the Manchester Arena bombing did not give immediate treatment to casualties because his role was to assess the scene, an inquiry has heard. Patrick Ennis was one of three paramedics to work at the blast scene. He explained he did not immediately start treating people because it was his job to prepare for a wider major incident response. Mr Ennis said his training was to assess who was most in need of help. Twenty-two people were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of an Ariana Grande concert at about 22:30 BST on 22 May 2017. The inquiry heard Mr Ennis arrived at the scene 21 minutes after the bomb had gone off. He said he spent 90 minutes triaging patients and deciding who was most in need of urgent care. Mr Ennis explained to the hearing as the first person from the ambulance service on the scene, treating the injured ""would occur sometime into the incident"", and added ""it was not practical at that stage"". Mr Ennis agreed that some people may see it as a ""brutal way to approach the situation"" but that was the way he had been trained to provide an ""overall grip"" on a major incident. Twenty-two people were killed in the May 2017 bombing The advanced paramedic said although he expected more colleagues to follow him into the foyer, he realised it was going to take some time. ""I think the numbers that we had available at that time just simply didn't allow for any deployment of large number of paramedics into the City Room."" Arena police chief did not share safety situation Abedi brother demands immunity at inquiry Arena police chief 'not the right man for the job' Mr Ennis told the inquiry he was made aware by firearms police officers that they did not think that area was safe. ""I believe that's one of the reasons why it wasn't possible to deploy further paramedics as they arrived into that area,"" he said. Mr Ennis said the decision to move critically injured people from the foyer down to the station concourse was why only two more paramedics went into the bomb scene. The inquiry continues.

"Events were held to mark the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd His dying moments were filmed and watched by millions, sparking global protests about policing and racial justice George's brother Philonise said a White House meeting with Biden went well 'The Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage' US President Joe Biden said The impact of Floyd's death was felt in the worlds of politics, business, sport and entertainment in dozens of countries 'More people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago,' says Barack Obama The anniversary was marked in UK cities including Birmingham, Edinburgh, London, Manchester and Swansea Gunfire briefly interrupted the commemorations near the spot where Floyd died but no one was hurt Ex-policeman Derek Chauvin, whose knee was on Floyd's neck area, has been jailed for murder Edited by Ritu Prasad and Marianna Brady That wraps up our coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's death. His murder by a police officer last year sparked global protests and altered perspectives on race and policing.  Our live coverage was provided by Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich, Max Matza and Mal Sirat Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Cortez Rice is wearing a walking cast: healing a bone bruised by a tear gas cannister in a recent protest, he says. But that doesnât slow him down. He hasnât slowed down since the death of his âbeloved friendâ George Floyd, someone he calls a role model. Rice believes that pressure on the streets helped secure a guilty verdict for Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of murdering Floyd. Now heâs focusing on using the law to change the way policing is done. He says he joined the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) so he could familiarise himself with police reform bills. He laughs when I suggest heâs giving himself a legal education, but agrees: âNow thatâs a big changeâ from last year. Many lives have been changed, even if wider reforms have been slow to follow. âWeâve just got to keep going,â says Rice. And at a rally marking the anniversary, he steps up with his cast to carry a box representing George Floydâs coffin, a symbolic pallbearer in a never-ending funeral. ""He's a genuine guy,"" says Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, after leaving a meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris. Floyd's daughter Gianna ""had an absolute ball"", says a lawyer for the family. ""Say his name,"" she said, as the family raised their fists and called out in unison: ""George Floyd."" Meanwhile, Floyd's sister Bridgett denounced Biden for ""breaking a promise"" to pass a police reform bill by today. She spoke at a rally in Minneapolis surrounded by the mayor and other city officials. This video can not be played George Floyd's family speaks on the White House lawn Reality Check In 1963, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr led the March on Washington to demand racial and economic justice. So what's changed since then? The black-white wealth gap was larger in 2019 than it was in 1983, when black family wealth data was first collected. There hasn't been much movement in the disparity between the wages of black and white Americans either. But there have been some upward trends: more African Americans had completed four years of higher education by 2019 than ever before - 26% compared with just 4% in 1962. We've looked at six measures, including poverty, education, wages and congressional representation to answer the question:How far have African Americans come since the 1960s? Miriam Walker-KhanBBC Sport US football player Colin Kaepernick started kneeling to protest racial inequity in 2016 Almost a year on from the death of George Floyd, the world of sport has seen hundreds, if not thousands of athletes protesting against racial injustice on a global scale. But on 22 April 2021, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that acts of protest - such as taking a knee - will continue to be banned at the Olympic Games, which begin in July. During a 10-month consultation process, the IOC asked 3,547 athletes whether its 'Rule 50' - which bans demonstrations - should change. A total of 67% said they wanted to keep the Olympic podium free of protests and 70% were keen to avoid on-field demonstrations. Gwen Berry, who competes in the hammer throw for the USA, responded with a powerful post on Instagram. ""I wished that Botham Jean was afforded that same choice when he was murdered in his home,"" she wrote, referring to a black man killed by an off-duty Dallas police officer who mistook his apartment for her own. ""Not to mention the countless individuals whose names are added to a growing list. This is my reason for not wavering. I will not shut up and throw."" Read the full story:How sport joined the fight for change Koralie BarrauBBC News A mourner at Floyd's funeral wears a shirt saying ""tired"" Black Americans are exhausted, and the anniversary of George Floyd's murder is a reminder that with every police killing of a black person, another cycle of grief and pain is re-triggered. Over the course of the Derek Chauvin trial, I spoke to many activists in the Minneapolis area about this constant exhaustion and how it takes a toll on their mental health continuously reliving past traumas. For them, the death of George Floyd was one of the most brutal images of police brutality and racism, but ultimately is part of a policing system that has always targeted predominately black and brown individuals. During the trial of Derek Chauvin, this exhaustion was on display at George Floyd Square, where Floyd was killed, with signs and graffiti saying: âIâm so tiredâ. One activist, DA Bullock, told us: ""We canât have another George Floyd in a year, two years, three yearsâ¦Because I can't go through another death, like that. It takes too much out of us, it really does harm us as individuals and harms us as a community."" For Deborah Watts, the cousin of Emmet Till - a black boy who was lynched over 60 years ago - time alone does not heal her wounds. She says that with every police killing, her wound is reopened again. Much of her work in Minneapolis seeks to work with families who have lost loved ones in encounters with police. Nearly everyone we spoke to in the city said that true justice equates to a fundamental change in the judicial system. They believe that despite this exhaustion they feel, they must continue to fight for justice, equality, and accountability. This video can not be played Why the Chauvin trial âexhaustsâ black America Kristen Clarke is now overseeing an investigation into Minneapolis police The US Senate has voted to confirm Kristen Clarke as the first black woman to run the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The vote passed narrowly on Tuesday afternoon with only one Republican vote (Maine's Susan Collins). Clarke is a first-generation American whose parents came to the US from Jamaica. She holds degrees from Columbia and Harvard universities. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the timing of her confirmation ""particularly poignant and appropriate"" given today's anniversary. The civil rights department that she now heads is already investigating the Minneapolis Police Department after Floyd's killer was convicted last month. They are also investigating the police in Louisville, Kentucky, for the killing ofBreonna Taylor. Reality Check The figures that are available for incidents in which the police shoot and kill people show that for African-Americans, there's a much higher chance of being fatally shot relative to their overall numbers in the US population. According to the Washington Postâs police shootings database, although African-Americans make up less than 14% of the population, they accounted for almost 24% of over 6,000 fatal shootings by the police since 2015. Further research shows the rate that police fatally shoot unarmed black people in the US is more than three times as high as it is for white people. Other studies have shown that black people are more likely to be pulled over in traffic stops by police. One of the most recent, a 2020 study by Stanford University, analysed 100m traffic stops by police departments across the US and found black drivers were about 20% more likely to be stopped than white drivers. African-Americans are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drugs are used at similar levels. Overall, African-Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans and twice the rate of Hispanic-Americans, according to the latest data. These rates have dropped for African-Americans over the last decade, but they still make up more of the prison population than any other race.

Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News James Bryd Jr's murder led to the creation of a federal hate crime law Twenty-two years before the death of George Floyd, another brutal murder of a black man shocked the conscience of America and forced a racial reckoning. WARNING THIS STORY CONTAINS DISTRESSING DESCRIPTIONS. James Byrd Jr was killed by three white supremacists who drove him down a dark country road and beat him. Then they chained him alive to a pickup truck and dragged his body for three miles - until he was decapitated. Two of the murderers were executed for the crime. The other is serving a life sentence. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed a federal hate crime bill into law which is named after James Byrd Jr (as well as Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in 1998 because he was gay). My colleague AngÃ©lica Casas and I visited the Texas town of Jasper this month to find out how Byrd's family is coping two decades after such an unspeakable crime. His daughter, Jamie, told us how she had reacted to his murder. ""I was numb, I was in denial. I was 16-years-old, so love and forgiveness were no part of my thought process at that moment."" Jamie says she still feels angry but chooses to channel it into positive actions. Now a police officer in Houston, she draws a connection between the murders of her father and George Floyd. ""My dad did not get killed at the hands of a police officer, but in today's world, that is what we're seeing. ""We're seeing a lot of brutality by the hands of officers, unfortunately."" Byrd's daughter, Jamie, says Floyd's killing deeply impacted her She says it was a challenge to put on the uniform after George Floyd's murder as protests against police brutality and racism spread across the world. Ultimately, she decided it was more important to keep serving her community. ""I want to be that officer, just be there in solidarity, and say 'hey, I know what you're going through'. You can watch our film about James Byrd Jr on the BBC News website on Friday. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The latest clashes between Israel and the Palestinians have revealed exactly how much the political centre of gravity in the Democratic Party has moved on the conflict in recent years, and especially after civil rights protests sparked by George Floydâs murder. In a recent column, Jewish-American Senator Bernie Sanders paid tribute to the rise of ""a new generation of activists"". ""We saw these activists in American streets last summer in the wake of the murder of George Floyd,"" he writes. ""We see them in Israel. We see them in the Palestinian territories."" His final words lift a direct line from the Black Lives Matter movement: ""Palestinian lives matter"". Sanders is noting what has become obvious during clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians over the past two weeks. Americans who found their political voice during last summer's activism in US cities are now turning their focus, and their rhetoric, on what they see as similar unchecked oppression in the Middle East. Reality Check More people are killed by police in the US than in any other developed country. Among these killings, black Americans are killed at a higher rate compared with the percentage of the population they represent. Most are shot dead. Part of this is to do with gun culture, but there are also growing calls for improved police training to reduce the use of lethal force. On average, US officers spend around 21 weeks in training before they go on patrol. That is far less than in most other developed countries, according to a report by the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform (ICJTR).  US police academies also spend far more time on firearm training than on de-escalating a situation - 71 hours against 21, on average. Prof Maria Haberfeld at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says: ""This is why you see officers very rapidly escalating from initial communication to the actual physical use of force, because this is how they train."" BBC Reality Check has looked into how the training requirements in the US compare with other countries. Read more here: How US police training compares with the rest of the world Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Activists continue to demand root and branch change of what they say is a brutal, racist policing system. But this past year has also been hard on police. Mylan Masson, a former Minneapolis police trainer, says sheâs never seen morale so low. The department has lost more than 200 officers to early retirement, transfer or medical leave for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). There is confusion over competing proposals for reform, and a backlash from citizens. ""The officers don't know what the community feels about them,â she said. âWhat should we be doing? Everything we do, is it going to be judged? Is everything we're doing going to be put through scrutiny that we've never had before? We have things that we need to discuss with the community and make them feel comfortable with us again.â The department has come under federal investigation and Mylan says there are problems that need to be fixed. But the focus on bad cops is wearing. âWe try to... do the best we can and all of a sudden you see something else just horrible happen,â she says. âAnd it's traumatic.â Joe Biden speaks at the White House earlier this month We heard moments ago from George Floyd's family about their meeting with the president and vice-president, and now Biden's released his own response, praising the family for their ""extraordinary courage"". Floyd's murder ""launched a summer of protests"", Biden said in a statement, which ""peacefully unified people of every race and generation to collectively say enough of the senseless killings"". Biden also called for action, writing that real change will be delivered only when there is accountability in the nation's law enforcement. ""The negotiations on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in Congress are ongoing,"" he said. ""It's my hope that they will get a bill to my desk quickly."" ""We have to act,"" he said. George Floyd's family spoke to reporters briefly after a private hour-long meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris. In quick succession, several members of Floyd's family made comments, many of them thanking Biden and Harris for the meeting. His brother Rodney Floyd said the family was grateful for the concern the president and vice-president showed. ""Being here today is an honour,"" said another brother, Terrence. ""I feel it was a very productive conversation and I'm grateful for it."" The family also addressed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which they called for Congress to pass. Biden has so far failed to push the bill through, missing his own deadline of today. The president is waiting for the ""right"" bill to be passed, Floyd's nephew Brandon said, instead of rushing one through. ""We just want this George Floyd Policing Act to be passed in the future,"" said brother Philonise Floyd. ""If you can make federal laws to protect the bird, the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of colour."" There was also a moment of levity during the meeting, the family said. Joe Biden interacted and played with Gianna Floyd, George's 7-year-old daughter. ""She had an absolute ball,"" a family lawyer said. According to a recent NPR poll, 51% of Americans approve of Democratic President Joe Bidenâs handling of race relations. But the numbers break down as expected along party lines. Among Democrats, about 85% say they approve. About half of independents and only 14% of Republicans approve. About one-third of Americans say they think things will improve under Biden, while another third say race relations will stay the same. Thatâs an uptick from Donald Trumpâs presidency when a majority of Americans said they expected race relations to worsen. Family members of George Floyd are outside the White House now, speaking to reporters after a private meeting with President Joe Biden. The meeting was ""great"" said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother. Bridgett Floyd speaks at a rally this past summer in Washington While several of her family members are in Washington to meet with President Biden, George Floyd's sister Bridgett stayed in Minneapolis, where she is attending a rally for her brother. She said she had passed on the White House meeting because the president has not yet managed to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act through Congress - which Biden had said would be done by today.Democrats first proposed the police reform bill last June. ""He broke his promise, but I am going to give him a couple more weeks,"" Bridgett said, according to local media. And she added this message for the president: ""Get your people in order."" Martin Luther King III said police brutality was continuing (file photo) Martin Luther King III, human rights advocate and son of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr, has told the BBC he fears that not enough has changed one year on from George Floyd's murder. ""This is a marathon,"" he says. ""People's emotions around the world were evoked to see a public servant whose job is to
protect and serve, being judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" he adds, referring to the actions of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. ""Although
one might say a year later it has subsided, the fact of the matter is that
there are still demonstrations going on, and part of it is because [police]
shootings have not stopped. ""So the incidents continue, there has been no
movement or transition"". Welcome to our live coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's murder. President Joe Bidenis currently meeting with members ofFloyd's family. Earlier today, the president wrote on Twitter that they had shown ""extraordinary courage"" in the year since George Floyd died. Demonstrations and marches are happening across the country to commemorate the day. People have taken to the streets inNew York, Los Angeles, PortlandandHouston. And much like the demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death last year, today's memorial is global. Demonstrators have gathered inEdinburgh, GlasgowandLondon,andCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaumarked the day, calling Floyd's death a ""tragedy"" and a reminder that anti-black racism and injustice persists. The memorial in Minneapolis at George Floyd Square was briefly interrupted by reports ofshots firedthough there was only one report of a possible injury from the incident. Stay with us as we bring you more updates from the day. Medical student Mikaela Loach read a poem at the vigil in Edinburgh Here's more from the vigil we reported has been taking place outside the Scottish Parliament
at Holyrood in Edinburgh. Medical
student and activist Mikaela Loach wrote and read a poem at the gathering. It included the lines: ""I want to be me, fully. To be loved, fully. To breathe in

to suffocate."" Loach told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that writing helps me take the stuff that is

His murder by a police officer last year sparked global protests and altered perspectives on race and policing.  Our live coverage was provided by Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich, Max Matza and Mal Sirat Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Cortez Rice is wearing a walking cast: healing a bone bruised by a tear gas cannister in a recent protest, he says. But that doesnât slow him down. He hasnât slowed down since the death of his âbeloved friendâ George Floyd, someone he calls a role model. Rice believes that pressure on the streets helped secure a guilty verdict for Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of murdering Floyd. Now heâs focusing on using the law to change the way policing is done. He says he joined the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) so he could familiarise himself with police reform bills. He laughs when I suggest heâs giving himself a legal education, but agrees: âNow thatâs a big changeâ from last year. Many lives have been changed, even if wider reforms have been slow to follow. âWeâve just got to keep going,â says Rice. And at a rally marking the anniversary, he steps up with his cast to carry a box representing George Floydâs coffin, a symbolic pallbearer in a never-ending funeral. ""He's a genuine guy,"" says Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, after leaving a meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris. Floyd's daughter Gianna ""had an absolute ball"", says a lawyer for the family. ""Say his name,"" she said, as the family raised their fists and called out in unison: ""George Floyd."" Meanwhile, Floyd's sister Bridgett denounced Biden for ""breaking a promise"" to pass a police reform bill by today. She spoke at a rally in Minneapolis surrounded by the mayor and other city officials. This video can not be played George Floyd's family speaks on the White House lawn Reality Check In 1963, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr led the March on Washington to demand racial and economic justice. So what's changed since then? The black-white wealth gap was larger in 2019 than it was in 1983, when black family wealth data was first collected. There hasn't been much movement in the disparity between the wages of black and white Americans either. But there have been some upward trends: more African Americans had completed four years of higher education by 2019 than ever before - 26% compared with just 4% in 1962. We've looked at six measures, including poverty, education, wages and congressional representation to answer the question:How far have African Americans come since the 1960s? Miriam Walker-KhanBBC Sport US football player Colin Kaepernick started kneeling to protest racial inequity in 2016 Almost a year on from the death of George Floyd, the world of sport has seen hundreds, if not thousands of athletes protesting against racial injustice on a global scale. But on 22 April 2021, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that acts of protest - such as taking a knee - will continue to be banned at the Olympic Games, which begin in July. During a 10-month consultation process, the IOC asked 3,547 athletes whether its 'Rule 50' - which bans demonstrations - should change. A total of 67% said they wanted to keep the Olympic podium free of protests and 70% were keen to avoid on-field demonstrations. Gwen Berry, who competes in the hammer throw for the USA, responded with a powerful post on Instagram. ""I wished that Botham Jean was afforded that same choice when he was murdered in his home,"" she wrote, referring to a black man killed by an off-duty Dallas police officer who mistook his apartment for her own. ""Not to mention the countless individuals whose names are added to a growing list. This is my reason for not wavering. I will not shut up and throw."" Read the full story:How sport joined the fight for change Koralie BarrauBBC News A mourner at Floyd's funeral wears a shirt saying ""tired"" Black Americans are exhausted, and the anniversary of George Floyd's murder is a reminder that with every police killing of a black person, another cycle of grief and pain is re-triggered. Over the course of the Derek Chauvin trial, I spoke to many activists in the Minneapolis area about this constant exhaustion and how it takes a toll on their mental health continuously reliving past traumas. For them, the death of George Floyd was one of the most brutal images of police brutality and racism, but ultimately is part of a policing system that has always targeted predominately black and brown individuals. During the trial of Derek Chauvin, this exhaustion was on display at George Floyd Square, where Floyd was killed, with signs and graffiti saying: âIâm so tiredâ. One activist, DA Bullock, told us: ""We canât have another George Floyd in a year, two years, three yearsâ¦Because I can't go through another death, like that. It takes too much out of us, it really does harm us as individuals and harms us as a community."" For Deborah Watts, the cousin of Emmet Till - a black boy who was lynched over 60 years ago - time alone does not heal her wounds. She says that with every police killing, her wound is reopened again. Much of her work in Minneapolis seeks to work with families who have lost loved ones in encounters with police. Nearly everyone we spoke to in the city said that true justice equates to a fundamental change in the judicial system. They believe that despite this exhaustion they feel, they must continue to fight for justice, equality, and accountability. This video can not be played Why the Chauvin trial âexhaustsâ black America Kristen Clarke is now overseeing an investigation into Minneapolis police The US Senate has voted to confirm Kristen Clarke as the first black woman to run the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The vote passed narrowly on Tuesday afternoon with only one Republican vote (Maine's Susan Collins). Clarke is a first-generation American whose parents came to the US from Jamaica. She holds degrees from Columbia and Harvard universities. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the timing of her confirmation ""particularly poignant and appropriate"" given today's anniversary.

Floyd's daughter Gianna ""had an absolute ball"", says a lawyer for the family. ""Say his name,"" she said, as the family raised their fists and called out in unison: ""George Floyd."" Meanwhile, Floyd's sister Bridgett denounced Biden for ""breaking a promise"" to pass a police reform bill by today.

So what's changed since then? The black-white wealth gap was larger in 2019 than it was in 1983, when black family wealth data was first collected. There hasn't been much movement in the disparity between the wages of black and white Americans either. But there have been some upward trends: more African Americans had completed four years of higher education by 2019 than ever before - 26% compared with just 4% in 1962. We've looked at six measures, including poverty, education, wages and congressional representation to answer the question:How far have African Americans come since the 1960s? Miriam Walker-KhanBBC Sport US football player Colin Kaepernick started kneeling to protest racial inequity in 2016 Almost a year on from the death of George Floyd, the world of sport has seen hundreds, if not thousands of athletes protesting against racial injustice on a global scale. But on 22 April 2021, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that acts of protest - such as taking a knee - will continue to be banned at the Olympic Games, which begin in July. During a 10-month consultation process, the IOC asked 3,547 athletes whether its 'Rule 50' - which bans demonstrations - should change. A total of 67% said they wanted to keep the Olympic podium free of protests and 70% were keen to avoid on-field demonstrations. Gwen Berry, who competes in the hammer throw for the USA, responded with a powerful post on Instagram. ""I wished that Botham Jean was afforded that same choice when he was murdered in his home,"" she wrote, referring to a black man killed by an off-duty Dallas police officer who mistook his apartment for her own. ""Not to mention the countless individuals whose names are added to a growing list. This is my reason for not wavering. I will not shut up and throw."" Read the full story:How sport joined the fight for change Koralie BarrauBBC News A mourner at Floyd's funeral wears a shirt saying ""tired"" Black Americans are exhausted, and the anniversary of George Floyd's murder is a reminder that with every police killing of a black person, another cycle of grief and pain is re-triggered. Over the course of the Derek Chauvin trial, I spoke to many activists in the Minneapolis area about this constant exhaustion and how it takes a toll on their mental health continuously reliving past traumas. For them, the death of George Floyd was one of the most brutal images of police brutality and racism, but ultimately is part of a policing system that has always targeted predominately black and brown individuals. During the trial of Derek Chauvin, this exhaustion was on display at George Floyd Square, where Floyd was killed, with signs and graffiti saying: âIâm so tiredâ. One activist, DA Bullock, told us: ""We canât have another George Floyd in a year, two years, three yearsâ¦Because I can't go through another death, like that. It takes too much out of us, it really does harm us as individuals and harms us as a community."" For Deborah Watts, the cousin of Emmet Till - a black boy who was lynched over 60 years ago - time alone does not heal her wounds. She says that with every police killing, her wound is reopened again. Much of her work in Minneapolis seeks to work with families who have lost loved ones in encounters with police. Nearly everyone we spoke to in the city said that true justice equates to a fundamental change in the judicial system. They believe that despite this exhaustion they feel, they must continue to fight for justice, equality, and accountability. This video can not be played Why the Chauvin trial âexhaustsâ black America Kristen Clarke is now overseeing an investigation into Minneapolis police The US Senate has voted to confirm Kristen Clarke as the first black woman to run the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The vote passed narrowly on Tuesday afternoon with only one Republican vote (Maine's Susan Collins). Clarke is a first-generation American whose parents came to the US from Jamaica. She holds degrees from Columbia and Harvard universities. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the timing of her confirmation ""particularly poignant and appropriate"" given today's anniversary. The civil rights department that she now heads is already investigating the Minneapolis Police Department after Floyd's killer was convicted last month. They are also investigating the police in Louisville, Kentucky, for the killing ofBreonna Taylor. Reality Check The figures that are available for incidents in which the police shoot and kill people show that for African-Americans, there's a much higher chance of being fatally shot relative to their overall numbers in the US population. According to the Washington Postâs police shootings database, although African-Americans make up less than 14% of the population, they accounted for almost 24% of over 6,000 fatal shootings by the police since 2015. Further research shows the rate that police fatally shoot unarmed black people in the US is more than three times as high as it is for white people. Other studies have shown that black people are more likely to be pulled over in traffic stops by police. One of the most recent, a 2020 study by Stanford University, analysed 100m traffic stops by police departments across the US and found black drivers were about 20% more likely to be stopped than white drivers. African-Americans are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drugs are used at similar levels. Overall, African-Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans and twice the rate of Hispanic-Americans, according to the latest data. These rates have dropped for African-Americans over the last decade, but they still make up more of the prison population than any other race.

Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News James Bryd Jr's murder led to the creation of a federal hate crime law Twenty-two years before the death of George Floyd, another brutal murder of a black man shocked the conscience of America and forced a racial reckoning. WARNING THIS STORY CONTAINS DISTRESSING DESCRIPTIONS. James Byrd Jr was killed by three white supremacists who drove him down a dark country road and beat him. Then they chained him alive to a pickup truck and dragged his body for three miles - until he was decapitated. Two of the murderers were executed for the crime. The other is serving a life sentence. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed a federal hate crime bill into law which is named after James Byrd Jr (as well as Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in 1998 because he was gay). My colleague AngÃ©lica Casas and I visited the Texas town of Jasper this month to find out how Byrd's family is coping two decades after such an unspeakable crime. His daughter, Jamie, told us how she had reacted to his murder. ""I was numb, I was in denial. I was 16-years-old, so love and forgiveness were no part of my thought process at that moment."" Jamie says she still feels angry but chooses to channel it into positive actions. Now a police officer in Houston, she draws a connection between the murders of her father and George Floyd. ""My dad did not get killed at the hands of a police officer, but in today's world, that is what we're seeing. ""We're seeing a lot of brutality by the hands of officers, unfortunately."" Byrd's daughter, Jamie, says Floyd's killing deeply impacted her She says it was a challenge to put on the uniform after George Floyd's murder as protests against police brutality and racism spread across the world. Ultimately, she decided it was more important to keep serving her community. ""I want to be that officer, just be there in solidarity, and say 'hey, I know what you're going through'. You can watch our film about James Byrd Jr on the BBC News website on Friday. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The latest clashes between Israel and the Palestinians have revealed exactly how much the political centre of gravity in the Democratic Party has moved on the conflict in recent years, and especially after civil rights protests sparked by George Floydâs murder. In a recent column, Jewish-American Senator Bernie Sanders paid tribute to the rise of ""a new generation of activists"". ""We saw these activists in American streets last summer in the wake of the murder of George Floyd,"" he writes. ""We see them in Israel. We see them in the Palestinian territories."" His final words lift a direct line from the Black Lives Matter movement: ""Palestinian lives matter"". Sanders is noting what has become obvious during clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians over the past two weeks. Americans who found their political voice during last summer's activism in US cities are now turning their focus, and their rhetoric, on what they see as similar unchecked oppression in the Middle East. Reality Check More people are killed by police in the US than in any other developed country. Among these killings, black Americans are killed at a higher rate compared with the percentage of the population they represent. Most are shot dead. Part of this is to do with gun culture, but there are also growing calls for improved police training to reduce the use of lethal force. On average, US officers spend around 21 weeks in training before they go on patrol. That is far less than in most other developed countries, according to a report by the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform (ICJTR).  US police academies also spend far more time on firearm training than on de-escalating a situation - 71 hours against 21, on average. Prof Maria Haberfeld at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says: ""This is why you see officers very rapidly escalating from initial communication to the actual physical use of force, because this is how they train."" BBC Reality Check has looked into how the training requirements in the US compare with other countries. Read more here: How US police training compares with the rest of the world Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Activists continue to demand root and branch change of what they say is a brutal, racist policing system. But this past year has also been hard on police. Mylan Masson, a former Minneapolis police trainer, says sheâs never seen morale so low. The department has lost more than 200 officers to early retirement, transfer or medical leave for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). There is confusion over competing proposals for reform, and a backlash from citizens. ""The officers don't know what the community feels about them,â she said. âWhat should we be doing? Everything we do, is it going to be judged? Is everything we're doing going to be put through scrutiny that we've never had before? We have things that we need to discuss with the community and make them feel comfortable with us again.â The department has come under federal investigation and Mylan says there are problems that need to be fixed. But the focus on bad cops is wearing. âWe try to... do the best we can and all of a sudden you see something else just horrible happen,â she says. âAnd it's traumatic.â Joe Biden speaks at the White House earlier this month We heard moments ago from George Floyd's family about their meeting with the president and vice-president, and now Biden's released his own response, praising the family for their ""extraordinary courage"". Floyd's murder ""launched a summer of protests"", Biden said in a statement, which ""peacefully unified people of every race and generation to collectively say enough of the senseless killings"". Biden also called for action, writing that real change will be delivered only when there is accountability in the nation's law enforcement. ""The negotiations on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in Congress are ongoing,"" he said. ""It's my hope that they will get a bill to my desk quickly."" ""We have to act,"" he said. George Floyd's family spoke to reporters briefly after a private hour-long meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris. In quick succession, several members of Floyd's family made comments, many of them thanking Biden and Harris for the meeting. His brother Rodney Floyd said the family was grateful for the concern the president and vice-president showed. ""Being here today is an honour,"" said another brother, Terrence. ""I feel it was a very productive conversation and I'm grateful for it."" The family also addressed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which they called for Congress to pass. Biden has so far failed to push the bill through, missing his own deadline of today. The president is waiting for the ""right"" bill to be passed, Floyd's nephew Brandon said, instead of rushing one through. ""We just want this George Floyd Policing Act to be passed in the future,"" said brother Philonise Floyd. ""If you can make federal laws to protect the bird, the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of colour."" There was also a moment of levity during the meeting, the family said. Joe Biden interacted and played with Gianna Floyd, George's 7-year-old daughter. ""She had an absolute ball,"" a family lawyer said. According to a recent NPR poll, 51% of Americans approve of Democratic President Joe Bidenâs handling of race relations. But the numbers break down as expected along party lines. Among Democrats, about 85% say they approve. About half of independents and only 14% of Republicans approve. About one-third of Americans say they think things will improve under Biden, while another third say race relations will stay the same. Thatâs an uptick from Donald Trumpâs presidency when a majority of Americans said they expected race relations to worsen. Family members of George Floyd are outside the White House now, speaking to reporters after a private meeting with President Joe Biden. The meeting was ""great"" said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother. Bridgett Floyd speaks at a rally this past summer in Washington While several of her family members are in Washington to meet with President Biden, George Floyd's sister Bridgett stayed in Minneapolis, where she is attending a rally for her brother. She said she had passed on the White House meeting because the president has not yet managed to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act through Congress - which Biden had said would be done by today.Democrats first proposed the police reform bill last June. ""He broke his promise, but I am going to give him a couple more weeks,"" Bridgett said, according to local media. And she added this message for the president: ""Get your people in order."" Martin Luther King III said police brutality was continuing (file photo) Martin Luther King III, human rights advocate and son of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr, has told the BBC he fears that not enough has changed one year on from George Floyd's murder. ""This is a marathon,"" he says. ""People's emotions around the world were evoked to see a public servant whose job is to
protect and serve, being judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" he adds, referring to the actions of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. ""Although
one might say a year later it has subsided, the fact of the matter is that
there are still demonstrations going on, and part of it is because [police]
shootings have not stopped. ""So the incidents continue, there has been no
movement or transition"". Welcome to our live coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's murder. President Joe Bidenis currently meeting with members ofFloyd's family. Earlier today, the president wrote on Twitter that they had shown ""extraordinary courage"" in the year since George Floyd died. Demonstrations and marches are happening across the country to commemorate the day. People have taken to the streets inNew York, Los Angeles, PortlandandHouston. And much like the demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death last year, today's memorial is global. Demonstrators have gathered inEdinburgh, GlasgowandLondon,andCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaumarked the day, calling Floyd's death a ""tragedy"" and a reminder that anti-black racism and injustice persists. The memorial in Minneapolis at George Floyd Square was briefly interrupted by reports ofshots firedthough there was only one report of a possible injury from the incident. Stay with us as we bring you more updates from the day. Medical student Mikaela Loach read a poem at the vigil in Edinburgh Here's more from the vigil we reported has been taking place outside the Scottish Parliament
at Holyrood in Edinburgh. Medical
student and activist Mikaela Loach wrote and read a poem at the gathering. It included the lines: ""I want to be me, fully. To be loved, fully. To breathe in
deep, to fill my lungs, feels like an act of rebellion in a world that wants me
to suffocate."" Loach told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that writing helps me take the stuff that is
bubbling up within and express it. ""The
stress of living in a world that doesnât want you to exist in the fullness of
who you are, that harms you."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.007976161

But that doesnât slow him down. He hasnât slowed down since the death of his âbeloved friendâ George Floyd, someone he calls a role model. Rice believes that pressure on the streets helped secure a guilty verdict for Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of murdering Floyd. Now heâs focusing on using the law to change the way policing is done. He says he joined the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) so he could familiarise himself with police reform bills. He laughs when I suggest heâs giving himself a legal education, but agrees: âNow thatâs a big changeâ from last year. Many lives have been changed, even if wider reforms have been slow to follow. âWeâve just got to keep going,â says Rice. And at a rally marking the anniversary, he steps up with his cast to carry a box representing George Floydâs coffin, a symbolic pallbearer in a never-ending funeral.

""This is a marathon,"" he says. ""People's emotions around the world were evoked to see a public servant whose job is to
protect and serve, being judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" he adds, referring to the actions of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. ""Although
one might say a year later it has subsided, the fact of the matter is that
there are still demonstrations going on, and part of it is because [police]
shootings have not stopped. ""So the incidents continue, there has been no
movement or transition"". Welcome to our live coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's murder. President Joe Bidenis currently meeting with members ofFloyd's family. Earlier today, the president wrote on Twitter that they had shown ""extraordinary courage"" in the year since George Floyd died. Demonstrations and marches are happening across the country to commemorate the day. People have taken to the streets inNew York, Los Angeles, PortlandandHouston. And much like the demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death last year, today's memorial is global. Demonstrators have gathered inEdinburgh, GlasgowandLondon,andCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaumarked the day, calling Floyd's death a ""tragedy"" and a reminder that anti-black racism and injustice persists. The memorial in Minneapolis at George Floyd Square was briefly interrupted by reports ofshots firedthough there was only one report of a possible injury from the incident.

Medical student Mikaela Loach read a poem at the vigil in Edinburgh Here's more from the vigil we reported has been taking place outside the Scottish Parliament
at Holyrood in Edinburgh. Medical
student and activist Mikaela Loach wrote and read a poem at the gathering. It included the lines: ""I want to be me, fully. To be loved, fully. To breathe in
deep, to fill my lungs, feels like an act of rebellion in a world that wants me
to suffocate."" Loach told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that writing helps me take the stuff that is
bubbling up within and express it. ""The

who you are, that harms you."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0010397026
"Jill Killington says she was told as a pregnant 16-year-old being an unmarried mother was a ""fate worse than death"" Hundreds of women forced into giving up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s have called on the prime minister to issue a government apology. Up to 250,000 women in Britain were coerced into handing over their babies because they were unmarried. Many of the women never had more children and say the loss caused them to lead a lifetime of grief. They want the UK to follow Australia, which in 2013 was the first country to apologise for forced adoptions. 'A lifelong legacy of pain and suffering' Irish PM apologises over mother and baby homes 'They called us fallen women, bad women' ""It was the most shameful thing that could happen,"" says Jill Killington from Leeds. She became pregnant in 1967, aged 16, and says being an unmarried mother ""was described as a fate worse than death"". She recalls having to stay upstairs at her home to hide her growing tummy, so she was out of sight when anyone visited. ""My mother asked me to wear a wedding ring when I went out. It was a deeply humiliating time,"" she says. This video can not be played Judy Baker gave birth aged 18 and was pressured into giving up her baby for adoption Veronica Smith became pregnant in 1965 while working as a nurse at a Butlin's Holiday Camp in Bognor Regis in West Sussex. The chilling reality of her situation hit home when she broke the news to her mother. ""My mother told me if my father found out it would kill him, so I never told him, ever."" Instead, Veronica was secretly sent to a mother and baby home in a part of London not far from her parents' house and she would meet up with her mother on Wimbledon railway station every Saturday. ""She would bring a blank airmail envelope and I would write a letter saying I was in Spain enjoying work and life. She would then take the letter home and show it to my father, who believed I was in Spain."" Lawyers examining the birth mothers' cases have focused on the period between 1945 and 1975 - before a change in adoption law - when around 500,000 babies were adopted in Britain, mostly from mothers who were under 24 and unmarried. Their research suggests about half of those women faced sustained pressure to give up their babies from professionals, including doctors, midwives, workers in mother and baby homes and adoption staff in religious and council-run homes. Ann Keen was 17 when she became pregnant in 1966 and recalls a particularly cruel moment during the birth of her son. ""I wasn't given any pain relief,"" she says. ""The midwife said 'you'll remember this, so you won't be wicked again'."" Ann Keen - who later became an MP - was forced to give birth as a teenager without pain relief Ann says she wasn't even given the opportunity to say goodbye to her son. ""Eight days after giving birth, I went to the hospital nursery to see him and he wasn't there,"" she says. ""The midwife told me 'he's gone. He's in that room over there. They'll be happy and that's the last you'll see of him'."" Ann says: ""It was coercion. The phrase they used was, 'This is for the best' and 'if you really love your baby, you should give him up'."" For Diana Defries, who was 16 when she became pregnant, it was a different kind of trauma. She says the moment after she gave birth someone in the delivery room announced, ""this baby is flagged for adoption and I'll take her away"". ""I yelled to bring her back,"" says Diana. ""But the nurse then just walked past me and put my daughter on a table out of my reach. They all then left the room with just me and my crying baby. All I could croak was 'help me, please'. ""At that moment, I remember thinking, it would be better for me to die."" Diana says: ""I do feel my social worker used coercion. The bullying wore me down"". Diana Defries says she pleaded for her baby to be brought back to her To enable an adoption, the women were supposed to sign consent forms. But some experts have doubts about the legality of some of the consent processes.â¯ Solicitor Carolynn Gallwey, who has acted for the birth mothers, says all of those she has spoken to said they had no choice but to sign the consent form. She says there is also evidence to show some mothers' forms may have been signed by other people, such as their parents or even their GP. One document, shown to the BBC by a woman who didn't want to be named, suggests a judge in one of the adoption hearings questioned the authenticity of a signature. Ms Gallwey said the women were also not told they were entitled to financial help or other kinds of support that might have meant they could have kept their children. Many of the adoptees who were given to new families in forced adoptions have also spoken of their shock at what happened to their birth mothers. Some of them say it has added to their own sense of loss. Gaynor Weatherly, whose mother was 16 when she was born in 1963, says: ""It's like a piece of me has been missing. It can eat you up."" Gaynor says she has found happiness through her own marriage and children but that she feels ""cheated out of a different life"". Gaynor Weatherly says the loss of being taken from her mother ""can eat you up"" Some of the adoptees were eventually reunited with their birth mothers, but it often took decades. Rachel Langham, who was born to Veronica Smith, went to live in Canada after she was adopted. She had a loving relationship with her adoptive parents, but says what happened to Veronica was ""inhumane"". ""I feel terrible empathy and sorrow for her and someone should apologise,"" Rachel says. Rachel Langham, pictured as a child and now, says the treatment of her birth mother was ""inhumane"" In her 40s, Rachel was reunited with Veronica. But building a relationship after so many years has been hard, and Veronica says these lifelong repercussions are one more reason why an apology is so essential. Hundreds of women have now written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say they deserve one from the UK government, on behalf of the institutions and individuals who treated them so badly. Birth mothers in Australia received the world's first government apology in 2013 when Julia Gillard, the prime minister at the time, apologised to around 150,000 women whose babies were taken from them. And three years ago, the Canadian Senate recommended the federal government issue an apology to 300,000 Canadian women. In January of this year, the Irish Taoiseach, Micheal Martin, apologised to former residents of mother and baby homes in Ireland for the way they were treated over several decades. The women in Britain, most of whom are now in their 70s and 80s, say an apology would bring lasting comfort. Ann Keen, who went on to become an MP and junior minister, says: ""I did not give up my son or abandon him. An apology would clear my name and my son's name. An historical injustice is what happened. It's time to say sorry."" In a statement, Children and Families minister Vicky Ford said: ""I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those affected by historic forced adoption. We cannot undo the past, but we can be reassured that our legislation and practices have been significantly strengthened since then.""â¯ â¯The 1975â¯and 1989 Children Actsâ¯and the 1976 Adoption Act were among the laws that have made it easier forâ¯adopted childrenâ¯and their birth mothers to regain contact with each other.

"Elliot Page posted the first public picture of himself post-top surgery. Elliot Page has won praise for posing bare-chested for the first time sincecoming out as trans in December. An Instagram post shared by the actor showed him smiling while posing in a pool in swimming shorts alongside the words #transjoy and #transisbeautiful. Page, 34, previously described his top surgery - where breast tissue is removed - as ""life-saving"". Speaking to Oprah Winfrey last monthhe said it made him ""feel comfortable"" in his body ""for probably the first time"". The Umbrella Academy star tearfully explained why his chest had brought him the ""most joy"" in transitioning. ""It's getting out of the shower and the towel's around your waist and you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're just like, 'There I am'. And I'm not having the moment where I'm panicked,"" he said during the Apple TV interview. Page's Instagram post has already received over two million likes and a wave of supportive celebrity comments praising his new appearance. ""Dude I see why you crushed me on that workout!"" actor Justin Cornwell commented. ""Hot"" added singer Miley Cyrus, alongside a heart emoji. The Vampire Diaries' Nina Dobrev said: ""You look amazingâ¦ and most of all happy."" Julianne Moore, who starred with Page in the film Freeheld, wrote: ""Happy summer"" accompanied by a flame emoji. The Good Place star Jameela Jamil also posted in recognition, tweeting that she was pleased to see Page ""thriving"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Winfrey, meanwhile, shared her support by reposting the image on the Oprah Daily Instagram account. ""This is what happiness looks like!"" she wrote. ""Looks like Elliot will be shining brighter than the sun this summer."" Page, a prominent LGBT advocate, also used the pair's April interview to reveal how the surgery had given him a new energy in fighting for trans rights, ""because it is such a freeing, freeing experience"". ""Not only has it been life-changing for me, I do believe it's been life-saving and it's the case for so many people. And because there is such an attack on trans healthcare right now, when already there's such lack of access,"" he continued. This video can not be played ""I feel comfortable in my body for the first time."" Page was referring tolaws in Arkansasand further legal fights across the US threatening to ban young transgender people from accessing certain medical treatments. Kirrin Medcalf, Trans Community Engagement Lead at LGBT charity Stonewall, said the photo emphasised the positive impact that gender affirmation procedures can have upon a person's mental health. ""It's fantastic to see Elliot looking so comfortable and happy in his latest photo. Elliot's has always been a role model to a huge number of people, and it is wonderful that he can share his trans joy with the world. ""Seeing moments of gender euphoria also highlights how important it is for all trans people to be able to access appropriate and timely gender affirming healthcare,"" he said. Felix, 20 (He/Him): ""Looking at Elliot's image, it makes me feel proud to see another trans person - especially a celebrity in the public eye - proudly showing off their top surgery scars, as it increases a wider scope of positivity. ""However, as a person who has had to delay surgery due to the unbearable waiting times on the NHS, it makes me frustrated that people with more money and resources - such as celebrities - do not have to struggle in the same ways as people relying on state healthcare. ""In the UK, it can often up to 10 years, if not longer, to fully medically transition. We should not have to wait this long to feel comfortable in ourselves. ""I have been waiting to medically transition since I was 14. I am 20 now and haven't got anywhere. I am now planning to go to Poland after crowdsourcing funds to complete the surgery privately. I should not have to be at such inconvenience in order to be myself. ""That said, I think the wider impact of Elliot's post is good, as long as we keep having this conversation about privilege and how it plays into securing a medical transition. With each celebration of Elliot's visibility, I hope people will recognise those relying on personal crowdfunds."" Page, who is Canadian-born, made his film breakthrough starring as a pregnant teenager in 2007's Juno - landing an Oscar nomination. Other major films include Inception and the X-Men series, before most recently starring as Vanya Hargreeves in Netflix superhero show Umbrella Academy. Page came out as gay in 2014, telling an audience in Las Vegas: ""I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission.""After three years of marriagehe announced his divorce from choreographer Emma Portner in February.

"It is crucial that surgical services in Northern Ireland are not ""stood down"" again, according to a report by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). The most recent statistics reveal that one in four people in Northern Ireland is on a waiting list. Northern Irelandhas the worst waiting times of any UK region. The Health Minister Robin Swann said tackling waiting lists is a ""long-term task"" and needs ""long-term, recurrent funding"". The college has said that a regional approach involving patient and surgical teams travelling to surgical hubs is the key to moving forward. Surgeons acknowledge that could involve additional travel for some people. ""The Action Plan for Surgical Recovery: 10 steps not 10 years"" has called for investment, waiting list and surgery plans, Covid-light sites in every trust area, surgical hubs and elective accountability. A Covid-light site is a hospital or unit where, as far as possible, only elective patients who do not have the virus are treated. 17,000 medical procedures cancelled in pandemic Unspent Covid cash could 'get surgery going again' NI has 'lost control' of hospital waiting lists From the start of the pandemic, almost all elective surgery was cancelled in Northern Ireland, as wards were closed and nurses moved to work solely in Covid areas. The move only exacerbated the waiting list crisis. This video can not be played 'I feel I've been let down' County Antrim man Brian Revels, after developing a problem with his hip for several years, was told he would have to wait between four and five years before getting surgery. Mr Revels then used his savings for private treatment. He told BBC News NI that the ""operation took place within two days"". Mr Revels has also gone privately for a hernia operation, after being told it too would take a couple of years. John Brennan, from Lambeg in County Antrim, is waiting for three different surgeries - hip, knee and cataract surgery. He has been on the list for a hip replacement for four years and fell last Friday after his leg gave way. ""My consultant had told me he would like to have done the surgery in three months,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I would sometimes like to have been told my hip was broken but because it's the only way I am going to get the surgery. ""I would not wish this pain on anyone. ""There has to be an answer to all this. How much does it cost the NHS in painkillers alone?"" he asked. Mark Taylor from the Royal College of Surgeons said statistics ""belie the true scale of the problem"" Mark Taylor, Director for Northern Ireland at the RCS, said that since the pandemic, the situation has only ""worsened over the last year"" with the health service now in ""deep crisis"". ""These patients will be waiting in pain and uncertainty, some of them unable to work, to go about day-to-day life,"" he added. ""They will be waiting for treatments ranging from hip and knee replacements to post-mastectomy breast reconstructions, and children's surgeries such as putting in vents for ear glue. ""The statistics also belie the true scale of the problem - some will seek expensive private treatment."" The plan by the RCS also details the need for additional recruitment and retention of staff, the launch of a comprehensive review of surgical services to support surgical trainees, the implementation of physical and mental wellbeing programmes and protected time for health professionals to learn. NI's waiting lists could take 10 years to tackle 'I would beg for a hospital appointment' According to the College, more than 4,000 ""red flag"" cancer procedures, including surgery, have been cancelled since the beginning of the pandemic. Patients waiting for general surgery, trauma and orthopaedics, and ENT (ear, nose and throat) or urology procedures are worst affected. Waiting times for orthopaedics are especially bad and, in some areas, urgent cases can take between 1.5 years (80 weeks) and nearly 5 years (255 weeks) for treatment. Children's surgery has also been severely affected with routine procedures taking anywhere between three and four years to be carried out. Mr Taylor added that leaders in Northern Ireland are now faced with a choice to either continue to let things ""spiral out of control"" or to use the easing of Covid-19 pressures as a ""turning point and an opportunity to do things differently"". ""We must ensure that no matter where a patient lives in Northern Ireland they can expect the highest quality of surgical care,"" he said. ""Surgeons have already demonstrated great flexibility in adapting to the challenges of Covid-19 and the limitations placed on capacity. ""Protected surgical beds, Covid-19 light sites, a strong surgical team and surgical hubs are key parts to any meaningful solution. ""The Royal College of Surgeons stands ready to work with all stakeholders in delivering a surgical service fit for the 21st Century."" In a statement the health minister said the report highlighted the need for greater investment. ""Sustained additional funding is not the answer by itself - but we cannot start fixing waiting lists without it,"" Robin Swann said. ""As minister I have tasked the system to be innovative, to be ambitious and to get as many services fully back online as quickly as possible. Already we are now breaking down Trust and administrative barriers at a far greater scale than ever before. Mr Swann said clinicians and patients were now travelling to ""better utilise capacity"". ""The new regional day procedure centre at the Lagan Valley Hospital is a clear illustration of that. ""Over the next few weeks I will also be publishing the cancer recovery plan for Northern Ireland, an elective care framework and the urgent and emergency care review. ""These reports will detail both the immediate and longer term actions that are needed to bring down our waiting times. We must start putting this right. It is a long-term task however and it needs long-term, recurrent funding.

"The European Commission said there was no alternative but the ""full and correct implementation"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol Brussels must show common sense and take a pragmatic approach to the NI Protocol, the UK government has said. It said it was disappointed that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was not fully recognising the effects of the protocol. It is the part of the Brexit dealthat puts a trade border in the Irish Sea. Ms von der Leyen said on Monday that there was no alternative but the ""full and correct implementation"" of the protocol. The UK government said its priority was the Good Friday Agreement, while the European Union was focussed on the single market. Technical talks to simplify the operation of the protocol are ongoing. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports - but it is strongly opposed to the protocol among unionists, who see it as separating Northern Ireland from the UK. It was agreed by the United Kingdom and European Union in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. However, in recent weeks the UK government's rhetoric against the protocol has hardened. Earlier this month the UK's Brexit minister said it washard to see how the current operation of the protocol was sustainable. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland The UK was committed to working with the EU, but there needed to be a ""pragmatic, risk-based approach"" to challenges over the protocol, said a government spokesman. ""The protocol relies on the support of all communities in Northern Ireland so it is disappointing that there was not more recognition from the commission president of the impact that the current operation of the protocol is having in Northern Ireland,"" said the spokesman. ""While the EU prioritise protection of the single market and treat the regulatory boundary as if it were like any other external EU border, our focus remains on protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions."" Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? NI Protocol 'legally rotten to the core' Irish Sea border 'still causing difficulties' Speaking in Brussels on Monday night, Mrs Von der Leyen said the protocol was the ""only possible solution to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland while protecting the integrity of the EU single market"". She added that any problems flowed from Brexit rather than the protocol, but the UK and EU had ""a common duty to do whatever we can to reduce tensions in Northern Ireland"". She said the current technical talks were exploring practical solutions to help minimise disruption to everyday life in Northern Ireland. Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader-designate Edwin Poots said that costs for businesses in Northern Ireland of the protocol would ""spiral"" as 15,000 checks will ultimately have to be made every week on goods. ""This protocol will hurt every single individual in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Poots told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday. ""I will continue to press hard with the UK government the issues that are at stake here. The case is unarguable that this protocol is bad for Northern Ireland."" DUP MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, along with Lord Dodds, met the Brexit minister on Tuesday. The trio told Lord Frost the protocol should be replaced, with Sir Jeffrey saying their message was ""clear and unambiguous"". ""The protocol has no support from any shade or quarter of unionism. Its imposition without the consent of both traditions in Northern Ireland and overriding of cross-community voting safeguards has seriously undermined support for devolution,"" Sir Jeffrey added. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of having a ""tin ear"" to concerns about the protocol. ""It is hugely disappointing, in spite of everything that has happened, the fact that we are talking about cancer drugs being prevented from coming into Northern Ireland,"" she said. Arlene Foster says Mrs von der Leyen's comments show a 'tin ear' ""The fact that there are more checks from Great Britain into Northern Ireland than there are in Rotterdam; that still the European Union and the European Commission have had a tin ear to the concerns and the absolutely genuine concerns of the people in Northern Ireland."" Outgoing UUP leader Steve Aiken said Ms von der Leyen's remarks were ""tone deaf"", and urged her to engage with his party, ""the party that helped write and implement the Good Friday Agreement"". He said: ""She is at best badly informed, or at worst, is wilfully misrepresenting the impact of the EU's failure to come to an acceptable agreement with the UK, and the people of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, we are all stuck in the middle. ""Northern Ireland is being used as a bargaining chip between Brussels and London."" But Ms von der Leyen's comments were welcomed by Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard, who said Northern Ireland businesses wanted ""the protections the protocol provides"". ""It's time the British government stopped the charades and implement what it has already agreed,"" he said. ""We also need to see the economy minister in the north using the unique situation the protocol affords the north to attract investment and jobs."" During Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority. It meant keeping the land border between the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (in the UK) open and avoiding new infrastructure like cameras and border posts. That was easy when the whole island of Ireland was part of the EU. But after Brexit, a new arrangement was needed because the EU requires certain goods to be inspected at the point of entry into its single market. So, the EU and the UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into force on 1 January 2021. The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said Mrs Von der Leyen's comments ""showed how little she cares about peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". The LCC was set up in 2015 to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities. Loyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association are also represented on it. LCC Chairman David Campbell said: ""I would appeal to her to start listening and to recognise that the imposition of the protocol on the people of Northern Ireland without their involvement or consent is unsustainable and actually contrary to many of the key founding tenets of the European Union."" When Ursula von der Leyen talks about practical solutions, she is alluding to the technical negotiations which are happening right now between EU and UK officials. Officials are crunching through about 30 different issues relating to the protocol -  everything from pet travel to VAT on second-hand cars to steel tariffs to medicines and the movement of plants. They're working through those to see what can ease the implementation of the protocol on the ground. But the difficulty is a dramatic shift is not going to happen at a technical level. It's something where there needs to be a political commitment and, at the moment, there is no sign of the EU or the UK being prepared to make that big political compromise. Last week, an LCC member told MPsviolence could not be ruled outif the protocol remained. The organisation also met Lord Frostto discuss the protocol earlier this month. A small protest against the protocol outside Belfast City Hall in early May Rioting erupted insome loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in April- withtensions around the protocol partly blamed. Since then, there has been a switch to demonstrations largely in the form of loyalist band parades and marches. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently investigating about 303unlawful parades against the protocol. Meanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said she has sought legal adviceover the DUP's absence at north-south meetings. The DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings due to its opposition to the protocol. Ms Mallon told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that ministers are legally obliged to attend. Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister and DUP leader-designate Edwin Poots was criticised for preventinganother north-south ministerial meeting from taking place.

"Events were held to mark the anniversary of the murder of George Floyd His dying moments were filmed and watched by millions, sparking global protests about policing and racial justice George's brother Philonise said a White House meeting with Biden went well 'The Floyd family has shown extraordinary courage' US President Joe Biden said The impact of Floyd's death was felt in the worlds of politics, business, sport and entertainment in dozens of countries 'More people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago,' says Barack Obama The anniversary was marked in UK cities including Birmingham, Edinburgh, London, Manchester and Swansea Gunfire briefly interrupted the commemorations near the spot where Floyd died but no one was hurt Ex-policeman Derek Chauvin, whose knee was on Floyd's neck area, has been jailed for murder Edited by Ritu Prasad and Marianna Brady That wraps up our coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's death. His murder by a police officer last year sparked global protests and altered perspectives on race and policing.  Our live coverage was provided by Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady, Holly Honderich, Max Matza and Mal Sirat Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Cortez Rice is wearing a walking cast: healing a bone bruised by a tear gas cannister in a recent protest, he says. But that doesnât slow him down. He hasnât slowed down since the death of his âbeloved friendâ George Floyd, someone he calls a role model. Rice believes that pressure on the streets helped secure a guilty verdict for Derek Chauvin, the police officer convicted of murdering Floyd. Now heâs focusing on using the law to change the way policing is done. He says he joined the Minneapolis chapter of the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) so he could familiarise himself with police reform bills. He laughs when I suggest heâs giving himself a legal education, but agrees: âNow thatâs a big changeâ from last year. Many lives have been changed, even if wider reforms have been slow to follow. âWeâve just got to keep going,â says Rice. And at a rally marking the anniversary, he steps up with his cast to carry a box representing George Floydâs coffin, a symbolic pallbearer in a never-ending funeral. ""He's a genuine guy,"" says Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother, after leaving a meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and Vice-President Harris. Floyd's daughter Gianna ""had an absolute ball"", says a lawyer for the family. ""Say his name,"" she said, as the family raised their fists and called out in unison: ""George Floyd."" Meanwhile, Floyd's sister Bridgett denounced Biden for ""breaking a promise"" to pass a police reform bill by today. She spoke at a rally in Minneapolis surrounded by the mayor and other city officials. This video can not be played George Floyd's family speaks on the White House lawn Reality Check In 1963, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr led the March on Washington to demand racial and economic justice. So what's changed since then? The black-white wealth gap was larger in 2019 than it was in 1983, when black family wealth data was first collected. There hasn't been much movement in the disparity between the wages of black and white Americans either. But there have been some upward trends: more African Americans had completed four years of higher education by 2019 than ever before - 26% compared with just 4% in 1962. We've looked at six measures, including poverty, education, wages and congressional representation to answer the question:How far have African Americans come since the 1960s? Miriam Walker-KhanBBC Sport US football player Colin Kaepernick started kneeling to protest racial inequity in 2016 Almost a year on from the death of George Floyd, the world of sport has seen hundreds, if not thousands of athletes protesting against racial injustice on a global scale. But on 22 April 2021, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) confirmed that acts of protest - such as taking a knee - will continue to be banned at the Olympic Games, which begin in July. During a 10-month consultation process, the IOC asked 3,547 athletes whether its 'Rule 50' - which bans demonstrations - should change. A total of 67% said they wanted to keep the Olympic podium free of protests and 70% were keen to avoid on-field demonstrations. Gwen Berry, who competes in the hammer throw for the USA, responded with a powerful post on Instagram. ""I wished that Botham Jean was afforded that same choice when he was murdered in his home,"" she wrote, referring to a black man killed by an off-duty Dallas police officer who mistook his apartment for her own. ""Not to mention the countless individuals whose names are added to a growing list. This is my reason for not wavering. I will not shut up and throw."" Read the full story:How sport joined the fight for change Koralie BarrauBBC News A mourner at Floyd's funeral wears a shirt saying ""tired"" Black Americans are exhausted, and the anniversary of George Floyd's murder is a reminder that with every police killing of a black person, another cycle of grief and pain is re-triggered. Over the course of the Derek Chauvin trial, I spoke to many activists in the Minneapolis area about this constant exhaustion and how it takes a toll on their mental health continuously reliving past traumas. For them, the death of George Floyd was one of the most brutal images of police brutality and racism, but ultimately is part of a policing system that has always targeted predominately black and brown individuals. During the trial of Derek Chauvin, this exhaustion was on display at George Floyd Square, where Floyd was killed, with signs and graffiti saying: âIâm so tiredâ. One activist, DA Bullock, told us: ""We canât have another George Floyd in a year, two years, three yearsâ¦Because I can't go through another death, like that. It takes too much out of us, it really does harm us as individuals and harms us as a community."" For Deborah Watts, the cousin of Emmet Till - a black boy who was lynched over 60 years ago - time alone does not heal her wounds. She says that with every police killing, her wound is reopened again. Much of her work in Minneapolis seeks to work with families who have lost loved ones in encounters with police. Nearly everyone we spoke to in the city said that true justice equates to a fundamental change in the judicial system. They believe that despite this exhaustion they feel, they must continue to fight for justice, equality, and accountability. This video can not be played Why the Chauvin trial âexhaustsâ black America Kristen Clarke is now overseeing an investigation into Minneapolis police The US Senate has voted to confirm Kristen Clarke as the first black woman to run the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division. The vote passed narrowly on Tuesday afternoon with only one Republican vote (Maine's Susan Collins). Clarke is a first-generation American whose parents came to the US from Jamaica. She holds degrees from Columbia and Harvard universities. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called the timing of her confirmation ""particularly poignant and appropriate"" given today's anniversary. The civil rights department that she now heads is already investigating the Minneapolis Police Department after Floyd's killer was convicted last month. They are also investigating the police in Louisville, Kentucky, for the killing ofBreonna Taylor. Reality Check The figures that are available for incidents in which the police shoot and kill people show that for African-Americans, there's a much higher chance of being fatally shot relative to their overall numbers in the US population. According to the Washington Postâs police shootings database, although African-Americans make up less than 14% of the population, they accounted for almost 24% of over 6,000 fatal shootings by the police since 2015. Further research shows the rate that police fatally shoot unarmed black people in the US is more than three times as high as it is for white people. Other studies have shown that black people are more likely to be pulled over in traffic stops by police. One of the most recent, a 2020 study by Stanford University, analysed 100m traffic stops by police departments across the US and found black drivers were about 20% more likely to be stopped than white drivers. African-Americans are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drugs are used at similar levels. Overall, African-Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans and twice the rate of Hispanic-Americans, according to the latest data. These rates have dropped for African-Americans over the last decade, but they still make up more of the prison population than any other race.

Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News James Bryd Jr's murder led to the creation of a federal hate crime law Twenty-two years before the death of George Floyd, another brutal murder of a black man shocked the conscience of America and forced a racial reckoning. WARNING THIS STORY CONTAINS DISTRESSING DESCRIPTIONS. James Byrd Jr was killed by three white supremacists who drove him down a dark country road and beat him. Then they chained him alive to a pickup truck and dragged his body for three miles - until he was decapitated. Two of the murderers were executed for the crime. The other is serving a life sentence. In 2009, President Barack Obama signed a federal hate crime bill into law which is named after James Byrd Jr (as well as Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in 1998 because he was gay). My colleague AngÃ©lica Casas and I visited the Texas town of Jasper this month to find out how Byrd's family is coping two decades after such an unspeakable crime. His daughter, Jamie, told us how she had reacted to his murder. ""I was numb, I was in denial. I was 16-years-old, so love and forgiveness were no part of my thought process at that moment."" Jamie says she still feels angry but chooses to channel it into positive actions. Now a police officer in Houston, she draws a connection between the murders of her father and George Floyd. ""My dad did not get killed at the hands of a police officer, but in today's world, that is what we're seeing. ""We're seeing a lot of brutality by the hands of officers, unfortunately."" Byrd's daughter, Jamie, says Floyd's killing deeply impacted her She says it was a challenge to put on the uniform after George Floyd's murder as protests against police brutality and racism spread across the world. Ultimately, she decided it was more important to keep serving her community. ""I want to be that officer, just be there in solidarity, and say 'hey, I know what you're going through'. You can watch our film about James Byrd Jr on the BBC News website on Friday. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The latest clashes between Israel and the Palestinians have revealed exactly how much the political centre of gravity in the Democratic Party has moved on the conflict in recent years, and especially after civil rights protests sparked by George Floydâs murder. In a recent column, Jewish-American Senator Bernie Sanders paid tribute to the rise of ""a new generation of activists"". ""We saw these activists in American streets last summer in the wake of the murder of George Floyd,"" he writes. ""We see them in Israel. We see them in the Palestinian territories."" His final words lift a direct line from the Black Lives Matter movement: ""Palestinian lives matter"". Sanders is noting what has become obvious during clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinians over the past two weeks. Americans who found their political voice during last summer's activism in US cities are now turning their focus, and their rhetoric, on what they see as similar unchecked oppression in the Middle East. Reality Check More people are killed by police in the US than in any other developed country. Among these killings, black Americans are killed at a higher rate compared with the percentage of the population they represent. Most are shot dead. Part of this is to do with gun culture, but there are also growing calls for improved police training to reduce the use of lethal force. On average, US officers spend around 21 weeks in training before they go on patrol. That is far less than in most other developed countries, according to a report by the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform (ICJTR).  US police academies also spend far more time on firearm training than on de-escalating a situation - 71 hours against 21, on average. Prof Maria Haberfeld at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says: ""This is why you see officers very rapidly escalating from initial communication to the actual physical use of force, because this is how they train."" BBC Reality Check has looked into how the training requirements in the US compare with other countries. Read more here: How US police training compares with the rest of the world Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Minneapolis Activists continue to demand root and branch change of what they say is a brutal, racist policing system. But this past year has also been hard on police. Mylan Masson, a former Minneapolis police trainer, says sheâs never seen morale so low. The department has lost more than 200 officers to early retirement, transfer or medical leave for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). There is confusion over competing proposals for reform, and a backlash from citizens. ""The officers don't know what the community feels about them,â she said. âWhat should we be doing? Everything we do, is it going to be judged? Is everything we're doing going to be put through scrutiny that we've never had before? We have things that we need to discuss with the community and make them feel comfortable with us again.â The department has come under federal investigation and Mylan says there are problems that need to be fixed. But the focus on bad cops is wearing. âWe try to... do the best we can and all of a sudden you see something else just horrible happen,â she says. âAnd it's traumatic.â Joe Biden speaks at the White House earlier this month We heard moments ago from George Floyd's family about their meeting with the president and vice-president, and now Biden's released his own response, praising the family for their ""extraordinary courage"". Floyd's murder ""launched a summer of protests"", Biden said in a statement, which ""peacefully unified people of every race and generation to collectively say enough of the senseless killings"". Biden also called for action, writing that real change will be delivered only when there is accountability in the nation's law enforcement. ""The negotiations on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act in Congress are ongoing,"" he said. ""It's my hope that they will get a bill to my desk quickly."" ""We have to act,"" he said. George Floyd's family spoke to reporters briefly after a private hour-long meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris. In quick succession, several members of Floyd's family made comments, many of them thanking Biden and Harris for the meeting. His brother Rodney Floyd said the family was grateful for the concern the president and vice-president showed. ""Being here today is an honour,"" said another brother, Terrence. ""I feel it was a very productive conversation and I'm grateful for it."" The family also addressed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which they called for Congress to pass. Biden has so far failed to push the bill through, missing his own deadline of today. The president is waiting for the ""right"" bill to be passed, Floyd's nephew Brandon said, instead of rushing one through. ""We just want this George Floyd Policing Act to be passed in the future,"" said brother Philonise Floyd. ""If you can make federal laws to protect the bird, the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of colour."" There was also a moment of levity during the meeting, the family said. Joe Biden interacted and played with Gianna Floyd, George's 7-year-old daughter. ""She had an absolute ball,"" a family lawyer said. According to a recent NPR poll, 51% of Americans approve of Democratic President Joe Bidenâs handling of race relations. But the numbers break down as expected along party lines. Among Democrats, about 85% say they approve. About half of independents and only 14% of Republicans approve. About one-third of Americans say they think things will improve under Biden, while another third say race relations will stay the same. Thatâs an uptick from Donald Trumpâs presidency when a majority of Americans said they expected race relations to worsen. Family members of George Floyd are outside the White House now, speaking to reporters after a private meeting with President Joe Biden. The meeting was ""great"" said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother. Bridgett Floyd speaks at a rally this past summer in Washington While several of her family members are in Washington to meet with President Biden, George Floyd's sister Bridgett stayed in Minneapolis, where she is attending a rally for her brother. She said she had passed on the White House meeting because the president has not yet managed to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act through Congress - which Biden had said would be done by today.Democrats first proposed the police reform bill last June. ""He broke his promise, but I am going to give him a couple more weeks,"" Bridgett said, according to local media. And she added this message for the president: ""Get your people in order."" Martin Luther King III said police brutality was continuing (file photo) Martin Luther King III, human rights advocate and son of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr, has told the BBC he fears that not enough has changed one year on from George Floyd's murder. ""This is a marathon,"" he says. ""People's emotions around the world were evoked to see a public servant whose job is to
protect and serve, being judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" he adds, referring to the actions of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. ""Although
one might say a year later it has subsided, the fact of the matter is that
there are still demonstrations going on, and part of it is because [police]
shootings have not stopped. ""So the incidents continue, there has been no
movement or transition"". Welcome to our live coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's murder. President Joe Bidenis currently meeting with members ofFloyd's family. Earlier today, the president wrote on Twitter that they had shown ""extraordinary courage"" in the year since George Floyd died. Demonstrations and marches are happening across the country to commemorate the day. People have taken to the streets inNew York, Los Angeles, PortlandandHouston. And much like the demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death last year, today's memorial is global. Demonstrators have gathered inEdinburgh, GlasgowandLondon,andCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaumarked the day, calling Floyd's death a ""tragedy"" and a reminder that anti-black racism and injustice persists. The memorial in Minneapolis at George Floyd Square was briefly interrupted by reports ofshots firedthough there was only one report of a possible injury from the incident. Stay with us as we bring you more updates from the day. Medical student Mikaela Loach read a poem at the vigil in Edinburgh Here's more from the vigil we reported has been taking place outside the Scottish Parliament
at Holyrood in Edinburgh. Medical
student and activist Mikaela Loach wrote and read a poem at the gathering. It included the lines: ""I want to be me, fully. To be loved, fully. To breathe in
deep, to fill my lungs, feels like an act of rebellion in a world that wants me
to suffocate."" Loach told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that writing helps me take the stuff that is
bubbling up within and express it. ""The
stress of living in a world that doesnât want you to exist in the fullness of
who you are, that harms you."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.001491166

George Floyd's family spoke to reporters briefly after a private hour-long meeting with President Joe Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris. In quick succession, several members of Floyd's family made comments, many of them thanking Biden and Harris for the meeting. His brother Rodney Floyd said the family was grateful for the concern the president and vice-president showed. ""Being here today is an honour,"" said another brother, Terrence. ""I feel it was a very productive conversation and I'm grateful for it."" The family also addressed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which they called for Congress to pass. Biden has so far failed to push the bill through, missing his own deadline of today. The president is waiting for the ""right"" bill to be passed, Floyd's nephew Brandon said, instead of rushing one through. ""We just want this George Floyd Policing Act to be passed in the future,"" said brother Philonise Floyd. ""If you can make federal laws to protect the bird, the bald eagle, you can make federal laws to protect people of colour."" There was also a moment of levity during the meeting, the family said. Joe Biden interacted and played with Gianna Floyd, George's 7-year-old daughter. ""She had an absolute ball,"" a family lawyer said. According to a recent NPR poll, 51% of Americans approve of Democratic President Joe Bidenâs handling of race relations. But the numbers break down as expected along party lines. Among Democrats, about 85% say they approve. About half of independents and only 14% of Republicans approve. About one-third of Americans say they think things will improve under Biden, while another third say race relations will stay the same. Thatâs an uptick from Donald Trumpâs presidency when a majority of Americans said they expected race relations to worsen. Family members of George Floyd are outside the White House now, speaking to reporters after a private meeting with President Joe Biden. The meeting was ""great"" said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd's brother. Bridgett Floyd speaks at a rally this past summer in Washington While several of her family members are in Washington to meet with President Biden, George Floyd's sister Bridgett stayed in Minneapolis, where she is attending a rally for her brother. She said she had passed on the White House meeting because the president has not yet managed to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act through Congress - which Biden had said would be done by today.Democrats first proposed the police reform bill last June. ""He broke his promise, but I am going to give him a couple more weeks,"" Bridgett said, according to local media. And she added this message for the president: ""Get your people in order."" Martin Luther King III said police brutality was continuing (file photo) Martin Luther King III, human rights advocate and son of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr, has told the BBC he fears that not enough has changed one year on from George Floyd's murder. ""This is a marathon,"" he says. ""People's emotions around the world were evoked to see a public servant whose job is to
protect and serve, being judge, jury and executioner all in one,"" he adds, referring to the actions of white police officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. ""Although
one might say a year later it has subsided, the fact of the matter is that
there are still demonstrations going on, and part of it is because [police]
shootings have not stopped. ""So the incidents continue, there has been no
movement or transition"". Welcome to our live coverage of the anniversary of George Floyd's murder. President Joe Bidenis currently meeting with members ofFloyd's family. Earlier today, the president wrote on Twitter that they had shown ""extraordinary courage"" in the year since George Floyd died. Demonstrations and marches are happening across the country to commemorate the day. People have taken to the streets inNew York, Los Angeles, PortlandandHouston. And much like the demonstrations sparked by Floyd's death last year, today's memorial is global. Demonstrators have gathered inEdinburgh, GlasgowandLondon,andCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeaumarked the day, calling Floyd's death a ""tragedy"" and a reminder that anti-black racism and injustice persists. The memorial in Minneapolis at George Floyd Square was briefly interrupted by reports ofshots firedthough there was only one report of a possible injury from the incident. Stay with us as we bring you more updates from the day. Medical student Mikaela Loach read a poem at the vigil in Edinburgh Here's more from the vigil we reported has been taking place outside the Scottish Parliament
at Holyrood in Edinburgh. Medical
student and activist Mikaela Loach wrote and read a poem at the gathering. It included the lines: ""I want to be me, fully. To be loved, fully. To breathe in
deep, to fill my lungs, feels like an act of rebellion in a world that wants me
to suffocate."" Loach told BBC Scotland: ""I feel that writing helps me take the stuff that is
bubbling up within and express it. ""The
stress of living in a world that doesnât want you to exist in the fullness of
who you are, that harms you."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99922824
"Palestinians say more than 1,000 housing and commercial units were destroyed in Israeli strikes The US will seek to rebuild its relations with the Palestinians by reopening its consulate in Jerusalem and providing aid to help rebuild Gaza, Secretary of State Antony Blinken says. After meeting President Mahmoud Abbas, Mr Blinken stressed the need to shore up the truce that ended the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas. But he vowed to ensure the militant group that rules Gaza did not benefit. He also reassured Israel of ""America's ironclad commitment"" to its security. At least 242 people were killed in Gaza and 13 people were killed in Israel during 11 days of fierce fighting that ended on Friday with an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire. This video can not be played Two children from Gaza City and Israel describe their experience of the Israel-Gaza conflict The violence came after weeks of spiralling Israeli-Palestinian tension in occupied East Jerusalem which culminated in clashes at a holy site revered by both Muslims and Jews. Hamas began firing rockets into Israel after warning it to withdraw from the site, triggering retaliatory air strikes from Israel on Gaza targets. The Democrats' 'tectonic' shift on the conflict A conflict on pause as both sides claim victory How much money does Israel get from the US? In pictures: The destruction in Gaza and Israel Mr Blinken travelled to Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, on Tuesday afternoon to hold talks with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. ""I am here to underscore the commitment of the United States to rebuilding a relationship with the Palestinian Authority and with the Palestinian people, a relationship built on mutual respect and also a shared conviction that Palestinians and Israelis alike deserve equal measures of freedom, security, opportunity, and dignity,"" he told a joint news conference. Antony Blinken (left) held discussions with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas The Palestinians broke off contacts with former US President Donald Trump's administration and rejected his Middle East peace plan as biased towards Israel. When he took office, President Joe Biden promised to restore aid to the Palestinians that was cut by his predecessor and reopen the diplomatic missions he closed. Mr Blinken announced on Tuesday that the US would seek to ""engage with and provide support to"" the Palestinian people by moving forward with the process of reopening its consulate in Jerusalem. The consulate covered Palestinian affairs until 2019, when it was merged with the new embassy to Israel that the Trump administration controversially opened in Jerusalem the previous year. The merger marked a significant downgrade of the US diplomatic mission to the Palestinians. A senior Palestinian official told the AFP news agency that discussions were taking place over reopening the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) office in Washington DC, which was closed by the Trump administration. The US consulate in Jerusalem used to act as a de facto embassy to the Palestinians (file photo) Mr Blinken also said the US was working with the international community, the Palestinian Authority and Israel to assist in the relief and recovery efforts in Gaza, adding: ""We have to respond to the profound need to help people in this moment."" He said the Biden administration would provide $5.5m (Â£3.9m) in immediate disaster assistance for Gaza and $32m for the emergency appeal by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa). It has also notified Congress of its intention to provide $75m in additional development and economic assistance for the Palestinians in 2021. But Mr Blinken stressed that Washington would ensure that Hamas, which controls Gaza, did not benefit. Hamas as a whole, or in some cases its military wing, is designated a terrorist group by Israel, the United States, European Union and United Kingdom, as well as other powers. Mr Blinken started his three-day trip to the Middle East in Jerusalem earlier on Tuesday by meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""I underscored America's ironclad commitment to Israel's security, and we discussed the importance of promoting peace, security, and dignity for all,""Mr Blinken tweeted.,external Antony Blinken gave America's ""ironclad commitment to Israel's security"" during talks with Benjamin Netanyahu Meanwhile, Mr Netanyahu thanked Washington for ""firmly supporting Israel's right of self-defence"" during the escalation. ""We, too, will give meaning to our commitment to our self-defence: if Hamas breaks the calm and attacks Israel, our response will be very powerful,"" the prime minister warned. He also said he had discussed with Mr Blinken replenishing the Iron Dome missile defence system that protects Israel from Palestinian rocket fire, and also ways to prevent Hamas rearming. Mr Blinken said intense, behind-the-scenes diplomacy by President Biden had helped produce last week's ceasefire, and that ""now we believe we must build on it"". He added: ""We know that to prevent a return to violence we have to use the space created to address a larger set of underlying issues and challenges. And that begins with tackling the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza and starting to rebuild."" The UN said on Sunday,externalthat 242 Palestinians, including 66 children and 38 women, were killed in the conflict, and that its human rights office had verified that at least 129 of them were civilians. Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system intercepted most of the Palestinian rockets heading towards populated areas It added that at least 230 of the Palestinian fatalities were seemingly killed by Israeli forces, and that some of the casualties in Gaza might have resulted from rockets falling short. The Israel Defense Forces said it killed more than 200 militants during the fighting. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have not given overall casualty figures for their fighters. In Israel, 13 people, including two children and three foreign nationals, were killed by Palestinian rocket or other fire, or when running for shelter during rocket attacks, its medical service said. The UN cited the Palestinian housing ministry as saying 258 buildings, comprising 1,042 housing and commercial units, were destroyed during the fighting. In addition, 769 housing units were severely damaged and 14,536 suffered minor damage. Israel reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing with Gaza on Tuesday Fifty-four education facilities, six hospitals and 11 primary healthcare facilities were also damaged, as was water, sanitation, and electric infrastructure, according to the UN. Palestinian officials put reconstruction costs at tens of millions of dollars. The Israeli government has not yet published its estimate for the damages, but many buildings and vehicles in Israel were damaged by rocket fire.

"Nicola Sturgeon is giving an update on the latest Covid developments with chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith Ms Sturgeon says case numbers have been increasing recently, but from a very low base It is hoped that the vaccination programme will limit transmission and prevent high numbers of people being hospitalised A further 318 people have tested positive for Covid since yesterday, with two deaths being recorded Ms Sturgeon says there are reasons for ""cautious optimism"" in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire Glasgow is the only part of the country in level three of the country's five-tier system of restrictions Half the numbers of people due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow at the weekend failed to turn up BBC Scotland News That's all from us today. Join us again next time. Stay safe.   Ms Sturgeon takes a question from the Daily Telegraph about vaccination passports. But rather than just focusing on the situation with foreign travel, will vaccination status reports help people return to the domestic hospitality sector in larger numbers? The first minister says she can see that being the case some time in the future. ""I think we will see greater use of vaccination as a route back to doing things,"" she says. ""We will see venues or other places ask for proof of vaccination and we need to think through some of the implications of that. ""But as I've said many times before, there are equity and ethical issues in there that we have to think through and that work is ongoing."" Green MSP Ross Greer tells the BBC update programme that Scotlandâs testing regime is still
not up to scratch more than a year after the start of the pandemic. Mr Greer says things have improved in recent months but a
more comprehensive âsurge testingâ strategy is needed. âWhat we have seen in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire is the
testing has come, and it has been a huge help, but itâs come too late to get a
handle on it before it becomes a proper outbreak,â he says. On vaccines, Mr Greer says a âhybrid systemâ of NHS-issued appointments
and people booking slots for jabs now needs to be introduced. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

about the vaccine take-up rate. The North East Fife MSP tells the BBC programme frustrations about the way appointments
are made have been raised for some time now. âMany people in my constituency were missing out on an appointment
because they had just moved house or GP practice, and it took weeks to sort out,â
he says. Mr Rennie says these issues will be worse among younger
people who tend to move home more often and calls on the Scottish government to

Back at the briefing, the first minister reacts to calls from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar to utilise the army to help speed up the vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government will continue to call on the army when, and if, that is required. ""There is no hesitation in doing that and I'm sure we will make use of army resources in the future,"" she says. ""But I've been very impressed with the public health response, and we have got to support our teams to continue that.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Making Covid testing a ""habit"" is key to getting through further
outbreaks of the virus this summer, says an NHS expert. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, tells the BBC Scotland coronavirus update programme that testing will be crucial for ensuring the virus stays under control. âWe need to keep encouraging people to see testing as a habit so we can keep on
top of outbreaks as they inevitably rise as restrictions ease,â she says. The NHS official says Grampian has seen big uptake rates for
any outreach or walk-in clinics it has run and this is something the rest of the
country could consider. Gordon Chree from STV asks the first minister about the focus shifting to hospital admissions and away from case numbers. He asks if she has changed tack on her position last summer when there was a push for an ""elimination strategy"". Ms Sturgeon says she still believes it is important to try to keep case rates as low as possible, ""because the lower they are the less chance of transmission and the less chance of new variants"". But she says, ""vaccination changes the game"" in how you deal with the pandemic. ""There's got to be a point to us having a mass vaccination programme, and that is it does allow us to change how we deal with this virus in a way which has much less restriction on our day-to-day lives."" The first minister says the number of people not turning up for jab appointments across
Scotland is higher now than at the start of the vaccination programme. In an answer to BBC Scotland, she says: âIt was particularly high over the weekend at the Hydro but it is
not an issue only affecting the Hydro."" The first minister say the government is considering what flexibility it can build
into the system to ânip in the budâ any non-attendance issues. Ms Sturgeon refers to news that at some vaccination sites over the weekend, there was a significant amount of ""no-shows"" where people did not turn up for their jab She says, overall, it is important to stress that uptake levels remain ""incredibly high"". The first minister adds: ""When people fail to attend, there will be a variety of reasons for this and some of them will not be to down to the individual, so no-one is pointing any fingers here."" Concluding her opening statements, Ms Sturgeon says all of us continue to have a part to play and speaks about the importance of vaccination. She says the latest data shows that two doses of either vaccine ""offer high levels of protection against this new variant"". We also expect that vaccines will offer even higher levels of effectiveness against hospitalisation and the risk of dying. So we are currently working to accelerate the programme as far and as fast as supplies allow. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister  Allow Twitter content?

The first minister says there will always be people who need hospital treatment, but that going forward ""we might not need to react quite so aggressively with tough restrictions in the face of rising case numbers"". ""Instead, we hope that we'll be able to rely more on enhanced public health interventions like testing and vaccination and on good public health practises on the part of the public,"" she adds.  The first minister says stemming case numbers has made tough restrictions necessary during the pandemic. She says a ""significant degree of caution is still appropriate"" and that is why, so far, the government has opted to keep Glasgow in level three. But if continues and increased vaccination breaks the rise in case numbers, Ms Sturgeon says she hopes the response to the virus ""can increasingly evolve as well"". Nicola Sturgeon says the impact of the vaccination programme
could reduce the amount of âtough restrictionsâ needed in some parts of Scotland. As the number of jabs issued topped 3.1m, Ms Sturgeon says an âincreasingly vital partâ of the Scottish governmentâs consideration is understanding
the âimpact of vaccinationâ. This could mean that increased community testing and localised
acceleration of vaccine rollouts might feature more than further lockdown measures. Ms Sturgeon says the so-called Indian variant is proving more transmissible
and this is reflected in the increased case numbers. As of 07:30 this morning, 3,138,366 people in Scotland had
received their first dose of the vaccine, an increase of 16,421 since yesterday. In addition, 1,881,214 have received their second dose, an
increase of 29,035. Which means, as of today, more than five million doses of vaccine have been given in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon begins with an update of the latest coronavirus
figures. The first minister confirms that a further 318 people have tested positive for Covid â which
is 2% of the tests carried out yesterday. This takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 232,661. There are 97 people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19,
an increase of three, and six in intensive care, up one from yesterday. There have also been two more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours
of people who tested positive in the previous 28 days. That brings the total number of deaths by that measurement to 7,666. Nicola Sturgeon will begin the Scottish government's coronavirus
briefing shortly, with chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith. You can follow the latest developments right here and watch or

Concerns have been raised over whether vaccination letters have been sent to correct addresses.

She said: ""Two were for the couple who lived in our unit three-and-a-half years ago.

"The European Commission said there was no alternative but the ""full and correct implementation"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol Brussels must show common sense and take a pragmatic approach to the NI Protocol, the UK government has said. It said it was disappointed that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was not fully recognising the effects of the protocol. It is the part of the Brexit dealthat puts a trade border in the Irish Sea. Ms von der Leyen said on Monday that there was no alternative but the ""full and correct implementation"" of the protocol. The UK government said its priority was the Good Friday Agreement, while the European Union was focussed on the single market. Technical talks to simplify the operation of the protocol are ongoing. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports - but it is strongly opposed to the protocol among unionists, who see it as separating Northern Ireland from the UK. It was agreed by the United Kingdom and European Union in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. However, in recent weeks the UK government's rhetoric against the protocol has hardened. Earlier this month the UK's Brexit minister said it washard to see how the current operation of the protocol was sustainable. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland The UK was committed to working with the EU, but there needed to be a ""pragmatic, risk-based approach"" to challenges over the protocol, said a government spokesman. ""The protocol relies on the support of all communities in Northern Ireland so it is disappointing that there was not more recognition from the commission president of the impact that the current operation of the protocol is having in Northern Ireland,"" said the spokesman. ""While the EU prioritise protection of the single market and treat the regulatory boundary as if it were like any other external EU border, our focus remains on protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions."" Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? NI Protocol 'legally rotten to the core' Irish Sea border 'still causing difficulties' Speaking in Brussels on Monday night, Mrs Von der Leyen said the protocol was the ""only possible solution to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland while protecting the integrity of the EU single market"". She added that any problems flowed from Brexit rather than the protocol, but the UK and EU had ""a common duty to do whatever we can to reduce tensions in Northern Ireland"". She said the current technical talks were exploring practical solutions to help minimise disruption to everyday life in Northern Ireland. Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader-designate Edwin Poots said that costs for businesses in Northern Ireland of the protocol would ""spiral"" as 15,000 checks will ultimately have to be made every week on goods. ""This protocol will hurt every single individual in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Poots told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday. ""I will continue to press hard with the UK government the issues that are at stake here. The case is unarguable that this protocol is bad for Northern Ireland."" DUP MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, along with Lord Dodds, met the Brexit minister on Tuesday. The trio told Lord Frost the protocol should be replaced, with Sir Jeffrey saying their message was ""clear and unambiguous"". ""The protocol has no support from any shade or quarter of unionism. Its imposition without the consent of both traditions in Northern Ireland and overriding of cross-community voting safeguards has seriously undermined support for devolution,"" Sir Jeffrey added. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of having a ""tin ear"" to concerns about the protocol. ""It is hugely disappointing, in spite of everything that has happened, the fact that we are talking about cancer drugs being prevented from coming into Northern Ireland,"" she said. Arlene Foster says Mrs von der Leyen's comments show a 'tin ear' ""The fact that there are more checks from Great Britain into Northern Ireland than there are in Rotterdam; that still the European Union and the European Commission have had a tin ear to the concerns and the absolutely genuine concerns of the people in Northern Ireland."" Outgoing UUP leader Steve Aiken said Ms von der Leyen's remarks were ""tone deaf"", and urged her to engage with his party, ""the party that helped write and implement the Good Friday Agreement"". He said: ""She is at best badly informed, or at worst, is wilfully misrepresenting the impact of the EU's failure to come to an acceptable agreement with the UK, and the people of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, we are all stuck in the middle. ""Northern Ireland is being used as a bargaining chip between Brussels and London."" But Ms von der Leyen's comments were welcomed by Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard, who said Northern Ireland businesses wanted ""the protections the protocol provides"". ""It's time the British government stopped the charades and implement what it has already agreed,"" he said. ""We also need to see the economy minister in the north using the unique situation the protocol affords the north to attract investment and jobs."" During Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority. It meant keeping the land border between the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (in the UK) open and avoiding new infrastructure like cameras and border posts. That was easy when the whole island of Ireland was part of the EU. But after Brexit, a new arrangement was needed because the EU requires certain goods to be inspected at the point of entry into its single market. So, the EU and the UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into force on 1 January 2021. The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said Mrs Von der Leyen's comments ""showed how little she cares about peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". The LCC was set up in 2015 to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities. Loyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association are also represented on it. LCC Chairman David Campbell said: ""I would appeal to her to start listening and to recognise that the imposition of the protocol on the people of Northern Ireland without their involvement or consent is unsustainable and actually contrary to many of the key founding tenets of the European Union."" When Ursula von der Leyen talks about practical solutions, she is alluding to the technical negotiations which are happening right now between EU and UK officials. Officials are crunching through about 30 different issues relating to the protocol -  everything from pet travel to VAT on second-hand cars to steel tariffs to medicines and the movement of plants. They're working through those to see what can ease the implementation of the protocol on the ground. But the difficulty is a dramatic shift is not going to happen at a technical level. It's something where there needs to be a political commitment and, at the moment, there is no sign of the EU or the UK being prepared to make that big political compromise. Last week, an LCC member told MPsviolence could not be ruled outif the protocol remained. The organisation also met Lord Frostto discuss the protocol earlier this month. A small protest against the protocol outside Belfast City Hall in early May Rioting erupted insome loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in April- withtensions around the protocol partly blamed. Since then, there has been a switch to demonstrations largely in the form of loyalist band parades and marches. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently investigating about 303unlawful parades against the protocol. Meanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said she has sought legal adviceover the DUP's absence at north-south meetings. The DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings due to its opposition to the protocol. Ms Mallon told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that ministers are legally obliged to attend. Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister and DUP leader-designate Edwin Poots was criticised for preventinganother north-south ministerial meeting from taking place.

"Government borrowing fell in April compared with the same month last year, as parts of the economy reopened after lockdown measures eased. Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was Â£31.7bn, official figures show, which was Â£15.6bn lower than April last year. However, the figure was the second highest for April since records began. Borrowing has been hitting record levels with billions being spent on measures such as furlough payments. The Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) now estimates that the government borrowed a total of Â£300.3bn in the financial year to March. While that was down slightly from its previous estimate of Â£303.1bn, it remains the highest level since the end of World War Two. The ONS said the cost of measures to support individuals and businesses during the pandemic meant that day-to-day spending by the government rose by Â£204.1bn to Â£942.7bn last year. The huge amount of borrowing over the past year has now pushed government debt up to Â£2.17 trillion, which is 98.5% of GDP - a rate not seen since the early 1960s. April's borrowing figure was lower than official forecasts. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog,had predicted borrowing would reach Â£39bn last month,external. Parts of the economy began to reopen in April, including pubs and restaurants as well as hairdressers and gyms. Tax receipts in April were Â£58bn, which was up slightly from the same month last year when receipts were Â£54.2bn. The government's borrowing figures were also boosted by smaller than expected interest payments on debt. Where does the government borrow billions from? ""April's public finances figures showed that the government's financial position isn't as bad as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted only two months ago, reinforcing our view that the tax hikes and spending cuts that most fear may be avoided,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. How you view the latest figures on government borrowing depends on what you compare it with. The amount borrowed in April - Â£32bn - is very high by normal standards, about as much as the public sector was predicted, before the pandemic, to need to borrow over the whole financial year. But it is less than the Â£39bn officially predicted by the OBR at the Budget two months ago. Similarly, the revised figure for the whole financial year 2020/21 is Â£300bn - about ten times what was forecast pre-pandemic and the highest borrowing in peacetime. But compare it to the Â£394bn predicted in November and there's room for optimism. Some economists now think there won't be a need for big spending cuts or tax rises to bring that figure down. Instead it will drop naturally as the economy expands, tax receipts from income tax, VAT and the like roll in and the government spends less supporting the economy. It's also worth remembering that government finances are about as unlike household finances as you could get; almost all the money the government's borrowed since the pandemic is owed to the Bank of England. In that light, the objective pressures to raise taxes or cut spending to reduce borrowing aren't at all urgent. Any decisions to do so will be born less from economic urgency and more from political judgment. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said public borrowing ""should continue to undershoot"" the OBR's forecast it published alongside the Budget in March amid expectations of a strong recovery in GDP. However, he said: ""The chancellor's room for manoeuvre on austerity measures will depend on the size of the long-term hit to potential GDP from the recent recession. ""While 'scarring' should be smaller than after past recessions, given that the unemployment rate has remained low, we still see significant costs in the form of diminished investment and an unprecedented exodus of non-UK nationals.""

"Nicola Sturgeon is giving an update on the latest Covid developments with chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith Ms Sturgeon says case numbers have been increasing recently, but from a very low base It is hoped that the vaccination programme will limit transmission and prevent high numbers of people being hospitalised A further 318 people have tested positive for Covid since yesterday, with two deaths being recorded Ms Sturgeon says there are reasons for ""cautious optimism"" in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire Glasgow is the only part of the country in level three of the country's five-tier system of restrictions Half the numbers of people due to get a Covid jab at a mass vaccination centre in Glasgow at the weekend failed to turn up BBC Scotland News That's all from us today. Join us again next time. Stay safe.   Ms Sturgeon takes a question from the Daily Telegraph about vaccination passports. But rather than just focusing on the situation with foreign travel, will vaccination status reports help people return to the domestic hospitality sector in larger numbers? The first minister says she can see that being the case some time in the future. ""I think we will see greater use of vaccination as a route back to doing things,"" she says. ""We will see venues or other places ask for proof of vaccination and we need to think through some of the implications of that. ""But as I've said many times before, there are equity and ethical issues in there that we have to think through and that work is ongoing."" Green MSP Ross Greer tells the BBC update programme that Scotlandâs testing regime is still
not up to scratch more than a year after the start of the pandemic. Mr Greer says things have improved in recent months but a
more comprehensive âsurge testingâ strategy is needed. âWhat we have seen in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire is the
testing has come, and it has been a huge help, but itâs come too late to get a
handle on it before it becomes a proper outbreak,â he says. On vaccines, Mr Greer says a âhybrid systemâ of NHS-issued appointments
and people booking slots for jabs now needs to be introduced. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

about the vaccine take-up rate. The North East Fife MSP tells the BBC programme frustrations about the way appointments
are made have been raised for some time now. âMany people in my constituency were missing out on an appointment
because they had just moved house or GP practice, and it took weeks to sort out,â
he says. Mr Rennie says these issues will be worse among younger
people who tend to move home more often and calls on the Scottish government to
âget on topâ of the issue. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Back at the briefing, the first minister reacts to calls from Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar to utilise the army to help speed up the vaccination programme. Ms Sturgeon says the Scottish government will continue to call on the army when, and if, that is required. ""There is no hesitation in doing that and I'm sure we will make use of army resources in the future,"" she says. ""But I've been very impressed with the public health response, and we have got to support our teams to continue that.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Making Covid testing a ""habit"" is key to getting through further
outbreaks of the virus this summer, says an NHS expert. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, tells the BBC Scotland coronavirus update programme that testing will be crucial for ensuring the virus stays under control. âWe need to keep encouraging people to see testing as a habit so we can keep on
top of outbreaks as they inevitably rise as restrictions ease,â she says. The NHS official says Grampian has seen big uptake rates for
any outreach or walk-in clinics it has run and this is something the rest of the
country could consider. Gordon Chree from STV asks the first minister about the focus shifting to hospital admissions and away from case numbers. He asks if she has changed tack on her position last summer when there was a push for an ""elimination strategy"". Ms Sturgeon says she still believes it is important to try to keep case rates as low as possible, ""because the lower they are the less chance of transmission and the less chance of new variants"". But she says, ""vaccination changes the game"" in how you deal with the pandemic. ""There's got to be a point to us having a mass vaccination programme, and that is it does allow us to change how we deal with this virus in a way which has much less restriction on our day-to-day lives."" The first minister says the number of people not turning up for jab appointments across
Scotland is higher now than at the start of the vaccination programme. In an answer to BBC Scotland, she says: âIt was particularly high over the weekend at the Hydro but it is
not an issue only affecting the Hydro."" The first minister say the government is considering what flexibility it can build
into the system to ânip in the budâ any non-attendance issues. Ms Sturgeon refers to news that at some vaccination sites over the weekend, there was a significant amount of ""no-shows"" where people did not turn up for their jab She says, overall, it is important to stress that uptake levels remain ""incredibly high"". The first minister adds: ""When people fail to attend, there will be a variety of reasons for this and some of them will not be to down to the individual, so no-one is pointing any fingers here."" Concluding her opening statements, Ms Sturgeon says all of us continue to have a part to play and speaks about the importance of vaccination. She says the latest data shows that two doses of either vaccine ""offer high levels of protection against this new variant"". We also expect that vaccines will offer even higher levels of effectiveness against hospitalisation and the risk of dying. So we are currently working to accelerate the programme as far and as fast as supplies allow. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister  Allow Twitter content?

The first minister says there will always be people who need hospital treatment, but that going forward ""we might not need to react quite so aggressively with tough restrictions in the face of rising case numbers"". ""Instead, we hope that we'll be able to rely more on enhanced public health interventions like testing and vaccination and on good public health practises on the part of the public,"" she adds.  The first minister says stemming case numbers has made tough restrictions necessary during the pandemic. She says a ""significant degree of caution is still appropriate"" and that is why, so far, the government has opted to keep Glasgow in level three. But if continues and increased vaccination breaks the rise in case numbers, Ms Sturgeon says she hopes the response to the virus ""can increasingly evolve as well"". Nicola Sturgeon says the impact of the vaccination programme
could reduce the amount of âtough restrictionsâ needed in some parts of Scotland. As the number of jabs issued topped 3.1m, Ms Sturgeon says an âincreasingly vital partâ of the Scottish governmentâs consideration is understanding
the âimpact of vaccinationâ. This could mean that increased community testing and localised
acceleration of vaccine rollouts might feature more than further lockdown measures. Ms Sturgeon says the so-called Indian variant is proving more transmissible
and this is reflected in the increased case numbers. As of 07:30 this morning, 3,138,366 people in Scotland had
received their first dose of the vaccine, an increase of 16,421 since yesterday. In addition, 1,881,214 have received their second dose, an
increase of 29,035. Which means, as of today, more than five million doses of vaccine have been given in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon begins with an update of the latest coronavirus
figures. The first minister confirms that a further 318 people have tested positive for Covid â which
is 2% of the tests carried out yesterday. This takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 232,661. There are 97 people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19,
an increase of three, and six in intensive care, up one from yesterday. There have also been two more deaths recorded in the past 24 hours
of people who tested positive in the previous 28 days. That brings the total number of deaths by that measurement to 7,666. Nicola Sturgeon will begin the Scottish government's coronavirus
briefing shortly, with chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith. You can follow the latest developments right here and watch or

Concerns have been raised over whether vaccination letters have been sent to correct addresses.

Maureen Downey, 35, is an unpaid carer for her 18-year-old son living in the west end of Glasgow. Despite receiving the AstraZeneca jag on 11 March, she recently received a letter warning her that she had missed her first vaccine appointment. She contacted the health board after being unable to book a second appointment via the vaccine helpline - and heard there were two conflicting records on her receipt of the vaccine. ""One record said I'd missed the first jag,"" she said. ""I was told there are two different systems - the one which Glasgow health board uses and NHS Inform's booking system, and they don't talk to one another. ""The only

"Indian yoga guru Baba Ramdev runs a vast business empire Doctors in India have hit out against yoga guru Baba Ramdev over his controversial statements against modern medicine. He recently said that tens of thousands died of Covid after taking modern medicines and mocked patients for trying to get oxygen cylinders. The guru withdrew his statement after the health minister criticised him. But he again took a swipe at modern medicine on Monday for not having a cure for some diseases. Modern, science-based medicine is the backbone of India's healthcare systems, but alternative therapies like ayurveda and homoeopathy are also hugely popular. Many gurus like Ramdev have launched successful businesses on the back of selling herbal medicines and products. India also has a Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (Ayush) to promote traditional systems. The Indian Medical Association (IMA), an organisation that represents doctors in India, has criticised the guru for his ""insensitive"" remarks in the middle of the pandemic. Doctors the BBC spoke to said such statements from a guru with millions of followers were ""irresponsible and demoralising"". A video of Baba Ramdev mocking patients for trying to find oxygen went viral earlier this month. It's not clear when he made the statement, but he is heard making references to oxygen shortages in several cities in April and May. ""God has given us free oxygen, why don't we breathe that? How can there be a shortage when God has filled the atmosphere with oxygen? Fools are looking for oxygen cylinders. Just breathe the free oxygen. Why are you complaining about shortage of oxygen and beds and crematoriums?"" he said. The statement drew sharp criticism from doctors and families of Covid patients who demanded an apology.

As pressure grew, India's Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who is also a doctor, issued a statement, asking the guru to withdraw his remarks. ""Allopathy [modern medicine] and the doctors attached to it have given new lives to millions of people. It's very unfortunate for you to say that people died from consuming allopathic medicines. ""We should not forget that this battle can only be won through united efforts. In this war, our doctors, nurses and other health workers are risking their lives to save people's lives. Their dedication towards serving mankind in this crisis is unparalleled and exemplary."" On Sunday, Baba Ramdev withdrew his controversial statement in a tweet. But a day later, he issued a letter asking the IMA why modern medicine had no cure for 25 diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. This video can not be played Baba Ramdev: We want to give overseas companies tough competition This has again infuriated doctors. Prominent pulmonologist Dr A Fathahudeen, who has treated thousands of Covid patients, told the BBC that such statements cause lasting damage. ""For more than a year, healthcare workers like me have been in a war-like situation. We have saved tens of thousand of lives. It's really unfortunate, insulting and hurtful to read such statements,"" he said. Dr Fathahudeen added that modern medicine had evolved over the years with constant research and studies. ""We follow evidence-based practice. At any given time, thousands of researchers are working to come up with cures. Look at the progress we have made in cancer treatment. We have to constantly evolve and learn. It's hard to trust any branch of medicine that offers absolute cure for every disease."" He also added that such statements create doubts in the mind of people when we need to have trust in medicines and vaccines in the middle of a raging pandemic. He shot to fame because of his televised yoga classes. Millions followed him and he received praise across the world for promoting yoga and healthy living. In 2006, he helped launch Patanjali Ayurveda to sell herbal medicines and a few years later,the business expanded to selling almost everything, from flour, jeans, soaps, oils, biscuits and even cow urinefrom stores in even the remotest corners of the country. He was successful in translating his popularity into building a business empire. The herbal pill is advertised on websites and in-store as helping with Covid-19 The expansion of his business also coincided with the Hindu nationalist BJP coming to power in 2014. Baba Ramdev has openly supported both the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and even campaigned for the party. Patanjali Ayurveda launched Coronil - a combination of herbs used in traditional Indian medicine - in June last year and claimed that it could cure Covid. But marketing of the product as Covid medicine had to stop after the government said there was no data to show it worked as a treatment.But it didn't ban Coronil, and said that it could be sold as an ""immunity booster"". Then in February, Patanjali supporters claimed that Coronil had been approved by the WHO - prompting it to issue a denial: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dr Vardhan was criticised for attending an event with Baba Ramdev in February where claims about Coronil as a cure for Covid were repeated. Coronil was also found selling in some stores in the UKwhich led to the drug regulator there saying no such drug was authorised. In 2018, Baba Ramdev launched a messaging app calling it ""a home-grown rival to WhatsApp"",but it was soon removed from app stores amid a furore over security flaws.

"This video can not be played Elena Morgan, part of Wales' elite development squad, said the situation was ""really sad"" There are ""grave concerns"" about the future of public swimming pools across Wales, according to the sport's governing body. Swim Wales has warned up to 10% - or 30 pools - may never open again, with rural areas worst hit. Its research suggests many of Wales' 307 pools have struggled financially while shut during most of the pandemic. The Welsh government said it would spend Â£7m this year to help provide more modern and accessible facilities. Alongside gyms and community centres,pools in Wales reopened on 3 May, but the bills have mounted after they were forced to stay closed for most of the last year. ""It's an astronomical cost running into the hundreds of thousands a year,"" said Angharad Collins, who heads up leisure services across Torfaen. Current Covid-19 restrictions mean 30 people can use an indoor swimming pool at one time, but Ms Collins said this made it difficult to cover costs. Fears child obesity may rise amid Covid lockdowns What's happening with pools, haircuts and gyms? But the chief executive of Torfaen Leisure Trusts - which is responsible for five sites across the county, including three pools - said they were vital for helping residents to stay fit and well. ""I had one lady come to us and say she had completely seized up through the pandemic and actually the pool was her oil,"" she said. Ms Collins, who is also chairwoman of the Welsh Sports Association's Facilities Committee, warned the biggest challenge would be in four months' time with the end of financial support from both the UK and Welsh governments. ""I think it's feasible but we're going to need the public support. Every pool in Wales will need the public support to ensure they remain open,"" she added. Simon Morgan (left) said Covid restrictions would drastically cut the number of swimming lessons possible at Cambrian Aquatics Centre The cost is a concern shared by Simon Morgan, who took over the running of Cambrian Aquatics Centre in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, five years ago with other parents from a swimming group. ""It's half a million quid a year - it's really difficult when you have no income,"" he said. Mr Morgan said support from the Welsh government and Sport Wales had been ""amazing"", but his priority was getting people back in the water. ""We had 1,200 in swimming lessons a week, now we're down to about 600... that really affects our ability to generate our own revenue,"" he added. Fears for children's safety as pools stay shut Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Mr Morgan said the pool was built in 1962 to stop people drowning in the nearby River Dee and had been a mainstay in the town ever since. But he said the coronavirus pandemic and the current restrictions made it difficult to have younger children in the pool as, with parents observing, the numbers allowed to swim were cut further. His daughter Elena, 18, who learned to swim there as a child, said the situation was ""really sad"". Pontypool Active Living Centre has one of three public swimming pools in Torfaen She is part of the national elite development squad and said she would not have raced for Wales without her local pool. ""Being a swimmer myself, I know how much I enjoy it and how much other people can enjoy it and it is disappointing how pools are struggling... it's just sad,"" she said. A report by Swim Wales found one in five pools had been completely closed for a year, with 80% ""inactive"" for 43 weeks out of 52. Tackling mental heath issues brought on by Covid Female athletes 'harassed' while training outdoors Chief executive Fergus Feeney said he was most concerned about rural areas where facilities might already be scarce, with fewer customers. ""It's very hard to make ends meet with rural footfall and, if those facilities go from those communities, they'll be even worse off,"" he added. He has called for a ""nationwide campaign"" to get people to use their local pools instead of losing them. The age of pools is also a concern for the organisation, with more than half being at least 20 years old and having no investment since they were built. A Welsh government spokesman said physical activity would continue to play an important role in helping people to deal with the mental and physical effects of the past 14 months. ""That is why we have invested over Â£40m to support sport and physical activity over the course of the pandemic and are investing an additional Â£7m this year to provide more modern and accessible facilities,"" he said. ""We hope that more people will be able to access these facilities as the public health conditions improve and restrictions are eased.""

"The European Commission said there was no alternative but the ""full and correct implementation"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol Brussels must show common sense and take a pragmatic approach to the NI Protocol, the UK government has said. It said it was disappointed that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was not fully recognising the effects of the protocol. It is the part of the Brexit dealthat puts a trade border in the Irish Sea. Ms von der Leyen said on Monday that there was no alternative but the ""full and correct implementation"" of the protocol. The UK government said its priority was the Good Friday Agreement, while the European Union was focussed on the single market. Technical talks to simplify the operation of the protocol are ongoing. The protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports - but it is strongly opposed to the protocol among unionists, who see it as separating Northern Ireland from the UK. It was agreed by the United Kingdom and European Union in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. However, in recent weeks the UK government's rhetoric against the protocol has hardened. Earlier this month the UK's Brexit minister said it washard to see how the current operation of the protocol was sustainable. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland The UK was committed to working with the EU, but there needed to be a ""pragmatic, risk-based approach"" to challenges over the protocol, said a government spokesman. ""The protocol relies on the support of all communities in Northern Ireland so it is disappointing that there was not more recognition from the commission president of the impact that the current operation of the protocol is having in Northern Ireland,"" said the spokesman. ""While the EU prioritise protection of the single market and treat the regulatory boundary as if it were like any other external EU border, our focus remains on protecting the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement in all its dimensions."" Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? NI Protocol 'legally rotten to the core' Irish Sea border 'still causing difficulties' Speaking in Brussels on Monday night, Mrs Von der Leyen said the protocol was the ""only possible solution to ensure peace and stability in Northern Ireland while protecting the integrity of the EU single market"". She added that any problems flowed from Brexit rather than the protocol, but the UK and EU had ""a common duty to do whatever we can to reduce tensions in Northern Ireland"". She said the current technical talks were exploring practical solutions to help minimise disruption to everyday life in Northern Ireland. Ursula von der Leyen oversees trade relations with the UK Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader-designate Edwin Poots said that costs for businesses in Northern Ireland of the protocol would ""spiral"" as 15,000 checks will ultimately have to be made every week on goods. ""This protocol will hurt every single individual in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Poots told the Stormont Assembly on Tuesday. ""I will continue to press hard with the UK government the issues that are at stake here. The case is unarguable that this protocol is bad for Northern Ireland."" DUP MPs Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Gavin Robinson, along with Lord Dodds, met the Brexit minister on Tuesday. The trio told Lord Frost the protocol should be replaced, with Sir Jeffrey saying their message was ""clear and unambiguous"". ""The protocol has no support from any shade or quarter of unionism. Its imposition without the consent of both traditions in Northern Ireland and overriding of cross-community voting safeguards has seriously undermined support for devolution,"" Sir Jeffrey added. Outgoing First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of having a ""tin ear"" to concerns about the protocol. ""It is hugely disappointing, in spite of everything that has happened, the fact that we are talking about cancer drugs being prevented from coming into Northern Ireland,"" she said. Arlene Foster says Mrs von der Leyen's comments show a 'tin ear' ""The fact that there are more checks from Great Britain into Northern Ireland than there are in Rotterdam; that still the European Union and the European Commission have had a tin ear to the concerns and the absolutely genuine concerns of the people in Northern Ireland."" Outgoing UUP leader Steve Aiken said Ms von der Leyen's remarks were ""tone deaf"", and urged her to engage with his party, ""the party that helped write and implement the Good Friday Agreement"". He said: ""She is at best badly informed, or at worst, is wilfully misrepresenting the impact of the EU's failure to come to an acceptable agreement with the UK, and the people of Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, we are all stuck in the middle. ""Northern Ireland is being used as a bargaining chip between Brussels and London."" But Ms von der Leyen's comments were welcomed by Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard, who said Northern Ireland businesses wanted ""the protections the protocol provides"". ""It's time the British government stopped the charades and implement what it has already agreed,"" he said. ""We also need to see the economy minister in the north using the unique situation the protocol affords the north to attract investment and jobs."" During Brexit negotiations, all sides agreed that protecting the Northern Ireland peace deal (the Good Friday agreement) was an absolute priority. It meant keeping the land border between the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) and Northern Ireland (in the UK) open and avoiding new infrastructure like cameras and border posts. That was easy when the whole island of Ireland was part of the EU. But after Brexit, a new arrangement was needed because the EU requires certain goods to be inspected at the point of entry into its single market. So, the EU and the UK negotiated the Northern Ireland Protocol, which came into force on 1 January 2021. The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said Mrs Von der Leyen's comments ""showed how little she cares about peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". The LCC was set up in 2015 to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities. Loyalist paramilitary groups like the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association are also represented on it. LCC Chairman David Campbell said: ""I would appeal to her to start listening and to recognise that the imposition of the protocol on the people of Northern Ireland without their involvement or consent is unsustainable and actually contrary to many of the key founding tenets of the European Union."" When Ursula von der Leyen talks about practical solutions, she is alluding to the technical negotiations which are happening right now between EU and UK officials. Officials are crunching through about 30 different issues relating to the protocol -  everything from pet travel to VAT on second-hand cars to steel tariffs to medicines and the movement of plants. They're working through those to see what can ease the implementation of the protocol on the ground. But the difficulty is a dramatic shift is not going to happen at a technical level. It's something where there needs to be a political commitment and, at the moment, there is no sign of the EU or the UK being prepared to make that big political compromise. Last week, an LCC member told MPsviolence could not be ruled outif the protocol remained. The organisation also met Lord Frostto discuss the protocol earlier this month. A small protest against the protocol outside Belfast City Hall in early May Rioting erupted insome loyalist areas of Northern Ireland in April- withtensions around the protocol partly blamed. Since then, there has been a switch to demonstrations largely in the form of loyalist band parades and marches. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently investigating about 303unlawful parades against the protocol. Meanwhile, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said she has sought legal adviceover the DUP's absence at north-south meetings. The DUP is boycotting some North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meetings due to its opposition to the protocol. Ms Mallon told the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday that ministers are legally obliged to attend. Earlier this month, Agriculture Minister and DUP leader-designate Edwin Poots was criticised for preventinganother north-south ministerial meeting from taking place.

"UK tourism is set for a slow recovery from the pandemic, with spending by holidaymakers this year expected to be just half the level of 2019. Forecasts by the VisitBritain agency indicate that domestic tourism will be worth Â£51.4bn in 2021, down from Â£91.6bn two years ago. Its forecast for spending by foreign tourists in the UK is Â£6.2bn, less than a quarter of the Â£28.4bn in 2019. The predictions come as UK tourism chiefs prepare for a summit on Tuesday. VisitBritain and VisitEngland are bringing industry leaders together - some in person, some virtually - to discuss priorities for helping the sector to recover and rebuild. Last year, the domestic tourism industry shrank by about two-thirds as coronavirus restrictions forced the cancellation or postponement of millions of people's travel plans. According to the tourism industry, that represented a Â£58bn loss to the economy. Despite the gloomy forecasts for this year, tourism analysts have predicted that demand for UK holidays is likely to outstrip supply this summer, with many holidaymakers unable or unwilling to brave foreign travel amid continuing restrictions. Like many hostels, Elterwater has only been able to welcome back limited numbers of guests ""We're offering a shadow of what we normally would and we'll struggle to break even,"" says Christine Thomas. This is usually peak season at Elterwater Hostel in Cumbria, which she and her husband, Alan, own. They're in the heart of the Lake District and they would normally be close to fully booked, with fell-runners, walkers and school groups, not to mention overseas visitors. Now they're only about a third full. Even if more people want to come, Covid rules mean they can't fill all their 38 beds. People from different groups aren't allowed to share bathroom facilities and the hostel only has five showers. They still provide hearty home-cooked meals, but you can't mingle with other visitors, like hostel guests often do. And the self-catering kitchen is closed. The past year feels like a ""write-off"" they say. Hotels that can offer en suite rooms, or self-contained self-catering places are probably managing better, says Christine. And if the rules are eased further after 21 June, that could make a big difference. ""Hostels are basically social places. It's about people meeting each other and exchanging experiences,"" she says. Last week, the tourism agency launched a Â£5m campaign entitled Escape the Everyday - Enjoy the UK this Summer. The campaign is aimed at boosting domestic demand, with a focus on cities and city visitor attractions, as well as on areas that have been particularly hard hit by the lack of international visitors. ""Britain's tourism industry is a huge driver of our economy but has faced many challenges over the past year,"" said tourism minister Nigel Huddleston. ""We've provided more than Â£25bn in support, and I have been impressed by VisitBritain/VisitEngland and the wider sector for its agile and innovative response, coming up with new ways to provide hospitality and entertainment while maintaining social distancing and protecting people's safety."" British Tourist Authority chairman Lord Patrick McLoughlin said the sector had faced ""an unprecedented challenge"" during the pandemic. ""Tourism is a critical industry for our country, delivering jobs and economic growth across the nations and regions and strengthening our place on the world stage,"" he added. Lord McLoughlin said that government's support measures, including the furlough scheme, the VAT cut for hospitality businesses and the business rates holiday, had been ""a lifeline"", helping many businesses survive and keeping people in jobs. ""We will continue to work with the UK government as it sets out its recovery plan and ambitions for tourism, and across the industry, to cement the recovery and the future of one of this country's greatest industries,"" he added.

"It is crucial that surgical services in Northern Ireland are not ""stood down"" again, according to a report by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). The most recent statistics reveal that one in four people in Northern Ireland is on a waiting list. Northern Irelandhas the worst waiting times of any UK region. The Health Minister Robin Swann said tackling waiting lists is a ""long-term task"" and needs ""long-term, recurrent funding"". The college has said that a regional approach involving patient and surgical teams travelling to surgical hubs is the key to moving forward. Surgeons acknowledge that could involve additional travel for some people. ""The Action Plan for Surgical Recovery: 10 steps not 10 years"" has called for investment, waiting list and surgery plans, Covid-light sites in every trust area, surgical hubs and elective accountability. A Covid-light site is a hospital or unit where, as far as possible, only elective patients who do not have the virus are treated. 17,000 medical procedures cancelled in pandemic Unspent Covid cash could 'get surgery going again' NI has 'lost control' of hospital waiting lists From the start of the pandemic, almost all elective surgery was cancelled in Northern Ireland, as wards were closed and nurses moved to work solely in Covid areas. The move only exacerbated the waiting list crisis. This video can not be played 'I feel I've been let down' County Antrim man Brian Revels, after developing a problem with his hip for several years, was told he would have to wait between four and five years before getting surgery. Mr Revels then used his savings for private treatment. He told BBC News NI that the ""operation took place within two days"". Mr Revels has also gone privately for a hernia operation, after being told it too would take a couple of years. John Brennan, from Lambeg in County Antrim, is waiting for three different surgeries - hip, knee and cataract surgery. He has been on the list for a hip replacement for four years and fell last Friday after his leg gave way. ""My consultant had told me he would like to have done the surgery in three months,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I would sometimes like to have been told my hip was broken but because it's the only way I am going to get the surgery. ""I would not wish this pain on anyone. ""There has to be an answer to all this. How much does it cost the NHS in painkillers alone?"" he asked. Mark Taylor from the Royal College of Surgeons said statistics ""belie the true scale of the problem"" Mark Taylor, Director for Northern Ireland at the RCS, said that since the pandemic, the situation has only ""worsened over the last year"" with the health service now in ""deep crisis"". ""These patients will be waiting in pain and uncertainty, some of them unable to work, to go about day-to-day life,"" he added. ""They will be waiting for treatments ranging from hip and knee replacements to post-mastectomy breast reconstructions, and children's surgeries such as putting in vents for ear glue. ""The statistics also belie the true scale of the problem - some will seek expensive private treatment."" The plan by the RCS also details the need for additional recruitment and retention of staff, the launch of a comprehensive review of surgical services to support surgical trainees, the implementation of physical and mental wellbeing programmes and protected time for health professionals to learn. NI's waiting lists could take 10 years to tackle 'I would beg for a hospital appointment' According to the College, more than 4,000 ""red flag"" cancer procedures, including surgery, have been cancelled since the beginning of the pandemic. Patients waiting for general surgery, trauma and orthopaedics, and ENT (ear, nose and throat) or urology procedures are worst affected. Waiting times for orthopaedics are especially bad and, in some areas, urgent cases can take between 1.5 years (80 weeks) and nearly 5 years (255 weeks) for treatment. Children's surgery has also been severely affected with routine procedures taking anywhere between three and four years to be carried out. Mr Taylor added that leaders in Northern Ireland are now faced with a choice to either continue to let things ""spiral out of control"" or to use the easing of Covid-19 pressures as a ""turning point and an opportunity to do things differently"". ""We must ensure that no matter where a patient lives in Northern Ireland they can expect the highest quality of surgical care,"" he said. ""Surgeons have already demonstrated great flexibility in adapting to the challenges of Covid-19 and the limitations placed on capacity. ""Protected surgical beds, Covid-19 light sites, a strong surgical team and surgical hubs are key parts to any meaningful solution. ""The Royal College of Surgeons stands ready to work with all stakeholders in delivering a surgical service fit for the 21st Century."" In a statement the health minister said the report highlighted the need for greater investment. ""Sustained additional funding is not the answer by itself - but we cannot start fixing waiting lists without it,"" Robin Swann said. ""As minister I have tasked the system to be innovative, to be ambitious and to get as many services fully back online as quickly as possible. Already we are now breaking down Trust and administrative barriers at a far greater scale than ever before. Mr Swann said clinicians and patients were now travelling to ""better utilise capacity"". ""The new regional day procedure centre at the Lagan Valley Hospital is a clear illustration of that. ""Over the next few weeks I will also be publishing the cancer recovery plan for Northern Ireland, an elective care framework and the urgent and emergency care review. ""These reports will detail both the immediate and longer term actions that are needed to bring down our waiting times. We must start putting this right. It is a long-term task however and it needs long-term, recurrent funding.

"This video can not be played Off-road bikers causing ""distress"" and safety fears Farmers fear escaped livestock could cause a serious crash after off-road bikers cut through fences, allowing animals to get on to the highway. They claim there has been a rise in the amount of fencing being cut to access their land during the Covid pandemic. Seven sheep died after being hit by vehicles after getting free in Ebbw Vale, prompting calls for action. Blaenau Gwent council said it was liaising with police where fencing was ""deliberately being damaged"". Bikers have been accused of cutting through fences and knocking over fence posts, with their deep tyre tracks destroying grazing habitats. A police inspector said anyone caught committing criminal damage could face prosecution. Sam Pearce shows some of the damaged fencing Sam Pearce, from Mynydd Carn-Y-Cefn Graziers' Association, which represents farmers in the area, said they were extremely worried about livestock getting free as ""it could result in a fatal car accident"". ""Over the last two weeks we've seen a number of animals get killed on the roads, and by dog attacks in the residential area,"" she said. ""It's causing great distress to everybody in the community."" The couple who created an 'animal nirvana' Farmer refuses to let cow be taken for destruction One evening this month, seven sheep were killed in a crash involving several cars near a supermarket in Ebbw Vale. Another animal was killed in a dog attack outside a pub. There are also reports of livestock on the roads elsewhere, including Abertillery and Blaina. Daniel Burrows said the damage the bikers have done to the landscape was ""soul-destroying"" The farmers said off-road motorcyclists have been using professional, heavy-duty cutting equipment to slice through high-tensile steel fences to access common land on Mynydd Carn-Y-Cefn, where some farmers have the right to graze their livestock. BBC Wales saw hundreds of metres of damaged and destroyed fencing. Daniel Burrows has grazing rights to the common and has lost livestock recently due to them being hit by traffic after they got free. He said it was ""heart-breaking"" and that the damage to fencing has ""got worse since lockdown"". ""Look what they've done to the landscape itself, it's soul destroying,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, with these fences down, there is nothing stopping them. Sheep shouldn't be on the road."" Representatives from Mynydd Carn-Y-Cefn Graziers' Association said they wanted the council to repair the fences. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Blaenau Gwent council said it was not solely a council issue, and it also required the co-operation of livestock owners and members of the community. In a statement, it said it ""responds to calls to assist the police in removing any sheep from the highway where they are causing a potential danger"". ""We also try to identify the owners of the animals so that they can be collected but, of course, we have to rely on the response of the individual owner in doing that. ""The maintenance of fences is always the responsibility of the landowner. ""Wherever these are council maintained, we will arrange for repairs to be carried out. ""We are also working closely with the police to look at areas where fences are deliberately being damaged by people wanting to gain access to the land.""

""We have done everything we can do - sanitisers, distancing and track and trace in place. We just have to see how we go,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. However, he added that businesses would still need financial help. ""Landlords are still looking for rent and there are still wages to pay and overheads, which haven't decreased in price."" Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the continued easing of restrictions was a ""huge step forward for Northern Ireland's economy"". ""Our businesses are looking forward to reopening but they are also responsible. It's about doing things safely and making sure we don't take any steps backward,"" she told Good Morning Ulster. Mrs Dodds also said NI tourism drives would be launched in the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain.

"Riley was one of the students whose photo was altered (Image courtesy of family) A Florida high school is facing a backlash for altering the yearbook photos of 80 female students to add clothing to their chests and shoulders. The school district told local media the changes were made to ensure the photos met the dress code, which says girls' shirts must be ""modest"". But critics pointed to yearbook photos of male students left unedited despite violating the same standards. The digital alterations were made without permission, the students say. Bartram Trail High School's yearbook co-ordinator - a female teacher - made the decision to edit the photos after determining they had violated the dress code, the St Johns County school district said. A disclaimer on Bartram Trail's website warns students that their yearbook photos may be digitally edited to be consistent with the dress code. But some students have called the alterations distressing and accused the school of sexism. ""The double standard in the yearbook is more so that they looked at our body and thought just a little bit of skin showing was sexual,"" Bartram Trail student Riley O'Keefe, 15, told CBS affiliate WJAX News. ""But then they looked at the boys, for the swim team photos and other sports photos and thought that was fine, and that's really upsetting and uncomfortable."" A US high school (stock image) In a statement to WJAX, the district said the school's previous policy was to remove all photos that violated the dress code, and this year's edits were to make sure all students were included. Following the criticism, Bartram Trail, a government-run high school near Jacksonville with about 2,500 students, has said they will issue refunds for the $100 (Â£70) yearbook to parents upset by the changes. The district's dress code for the 2020-2021 school year says that girls' tops and shirts ""must cover the entire shoulder"" and must be ""modest and not revealing or distracting"". ""Excessive make-up"" is not permitted and all students are prohibited from donning ""extreme hairstyles"". Enforcement of the dress code differs between schools, according to the district. How breaking dress codes pays off Why do workplace dress codes persist? The end of high heel dress codes in BC? Bartram Trail's application of these rules stirred local controversy earlier this year when 31 students received dress code violations in a single day. Several of the female students - around 15 and 16 years old - said at the time they were asked to unzip their sweaters and jackets in front of teachers and other students to reveal tank tops and bras underneath. In response, Riley created an online petition asking for changes to the dress code which, she says, ""is clearly based on the sexualisation of young women"". With the code making national headlines again, the petition now has more than 5,000 signatures. US dress codes have been criticised in recent years, with some saying they are applied in ways that shame young women and girls about their bodies. Allow Twitter content?

A 2018 study in Washington, DC, by the National Women's Law Center found that black girls and students with curvier bodies were disproportionately targeted. Riley's mother, Stephanie Fabre, told the BBC the incident ""drew attention to something that wasn't a problem to begin with"". ""Nobody would have looked at that yearbook and looked at these pictures and thought anything of them other than they were beautiful ninth graders,"" she says. ""Some of these edits have drawn mass bullying and emotional stress on some of these girls, because their pictures were so poorly photoshopped that they're being used as memes now and circulating on Snapchat, and that's horrible."" Ms Fabre added that some families are demanding an apology from the school, changes to the dress code and a reissue of the yearbooks with the original photos. But not all parents are against the rules. Another Bartram mother, Rachel D'aquin, told WJAX that she approved of the edits.
