"Theresa May's plan to make GPs in England open their surgeries seven days a week features on several of Saturday's front pages. The Daily Mail says the""personal intervention"",externalby the prime minister comes as ""thousands"" of surgeries close early on weekday afternoons, ""while others take a three-hour lunch break"". According to theDaily Telegraph,external, access to a major package of government funding will be ""contingent"" on GPs being able to demonstrate they are offering appointments when patients want them. The Times warns that many GPs""are likely to be incensed"",externalby the plan, after years of claiming there are too few of them to cope with an ageing population. The Conservative chair of the Commons Health Select Committee has said the Tories ""risk losing the trust of voters"" on the NHS in an interview with the newspaper. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was a GP before entering parliament, says the system is ""underfunded"", and warns that ""relentless"" pressures on staff are contributing to what she describes as a ""human crisis"". She denies that GPs are lazy, claiming she has never encountered one who plays golf during the day, and instead argues that the key to dealing with problems in the NHS is to increase funding for social care. The Guardian reports that Michel Barnier is ""backing away from his hardline approach"" to Brexit The lead story inthe Guardian,externaldetails how the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he wants a ""special"" relationship with the City of London to continue to give EU countries easy access to the financial centre after Britain leaves. The paper says it has seen unpublished minutes that hint at ""unease"" about the costs of Brexit on the rest of the EU, and give the ""first signs"" that Mr Barnier is ""backing away from his hardline approach"". The European Commission has insisted the minutes ""do not correctly reflect"" what was said, but a source has described them to the Guardian as ""more or less accurate"". Tristram Hunt's decision to quit as the Labour MP for Stoke Central is widely seen as bad news for Jeremy Corbyn in Saturday's newspapers. TheDaily Express,externalclaims Labour will need a ""miracle"" to retain the seat in a by-election. For the Times, the resignation underlines Labour's""poor leadership and dearth of talent"",external, whilethe Sun,externalbelieves life is ""too short"" to spend a decade in ""impotent opposition"". Only theDaily Mail,externalis critical of Mr Hunt, arguing that his new job as director of the Victoria and Albert Museum means he joins ""multitudes of like-thinking left-wing luvvies"" running ""almost every public body in the country"". Lord Snowdon features on several front pages following his death aged 86 Photographs of Lord Snowdon are printed on several front pages, including theDaily Express,externalwhich claims the Queen has been ""left saddened"" by the death of her former brother-in-law at the age of 86. TheDaily Telegraph,externalnotes that he was seen as ""one of the country's foremost photographers, but became known for his many affairs"", a fact which prompts The Sun to describe him as ""the romping rock'n'roll royal rebel"". The Daily Mirror highlights some of his""iconic"" images,external, including photographs of David Bowie and Sir Richard Branson, and praises his portraits of the royal family for capturing ""a more human side"".

"Property buyers willing to live at ""unlucky"" number 13 may be encouraged by paying Â£9,000 less than the cost of the average home, a website suggests. Search portal Zoopla has calculated that homes with this number are typically Â£8,974 cheaper than the average UK property. Its survey, released on Friday the 13th, found that nearly a third of owners asked would be less likely to buy number 13. Number one is generally the priciest. Number 100 tends to be the next most expensive property. Lawrence Hall, spokesman for Zoopla, said: ""While superstitions might weigh heavily on the minds of some, in a year with not one but two Friday 13ths - the second of which will be in October - there could be a real opportunity for those not suffering from triskaidekaphobia to secure a property bargain."" Nearly a quarter of those surveyed said they would not exchange or complete on, or even move into, a property on Friday the 13th.

"Bradford has had a rugby league presence since the beginning of the Northern Union in 1895 The Rugby Football League has agreed a deal that will see a new club set up in Bradford for the start of the season. The old Bradford Bulls wasliquidated earlier this monthafter its latest spell in administration, after years of financial problems. Four bids to revive the club were received by the game's governing body. The identity of the winning consortium is not expected to be revealed until next week, but it is believed to be headed by Andrew Chalmers. He is a former chairman of New Zealand Rugby League and used to be a director at Salford Red Devils. Former Wigan and New Zealand coach Graham Lowe is also believed to be involved. The group came close to taking the Bulls out of administration during the Christmas period, when a bid they made was rubber-stamped by the RFL, only to be rejected by the administrator. Chalmers registered the name Bradford Bulls 2017 at Companies House on Friday, and is now expected to meet with the former Bradford Bulls players. RFL director of operations and legal, Karen Moorhouse, said:  ""The RFL is confident that the consortium selected to run a new club in Bradford will provide an exciting and stable future for rugby league in the city."" Earlier this week, a proposed pre-season friendly for a Bradford Select XIII due to take place on Sunday was called offbecause they do not have enough players. The new club will remain in the Kingstone Press Championship, but will start the new season with a 12-point deficit. They will also continue playing at Odsal Stadium, the lease for which is owned by the RFL.

"Costa joined the Blues from Spanish club from Atletico Madrid for Â£32m in 2014 Striker Diego Costa has been left out of the Chelsea squad to face Leicester on Saturday after a dispute with a coach over his fitness. The Spain international has not trained for three days and has not travelled for the Premier League leaders' match with the champions (17:30 GMT). The news comes amid reports he is the subject of an offer to move to China that would beworth Â£30m a year.,external Costa, 28, has scored 14 goals and provided five assists this season. Chelsea declined to comment. It is understood Blues owner Roman Abramovich is not interested in releasing him from his contract, which expires in 2019, and would not entertain the idea of being forced to do so. Podcast: Is Costa about to derail Chelsea's season? Speaking in early January, Costa admitted he wanted to leave Chelsea last summer, but said he was now happy to stay. Chelsea had been hopeful of agreeing a contract extension with the Brazil-born forward, but the dispute with fitness coach Julio Tous raises new doubts. Diego Costa's record in Premier League matches for Chelsea Costa joined the Blues for Â£32m in 2014, and was understood to be close to a return to former club Atletico Madrid after a difficult 2015-16 campaign. ""Did I want to go? Yes, yes, I was about to leave,"" he said earlier this month. ""But not because of Chelsea. ""There was one thing I wanted to change for family reasons but it wasn't to be, and I continue to be happy here."" Shortly afterwards, manager Antonio Conte said he believed the striker was now ""completely focused"" on ""fighting for this club and for his shirt"". He added: ""When Diego decided to stay, I wasn't concerned. He is showing great patience in the right way, in every moment of the game."" MidfieldersJon Mikel ObiandOscarrecently left Chelsea for Chinese clubs - Tianjin TEDA and Shanghai SIPG respectively - while ex-Manchester City and United strikerCarlos Tevezjoined Shanghai Shenhua from Boca Juniors in a deal reportedly worth Â£310,000 a week. Former England defender Danny Mills on BBC Radio 5 live Why shouldn't Diego Costa go to China? There is no loyalty from clubs in football. He's already defected from Brazil, his native country, to play for Spain and has no real affinity with England and the Premier League. I'm sure he likes London but he doesn't have any real affinity here. Brazilians move around all the time; they will go wherever the money is. This is how the Premier League started, paying huge money for foreign stars and now China is trying wrestle the Premier League away from England. In general, how many England players have gone abroad in the past? We like our creature comforts. Brazilians are quite happy to up and leave. Diego Costa has got no loyalty or affinity with England and the Premier League and you can't blame him - everybody would do the same thing. Former England midfielder Jermaine Jenas on BBC Radio 5 live Everything has been smooth sailing for Chelsea up to now. Imagine the faces of Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham. This is what they have been waiting for. Another bid from the Chinese market seems to be rocking the boat of another top club. It's a huge problem. When these situations arise, the players are probably thinking they'll go and do two years and then come back and play in the Premier League. Financially, they're not just supporting their immediate family, they are supporting their whole familyâ¦ aunts, uncles and cousins. I'd still give Chelsea a good chance of winning the title even if they lost him. With the lead they now have, I think they can cope if they replace him. You don't want to keep players at your club who don't want to be there. Yes, Costa has been a huge part of Chelsea's success but he's not Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. Everton winger Yannick Bolasie on BBC Radio 5 live Diego Costa is a problem for any defender. He is strong, quick and doesn't stop running. He sets the tone for all the other Chelsea players. It's frightening the way the Chinese market is acting right now.

"A urine test that can reveal how healthy your meals are has been developed by UK scientists. They think it could be used to improve nutritional advice or in weight loss because people are notoriously bad at recording their own eating habits. The test,detailed in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology,external, detects chemicals made as food is processed by the body. The research team believe it could be widely available within two years. The urine samples are analysed to determine the structure of the chemicals floating around in it using a technique called a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This gives clues to both recent meals and long term dietary habits. The results of your body processing fruit, vegetables, fish and different types of meat leave a distinct signature in the urine. Clues to the state of the body's metabolism and gut health can also be detected by investigating the chemicals in it. The test was developed by a collaboration between Imperial College London, Newcastle University and Aberystwyth University. Dr Isabel Garcia-Perez, one of the researchers at Imperial, said: ""This will eventually provide a tool for personalised dietary monitoring to help maintain a healthy lifestyle. ""We're not at the stage yet where the test can tell us a person ate 15 chips yesterday and two sausages, but it's on the way."" Could urine be more accurate than food diaries? In trials, around 60% of people either under or over report what they are eating. Prof Gary Frost, another scientist at Imperial, said this could be the first independent test of what people munch on at home. He told the BBC News website: ""You can really tell whether someone's been following a healthy diet or not. ""The bigger you are the more likely you are to under-report what you eat. ""People find it difficult to open up to what types of foods they eat at home, which is a major problem."" The researchers believe the test results could help combat people's obesity or risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Prof Frost said: ""If someone is very big and their profile says they're eating lots of energy dense foods like meat, then you can try to change that profile and then test them again later. ""It remains to be seen, but people might respond better to that and there is a desperate need for tools to help people change their diet."" He says doing the test on large numbers of people would build up a picture of what the nation was really eating, which could be used to design better public health campaigns. The scientists were able to spot the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets after tests on 19 people who spent days eating a carefully controlled set of meals. Four diets of varying degrees of healthiness were given to the patients and their urine was sampled morning, noon and night. Dr Des Walsh, from the UK Medical Research Council, commented: ""Though this research is still in its early stages, it's grappling with essential methods in food and diet studies where advances are really needed. ""Measuring what we eat and drink more accurately will widen the benefits of nutrition research, developing better evidence-based interventions to improve an individual's health and reduce obesity.""

"A California shoe company has recalled a boot after a customer discovered the sole left tiny swastika prints behind. The boot went viral after a Reddit user posted a picture showing the shoe's tread and its swastika imprints. Conal International Trading Co, the City of Industry company that manufactures the boot, has since issued a public apology and pulled the shoe. The company said it was ""no way intentional"" and an ""obvious mistake"" made by manufacturers in China. ""We will not be selling any of our boots with the misprint to anyone,"" the company said in a statement. ""We would never create a design to promote hate. We don't promote hate at our company."" The Reddit user's post has been viewed more than two million times, sending social media into a flurry.

"The daughters of George W Bush have written an open letter to Sasha and Malia Obama as they prepare to leave the White House. President Barack Obama's time in office ends on 20 January. In the letter, Jenna Bush-Hager and Barbara Bush say they will be ""rooting"" for the Obama sisters in their ""next chapter"". They also lived in the White House for eight years, 2001 to 2009, and moved on to university and jobs. Malia (R) will start a degree at Harvard University later this year ""Malia and Sasha, eight years ago on a cold November day, we greeted you on the steps of the White House. We saw both the light and wariness in your eyes as you gazed at your new home. ""We left our jobs in Baltimore and New York early and travelled to Washington to show you around. To show you the Lincoln bedroom, and the bedrooms that were once ours, to introduce you to all the peopleâthe florists, the grounds-keepers and the butlersâwho dedicate themselves to making this historic house a home. ""The four of us wandered the majestic halls of the house you had no choice but to move in to. When you slid down the banister of the solarium, just as we had done as eight-year-olds and again as 20-year-olds chasing our youth, your joy and laughter were contagious. After leaving the White House Barbara (L) founded a non-profit health foundation, and Jenna is a journalist and author ""In eight years, you have done so much. Seen so much. ""You stood at the gates of the Robben Island cell where South Africa's Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for decades, your arms around your father. ""You travelled to Liberia and Morocco with your mom to talk with girls about the importance of education - girls who saw themselves in you, saw themselves in your parents, saw who they could become if they continued to study and learn. Malia was 10 years old and Sasha was seven when Barack Obama took office in 2009 ""You attended state dinners, hiked in national parks, met international leaders and managed to laugh at your dad's jokes during the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, all while being kids, attending school and making friends. ""We have watched you grow from girls to impressive young women with grace and ease. ""And through it all you had each other. Just like we did. ""Now you are about to join another rarified club, one of former First Children - a position you didn't seek and one with no guidelines. Sasha missed President Obama's farewell speech on Tuesday because she was revising for an exam ""But you have so much to look forward to. You will be writing the story of your lives, beyond the shadow of your famous parents, yet you will always carry with you the experiences of the past eight years. ""Never forget the wonderful people who work at the White House. Our greeter as seven-year-olds at our grandfather's inauguration was Nancy, the White House florist, who ushered us in from the cold. ""She helped us make colourful bouquets of winter flowers for our grandparents' bedside. Twenty years later, Nancy did the flowers for Jenna's wedding. Cherish your own Nancy. Handing out food to homeless people in Chicago in 2008 ""We stay in touch with our secret service. They were part of growing up for us: there for first dates, first days and even an engagement and a honeymoon. ""We know it wasn't always easy - the two of you and the two of us were teenagers trailed by men in backpacksâbut they put their lives on hold for us. ""Enjoy college. As most of the world knows, we did. And you won't have the weight of the world on your young shoulders anymore. Explore your passions. Learn who you are. Make mistakes - you are allowed to. ""Continue to surround yourself with loyal friends who know you, adore you and will fiercely protect you. Those who judge you don't love you, and their voices shouldn't hold weight. Rather, it's your own hearts that matter.

"Samya Gupta, a 21-year-old law student from the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, was napping on a seat near the back of a bus when she felt something on her breasts. It was the hands of a man sitting in the row behind her. ""The moment I realised (what was happening), I stood up from my seat, yelled and asked for his ID proof,"" Gupta wrotein a widely-shared Facebook post,external. She went on to detail how she not only confronted her alleged molester, but got the bus to take a detour so he could be taken into police custody. Gupta ended her account with a series of hashtags including #TooHorrifiedToLetItGo. But the social media users who have expressed admiration for Gupta's stand, may be disappointed by what has happened since. In her post Gupta wrote that when she challenged the man, who she says was in his 40s, he apologised. There were around 30 other passengers on the bus and they reportedly vocalised their support for Gupta. But they also advised her to not pursue the matter, she said. ""My co-passengers asked me to accept it, and let it go,"" Gupta wrote, ""But I decided otherwise. I decided to not let it go. I decided to not let an audacious eve-teaser to go free merely by apologising."" In her post she said that she chose to speak up because she didn't want the alleged aggressor to feel confident enough in the future to escalate his behaviour to a more violent assault - ""to convert into a rapist"". ""Eve teasing""is a common term used in some South Asian countries to refer to a wide variety of behaviour including molestation. According to Sameera Khan, the co-author of 'Why Loiter? Women & Risk on Mumbai Streets' it includes ""flashing or any verbal/physical sexual street harassment that falls short of rape."" ""It's an archaic term,""saysKhan, ""The 'Eve' part comes from the Old Testament and describing harassment as 'teasing' makes it sound almost like a mild romantic overture that should be tolerated - which of course it should not."" Gupta told BBC Trending that she persuaded the bus driver to divert the bus to the nearest local police station. The passengers, who had surrounded the man who had allegedly been groping Gupta, then escorted them both into the building. There Gupta filed a harassment complaint against the man whose name has not emerged in the media and was not named in Gupta's post. ""The process of filing a complaint was lengthy and laborious,"" Gupta added. She says that she was informed she would have to provide her statement in Hindi, a language she says she doesn't know to write well. ""This made me wonder what happens to illiterate women in India who muster up the courage to go to the police,"" she told Trending, ""I'm a law student and even I found the process tedious and challenging."" Gupta wrote in her Facebook post that her problems didn't end when she left the police station. She claimed that when she took another bus several acquaintances of the alleged harasser approached her and told her to drop her complaint. She added that they questioned her character, accusing her of ""goofing around with various guys every now and then, therefore my allegations have no sense of veracity"". A court date was set for a hearing for the harassment charge. But before it arrived Gupta withdrew her charge. Speaking to Trending, she cited a couple of reasons for dropping the case. One, she said, was due to ""complacency with paperwork"" which she claimed resulted in her mobile number becoming available to man's family. As a result, Gupta told Trending, she received calls pressuring her to drop the case because the accused man was a father of two. Similarly, she said, her own family also advised her to drop the case. ""They felt Eve teasing wasn't serious enough an incident to merit going through with a court trial,"" Gupta told Trending. She added: ""I am a student and I don't earn my own money. I come a family with no background with the law. Going to the police station was a big deal for them. I dropped the charge because it seemed like too much pressure on my family."" Local police have defended the handling of the case. Inspector Shiv Mangal Singh told BBC Trending that officers had followed protocol. ""Then the girl, Samya Gupta and her father, came to the police station and told us to drop the case. In terms of the accuser's family getting her phone number, that didn't happen at our end, it may be an administration issue with the lawyers. Similarly, they were people available to translate and write the document in Hindi for her."" Inspector Singh said that even after the case had been dropped, the man still spent several more days in custody, because the statute under which he was arrested requires suspects to remain in custody for 14 days without the prospect of bail. He added: ""We take Eve-teasing seriously and have set up aWhatsapp number,externalwhere women can send complaints about Eve-teasing."" Eve-teasing, is not specifically classified as an offence specific in Indian law. However sections of the Indian Penal code are said to cover offences comprising sexually intimidating behaviour. This includesSection 354,externalwhich is defined as ""assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty"" andSection 509,externalwhich allows for up to three years imprisonment for on ""word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman.""

"L.L. Bean is known for its heavy boots (other boot makers are available) In itself, it was nothing out of the ordinary: a morning tweet by Donald Trump thanking a supporter. The subject of his thanks was one Linda Bean, who was praised for her ""great support and courage"" in the tweet on Thursday. But his post, like many before it, had wider repercussions. Linda Bean is an heiress of the Maine-based catalogue business L.L. Bean - a company Mr Trump then encouraged his 19.7m Twitter followers to support. The tweet poses all sorts of questions about whether it is correct for the most powerful man in the Western world to endorse certain brands over others. But what is the broader effect of a brand being associated with Mr Trump - a man who, despite his election win, will enter the White House next Friday less popular than the man who leaves (at leastaccording to one poll,externalthis week)? Linda Bean was found by the Associated Press to have made a large donation to a pro-Trump PAC (political action committee), named Make Maine Great Again. As a result, she and L.L. Bean have been targeted by anti-Trump groups, including one,#GrabYourWallet,external, that urges a boycott of companies associated with the billionaire and his family. L.L.Bean was forced on the defensive earlier this week. Its executive chairman, Shawn Gorman,wrote on Facebook,externalthat the company was ""disappointed to learn that Grab Your Wallet is advocating a boycott against L.L.Bean solely because Linda Bean, who is only one of 50+ family members involved with the business, personally supported Donald Trump for President"". But despite the company's statement, the links to Mr Trump may not necessarily have been harmful: on the day of Mr Trump's tweet, the company's stock price ended the day higher, and Linda Bean told Fox Business there had been ""a slight uptick"" in business in recent days. And the website for her own lobster restaurant crashed after Mr Trump linked to it (perhaps accidentally) in his tweet. Trump on Twitter: The man and his medium An F-35 fighter jet (other fighter jets are available) In mid-December, a little more than a month after he won the election, Mr Trump took aim at the US defence giant Lockheed Martin. Shares in the companyfell after he tweetedthat he would cut the cost of its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter after taking office. He wrote: ""F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20."" The F-35 is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons programme, costing about $400bn (Â£328bn), so it's no small fry. The lobster restaurant in this particular relationship is Lockheed Martin's rival, Boeing. After Mr Trump tweetedthat he had asked Boeing,externalto look into producing a cheaper alternative to the F-35, that company's sharesjumped,external. New Balance trainers being set alight (other trainers and fire-starting materials are available) Days after the election, the footwear company's vice-president appeared to praise Mr Trump's trade plans in an interview withthe Wall Street Journal,external. Matt LeBretton said Barack Obama had ""turned a deaf ear"" to US business. ""Frankly, with President-elect Trump, we feel things are going to move in the right direction,"" he said. The company put out a statement saying it supported the trade positions of Democrat candidates too, but the damage was done - literally, in some cases, as New Balance shoe ownersset fire to their footwear. Mr Trump's son visited Yuengling's brewery in October (other beers and Trump children are available) Back in the weeks before the election, the owner of the oldest brewery in the US (in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, no less) expressed his support for the Republican candidate, and his frustration at what he saw as high tax rates. The outrage followed a similar path to that of New Balance, minus the fire-starting - online anger, the promise of a boycott of Yuengling beer, and one-star reviews on its Facebook page. But it is not clear now just how seriously the calls for a boycott affected Yuengling. Their Facebook page, for example, is now awash with support. And there's only one fact that matters - in Pennsylvania, the state where Yuenglingis the most popular beer,external, Mr Trump ended up winning 48.2% of the vote, with Hillary Clinton on 47.5%. That's a result that helped push him towards the White House, and he'll take charge next week. Although, as a teetotaller, he won't be celebrating with a Yuengling beer.

"The claim:The government plans to cut one-third of hospital beds in England. Reality Check verdict:We do not have enough data to put a figure on the proportion of beds that will close under current plans. Only one-third of local NHS plans give any information about bed closures. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said at Prime Minister's Questions this week: ""Her government is proposing, through sustainability and transformation, to cut one-third of the beds in all our hospitals in the very near future."" He was referring to the Sustainability and Transformation Plans (STPs), which are the plans that local NHS areas have been asked to come up with to change services in order to make themselves financially sustainable. They are part of NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens' Five Year Forward View. England has been divided into 44 areas, each of which has its own STP. Although some of the STPs have quite precise plans, others are quite vague. That means it is difficult to come up with a precise figure for the number of beds being closed. In fact, according to Labour Party health researchers, only 14 of the 44 STPs mention bed closures. That is one-third of the STPs, although that might just be a coincidence. Mr Corbyn's team has been unable to show Reality Check where he got the number that he used in Parliament. Among the STPs with the most precise figures was Derbyshire, where 535 of 1,771 beds will be cut by 2020-21, a cut of 30%. West, North and East Cumbria plans to reduce beds in cottage hospitals (smaller hospitals, often in rural areas) from 133 to 104, with beds at Cumberland Infirmary and West Cumberland Hospital going from 600 to 500. That's an 18% cut overall. It illustrates another difficulty with these figures, which is that not all beds are the same. Having an acute bed is not the same as having a bed in a day unit or an A&E bed, for example. Also, some of the plans involve trying to treat people in ways that do not involve using hospital beds, through the use of home treatment, for example, which makes it harder to interpret bed closure figures. So an overall figure for bed closures would need a great deal of clarification, but it is clear that we do not yet have enough data to reach such a figure.

"Commuters in south London and southern England have faced months of disruption on the Southern rail network amid a long-running strike over the role of conductors and the operation of driver-only trains. The RMT union's members first walked out in April last year and were joinedby members of Aslef,making the dispute the longest-running rail strike since the railways were privatised in 1996. Furtherstrikes had been plannedfor later this month, but most of the action has been called off following talks between the drivers' union Aslef and Govia Thameslink Railway, Southern's parent company. But with customer satisfaction at a low of 69% - the bottom of the passenger satisfaction table - just how bad have things got for Southern's customers? According to theofficial performance data published by Network Rail and the Office of Rail and Road,,external29.5% of Southern's Mainline and Coast services were late (more than five minutes of the scheduled arrival time for commuter services) in the year to 7 January. That's almost three in every 10 services. However, if the latest-available figures - from 11 December to 7 January - are taken in isolation, the percentage of late-running trains rises to 35.4%. The national average for the same period was 12.6% In fact, all lines run by Southern's parent company, Govia Thameslink Railway, were in the bottom six of the list for the latest period (Southern Metro, Great Northern, Gatwick Express, Southern Mainline and Coast and Thameslink), with between 21.3% and 35.4% of trains arriving late at their destinations. *This is the Public Performance Measure (PPM) - the industry standard measure that monitors trains arriving within five minutes of scheduled arrival times for commuter services or 10 minutes for long-distance services. ""Cancelled or significantly late"" means cancelled trains or those arriving more than 30 minutes after a scheduled arrival time. Source: Network Rail, Office of Road and Rail On Wednesday 11 January, the second strike day that week, Southern's own daily performance chart showed 60% of its Southern Mainline services were arriving late. That's six out of every 10 services. Meanwhile, the top performer nationally during the latest four-week period of 11 December to 7 January, was London Overground - with only 2.9% of its London services late. Merseyrail Electrics Northern line also performed well, with just 2.9% late-running trains. Source: Network Rail, Office of Road and Rail Looking further back over the last two years, Southern's Mainline and Coast performance has fluctuated, but delays have increased since the beginning of this year, according to the three official measures. Using the Public Performance Measure (trains arriving late by more than five minutes), Southern's best performance since April 2014 was attained over the summer of that year - 10.3% of trains late. It has never attained that figure since. Its worst period was between 29 May and 26 June last year, with 44.2% - almost half - of its services running late by more than five minutes. Some 68.6% (almost seven in 10) of trains were running more than 59 seconds late and 23.6% (almost a quarter) of services were cancelled or arriving more than 30 minutes late. The latestNational Rail Passenger Survey,external, released in Spring 2016, showed the lowest ratings for overall passenger satisfaction were given to Southern (69%) and Southeastern (69%), closely followed by Great Northern (74%), Thameslink (74%) and Abellio Greater Anglia (77%). Southern, Great Northern and Thameslink are all run by Govia Thameslink Railway. Southern refund: What you need to know Southern commuters' tales of 'hell' Nationally, the highest ratings for overall satisfaction were achieved by Grand Central (96%), First Hull Trains (94%), Virgin Trains (92%), Chiltern Railways (91%) and Heathrow Express (91%). Southern rail has promised to restore a ""full train service"" from Tuesday 24 January after talks with Aslef were described as constructive. Three Aslef strike days - on the 24, 25, 26 January - have been cancelled as a result of the talks, however the RMT union's walkout on Monday 23 January is still set to go ahead. Affected services are listedon Southern's website.,external Rail performance is measured in a number of ways. There are targets on punctuality, reliability, causes of delay, asset failures and disruption to the network from planned engineering work. Official statistics, published by the Office of Rail and Road, include the following indicators regarding punctuality and reliability: Public Performance Measure (PPM):this measures trains arriving at their terminating station within five minutes of their scheduled arrival time for commuter services or within 10 minutes for long-distance services. Right Time:this measures the percentage of trains arriving at their terminating station early or within 59 seconds of schedule. Cancellations and Significant Lateness (CaSL):this measures cancelled trains or services that are more than 30 minutes late at their terminating station. The rail industry reports data on a periodic basis rather than the more recognised reporting cycles such as monthly or quarterly. A period is normally a 28-day, or four weekly period for business reporting purposes (Sunday to Saturday) and there are 13 periods in a financial year.

"Mr Chandrasekaran is the first person outside India's affluent Parsi community to be appointed as chairman India's Tata Group appointed Natarajan Chandrasekaran as its new chairman on Thursday, months after an acrimonious stand-off with its outgoing chairman Cyrus Mistry. The BBC's Sameer Hashmi profiles the new chief. Chandra - as Mr Chandrasekaran is popularly called - is one of the best known faces of the Tata Group. The 53-year-old has been the chief executive of the high profile global IT service provider, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), since 2009. But his journey with the Tata group began three decades ago. He joined the company in 1987 after obtaining a Master's degree in computer applications from the National Institute of Technology in Trichy in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Interestingly, Mr Chandrasekaran, who will become the seventh chairman of the Tata group - is the first person outside India's affluent Parsi community to be appointed to the post. The $100bn (Â£80bn) enterprise is controlled by a Parsi family and for many observers this decision marks a huge shift. Apart from being an accomplished business leader, Mr Chandrasekaran is also known for being an avid runner. He has participated in marathons across the globe including in cities like Boston, Berlin, New York and Chicago, as well as back home in Mumbai. ""I love running. It's helped me become a better listener and also calms me down,"" he told the BBC a few years ago. Tata Sons names new chairman Tata ex-chairman: I was a lame duck Running long races has also been the hallmark of his professional life. Mr Chandrasekaran has never worked anywhere but at TCS. As the firm grew through the 1990s and 2000s to become one of India's most prominent IT companies, he also rose through the ranks, heading various important projects and teams before becoming the chief executive in 2009. ""I spotted him way back in 1996, and knew that he had the potential,"" S Ramadorai, the former chief executive of TCS and his first boss, said in 2009. And it was his performance over the last eight years, during which TCS expanded its global footprint and became India's most valuable company with a market capitalisation of nearly $70bn, that put him in a different league. Tata is a $100bn dollar enterprise This period was marked by global turbulence because of the economic recession which severely hampered the growth of Indian IT firms. But despite the tough times, TCS kept reporting healthy profits - and eventually displaced Bangalore-based Infosys to become the bellwether for India's IT sector. TCS is the jewel in the crown for the Tatas, contributing 10% of the group's total revenues and 40% of its profit. His strong leadership skills and a proven track record were big factors that helped him during the selection process. The fact that he is a Tata veteran, an ""insider"" who understands the dynamics and complexities of the group, also gave him an edge over other candidates in the race. ""He is a global business leader with boldness of vision and drive for results. Chandra personifies the value system of the Tatas,"" Abidali Z Neemuchwala, Chief  Executive of Wipro Limited told the BBC. But as Mr Chandrasekaran gets ready to take over the mantle from Ratan Tata, who was appointed interim chairman after Cyrus Mistry's ouster in October, he faces several challenges. The bitter and very public feud between Mistry and the Tatas over the last couple of months has tarnished the conglomerate's brand image. Both sides have made serious but unverified allegations against one other and are now locked in a legal battle. ""The immediate priority for him will be to rebuild credibility. The second is building up transparency and governance besides everything else like strategy and building performance,"" said Kavil Ramachandran, the executive director at the Thomas Schmidheiny Centre for Family Enterprise, Indian School of Business. Tata Steel operations in the UK have been a concern for the company His other big task will be stabilising businesses that have been struggling. Tata's empire ranges from cars and steel mills to aviation and salt. It has a presence in more than 100 countries. But firms like Tata Steel have suffered heavy losses in the UK, and at home Tata Motors is facing some stiff competition from foreign and local brands. The Tata group relies hugely on a clutch of companies, including TCS - to bolster its overall profits. Mr Chandrasekaran started running marathons when he was 43 to keep his fitness levels up. And given the mammoth challenge that lies ahead, he will need all his stamina and patience to succeed.

"Lord Snowdon was a talented  film maker and photographer whose marriage to Princess Margaret fed the gossip columns for over a decade. His career was punctuated by lurid tales of extra-marital affairs, alcohol and drugs, but throughout it all he maintained a close contact with the Royal Family. His body of photographic work featured the cream of British society, although he was usually dismissive about his work. He was most proud of the stunning aviary he helped design for London Zoo. He was born Anthony Charles Robert Armstrong-Jones on 7 March 1930, into a family of minor gentry. His father, Ronald, was a barrister while his mother, society beauty Anne Messel, later became Countess of Rosse, following her divorce from his father. In his teens, he contracted polio and had to lie flat on his back for a year. It left him with a permanent limp. But visits by such luminaries as Noel Coward and Marlene Dietrich, arranged by his uncle, the theatre designer Oliver Messel, helped alleviate the boredom. The start of what was to prove a stormy marriage He was educated at Eton, where his passion for photography began. He went on to Jesus College, Cambridge, and was cox of the victorious eight in the 1950 Boat Race. He never completed his course on architecture, and at 21 took up photography as a career, setting up a studio of his own in London. It was his flair for taking less formal photographs that earned him the commission, in 1956, for the 21st birthday pictures of the Duke of Kent. Later he was invited to Buckingham Palace to photograph the Prince of Wales and other members of the Royal Family, including Princess Margaret. Unlike some photographers, he did not set out to create a rapport with his subjects. ""I don't want people to feel at ease,"" he once said. ""You want a bit of an edge."" His engagement to Princess Margaret was announced in 1960. At the time there had been no recent precedent for anyone so near to the throne marrying outside the ranks of royalty or the British peerage. The wedding took place on 6 May 1960, and after a honeymoon tour of the Caribbean in the royal yacht Britannia, the young couple moved into Kensington Palace. Early in 1961 Armstrong-Jones was raised to the peerage as Lord Snowdon, and he took his seat in the House of Lords a year later. A son, David, Viscount Linley, was born in 1961, and their daughter, Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, three years later. In 1963 the Queen made him Constable of Caernarvon Castle, and as such he took a leading part in the arrangements for the investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969. He was scathing about the ceremonial surrounding the event, claiming that most of the procedures used were ""completely bogus"". Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon went to Jamaica together in 1962, when the princess represented the Queen at the independence celebrations, and they made an official visit to the United States in 1964. In the early years of their marriage, he and Princess Margaret were treated almost as Hollywood stars. The press relished incidents in which the Snowdons donned leather jackets and raced motorbikes along London's North Circular Road. They consorted with celebrities of the day, and provided a marked contrast to the more conservative Queen and Prince Philip. But the marriage quickly experienced the sort of difficulties that were destined to plague royal relationships over the following 20 years. He had a flair for informal photography Snowdon's womanising was part of the reason for the break-up. A natural charmer, he had a string of relationships throughout his life and seemed incapable of remaining faithful. One close friend was quoted in a biography of the earl as saying: ""If it moves, he'll have it."" Margaret's own predilection for late-night partying, and the desire of both of them to be the centre of attention, also fuelled the breakdown. By then, Snowdon had embarked on a varied professional career - acting as adviser to the Council of Industrial Design, and working for various publications, including the Sunday Times. The aviary he helped design for London Zoo opened in 1964. It was regarded as cutting-edge in its use of new materials, providing the maximum amount of space for birds to fly. He helped to make several television documentaries. The first, Don't Count the Candles, from 1968, was about old age and won seven international awards. In 1975 he directed two programmes in BBC television's Explorers series, and in 1981 he presented two programmes on photography, Snowdon on Camera, for which he was nominated for a Bafta Award. Snowdon designed an electrically powered wheelchair, called the Chairmobile. The aviary at London zoo was regarded as a triumph of design It was during a debate on the mobility of people with physical disabilities that he had made his maiden speech in the Lords in April 1974. In March 1976, it was finally announced that he and Princess Margaret would live apart. When Margaret had a relationship with Roddy Llewellyn, Snowdon was able to play the part, though not very convincingly, of the cuckolded husband, and the divorce became final in 1978. Snowdon always refused to speak about the marriage but he regularly saw the children and continued to photograph the Royal Family. In December 1978, he was married again, to Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, a researcher on a BBC television series on which he was working. They had a daughter, Frances, the following July. In June 1980 Snowdon started an award scheme for disabled students. The money for it came from the reproduction fees he had received over 20 years from his royal photographs. The following year the Snowdon Council was formed, of which he was president. It comprised 12 members co-ordinating a dozen different bodies concerned with helping disabled people. Also in 1981 a compromise was reached in his long-running row with Lord Aberconway, president of the Royal Horticultural Society, who had said that disabled visitors to the Chelsea Flower Show were not encouraged. His subjects were often the rich and famous It was agreed that guide dogs would be admitted, and a special garden was created for those with disabilities. While married to Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, Snowdon had a long affair with journalist Ann Hills, who took her own life in 1996. Two years later, at the age of 68, he fathered a son, Jasper, with 33-year-old Melanie Cable-Alexander, a journalist on Country Life. This proved the final straw for Lucy, and the couple divorced. By then Snowdon had lost his seat in the Lords, following Labour's clear-out of hereditary peers. Instead, he took a life peerage as Baron Armstrong-Jones to enable him to remain in the House. Despite an increasing disability as a result of his childhood polio, Lord Snowdon travelled widely, doing work for the theatre and fashion houses as well as portraits and travelogues. A friend once said of him, ""It's impossible to imagine a gentler, more cultured man.""

"Keen cyclist Peter Dumbreck uses fitness trackers to improve his performance Fitness-tracking devices have helped Peter Dumbreck beat his personal best times for cycling three days in a row. The racing driver and keen cyclist uses a Garmin 810 Edge cycle computer, a heart rate monitor and a power meter. ""The power meter is embedded into my left crank arm and talks via Bluetooth to my Garmin device, as does my heart rate monitor,"" he says. ""I can see my power [the force his legs are generating], which is updated every three seconds, on my Garmin screen and through training and experience know how many watts I can maintain and for how long I can do it,"" he says. Wearable and portable fitness trackers are certainly helping serious athletes like Peter to push themselves to the limit. But what about the rest of us? Does knowing how many calories we're burning, how fast our hearts are beating, and how many steps we've taken really motivate us to do more exercise and eat more healthily? In short, do they really work? ""They've made us all aware of how we treat our bodies, and they have even helped people diagnose things like diabetes and obesity,"" says Collette Johnson, head of marketing at design technology consultancy Plextek. ""But I feel they could go further."" Last year the University of Pittsburgh concluded that fitness trackers were""ineffective at sustaining weight loss"",external. The two-year study, conducted by the university's School of Education Department of Health and Physical Activity, involved 500 overweight volunteers. All were asked to diet and engage in more exercise, but only half were given a fitness tracker to help them. Do fitness trackers make us more or less motivated? The study found that the group wearing trackers lost 8lb (3.6kg), but the ones who didn't lost 13lb (5.9kg). ""Trackers are a reliable measurement of our activity, but we can't rely on them completely,"" says Andrew Lane, professor of sport psychology at the University of Wolverhampton. ""We can't expect just to buy one and that's it - some of the responsibility sits with us too. We still have to get off that sofa and complete those 10,000 steps a day."" Prof Lane believes that, if used inappropriately, they may even start to have a negative psychological effect. ""What if we start consistently not reaching goals set for us by them? Ultimately it would lead to us feeling demotivated - the opposite effect they are supposed to have."" Such concerns haven't stopped the market from booming - yet. Leading wearable fitness tracker maker Fitbit reported 2015 revenues of Â£1.3bn, while researcher CSS Insight forecasts that the market will be worth Â£16bn by 2020. And the fact that smartwatch sales declined sharply last year, according to market analysts IDC, has led many makers to reposition them primarily as fitness-tracking devices - another indication of where the business potential lies. But is the problem with them that they are neither accurate nor sophisticated enough yet? ""As well as providing data for us, companies need to provide coaching with this data. They need to take responsibility for the results they're providing us,"" says Prof Lane. Plextek's Collette Johnson thinks trackers need to give us more tailored advice And Plextek's Ms Johnson thinks they need to understand more about the individual user. ""They need to recognise whether Sharon from Uxbridge really should be doing two hours of fitness a week, how that's going to impact upon her body, her joints, whether she's at risk of osteoporosis. ""Fitness trackers can be too generic, personalising them will motivate us more,"" she tells the BBC. Apps, like the Slimming World app, may be better for achieving sustained weight loss, she argues, because they allow you to track your weight loss progress and give you incentives after it has recorded your exercise. ""There is no doubt the industry is booming, but for it to really see results it needs not only to give us results, but to make them as personalised and as accurate as possible."" So what tech innovations are making fitness tracking more effective? Genetics and nutrition firm DNAFit advises on how we should be training and what we should be eating after testing our genes and applying its algorithm to the analysis. You take a saliva swab and send it off to the company's lab. After 10 days a report tells you which exercises your body will respond to best and which foods you should be eating. The company says its technology platform has been peer reviewed and clinically tested. Andrew Steele, DNAFit's head of product, shows how to take a saliva swab for DNA testing Other companies such as FitnessGenes, Genetrainer and AnabolicGenes adopt similar approaches. Jo Rooney, 35, a deputy headteacher, used the test to try to cure her stomach problems. ""My results came back quite quickly and told me that I was actually lactose intolerant and had a high sensitivity to gluten. ""This did mean quite a radical change to my diet, and a lot more forward planning, but within a week I felt a lot less bloated, lost weight and I'd stopped having stomach problems."" Body scanners and tech built into sports clothes are also giving us more detailed results. For example, Fit3D uses scanners to assess the whole body to calculate body fat percentage, assess posture and give body shape scoring. While last year, OMsignal launched OMbra, a smart sports bra that tracks heart rate, breathing and distance between steps, and shares this data with a smartphone app. The OMbra is a wearable fitness tracker that's really wearable Prof Lane believes that we're also going to start seeing biometric devices integrated not just into clothes and wearable devices, but directly on to our bodies as well. For example, US tech firm Chaotic Moon Studios - now called Fjord - has created a prototype tech tattoo - a skin-mounted monitor that connects to your smartphone to monitor heart rate, blood pressure and even track movement via GPS. Now we just need an injection of willpower.

"When first identified Peggy was picked up as a long, bright smudge at the edge of Saturn's A-ring Will Peggy finally reveal herself? Scientists studying the splendour of Saturn's rings are hoping soon to get a resolved picture of an embedded object they know exists but cannot quite see. The moonlet is named after London researcher Carl Murray's mother-in-law, and was first noticed in 2013. Its effect on surrounding ice and dust particles has been tracked ever since. But no direct image of Peggy's form has yet been obtained, and time is now short. TheCassini spacecraft's mission at Saturn,externalis edging to a close and its dramatic end-of-life disposal. In September, the probe will be driven to destruction in the atmosphere of the giant planet, at which point the constant stream of pictures and other data it has returned these past 13 years will come to an abrupt end. This video can not be played Carl Murray: ""It's like an old friend to us, and so as you say goodbye you'd like to get a picture"" Carl Murray and his team at Queen Mary University of London know therefore they have only a few months left to get the definitive image. Fortunately, Cassini will spend its remaining time flying close in to the planet and the moonlet's place in the so called A-ring. The best ever chance to see the face of Peggy is now at hand. And such is the fondness for this little object, the probe will even be commanded to take one last picture just before the big plunge. ""Peggy is such an interesting object, and for people who work on the mission and even with the public - it's captured their imagination. It's like an old friend to us, and so as you say goodbye you'd like to get a picture. Peggy will be one of the last targets for Cassini,"" Prof Murray told BBC News. Theory suggests some of Saturn's bigger moons could even have been made in the rings The study of objects like Peggy goes to the core objectives of the multi-billion-dollar international space mission. The wide band of ice and dust that surrounds Saturn is a version in miniature of the kind of discs we see circling far-off new stars. It is in those discs that planets form, and so seeing the processes and behaviours that give rise to objects like Peggy delivers an insight into how new worlds come into being. It is a model even for how our own Solar System was created. ""Peggy is evolving. It's orbit is changing with time,"" explained Prof Murray. ""Sometimes it moves out, sometimes it moves in, by just a few kilometres. And this is what we think happens with proto-planets in those astrophysical discs. They interact with other proto-planets and the material in the disc, and they migrate; they move. We see that when we look at exoplanets around other stars: some canât possibly have formed in the places we detect them now; they must have migrated at some point."" Peggy was discovered by accident. Prof Murray was using Cassini to try to image Prometheus - a bigger, very obvious moon connected with the F-ring. The gravitational influence of objects within the rings can produce propeller-like features He got that no problem, but his eye was drawn to a 2,000km-long smudge in the background. That was 15 April 2013 (his mother-in-law's birthday). And a subsequent trawl through the Cassini archive revealed that a disturbance in the A-ring was actually evident from a year before. Peggy is certainly smaller than 5km across. So to produce that showy smudge, it must have been involved in a collision that kicked up a cloud of ice and dust. Follow-up observations have monitored the ongoing disturbance. If moonlets are big enough they can clear a gap in Saturnâs rings. But tiny objects like Peggy merely produce small bumps in the surrounding band of particles, or a sort of wavy pattern that looks akin to a propeller. This indirect evidence of the presence of a moonlet is all Cassini can achieve when the target is so small and the onboard camera is producing a best resolution of about 5km per pixel. But in the next few months, the orbits the spacecraft will fly around Saturn should bring the resolution down to one or two km per pixel. This might be enough to picture Peggy directly, and to confirm an intriguing possibilityâ¦ that Peggy has recently become two objects. ""When Cassini came out of its ring plane orbit in early 2016, we went back to look where Peggy should be; and we found Peggy and we've been tracking it ever since. ""But a few degrees behind we could also see another object, even fainter in the sense that it had an even smaller (disturbance) signature. And when we tracked back the paths of both objects, we realised that in early 2015 they would have met. ""So, probably, Peggy 'B', as we call it, came from a collision of the sort that causes Peggy to change its orbit, but rather than a simple encounter that deflected the orbit slightly, this was more serious."" This video can not be played Linda Spilker: ""Cassini is one of the great space missions of all time"" Prof Murraygave an update on Peggy at the recent Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union,external. At that same conference, Dr Linda Spilker, the Nasa project scientist on the Cassini mission,outlined the end-stage activities,externalof the probe, culminating in its disposal on 15 September. She said the same close-in manoeuvres that hopefully will enable Carl Murray to get his resolved pictures should also finally help to determine a key property of Saturn's rings - their mass. ""The mass of the rings is uncertain by 100%,"" Dr Spilker told BBC News. ""If they're more massive, maybe they're really old - as old as Saturn. If they're less massive, maybe they're really young, maybe only a mere 100 million years old."" Age is important to this idea that rings, or discs, are the medium in which objects form.  Some of Saturn's moons, even a number of its bigger ones, likely emerged by accumulating the material around them and displaying, certainly in the early phases of growth, the sorts of behaviours now seen in Peggy. But making moons takes time and if the largest of Saturn's satellites came out of this same process, it demands the present ring system to be very old indeed.

"Catalonia: Sun, sand, sea... and secession? If the stand-off between the Spanish state and the north-eastern region of Catalonia has been intense for the past five years, 2017 looks set to be explosive. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemontset the tone in a New Year message, saying a planned referendum would go ahead by September. That would defy the Spanish government's warning that any vote organised by Catalonia's regional authorities would be illegal. ""If 50% plus one vote 'yes', we will declare independence without hesitation,"" he said. Tensions between supporters of independence and Spanish authorities are likely to rise when three senior Catalan ex-officials, including former president Artur Mas, go on trial accused of criminal disobedience for organising a wildcat poll in November 2014. Spain's conservative prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, says he is willing to negotiate possible alterations to the relationship between the national and Catalan administrations, but will not discuss changes to Spain's constitution. Artur Mas has spearheaded the Catalan campaign for independence Catalonia's quarrel with Madrid Catalonia profile So Madrid says there will be no referendum. Barcelona insists there will be a vote and it will be binding. ""If we have 50% turnout and a majority in favour of independence, this will be legitimate. Then Madrid will have to ask itself if it is going to impose its laws by force, if the Catalan people choose their future peacefully and democratically,"" says Joan Maria Pique, the Catalan government's director of international communications. The image of tanks rolling north across the Ebro river belongs to Spain's tragic civil war of the 1930s. But how would Madrid react if Catalonia made a unilateral declaration of independence? When Spain's defence minister until last November, Pedro Morenes, was asked what the army would do in such a scenario, he avoided giving a direct answer: ""If everyone does what they are legally bound to do, that situation will not be necessary."" Like other regions in Spain, Catalonia already has the power to run its educational and healthcare systems, as well as limited freedoms in the area of taxation. But Spanish constitutional experts offer little encouragement to supporters of independence for Catalonia. ""If the Catalan government does not negotiate the calling of a referendum with the state, it is not legally possible, because this power is held by the central state,"" explains Javier Garcia Roca, professor of constitutional law at Madrid's Complutense University. Spain's constitutional court agrees. It outlawed the unofficial vote held in November 2014, and that ruling led to former Catalan President Mas and two of his ministers facing trial this year. If found guilty, Mr Mas could be barred from public office for a decade. Surveys suggest a referendum vote on secession would be close Many Catalan towns and villages have gone ahead and declared independence in a symbolic but defiant fashion. A picturesque Costa Brava fishing village, El Port de la Selva, declared itself ""morally excluded"" from Spain's constitutional order in July 2010. Earlier Spain's top court had ruled that large chunks of the Catalan autonomy statute, approved by both the Spanish and Catalan parliaments, were unconstitutional. The number of rebel municipalities has gone on growing. One estimate from a pro-sovereignty association suggests 787 of the region's 947 town and city halls have declared support for ""decoupling from the Spanish state"". Several local politicians and hundreds of councils are being investigated for offences deriving from symbolic disobedience of Spanish laws. The constitutional court has also quashed several attempts by the Catalan parliament to vote into existence ""instruments of state"" for a future independent country, including a tax agency and a social security department that would form the basis of a new welfare system. It has also annulled laws against fracking, gender inequality and banks which keep empty homes on their books. In 2010 the court sparked outrage by removing the preferential status of the Catalan language and quashing another dozen articles. Catalan spokesman Joan Maria Pique accuses the Spanish government of ""exercising juridical violence by violating the independence of the courts"". ""The constitution lays down the principle of unity of the state and nation, which are described as 'indivisible',"" argues Prof Garcia Roca. ""It is a rigid document and the possibilities for imagination and constitutional engineering are therefore not the same for Catalonia as for Scotland."" Solar panels at a Barcelona cemetery: It is one of the most developed regions in Spain And yet much of Catalonia believes that it has already triggered what pro-independence circles describe as ""decoupling"" from the Spanish state, backed by a majority of the Catalan parliament and the region's local councils. A recent poll published by Barcelona-based newspaper El Periodico, not seen as backing independence, suggested that 85% of Catalans wanted a referendum, which all surveys predict would be extremely tight. So while the Madrid government insists any vote will have no validity, the game of political chicken goes on. Court orders have been served on councillors in Catalonia who refuse to acknowledge Spanish national holidays, remove flags or bow to other constitutional requirements, or who burn images of Spain's King Felipe. Meanwhile, the tension continues to rise. Something will have to give.

"The Nintendo Wii was hugely popular - from retirement homes to living rooms From the Game Boy to the Wii, Nintendo has created some of the world's most memorable games consoles. Some were big hits, but others have been big misses. Ahead of the release of its next games machine, the Nintendo Switch, these are the main devices that have brought players the likes of Super Mario, Tetris, Zelda and Pokemon. The Game & Watch range, launched in 1980, were many players' first handhelds The Game & Watch was Nintendo's first breakout video game success. Its inspiration came when developer Gunpei Yokoi saw a bored businessman punch buttons on a calculator to amuse himself on a train, says Katharine Byrne, news editor at video games publication MCV. Up to that point, Nintendo had largely been a toy company. Its hits had included a Love Tester, which told couples how compatible they were. But with the Game & Watch, it came up with a handheld console that introduced millions of players to now-longstanding Nintendo characters, such as Donkey Kong, Zelda and the Mario Brothers. Nintendo sold the NES as a premium video games console When Nintendo released the NES in North America, no-one thought it would succeed, says Tristan Donovan, a games industry writer. ""The industry had collapsed. There had been an enormous boom following the release of Space Invaders and Pac-man, but the bottom had fallen out of the market."" The company went ahead with the console anyway - which unlike the Game & Watch was hooked up to people's televisions. It paid off. Towards the end of the decade, the NES had almost a complete monopoly in the US home video games market, Mr Donovan adds. The Game Boy and block puzzle Tetris became synonymous in the 1990s The next big hit was the Game Boy, which remainsNintendo's second-highest selling console,external. ""It brought hand-held gaming to the world,"" says Mr Donovan, author of the book, Replay: The History of Video Games. That was despite ""looking quite dated, even at the time"", he says. The screen was in black and white, compared with Sega's Game Gear and Atari's Lynx. ""But it had Tetris and a long battery life,"" he adds, and went on to be one of the best-selling toys in the 1990s. The SNES was a big hit in Europe - along with Sega's Mega Drive By the start of that decade, Nintendo faced growing competition for its NES console from rival Japanese games maker Sega. Nintendo's answer was the Super NES, or SNES. ""That was when it lost its stranglehold on the market, with Sega targeting older teenagers,"" says Mr Donovan. Nintendo's strict policy against violence in its games gave it more of a family-friendly image, whereas Sega had more ""blood and guts"", with games such as Mortal Kombat. Still, the SNES was a big success in Europe, where - together with the Mega Drive - it brought home video consoles into the mainstream, Mr Donovan adds. Gamers complained that Virtual Boy made them feel ill Where the Game Boy and NES had been big successes, the Virtual Boy - Nintendo's virtual reality games console - proved to be a major dud. The console was quietly discontinued about a year after it came out. Among the issues, gamers complained of motion sickness and vomiting from the wraparound headset and black and red graphics. Its failure also accelerated the departure of Nintendo designer Gunpei Yokoi, who along with creating the Game & Watch, was a major force behind the Game Boy, says Mr Donovan. The N64 popularised multi-player gaming - but was still outsold by the PlayStation By the time the Nintendo 64 came out, it faced another big competitor - Japanese electronics giant Sony. The N64 enjoyed some success - with popular games such as Mario Kart and the James Bond shoot-em-up Goldeneye - but came second in sales to Sony's PlayStation. One of the main criticisms was that N64 games still used cartridges, which were more expensive than the CDs used by Sony, says Ms Byrne. Mr Donovan agrees, adding that Nintendo was also ""outgunned"" by Sony on marketing, timing and appeal to older players. The GameCube failed to close the gap with Sony's PlayStation consoles The GameCube saw Nintendo fall further behind Sony, selling about 22 million consoles compared with an estimated 155 million of Sony's PlayStation 2. ""Apart from looking distinctive, the GameCube didn't do much more than the N64. It was not one of their great ideas,"" says Mr Donovan. It replaced cartridges with CDs, but was outflanked by the PlayStation 2, in part, because that console enabled users to play DVDs. ""The PlayStation 2 was the beginning of game consoles as home entertainment,"" says Ms Byrne. ""It was two things in one, which helped it pull even further ahead."" Seen as different to traditional games consoles, the DS found its way into the classroom Then came the Nintendo DS - to date the company's best-selling console. With adverts featuring actorsNicole Kidman,external,Julie Walters and Patrick Stewart,externalplaying its mind quizzes, the DS looked to appeal beyond traditional gamers. It also did well with the core players of its handheld devices - ""teens, tweens and children"", says Lewis Ward, a gaming analyst at tech research company IDC. ""At that time, if you wanted to play a game on the move, there was no other place to go,"" he adds, with the boom in smartphones coming four years later. The Wii's motion sensors tracked a player's movements in the game ""A big part of Nintendo's strategy with the Wii was to make something mums wouldn't be annoyed at,"" says Ms Byrne. Despite reports of the motion-sensor controls flying into TV screens, the strategy seemed to work. The small white consoles and its games - which followed players' movements - had broad appeal, from retirement homes to office staff rooms, and helped Nintendo overtake Sony again. ""The innovation of motion controls was something so different and so fun for users of all ages that it reached people who had not previously thought of buying game consoles,"" says Mr Ward. The Wii U has failed to live up to the success of Nintendo's previous console The same could not be said, though, for the follow-up Wii U, which is the second worst-selling of Nintendo's main consoles. There weren't enough non-Nintendo games available on it, Mr Ward says, and Nintendo failed to explain the benefits of the Wii U GamePad, which tried to popularise the idea of dual-screen gaming. However, Seth Barton, editor of MCV, has another explanation. If you look back through, from the N64 to the GameCube, then the Wii and after that the Wii U, Nintendo consoles are like Star Trek films, he jokes - every good one is followed by a bad one.

"Economists and economics reporters do like their charts and graphs. And if they were all forced to pick just one with which to tell the story of the Obama presidency, many would plump for the bar chart of ""non-farm payrolls"". The non-farm payrolls report is simply the official measure of how many jobs the US economy has added (or lost) in the previous month. The release of this job tally, which happens at the same time, on the same day (the first Friday) of every single month, is one of the constants in the working life of a Wall Street economist or reporter. Many feel they measure out their lives with non-farm payroll reports. But you can reasonably measure out the Obama presidency with them as well. Take a look at the chart. On it you can see that from the first such report after entering the White House, President Obama learned that the US economy had just shed 800,000 jobs in one month. No other figure so clearly illustrates that Mr Obama started his presidency with an economy that wasn't just weak, it was on the verge of collapse. A recession of a severity not seen since the 1930s was under way. The most pressing question for the new president was what, if anything, could be done to stabilise the economy so that it could create jobs once more. This video can not be played âYes we didâ: Obama on Iran, Cuba and healthcare achievements The chart shows us what happened. By early 2010 the monthly tally shows the US was adding jobs again And albeit with further dips later that year, it has done so ever since. The last non-farm payrolls report of the Obama era showed that in December 2016the US economy added 156,000 jobs. It was also the 75th consecutive month of job growth. There has never been such a long period of job creation. The official unemployment rate in the US is now 4.7%. For many economists that represents ""full employment"". But the chart doesn't tell us WHY the job market bottomed out and started its long expansion. For an explanation of that you might start with one word: Detroit Detroit, or rather the US car industry with which the city is synonymous, was seemingly in its death throes in January 2009. The recession and financial crisis had hit General Motors, Chrysler and Ford particularly hard. This video can not be played US ""car tsar"" Steve Rattner discusses President Obama's economic legacy with the BBC's Michelle Fleury Already heavily indebted, by the turn of the Obama administration it looked like they would simply run out of cash and cease operations within weeks. President Obama's decision to bail out General Motors and Chrysler with bridging loans and managed bankruptcies (Ford managed to turn itself around without government money) was deeply controversial. But look again at the chart. If the auto industry had in fact collapsed, we would probably need to spread something like a million more job losses across those bars for 2009-10. Beyond the number of jobs directly or indirectly lost, it's hard to calculate the ultimate economic effects of a disintegration of the US auto industry. But it seems safe to say that America would look very different indeed without the auto bailout. There was also Mr Obama's stimulus package - or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, to give it its official name. This was a package of government spending which Congress passed, at the new president's behest, within weeks of his taking office. There have been 75 consecutive months of job growth in the US It too met fierce criticism and its impact has long been disputed. Still, more than one analysis has estimated that through 2010 it created or saved more than 2 million jobs. Taking those away would also dramatically alter the non-farm payrolls chart. At least it would for the beginning of Mr Obama's presidency. But after the first two years of his administration the politics of job creation, like everything else, changed. The Republican Party's capture of the House of Representatives in November 2010 deprived the president of most of his influence on the writing of new laws. He lost his grasp of one of the main levers of economic control and never regained it. The Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives in November 2010 That means that so much of the long period of job growth, from 2011 to the present, has unfolded with little input from the White House. Of course the president always has large powers, whoever controls Congress, but they tend to be in the administration of business regulations and in trade relations. Attributing the creation of jobs to those functions of government is even more speculative than attributing them to new laws. Still, if presidents cannot write laws, their veto power means laws can hardly ever be passed without them. It is a feature of the notorious political ""gridlock"" that has characterised much of the Obama era. The president and the Republican Congress have been in a perpetual stand-off over so many issues at the heart of the economy. The result is that many economic problems have gone unaddressed. Yet it also means that politicians, and their insistence on change and reform, have been kept on the sidelines, leaving the economy to develop without them. In the absence of major external shocks, perhaps the consistent job growth the US has enjoyed for more than six years should be attributed, not to the name and the politics of the president but to things more fundamental to the US and its brand of capitalism. It seems appropriate that after the steep steps down, then up, in the first 18 months of the non-farm payrolls bar chart, what the Obama presidency looks like is then a consistent series of bars, representing steady if undramatic job growth, month after month after month.

"US Attorney-General Loretta Lynch said VW denied and then lied in a bid to cover up its actions ""Volkswagen obfuscated, they denied, and they ultimately lied."" These were the words of the US Attorney General Loretta Lynch, as she set out how the German carmaker would be punished for attempting to hoodwink the US authorities over the emissions produced by its diesel cars. It has been a tough week for Volkswagen. It has been fined $4.3bn, agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges - and six executives are facing charges. One of them, Oliver Schmidt, has spent the past few days in a Miami jail. Others may yet find themselves in the firing line. But because of this, we now have a very clear idea not only of what Volkswagen was doing wrong, and how it went about it, but also the measures that were taken to conceal that wrongdoing. As part of its plea bargain with the US authorities Volkswagen signed up to an agreed ""Statement of Facts"". It draws heavily on the results of an investigation by the law firm Jones Day, commissioned by VW itself. The FBI makes further detailed allegations in its criminal complaint against Oliver Schmidt. These have not yet been tested or admitted. According to these documents, the seeds of the scandal were sown in 2006, when VW were designing a new diesel engine for the US market. Supervisors in the engine department realised they had a problem. They could not design an engine that would meet tough emissions standards due to enter into force in 2007, and at the same time give customers the performance that they wanted. Their solution was to ask their engineers to design engine management software which would turn on emissions controls when the car was being tested, and turn them off when it was being driven on the road. This 'defeat device' software was able to recognise the standard testing procedure. It was based on a program developed by VW's subsidiary Audi, which engineers had specifically stated should ""absolutely not be used"" in the US. Not everyone was happy about this, it seems. Engineers ""raised objections to the propriety of the defeat device"" in late 2006. In response, a manager decided that production should continue, still using the device. He also ""instructed those in attendance, in sum and substance, not to get caught"". A similar row broke out the following year, and again, the decision was taken to press on regardless. Subsequently, the use of the defeat device appears to have become routine. The Statement of Facts describes how the software was refined and improved over time. A spate of breakdowns was blamed on the cars remaining in 'test' mode while being driven on the road. Supervisors worked with engineers to solve the problem, and ""encouraged the further concealment of the software"". The engineers were also told to destroy documents relating to the issue. The deception came to a head when, in 2014, the California Air Resources Board approached the company to find out why tests had shown that its cars were emitting up to 40 times the permissible amount of nitrogen oxides when driven on the road. VW supervisors ""determined not to disclose to US regulators that the tested vehicle models operated with a defeat device"". Instead they ""decided to pursue a strategy of concealing the defeat deviceâ¦ while appearing to cooperate"". The FBI claims in its criminal complaint against Mr Schmidt - who was a head of compliance at VW's US division from 2012 to 2015 - that the deception eventually went to the very top of the company. Citing ""co-operative witnesses"" and allegedly corroborating documentation, it claims that the company's executive management in Wolfsburg were briefed on the issue in July 2015. Rather than tell its staff to come clean about the defeat device, it says, ""VW executive management authorized its continued concealment"". There is, however, no mention of this meeting in the statement agreed by Volkswagen. Ultimately, Volkswagen's wrongdoing was confirmed to the authorities by a single employee acting ""in direct contravention of instructions from supervisors at VW"". But the deception did not end there. The Statement of Facts explains how VW staff were warned by an in-house lawyer that the authorities were about to circulate a so-called ""hold notice"", obliging them to retain and preserve documents under their control. Engineers were told to ""check their documents"", which several of those present ""understood to mean that they should delete their documents"". The message was repeated at a number of subsequent meetings, one of them attended by 30-40 people and ultimately thousands of documents were deleted. When the scandal at Volkswagen first came to light, the company's former US chief executive, Michael Horn blamed ""a couple of software engineers"". It is now clear that many more people were involved, at least some of them in positions of authority, and deliberate attempts were made to cover up wrongdoing. It is not hard, then, to see why the US authorities have taken such a tough line with the company. But some questions remain unanswered. We still don't know for certain, for example, whether people at board level knew what was going on. It's also unclear why the same software that was fitted illegally to 600,000 US vehicles was also present on millions of others sold around the world, including eight million in Europe. VW continues to maintain that the systems didn't actually break European law - though it is in the process of repairing those vehicles all the same.

"Parkes' Elvis parade has grown from modest beginnings in 1993 They are unlikely saviours but Elvis Presley, ABBA and Bob Marley are helping to revive the fortunes of small outback towns in Australia. Their enduring music, fashion and legend have spawned festivals that are reversing the demoralising effects of drought and economic decline. The most glittering takes place this week in Parkes, a farming community 350km (217 miles) west of Sydney, named after Sir Henry Parkes, one of the founding fathers of modern Australia, who was born half a world away in Coventry. Parkes is being transformed by more than 20,000 Elvis loyalists in a motley collection of flared jumpsuits, a galaxy of sequins, jet-black wigs and sideburns, along with cockpit aviator sunglasses. There is a legion of buskers, look-a-like contests, a street parade, displays of Elvis artefacts and an Elvis-themed Gospel Service, which has become so popular it has outgrown its previous home in a supermarket car park and now takes place in a local park. The headline acts are international tribute artists Pete Storm from the UK and the American entertainer Jake Rowley. Parkes Mayor Ken Keith says everyone in the town embraces the festival The real King - who would have celebrated his 82nd birthday last week- may never have travelled to Australia, but 40 years after his death, his appeal remains as magnetic as ever. ""I remember when he died the world just went crazy. It was a pretty devastating time,"" said Sheridan Woodcroft from Melbourne, as she boarded the Elvis Express, a special train service from Sydney to Parkes. ""He just had the X-factor. He was so charismatic, he was gorgeous."" Australia's biggest Elvis festival was borne out of economic necessity. Back in the early 1990s, mid-summer trade in baking-hot Parkes was sluggish but Bob Steel, 75, and his wife Anne, owners of the Gracelands restaurant, had a plan. ""It was a pretty slack time. I went to a hoteliers' meeting and they were all having their grizzle about quiet times. I said, well, Elvis's birthday is in January and we could have a birthday party,"" Mr Steel told the BBC. Parkes' Elvis festival now generates about A$13m (US$9.6m) each year And they did. In January 1993, 190 people attended the inaugural event in the Steels' restaurant. From simple beginnings, the festival now generates about A$13m (US$9.7m, Â£7.9m) each year. ""It's a tremendous economic benefit and it has really revived a town that was struggling. [Parkes] is now a place that people have heard about, they stop there when they are travelling through,"" said John Connell from the University of Sydney, who has written a book about the festival. His co-author Chris Gibson, a professor of geography at the University of Wollongong, explained that they had researched how various carnivals - from those celebrating scones and pumpkins to music and art - can benefit small country towns in Australia. Academics Chris Gibson (l) and John Connell (r) say music festivals can reinvent fading towns ""There's a spirit of quirky eclecticism and larrikin [boisterous or maverick] humour in country Australia that comes out at these sorts of festivals. They can reinvent the story of a place, really,"" said Professor Gibson, dressed in a purple Elvis costume at Sydney's Central Station. ""Although there are still jobs in agriculture, it is a fading industry, whereas the future is really about tourism, music, creativity and culture,"" he added. Kandos, in the Mudgee winemaking district of New South Wales, hosts a Bob Marley festival, while since 2012 fans of ABBA have headed to the town of Trundle for its annual homage to Sweden's finest. Elvis tribute singer John Collins says Parkes' Elvis festival is on many people's bucket list Elsewhere the tasty Food (Food of Orange District) jamboree draws large crowds, while the Tamworth Country Music Festival is arguably one of Australia's premier music events. So is Parkes worried it could lose its lustre because of the competition in other parts of New South Wales and beyond? Ken Keith, who is his ninth year as mayor and probably the only public official in Australia who turns up for work in a blue jumpsuit, is not concerned. ""Why other people haven't been able to replicate it or steal the concept from us is just the friendly nature of the town, where people are made to feel welcome,"" he explained. This week Parkes is turning on not only a warm reception, but one that is roasting hot, with temperatures expected to climb to the high 30s Celsius. Simone Collison (far r) and friends joined fellow fans for the Elvis express train from Sydney Also celebrating a quarter of a century as an Elvis tribute singer is John Collins, who, as a marriage celebrant, officiates at Elvis-themed weddings all over Australia. ""The Parkes Elvis festival is something everyone has to put on their bucket list. You've got to go at least once. One of the entertainers last year nearly cried when he had to go home. He didn't want it to finish,"" he said. As the Elvis Express prepared to roll out of Sydney - on what is quite likely to be Australia's most high-spirited rail journey - Simone Collison from Menangle had gathered with her friends for the trip. They all wore matching black and white spotted outfits with pink tops and  sunglasses. Asked why a singer who died so long ago still had so many devoted fans, she said simply: ""Everyone still loves him. That will never die."" Australian fans enjoy Elvis festival.

"How did a man who took office espousing a new era of engagement with the world end up a spectator to this century's greatest humanitarian catastrophe? Barack Obama was not against using force to protect civilians. Yet he resisted, to the end, a military intervention to stem Syria's six-year civil war, even as it killed or displaced half the country's population, brutally documented in real time on social media. Part of the answer to this vexing question has been clear from the beginning. President Obama was elected to end America's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan by a people tired of paying the cost in blood and treasure. He was extremely reluctant to get sucked into another messy Middle East conflict. But when the siege and bombardment of cities like Aleppo placed the violence on the genocidal scale of atrocities set by Rwanda and Srebrenica, inaction by the US and its allies mocked the international community's vows of ""never again"". Despite the pressing moral imperative, Obama remained convinced a military intervention would be a costly failure. He believed there was no way the US could help win the war and keep the peace without a commitment of tens of thousands of troops. The battlefield was too complex: fragmented into dozens of armed groups and supported by competing regional and international powers. A boy pushes a wheelchair along a damaged street in the east Aleppo neighborhood of al-Mashatiyeh, Syria ""It was going to be impossible to do this on the cheap,"" he said in his final press conference of 2016. But that was not the conclusion of some senior military and cabinet officials, nor did they even propose a mass ground deployment, according toformer defence secretary Chuck Hagel,external. They argued that a more limited engagement could have effectively tilted the balance of power against President Bashar al-Assad. Among the options: arming the rebels and setting up a safe zone from where they could operate early in the conflict, or military strikes on the Syrian air force to push Assad to the negotiating table. Instead, the Obama administration focused on providing humanitarian aid, and on promoting a ceasefire and political negotiations aimed at Assad's departure. What does Barack Obama most regret? The future of Guantanamo after Obama ""There is no military solution"" became the mantra in briefing rooms at the White House and state department, but spokespeople were unable to explain how a political solution was possible without military leverage. ""If there is to be any hope of a political settlement, a certain military and security context is required,"" former CIA Director David Petraeus told a Senate committee last year. ""We and our partners need to facilitate it, andâ¦have not done so."" Obama's caution was reinforced by lack of support for military intervention from key allies such as the UK and Germany. That influenced his decision to back away from his famous ""red line"" threat of force in response to Assad's use of chemical weapons. It was also part of a larger pessimism about what the US could achieve in the Middle East, sealed by a Nato intervention in Libya that was carefully planned but still left the country in a mess. ""The liberal interventionists seem to have forgotten that it is no longer the 1990s,"" wrote two of Obama's former national security officials, Steven Simon and Jonathan Stevenson, in October last year. ""Disastrous forays in Iraq and Libya have undermined any American willingness to put values before interests."" Indeed, to fully understand President Obama's reticence, it is important to also understand that despite his liberal instincts and his soaring rhetoric about a more peaceful global order, he was a foreign policy realist with a keen sense of the limits to American power. Although he campaigned to restore US moral authority after the disaster of the Iraq War, he rejected what he saw as the moralising interventionism of the president he replaced, George W Bush. Instead, his emphasis was on measured diplomacy and progressive multilateralism. That included a willingness to engage with repressive regimes, rather than consign them to an ""Axis of Evil"" - giving them ""the choice of an open door"", he told the Nobel Peace Committee when accepting its prize at the end of his first year in office. Above all, he was not willing to prevent humanitarian tragedies by expending American lives and military power unless he saw a direct security threat to the United States. The agreement on Iran's nuclear deal is an example of this doctrine at its most effective. Obama ably used diplomacy to force an issue around which there was a high degree of international consensus. He marshalled broad support for crippling sanctions, and then stretched out his hand to America's most enduring Middle East foe and negotiated an achievable deal - one that limited a threat rather than transformed a relationship. Cuba also walked through that ""open door"", propelled by an economic crisis at home and drawn by a less hostile political climate in America, as did the junta in Myanmar. Damascus did not. And Obama decided against trying to push it through. US administrations have tended to bridge the gap between values and interests when the moral choice is also strategic. But Obama calculated early on that the Syrian civil war did not directly endanger America's national security. Instead he focused US military might against the so-called Islamic State (IS), which he did eventually see as a threat to the homeland. Again, he was able to organise an international coalition that has had considerable success in achieving a limited goal. Rebel fighters stand with their weapons on a military vehicle as they head towards the northern Syrian town of al-Bab Dividing his Syria policy in two, however, meant inevitable contradictions. The White House held that the only way to stop the spread of IS was to end the rule and brutality of the Assad regime. But America's absence from the civil conflict served to strengthen the Syrian president. Obama did grudgingly approve some covert military aid to moderate Syrian rebels to diffuse the power of Islamist fighters. But it wasn't enough to shape them into a force that could defeat Assad. So the vacuum was filled by the better-supplied Islamist groups, feeding into Assad's narrative that the world had to choose between him or terrorists. The presence of Islamist rebels, along with the momentum of the anti-IS campaign, also began to colour views of the regime within the administration, according to a US official who worked closely with these issues. Obama says shift to green energy is 'irreversible' despite Trump Barack Obama legacy: Did he improve US race relations? ""Everything was done through a counterterrorism lens,"" he says. ""This is a bunch of people who wanted Assad to stay because they were terrified of political Islamists taking over."" Obama argued that the regime's supporters, Russia and Iran, had more at stake in Syria than the US and would be prepared to fight harder to defend it. So any American intervention would only escalate the conflict. It's the same calculation he made in his approach to Ukraine. Russia did enter the war to reverse rebel gains in 2015, turning the tide. Its anti-aircraft weapons closed the door on even the remote chance of a US intervention. Its air force solidified Assad's grip on Syria's cities, culminating in the military victory over Aleppo and giving Moscow new leverage in the Middle East while sidelining the US. Many in the American foreign policy establishment believe Obama erred in defining US interests too narrowly in Syria. ""Syria exploded in strategic ways,"" says Vali Nasr, who's written a book arguing that the president's policies have diminished America's leadership role in the world. ""It empowered Russia and Iran, produced ISIS, strengthened al-Qaeda and created the refugee crisis which became a strategic threat to Europe."" Obama's critics have also faulted him for a detached, analytical leadership style they say is unsuited to geopolitical jousting. ""He wasn't good at brinkmanship, it wasn't his inclination,"" says Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk firm Eurasia Group. Secretary of State John Kerry talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in 2013 ""I've always thought [George W] Bush was a leader who didn't like to think, and Obama a thinker who didn't like to lead."" Obama has taken the lead on combating what he sees as one of the biggest threats, climate change. And he hasn't hesitated from unilaterally ordering force when he felt America's security was at stake, as shown by his prolific use of drones against terrorist suspects. But in Syria his administration left a perception of American weakness. Stepping back from his red line on chemical weapons damaged US credibility, shaking the confidence of allies and, some argue, emboldening its adversaries. ""Some in the administration thought that the longer we continued to engage the Russians in a facade of ceasefire and political negotiations the more we were providing political cover to the regime and Russia and Iran as they continued to pursue a military victory,"" said the US official. ""It's hard to understand why the state department is going along with it,"" a European diplomat told me as the talks became about managing that victory. ""It's supporting the Russian narrative."" Although Obama says he came to understand that very little is accomplished in international affairs without US leadership, he doesn't talk about it as a strategic asset, says Nasr. That sets him apart from his predecessors who ""believe US leadership is important for the world and important for America's hardnosed interests. Obama believes we can selectively lead where we have clear definable interestsâ¦ but American leadership as a free-floating independent idea doesn't have value to him"". Despite the personality chasm between the cerebral lawyer exiting the White House and the reality TV star entering it, Barack Obama and Donald Trump are on the same page when it comes to non-interventionism. In that sense, Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy is expected to be an extension of President Obama's. But it would be a stripped-down version without Obama's attachment to international law and institutions or his moral commitment to universal rights,argues Max Boot,external, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. And although neither would seek foreign quarrels, Trump would be more disposed to ""clobber anyone who messes with"" the United States. Would that make major powers such as China and Russia less likely to mess with America? Bootsuggests,externalTrump's ""menacing unpredictability"" could be more effective than Obama's reasonable predictability in confrontations with Beijing. The President-elect's call with the Taiwanese president shows a penchant for brinkmanship that has certainly put China on alert. Against these uncertain advantages, however, stand Trump's inexperience, his intemperate nature, and his hostility to some of the building blocks of US power, such as free trade in Asia. Crucially, his uncritical support for Moscow, along with allegations that it has compromising information about him, have put America's Russia policy into uncharted territory. This video can not be played Are Trump's nominees on the same page on Russia as their boss? Some of the President-elect's key cabinet officials can be expected to try and temper his extreme impulses and outlier positions, while taking a more muscular approach than Obama. In confirmation hearings, Trump's choices for secretary of state and defence advocated a conventional hard power policy, that included checking Russian moves on the geopolitical chess board. But the nominee for top diplomat, Rex Tillerson, echoed Trump's hard line on China by proposing an unusually aggressive stance against Beijing, raising eyebrows and concerns amongst many lawmakers and diplomats. History could very well judge Obama positively on Iran, Cuba and climate change. But the most important test of his foreign policy philosophy will be Syria, because it has been the crucible for the kind of realism he believes in. He argues that he's saved the US from getting trapped in another disastrous Middle East war that would sap America's power. His critics charge he has diminished US power in a crucial region, and weakened American global leadership in the process. The factor that shapes his legacy will be the same one that tests Trump: the extent to which either sustain, or reduce America's role in the world.

"The history and whereabouts of the piano between 1906-1983 is unknown A ""substantial"" hoard of gold has been found hidden inside an old piano. The discovery was made in Shropshire before Christmas when its new owners had it retuned and repaired. Experts think the valuables might have been ""deliberately hidden"" in the instrument more than 100 years ago. An inquest opened at Shrewsbury Coroner's Court earlier to determine whether the find can be classed as treasure, or whether an heir to the cache can be traced. Snow disruption, plus more Shropshire stories Peter Reavill, of the British Museum's Portable Antiquities Scheme, described the find as ""a stunning assemblage of material"". Investigations so far have revealed the upright piano, made by Broadwood & Sons of London, was sold in 1906 to a music shop in Saffron Walden, Essex. Its history is then unknown until 1983, when records show it was purchased by a family in the area, who later moved to Shropshire. The current owners had recently been given the instrument and reported the find to Ludlow Museum Resource Centre. Mr Reavill said: ""The current owners... came to the museum and laid it all out on the table. ""I was like, 'whoa'. I'm an archaeologist and I'm used to dealing with treasure but I'm more used to medieval brooches. ""I have never seen anything like that."" No more details will be revealed about the gold while the search is on to find the potential owners. Ian Richardson, treasure registrar at the British Museum, said: ""The artefacts might be older but they were hidden in the last 100 years. ""Somebody put them in there and either died and didn't tell anyone or something else happened."" The inquest will resume in March. Treasure must be substantially made of gold or silver According to the Treasure Act 1996, treasure is defined as any object which is at least 300 years old when found and: must be substantially made of gold or silver have been deliberately concealed by the owner with a view to later recover the owner, or his or her present heirs or successors must be unknown is one of at least two coins in the same find and has a precious metal content of at least 10% if the precious metal content is less than 10%, is one of at least ten coins in the same find Source:Portable Antiquities Scheme,external Student's Anglo-Saxon find is treasure Treasure hunter finds rare Roman pendant Rare silver coins declared treasure Portable Antiquities Scheme British Museum Independent councillor says administration's budget plan is 'doing everything they can' to maintain services News|Just now Woman taken to hospital and treated for 'potentially' serious injuries after crash involving two vehicles near Shrewsbury News|1 hour ago Community hospital near Whitchurch closes 'temporarily' due to lack of patients Train services resume after Gobowen landslip South Shropshire MP urges Prime Minister to listen to rural communities Ludlow town wall collapse report released at last Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over a national inquiry into grooming gangs Thousands flee three LA wildfires as forecasters warn worst is yet to come Watch: Timelapse shows rapid spread of Palisades wildfire How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"Daughters were traditionally valued less than sons in South Korea For every 100 baby girls born in India, there are 111 baby boys. In China, the ratio is 100 to 115. One other country saw similar rates in 1990, but has since brought its population back into balance. How did South Korea do it? Yvette Tan reports. ""One daughter is equal to 10 sons,"" was the message desperately being promoted by the South Korean government. It was some two decades ago and gender imbalance was at a high, reaching 116.5 boys for every 100 girls at its peak. The preference for sons goes back centuries in Korean tradition. They were seen to carry on the family line, provide financial support and take care of their parents in old age. ""There was the idea that daughters were not regarded as part of their own family after marriage,"" says Ms Park-Cha Okkyung, the executive director of the Korean Women's Associations United. The government was looking for a solution - and fast. In an effort to reduce the incidence of selective abortions, South Korea enacted a law in 1988 making it illegal for a doctor to reveal the gender of a foetus to expectant parents. At the same time women were also becoming more educated, with many more starting to join the workforce, challenging the convention that it was the job of a man to provide for his family. It worked, but it was not for one reason alone. Rather, a combination of these factors led to the eventual gender rebalancing. South Korea was acknowledged as the ""first Asian country to reverse the trend in rising sex ratios at birth"",in a report by the World Bank.,external In 2013, the ratio was down to 105.3, a number comparable to major Western nations such as Canada. Monica Das Gupta, research professor in sociology at the University of Maryland who has studied gender disparity across Asia, says factors other than legislation are likely to be the most significant in accounting for this change. A legal ban can ""dampen things a bit"", but she points out that ""seven years after the law [was instituted] sex-selective abortions continued"". Rather she attributes the change to the ""blistering pace"" of urbanisation and industrialisation in South Korea. While the country was predominantly a rural society there was great emphasis on male lineage and boys staying at home to inherit their fathers' land. But in just a few decades a large part of the population has moved to living in apartment blocks with people they don't know and working in factories with people they don't know, and the system has become much more impersonal, Dr Das Gupta says. China and India, though, still have a stark gender imbalance, despite India outlawing, and China regulating against, sex-selective testing and abortions. So why is that? Dr Das Gupta believes that in China this may be because until last year, the rule that your household registration - known as the hukou system - remained in the village where you were from, regardless of the fact that you might work in the city, meant that there was still an emphasis on male lineage and land ownership, but that this should now start to shift. But she also stressed that the change is not always linear. As people gain economic advantage they have better access to sex-selective testing and have fewer children, which actually then puts greater emphasis on their gender. In India in 1961, there were 976 girls for every 1,000 boys under the age of seven. According to the latest census figures released in 2011, that figure had dropped to a dismal 914 and campaigners say the decline is largely due to the increased availability of antenatal sex screening, despite the fact that both the tests and sex-selective abortion have been outlawed since 1994. They say that in the past decade alone, 8 million female foetuses may have been aborted in the country. But she argues that several factors in India are slowly having a trickle-down effect on attitudes to women including media representation of women functioning in the outside world, and legislative changes enforcing equal inheritance rules and requiring one-third of elected positions be reserved for women.

While South Korea may have rebalanced its population, this does not necessarily equate gender equality, Ms Okkyung argues. ""Even though Korea has a normal gender ratio balance, discrimination against women still continues,"" the 47-year-old says. ""We need to pay more attention to the real situations that women face rather than just looking at the numbers."" Women in South Korea face one of the largest gender wage gaps amongst developed countries - at36% in 2013.,externalBy comparison, New Zealand has a gap of some 5%. ""Nowadays women go to university at a higher rate than men in South Korea. However, the problem starts when women enter into the labour market,"" Ms Okkyung explains. Women are still expected to manage both work and family in South Korea ""The glass ceiling is very solid and there is a low percentage of women at higher positions in offices."" One of the reasons it is harder for women to compete in the workplace is because they are expected to devote their time to both work and family. ""One example is that working mothers have a dilemma, as children in elementary schools come home early after lunch. Therefore, mothers who cannot see a sustainable future in the workplace tend to quit their jobs,"" says Ms Okkyung. Dr Hyekung Lee was one of the few Korean women in her generation that did find workplace success. ""I have been very lucky that I was brought up in a very enlightened family. My family had three girls and two boys, and all were given the same support for education,"" says 68-year-old Dr Lee, who is the chairperson of the Korea Foundation for Women, the country's only non-profit organisation for women. ""But when I became a full-time faculty member in my university, I had to be the only woman professor in my department throughout my 30 years there."" Generally, attitudes towards women have improved as today's Korean men become more educated and exposed to global norms. They also inevitably mix with women across all spheres of life, in workplaces, schools or social circles, something that perhaps was not so common decades ago. Having children makes it hard for women to compete in the workplace, partly because of school hours for younger children It is amongst the older generation that many still cling on to the preference for sons. Emily [not her real name], 26, recalls that growing up as an only child, she was always treated equally by her grandparents - until her step-brothers were born. ""I only noticed the difference when my brothers came,"" she said. ""Then I realised that they would never do stuff like the housework."" ""My birthday is also one day before my father's so my grandparents didn't allow me to celebrate it because as they said: 'How dare a girl celebrate a birthday before her father?'"" How long will South Korea's women take to catch up? ""I think Korea is at that transitional phase that people are more aware now than previous generations, but it's still not quite equal compared to Western countries,"" she says. ""I've had friends tell me I can only keep my career if I stay single, and others tell me I've chased away men because I was too bossy on the dates and took the initiative."" She also notes that there is also a substantial difference in attitudes towards women in bigger cities and smaller towns. ""Cities like Busan are more traditional. I've had friends from Busan get a culture shock when they come to Seoul,"" she says. ""In the capital, things are more progressive."" Yet she believes change will come. ""Women in Korea need to be aware that there is gender discrimination,"" says Emily, who is now studying in the Netherlands. ""I didn't know until I left - I thought the way things were was just how they were."" ""It's not until you expose yourself to other cultures that you start to question your own. I think things will change, but it will take a lot of time."" Additional reporting by the BBC's Geeta Pandey and Yuwen Wu.

" Thursday 12th January 2017 Food can be enormously evocative, a real taste of home, and when your job is essentially to travel the world repeating the same day over and over, it's clearly going to be of some comfort to enjoy familiar tastes and smells along the way. This is one of the reasons why music stars develop strange cravings and routines around certain foodstuffs. Sometimes the affection is only fleeting, sometimes it's a love affair for life, but there's usually a pretty good reason why someone would eat the same food over and over again and never get bored. Here are just a few, and it's worth noting that none of these quirks and appetites constitute any kind of complete diet, official or otherwise. This is just pop stars taking a fancy to something, and not really knowing when to stop. [Warning: Third-party content may contain adverts] Anyone who grew up with rationing as a child and then became a millionaire in their early-20s would struggle not to immediately rush out and satiate their inner child when money became no object. And forJohn Lennon, the object of his first craze was the humble jaffa cake. According toPaul McCartney, John developed an intense craving for the orangey snacks during the early years ofThe Beatles, although the obsession was short lived. He told authorPaul Du Noyer: ""When we first got loaded he moved out to St George's Hill in Weybridge, which is near a golf club, very much the landed gentry. And you could have anything you'd ever wanted, kind of, in the first flush of success. He went mad on jaffa cakes, went insane about them: 'Gimme gimme!' About a week later he couldn't look at one, and he never looked at one the rest of his life. 'Oh, don't talk to me about jaffa cakes!'"" Some pop star food cravings are borne of success, some are borne of years of bad living, butSelena Gomez's crush on pickled gherkins (and the vinegar in which they sit) has been with her since childhood. She toldthe Mirrorher feelings run very deep: ""I'm obsessed with them. I drink the juice from the jar, too. I go to the movies and have popcorn and pickles. I may bring out a pickle cookbook."" During a 2010 appearance on Jimmy Fallon's chat show, she revealed that she even uses it to flavour her popcorn, serving it ""Texas-style"" with salt and Tabasco, then dipping each kernel in the vinegar. But she has standards, claiming: ""Someone made me try pickled onion Monster Munch the other day and I almost threw up.""

When the band signed to Hut records, he blew his share of the loot on having one particular dish sent over piping hot, meals on wheels-style, with distressing regularity - distressing on a dietary level (this was his sole meal of the day), but also financially, as it turned out. He told the People in 1998: ""I had lasagne delivered to my door every day for five months until I was broke again. Then, at the beginning of 1995, I owed £3,000 in rent arrears, went AWOL and returned to find my landlord had changed the locks and sold everything in it, records included.""

Here's what Noel told the Australian DJ Molly Meldrum when asked about the first line in the Oasis song Stand By Me: ""It starts, 'Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday.' When I first moved to London me mam kept on ringing up and asking was I eating properly. Yes, Mam. So I tried to cook a Sunday roast and puked up for two days with food poisoning. It was back to Pot Noodles after that."" Most tellingly, Noel has previously admitted that he loves his younger brother Liam, but not as much as his favourite brand of instant noodles. [WATCH] Arena - The Burger and the King The principal elements ofElvis Presley's diet - bread, peanut butter, meat, bananas - didn't really change much from the food he had loved as a child. The only change his colossal success created was the amount he could get his hands on. Quite literally. As this astonishingArenadocumentary proves, The King was not used to using cutlery. Perhaps the most stunning revelation, amid all the deep fried banana sandwiches, is the story of a midnight private plane ride to Denver from Memphis, to a restaurant called the Colorado Mine Company, where Elvis and his entourage ordered 30 Fool's Gold Loaves; a sandwich made using an entire loaf of bread, a pound of bacon, a jar of grape jam and a jar of peanut butter. Restaurant owner Buck Scott claims that each sandwich contains 42,000 calories (although it's likely to be closer to 8,000). Either way, Elvis and his pals then spent two hours scoffing the lot. [LISTEN] David Bowie on his alter-egos During the 1970s,David Bowie's look, music and lifestyle were so thrillingly exotic, even his strangest habits seemed perfectly plausible. So to discover that, during a particularly unhealthy stay in Los Angeles throughout the recording sessions for the 1976 album Station to Station, he essentially lived on a diet of milk and red peppers... well, that's the sort of thing an alien rock star would do, isn't it? It's worth noting that, shortly afterwards, he decamped for Berlin withIggy Popin tow. Partly to throw off a drug addiction, partly to dramatically alter the trajectory of his music and, as the interview clip above suggests, lock up his various personas, from Ziggy Stardust to the Thin White Duke, but mostly to eat some proper meals. [LISTEN] Robbie Williams on the pineapple he got when he left Take That Robbie Williamsis often very candid about his various struggles with addiction, and that is entirely to his credit. The interesting thing is that it doesn't seem to matter what the substance may be. Case in point, humble chocolate buttons. He told theGuardianthat he gave up one vice for another - bingeing on Minstrels - before trying fitness. ""And then,"" he added, ""I stopped the working out and just carried on with the Minstrels and I ballooned to the point where the Daily Mail suggested I was akin to Elvis before he died... I had to go on stage, too: 'Yeah, I know, I look like Elvis before he died. Sorry, everybody, as I'm pointing at you suggestively, pretending that you think I'm sexy.'""
