"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is being accused of attempting to mount a ""stealth raid"" on Britain's foreign aid spending. Development charities say the Treasury is hoping to use ""accounting tricks"" in this month's Spending Review to squeeze the aid budget by billions of pounds. They fear new items will be designated as ""overseas development assistance"" in a way that would cut the amount spent directly on humanitarian aid. The Treasury said it would continue to protect the world's poorest people. But it would not speculate on future spending commitments ahead of a fiscal event. Gates and others to partially cover UK aid cuts Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Is public opinion shifting on cutting foreign aid? Any rebadging of overseas assistance would be seen by some as an attempt by Mr Sunak to seize further control of the aid budget while new Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is finding her feet. But Foreign Office sources said Ms Truss - as a former chief secretary - was familiar with how the Treasury worked and it would be wrong to suggest she was unaware of what was going on. The government is already cutting aid spending byreducing the target of what must be allocated to overseas assistancefrom 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. That means a reduction this year of about Â£4bn, leaving the total amount being spent on aid at roughly Â£10bn. There are strict international rules about what counts as aid and charities fear the Treasury is looking at options that would effectively break the spirit of these rules. They say officials want the cancellation of a multi-million-pound debt owed by Sudan to the UK to count as official aid, even though the money was effectively written off years ago. They say the Treasury wants some foreign currency handouts from the International Monetary Fund - known as Special Drawing Rights - to count as aid. These complex financial mechanisms are designed to help developing countries cope with Covid. But even though the money comes from the IMF and not UK coffers, officials want 30% to count towards the 0.5% target. The Treasury is also understood to want to designate the cost of giving Covid vaccines to developing countries as official aid. This could amount to as much as Â£1bn. Some analysts say the Treasury is additionally considering switching large chunks of aid spending from so-called ""resource"" budgets to ""capital"" budgets, an accounting change that would make it harder for the Foreign Office to spend aid on what it wants. Ranil Dissanayake, policy fellow at the Centre for Global Development think tank, said all these changes - if made together - could potentially reduce the FCDO's discretionary aid budget from Â£8bn to as little as Â£2bn. ""That would amount to a complete gutting of the UK's status as a major bilateral development presence, essentially depriving [the Foreign Secretary] of one of its most potent weapons almost immediately after she assumes the brief,"" he said. ""The UK's status as a serious bilateral donor would be under existential threat."" He added: ""Unless Liz Truss manages to stop the chancellor from bullying her department out of its spending power, the UK will become a near non-entity as a bilateral development actor as early as next year."" One source in the aid sector said: ""Rishi is trying to cut Liz Truss off at the knees before she's got her legs under the table."" Romilly Greenhill, UK Director of ONE, the global campaign against poverty, said: ""It's incredibly worrying that UK aid looks set to be cut again, through accounting trickery by the Treasury. ""The chancellor looks set to count the sharing of surplus vaccine doses, a new injection of cost-free foreign exchange reserves and the cancellation of debts that haven't been repaid for decades as part of the aid budget. If these areas are included under the new 0.5% pledge, it will further squeeze funding to tackle poverty, conflict and climate, hurting people both in the UK and around the world. She added: ""What's worse is that it's happening by stealth. The Treasury is combing the aid rules for loopholes and ambiguities to save money on technicalities. It will mean death by a thousand cuts for UK aid."" Abigael Baldoumas, policy and advocacy manager at the international development network BOND, said: ""We are deeply concerned about a further assault on the aid budget. There is a real risk that the Treasury will use accounting tricks to reduce the amount of aid the Foreign Office can spend in ways that make a real difference to the lives of people living in poor and middle-income countries."" She added: ""Special drawing rights were issued to put more money in the hands of low and middle-income countries to tackle the devastating impact of the pandemic, not so that the Treasury could use them to replace of overseas development assistance. Meanwhile, Sarah Champion, International Development committee chair, said: ""The chancellor may think he's clever by playing these financial sleight of hand games, but it's not just the poorest in the world that suffer, it's the UK's international reputation."" A Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We will continue to protect the world's poorest. The UK is one of the highest donors in the G7 and this year we will spend at least Â£10bn on overseas aid. We do not speculate on future tax and spending commitments ahead of fiscal events."" The Treasury said the UK would continue to ""score"" overseas development assistance ""fully guided by and in accordance with"" the rules laid down by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. It also emphasised the UK's aid spending was ""considerably more"" than the 29 countries on the OECD's development assistance committee.

"Ozy chief executive Carlos Watson was a former CNN news anchor US media firm Ozy Media has announced that it is to close down amid a growing row over its business practices. ""It is.. with the heaviest of hearts that we must announce today that we are closing Ozy's doors"", the company said in a statement. It follows reports that Ozy's chief operating officer deceived potential investors during a conference call and is now being investigated by the FBI. Some major advertisers subsequently cut ties with the firm. Ozy's chairman Marc Lasry and ex-BBC journalist Katty Kay have also quit. In another twist, Sharon Osborne, the wife of rock star Ozzy Osbourne, alleged the firm's chief executive, Carlos Watson, falsely claimed the couple had invested in the business. Mr Watsonmade the claims in a TV interview with broadcaster CNBC,externalin 2019 after settling a trademark dispute with the couple. Former BBC journalist Katty Kay quits US media firm Ms Osbourne told CNBC on Thursday: ""This guy is the biggest shyster I have ever seen in my life."" Neither Mr Watson nor Ozy Media has commented publicly on the claims. These accusations are outrageous, almost unbelievable - part of a toxic culture of corporate behaviour that exists in parts of Silicon Valley. It is common here to say your company is bigger, more innovative, more successful, more connected, than it really is.  It's seen as ""hustle"", or ""hype"". However, ""fake it till you make it"" - as it's sometimes referred to - has led to some of the biggest scandals in Silicon Valley history. Theranos' CEO and founder is currently on trial in San Jose - accused of a spectacular fraud involving blood testing. Selling a dream that will one day be realised is what most companies do. It's why we have computers and smartphones. But there are countless examples of companies going too far. Some of the things Ozy Media has been accused of are actually pretty common in Silicon Valley, Overstating how popular your content is a classic of the genre - something numerous companies have been accused of. But there are other accusations here that are simply astonishing - that if true may well lead to legal action. It's the kind of story that will deeply worry investors, who are in a constant battle to separate the frauds from the visionaries. Ozy Media, which was launched in California in 2013, produces left-leaning podcasts, television series and events, and has won an Emmy for its work. Last weekend, the New York Times reported that its co-founder and chief operating officer, Samir Rao, impersonated a senior leader at YouTube during a conference call with Goldman Sachs in February. At that point the investment bank was considering making a $40m investment in the media company. Mr Rao reportedly claimed that Ozy's videos were highly popular on YouTube. Katty Kay called the allegations against the firm ""troubling"" According to the Times, the investors realised something was wrong and did not go through with the deal. Mr Watson has since apologised and said Mr Rao was suffering a ""mental health crisis"" at the time. Yet amid growing scrutiny, Ozy this week said it had begun an internal investigation and Mr Rao had taken a leave of absence. On Thursday, Mr Lasry, who owns the NBA basketball team the Milwaukee Bucks, stepped down after only three weeks as chairman. In a statement he said: ""I believe that going forward Ozy requires experience in areas like crisis management and investigations, where I do not have particular expertise."" He added that he remains an investor in Ozy Media. The same day, major advertisers were reported to be pulling their ad campaigns with Ozy. Target, Goldman Sachs and AirBnB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Ford said ""We are pausing our advertising while Ozy Media addresses their current business challenges"" and US banking services firm Ally Financial said its relationship with Ozy was on hold ""in light of recent developments"". On Wednesday, Ms Kay announced she had ""no choice"" but to cut ties, calling the New York Times' allegations ""deeply troubling"". The veteran broadcaster joined Ozy in June after more than three decades at the BBC. On Friday, the Times publishedfresh claims about Ozy,externalmade by a former producer, Brad Bessey. Mr Bessey, who was hired this summer to produce a talk show hosted by Carlos Watson, was reportedly told from the start it would appear in a prime time slot on the US cable network A&E. Yet, he later found out A&E had rejected the show before it began taping, the Times said. Mr Bessey reportedly quit the firm, accusing Mr Watson and Mr Rao of playing ""a dangerous game with the truth"". In the end ""The Carlos Watson Show"" show appeared on Ozy's own website and YouTube. The BBC has contacted Ozy Media for comment.

"Jeff Bezos after travelling into space onboard a Blue Origin rocket in July The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said it will review safety concerns raised by whistleblowers at Blue Origin, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' space company. The announcement comes after 21 current and former employees claimed the company had ignored safety concerns to gain an advantage in the space race. Staff also complained of a culture of sexism within the company. Blue Origin rejected the charges and said it stands by its safety record. A spokesperson for the company said it provides ""numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct"". It added that it ""has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind"". Staffers led by Blue Origin's former head of internal communications, Alexandra Abrams, made the allegations in a letter that was sent to the FAA before being published on the whistleblowing website, Lioness, on Thursday. Raising concerns over the standard of the company's flagship New Shepard rocket,which Mr Bezos travelled into space on in July, the essay writers said: ""In the opinion of an engineer who has signed on to this essay, 'Blue Origin has been lucky that nothing has happened so far'."" The letter also alleged that more than 1,000 reports of issues related to the engines that power Blue Origin's rockets have never been addressed. ""Many of this essay's authors say they would not fly on a Blue Origin vehicle,"" the letter added. The FAA, which regulates rocket launches in the US, said that it ""takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information"". In addition to the safety concerns, staff also claimed that the company's management embraces a ""particular brand of sexism"" under which numerous managers and senior staff displayed consistently inappropriate behaviour towards women. One senior executive was reported to the HR department multiple times for sexual harassment, the authors claim. However, no action was taken and they allege that the individual was later placed on a panel overseeing the appointment of a new senior HR role. Another executive was reportedly so notorious for sexist behaviour that new female staff were warned to avoid him. ""It appeared to many of us that he was protected by his close personal relationship with Bezos â it took him physically groping a female subordinate for him to finally be let go,"" the group alleged. A Blue Origin spokesperson said Ms Abrams ""was dismissed for cause two years ago after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations"". Ms Abrams told CBS News, which first reported the allegations, she never received any warnings related to export control issues. In July the company made the first crewed flight of its rocket ship, New Shepard, with Mr Bezos onboard. When the capsule touched back down after the 10 minute, 10 second flight, the Amazon founder exclaimed: ""Best day ever!"" The rocket is designed to serve the burgeoning market for space tourism.

"Jeremy Stansfield co-hosted the BBC's Bang Goes The Theory from 2009-14 A TV presenter who was hurt while playing the role of a human crash test dummy has been awarded Â£1.6m in damages after a High Court battle with the BBC. Jeremy Stansfield, 50, said he suffered spine and brain injuries while filming a 2013 episode of science show Bang Goes The Theory, resulting in more than Â£3m of lost future earnings. Mrs Justice Yip ruled the effect of the injuries was ""to derail the claimant's successful career in television"". The BBC disputed Mr Stansfield's claim. The injuries happened when Mr Stansfield, who was 42 at the time, filmed a Bang Goes The Theory feature about the relative safety of forward and rear-facing child car seats. The episode saw him ""strapped into a rig like a go-cart which was propelled along a track into a post"". In the segment, Mr Stansfield explained he had calculated the experiment to give a similar crash profile to hitting a lamppost in a real car in an urban environment. The crashes were performed forwards and backwards twice each. Mr Stansfield said he had been left with a ""constellation of symptoms"", leading to a significant decline in his health. Mrs Justice Yip ruled that the ""combined effect"" of Mr Stansfield's physical injuries and his psychological reaction to the crash test had caused him ""significant impairment"" and restricted ""his enjoyment of life"". Before the crash tests, Mr Stansfield had been an ""exceptionally fit"" man, the judge said. A BBC physical assessment for a 2012 project involving a human powered aircraft, which he had designed himself as a former engineer, suggested he was performing at the level of a competitive athlete. Jeremy ""Jem"" Stansfield with Bang Goes The Theory co-hosts Liz Bonnin and Maggie Philbin in 2013 Mrs Justice Yip said: ""I must say that I find it astonishing that anyone thought that this exercise was a sensible idea. ""On his own account to camera, the claimant was simulating a road traffic collision of the sort that commonly causes injury. ""It might be thought that someone of his intelligence and scientific background might have appreciated the risk."" The judgement was not assessing liability, but the extent of Mr Stansfield's injuries and the damages owed. The judgement said the BBC argued that ""little more than a moderate whiplash injury with depressive symptoms"" could properly be attributed to the crash tests, so only modest damages should be awarded. She said there was also evidence the BBC actively sought advice and had been warned of the danger yet still allowed the experiment to proceed. The BBC has agreed to share responsibility and loss of earnings, the ruling said. Mr Stansfield had originally claimed almost Â£4m in damages. A BBC spokesman said: ""We take the health and wellbeing of everyone who works for the BBC extremely seriously. ""We keep safety measures on set under constant review and we made adjustments following the incident in 2013. ""We acknowledge the court's judgment in this complex case and wish Mr Stansfield the best for the future."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says nuclear power should be part of the power generation mix in the UK Proposals for a new nuclear power plant at Wylfa are being looked at by the UK government, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said previous ministers had failed to take ""tough decisions"" on the technology. It comes as officials holdexploratory talkswith groups wanting to build a nuclear plant at the Anglesey site. A previous bid for a new plant was scrappedearlier this year. Japanese firm Hitachi walked away from the Horizon project after it failed to agree with the UK government on funding. Talks on new Anglesey nuclear plant proposals Hitachi scraps Â£20bn nuclear power plant End for Â£20bn nuclear plant as plans ditched Two groups have been speaking to officials at the UK government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A consortium involving US engineering firm Bechtel has proposed building a Westinghouse AP1000 reactor. Talks have also taken place with UK-based Shearwater Energy, he said, which has hybrid plans for small nuclear reactors and a wind farm. Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant was switched off in 2015 and is being decommissioned Speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Johnson said: ""To be frank, governments in this country have refused to take the tough decisions on nuclear for too long. ""We do need to go forward with more nuclear power. I do think it should be part of our baseload. ""So that's why yes, of course, we're looking at Wylfa as well as lots of other projects."" He said the cost of energy can be held down ""if we make the big long-term investments that we need to do now in clean power generation"". A representative of Bechtel has said Anglesey is regarded as the best site in the UK to build a large-scale nuclear power station. Previous plans to build a new nuclear power station on Anglesey were ditched in January Wylfa is currently the site of a decommissioned power station,the last part of which was switched off in 2015. Plans for a new Â£13bn nuclear power plant failed after backers Hitachi failed to come to an agreement with the UK government over how it would be subsidised. Reports suggested the company was offered a ""strike price"" - a price on energy that ministers would guarantee to the builders of the project - of around Â£75 per megawatt hour. The nuclear plant was intended to have a generating capacity of 2,900 megawatts (MW) and have a 60-year operational life. Mr Johnson spoke ahead of the Conservative party conference, which begins in Manchester on Sunday. Defending the decision to scrap the Â£20 universal credit uplift, he told BBC Wales he did not believe it would be right to subsidise low wages. He said a Â£500m hardship fund was being set up - with Â£25m going to the Welsh government, which can spend the cash how it wants. There are 275,000 universal credit claimants in Wales. Mr Johnson continued: ""What I don't think would be right would be to subsidise low wages when companies are paying their workers more. ""That is the right way forward for the UK economy.""

"Jo Barrie (left) with her mother Nancy Lovering who was discharged from hospital to a care home and was lost to Covid In the early days of the pandemic more than half of elderly hospital patients discharged to nearly 200 Scottish care homes had not been tested for Covid. Data obtained by the BBC from Public Health Scotland (PHS) provides the clearest picture yet on which homes took in untested and positive patients. A lawyer acting for bereaved families at an upcoming inquiry called the data ""explosive evidence"". Aamer Anwar claimed it was proof that people's lives had been put at risk. The figures, which were released 11 months after BBC Scotland had asked for them, focus on hospital discharges between March and May 2020 - which was the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The PHS data, released under freedom of information laws, appears inthis interactive dashboard,externaland shows every hospital discharge by individual care home in Scotland. It reveals what proportion of people discharged were untested or positive and what proportion of beds might have been occupied by discharged patients. Although the data cannot be used to link discharges to outbreaks or deaths in any given home, solicitor Mr Anwar believed it proved that lives had been put at risk. He is acting on behalf of members of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice and told BBC Scotland: ""The data supports what many bereaved families have always suspected, that elderly patients were discharged without any regard for a duty of care owed to them, or to residents and care home staff. ""Many of the grieving families I represent describe what took place in our care homes as a massacre that could have been avoided, had a simple test taken place prior to discharge. ""The data makes for explosive evidence for a pending Scottish Covid-19 Public Inquiry."" Ms Sturgeon has admitted that the way elderly people were discharged from hospital to care homes in the early stages of the pandemic was a mistake At the start of the pandemic, thousands of elderly people who no longer needed to be in hospital were discharged into many of Scotland's 1,000 plus care homes. This was at a time when the Scottish government was being advised that spare capacity was needed in wards to accommodate coronavirus cases. It was also before testing was commonplace. Only on 21 April 2020 it became mandatory for hospital patients to have two negative Covid tests before being discharged, and for all new care home admissions to be isolated for 14 days. Between 1 March and 21 April 2020 in Scotland, 82% of the 3,595 discharged patients were not tested. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later called the way patients were dischargeda ""mistake"". But solicitor Anwar said: ""It's all very well to say with the benefit of hindsight a mistake was made, but we knew at the time elderly people were dying at a rapid rate. A recent PHS reportconcluded it ""cannot rule out"" a link between patients being discharged from hospital and Covid outbreaks in care homes. A Scottish government spokesman said the PHS analysis ""found care home size is very strongly related to outbreaks and concluded there was no clear statistical evidence that hospital discharges were associated with care home outbreaks."" He added: ""These latest figures do not change that conclusion. Decisions to discharge patients are not made by ministers, but health and social care professionals, alongside the patient and their family."" Scottish Conservative social care spokesman Craig Hoy said the figures showed that ""critical errors"" by the Scottish government meant it had ""completely failed to protect our elderly and vulnerable residents in care facilities, which has resulted in thousands of families grieving the loss of a loved one."" This interactive dashboard,externalreveals for the first time the 843 homes into which each of the 5,198 patients was discharged to between 1 March and 31 May 2020. The data also shows the 752 homes which took in untested patients between 1 March and 21 April 2020. And the figures reveal the 75 homes which took in at least one patient who had tested positive - and who had never received a negative test prior to discharge. The data also revealed: That while the average number of discharges to Scottish homes was at least five, Oakminster Healthcare'sChester Park Care Homein Glasgow received the most (46) between March and May 2020 - which equates to more than half of the beds in the home. At least 19 of these were untested hospital patients discharged between during 1 March and 21 April 2020 TheRutherglen Care Homerun by Advinia took in the most untested discharges (28) - that is at least 70% of all the 40 discharges between March and May 2020 TheLower Johnshillhome run by the Methodist Homes Association took in 10 discharged patients - none of them were tested for coronavirus prior to entering the home There were nearly 200 homes where at least half of incoming residents were untested Five patients testing positive were discharged to theDrummond Grange Nursing Homerun by Barchester Healthcare - at least 21% of all 23 discharges to the home An Advinia spokesperson said: ""In the earliest days of the crisis, when, by comparison, little was known about the virus, particularly the asymptomatic nature of transmission, our care homes found themselves on the frontline."" They added that care was given in accordance to guidelines and all of its homes were are ""prepared as they could been at the time the pandemic started"". A statement from Barchester Healthcare said that given ongoing investigations by Police Scotland and the Crown Office it was not appropriate to comment on specific cases. It added: ""The beginning of the pandemic was a very difficult time for everyone with so little known about the virus, testing, or airborne and asymptomatic transmission."" Oakminster Healthcare and Methodist Homes Association has been contacted for a comment. Jo Barrie said there was a ""lot of pressure"" to get her mother into a care home. She recalled: ""I was getting almost daily calls from a social worker just push, push, pushing all the time. They wanted her out of that hospital as soon as."" Nancy Lovering, was admitted to Perth Royal Infirmary in late February 2020 with a chest infection and after several weeks the 88-year-old was deemed well enough to be discharged. Due to her mother's Alzheimer's and increasing frailty, a social worker advised the family to start looking for care homes. They initially thought they had time to find the right accommodation, but Jo was contacted by a senior social worker who told her she just needed to ""find somewhere that's got a space"". ""I ended that phone call in tears,"" she said. Nancy was discharged into the Ancaster House Care Home in mid-March, but she did not take a test. Jo says that after a quarantine period of 14 days, and being symptom free, her mother was allowed into the residence's public areas. Four days later Jo says her family were emailed by the home to inform them that three residents had been diagnosed with coronavirus. Nancy then became ill and was admitted back into hospital where she died six days later from coronavirus. The new data reveals that 13 people were discharged to Ancaster House between March and May 2020. At least one patient was untested, and at least one other was discharged, despite testing positive for coronavirus. Jo said: ""I keep replaying back in my mind the day I dropped her off at the home. I feel as if I gave her a death sentence."" She says thousands of families still have unanswered questions. A statement by the home said: ""We would like to share our deepest sympathies with everyone who has lost a loved one to Covid-19 and send our condolences again to Nancy's family. Since the start of the pandemic, we have rigorously adhered to all guidance provided by the Scottish government, Health Protection Scotland and our local authority."" NHS Tayside, the health board which covers Perth Royal Infirmary, from where Nancy was discharged, said that from early April 2020 patients leaving hospital and going into care homes were tested. A spokesperson added: ""The decision to transfer a patient from hospital to a care home is always based on clinical judgement and is undertaken in discussion with the family and a multi-disciplinary team which includes doctors, nurses and other health and care staff, including staff at the care home."" Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate of nearly 10,500 people in Scotland The Scottish government confirmed last month thatScotland was to hold a public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemicby the end of the year and would scrutinise decisions that were taken over the course of the crisis. The Scottish inquiry will investigate ""events causing public concern"", including the high number of deaths in care homes, and will examine the explanations of the decisions that were taken and the causes of ""anything which may not have gone as expected"". Mr Anwar said: ""We aim to hold to account those officials in hospitals who took the decision to discharge without tests, especially at a time when our hospitals were in complete shutdown, fearful of spreading the virus.""

"Armed forces personnel will begin delivering petrol to garages across the UK from Monday, the government says. Almost 200 servicemen and women, 100 of them drivers, will provide ""temporary"" support to ease pressure on stations. Ministers have also announced that up to 300 overseas fuel tanker drivers will be able to work in the UK immediately until the end of March. There have been long queues at petrol stations this week after a shortage of drivers disrupted fuel deliveries. Petrol prices at eight-year high amid fuel crisis Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis Is the petrol shortage improving? Ministers - who have maintained there is enough fuel if people buy at their normal rates - say the situation at petrol station forecourts is improving, with more fuel now being delivered than sold. But they acknowledge some parts of the country are worse affected than others. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations said Scotland, the north of England and parts of the Midlands had seen a ""distinct improvement"" with fewer dry sites. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it remained a ""big problem"" in London and south-east England, where ""if anything it had got worse."" He said the military drivers will be a ""large help"" but a ""prioritisation of deliveries to filling stations, particularly the independent ones, which are the neighbourhood sites"" was needed ""immediately"". Mr Madderson warned drivers would see a rise in fuel prices next week, but because of ""global factors"" not because of profiteering. On Friday, the RAC motoring group also saidthe disruption in deliveries was continuing to ease, though many areas were still experiencing supply issues. Smaller fuel stations were facing major supply problems as drivers filled up for the weekend, it said. Military personnel are currently training at haulier sites and will be on the road delivering fuel supplies across the country to ""help fuel stocks further improve"" from Monday, the government said. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said personnel would be seen working alongside drivers this weekend following training this week. In addition to the 300 fuel tanker drivers being allowed to work temporarily in the UK, temporary visas are also being offered to 4,700 food haulage drivers who are able to arrive from late October and leave by 28 February 2022. Visas are being offered to a further 5,500 poultry workers who can come from late October and stay until 31 December. Previously, the government said these temporary visas would last until Christmas Eve. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said there were ""continued signs that the situation at the pumps is slowly improving"". ""UK forecourt stock levels are trending up, deliveries of fuel to forecourts are above normal levels, and fuel demand is stabilising,"" he said. ""It's important to stress there is no national shortage of fuel in the UK, and people should continue to buy fuel as normal."" By political correspondent Pete Saull More than a week after queues started appearing on petrol station forecourts, just under 200 military personnel will take to the roads. Ministers say it takes time to train up servicemen and women to drive large tankers carrying highly flammable substances into built-up areas. While they will help with getting supplies to garages, there's been a concern inside government that falling back on the armed forces could be counter-productive. What message does it send to worried motorists to see soldiers driving petrol tankers? Could it lead to more panic buying? Ministers are confident the situation will continue to stabilise, but they've been under pressure to take more urgent action. It's notable that alongside the decision to deploy the military, up to 300 tanker drivers will be allowed into the UK from overseas immediately - several weeks before the wider visa scheme comes into effect. Labour leaderSir Keir Starmer called on the PM to recall Parliamentfrom party conference recess, saying ""emergency action"" was needed to speed up the visas. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused the haulage industry of being too reliant on low-paid migrant workers. He added that he would not allow the UK to repeat the ""failures"" of the past, by allowing mass immigration to create a ""low-wage, low-skill economy"" for British workers. The haulage industry says the driver shortage already existed, but has been made worse by factors including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, low wages and poor working conditions. A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage In addition to offering temporary visas, the government last week set out a number of other measures aimed at limiting disruption in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. These include increasing HGV (heavy goods vehicle) testing capacity, sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence, encouraging them back into the industry, and offering training courses for HGV drivers. Meanwhile, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned there is global disruption to supply chains in other industries, which could continue until Christmas. ""These shortages are very real,"" Mr Sunaktold the Daily Mail,external. ""We're seeing real disruptions in supply chains in different sectors, not just here but around the world. We are determined to do what we can to try to mitigate as much of this as we can."" Andthe Financial Times reports,externalthat turkeys will be imported to the UK from France and Poland in the run-up to Christmas after farmers reared about one million fewer birds. British Poultry Council chief executive Richard Griffiths told the paper that Brexit had cut off the industry's supply of cheap labour.

"Women have been asking how they should react if they are stopped by a lone police officer. It comes after Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens was jailed for using his police ID to kidnap, rape and murder 33-year-old Sarah Everard. The laws are different inScotland,externalandNorthern Ireland,external, so most of this information only applies to England and Wales. Campaigners stress the onus should not be on women to keep themselves safe. Instead, they say the focus should be on tackling violence against women and rebuilding trust in police. Jess Phillips, shadow domestic violence and safeguarding minister, says ""it is not women who need advice"". She saysshe would have got into Wayne Couzens' car - ""almost anybody would"". But if you are stopped by someone claiming to be an officer and something doesn't feel right, what can you do? Former Met Police chief superintendent Parm Sandhu urges people to ""ask for help if you need it"". She says if you're stopped by someone who is alone, in plain clothes and an unmarked car, phone 999 to check who they are. If you can't phone anyone, and you're scared, scream and draw attention to yourself, she says. If they ask you to get into their car, ask them to call for a marked police vehicle or insist they call another officer, she adds. Calling the police station they say they belong to, or 101 to check their warrant card and identity, is a good idea says Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers. He also suggests calling a family member or friend (or lawyer if you know one) to let them know what is happening. The Met Police says if you are alone with an officer and no others arrive, ask ""searching questions"", such as ""where are your colleagues?"". If they have a radio, ask to hear the voice of the operator and ask them to verify you're with a genuine officer, it says. However, Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, says it is ""absurd"" for police to advise women to challenge officers - as this fails to recognise the power imbalance in the relationship. She says this will be ""felt most by women from black, minority ethnic and migrant communities who commonly experience over-policing"". Officers always carry identification and can be asked for proof. This is usually a warrant card. These can differ from force to force buttypically include,externalthe officer's photograph, name, identity number, the name of the force and a security hologram - although they won't necessarily have all of these. Police in Brent, north-west London, shared an image of a Met Police warrant card back in 2018. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A police community support officer (PCSO)must wear uniform,externalwhen they stop and question you. Police officers don't always wear uniforms. But they must show you their warrant card, especially if they are in plain clothes. It would be highly unusual for a plain-clothes officer to be working alone, the College of Policing says. If they are, it is standard practice that they should call other officers who should arrive soon afterwards. After Couzens' sentencing, the Met Police saidit would no longer deploy plain-clothes officers on their own- although there would be ""occasions"" when that was not possible. A police officer or PCSO can ask questions about who you are, where you are going and what you are doing. This is under ""stop and account"" powers,according to human rights organisation Liberty.,external In most cases you have the right to refuse to answer and can walk away andthis can't be used as the sole reason to search or arrest you.,external However, Liberty advises that if officers have reason to believe you're involved in anti-social behaviour, you must give your name and address - as it is a criminal offence not to. Police can also stop you under separate ""stop and search"" powers. These allow officers to search an individual if they have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect you are carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something which could be used to commit a crime. Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief How a police officer covered up Sarah Everard's murder To arrest you,police need reasonable grounds to suspect you're involved in a crime for which your arrest is necessary,external. If you're arrested, the officer must: identify himself or herself as police tell you that you're being arrested and what crime they think you've committed explain why it's necessary to arrest you explain to you that you're not free to leave ""If someone who says they are a police officer stops you, it can be difficult to know what to do,"" says Adam Wagner. If you are being arrested on your own in a secluded location or at night, you could offer to give the officer your details and ask to attend a police station the next day instead, he suggests. Officers on the streets now almost always havebody-worn video cameras,external, which are used to capture evidence when attending incidents or arresting someone. They act as a safeguard for both the person being stopped and the officer in the event of a dispute. Officers are expected to intervene if they see someone committing an offence or there is another need to protect the public - even when off duty. An officer can exercise most of their powers all the time,external- and as soon as they do so they are classed as being on duty.

"Jeremy Stansfield co-hosted the BBC's Bang Goes The Theory from 2009-14 A TV presenter who was hurt while playing the role of a human crash test dummy has been awarded Â£1.6m in damages after a High Court battle with the BBC. Jeremy Stansfield, 50, said he suffered spine and brain injuries while filming a 2013 episode of science show Bang Goes The Theory, resulting in more than Â£3m of lost future earnings. Mrs Justice Yip ruled the effect of the injuries was ""to derail the claimant's successful career in television"". The BBC disputed Mr Stansfield's claim. The injuries happened when Mr Stansfield, who was 42 at the time, filmed a Bang Goes The Theory feature about the relative safety of forward and rear-facing child car seats. The episode saw him ""strapped into a rig like a go-cart which was propelled along a track into a post"". In the segment, Mr Stansfield explained he had calculated the experiment to give a similar crash profile to hitting a lamppost in a real car in an urban environment. The crashes were performed forwards and backwards twice each. Mr Stansfield said he had been left with a ""constellation of symptoms"", leading to a significant decline in his health. Mrs Justice Yip ruled that the ""combined effect"" of Mr Stansfield's physical injuries and his psychological reaction to the crash test had caused him ""significant impairment"" and restricted ""his enjoyment of life"". Before the crash tests, Mr Stansfield had been an ""exceptionally fit"" man, the judge said. A BBC physical assessment for a 2012 project involving a human powered aircraft, which he had designed himself as a former engineer, suggested he was performing at the level of a competitive athlete. Jeremy ""Jem"" Stansfield with Bang Goes The Theory co-hosts Liz Bonnin and Maggie Philbin in 2013 Mrs Justice Yip said: ""I must say that I find it astonishing that anyone thought that this exercise was a sensible idea. ""On his own account to camera, the claimant was simulating a road traffic collision of the sort that commonly causes injury. ""It might be thought that someone of his intelligence and scientific background might have appreciated the risk."" The judgement was not assessing liability, but the extent of Mr Stansfield's injuries and the damages owed. The judgement said the BBC argued that ""little more than a moderate whiplash injury with depressive symptoms"" could properly be attributed to the crash tests, so only modest damages should be awarded. She said there was also evidence the BBC actively sought advice and had been warned of the danger yet still allowed the experiment to proceed. The BBC has agreed to share responsibility and loss of earnings, the ruling said. Mr Stansfield had originally claimed almost Â£4m in damages. A BBC spokesman said: ""We take the health and wellbeing of everyone who works for the BBC extremely seriously. ""We keep safety measures on set under constant review and we made adjustments following the incident in 2013.

"The RAC motoring group has said the fuel shortage problem continues to ease, although many areas of the UK are still suffering supply issues. Smaller fuel stations were still facing major supply issues as drivers fill up for the weekend, the RAC said. Earlier, BP said problems at its stations caused by a shortage of HGV drivers was starting to improve. It comes as one of the big fuel delivery firms, Hoyer Petrolog, confirmed it was training army drivers. The RAC said that on Thursday its patrol vehicles dealt with nearly five times the number of out-of-fuel breakdowns than was typical. However, that was down on the 13-times it dealt with on Monday. Mr Williams said: While the fuel delivery situation continues to improve in many areas, that's sadly not the case right across the country. ""Those drivers that rely on independent forecourts, especially where there aren't any supermarkets selling fuel, may still be struggling to fill up."" BPwas the first company to warnit had to close some petrol stations due to a shortage of drivers, which has worsened due to Covid and Brexit. But the company said on Friday the situation was ""stabilising"". A big fuel delivery supplier to BP forecourts and other outlets, Hoyer, confirmed to the BBC it was training army drivers over the last two days. Hoyer, which delivers to about 25% of the UK's petrol stations, was not able to confirm how many army personnel were being trained nor when they would start work. However, the army drivers will use a mix of Hoyer and military vehicles to make deliveries, the company said. The UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies. BP said the situation had started to improve over the last few days, adding it was ""working flat out"" to keep sites across the country supplied. BP closes some sites due to lorry driver shortage No improvement in fuel supplies, say retailers UK visa plan will not fix lorry crisis, says boss While the government and retailers say there is enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations. The haulage industry says an existing shortage of lorry drivers has been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, low wages and poor working conditions. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, policing minister Kit Malthouse said: ""My latest briefing is that the situation is stabilising, that we are seeing more forecourts with a greater supply of fuel and hopefully that, as demand and supply come better into balance over the next few days, week or so, that we will see a return to normality."" He added that if the situation started to deteriorate again, Prime Minister Boris Johnson would review matters. However, Labour leader Kier Starmer said it was time for ""emergency action"" as the ""chaos"" looked set to continue. He said: ""We're going to see this driver shortage problem coming back again in different sectors. ""By the government's own admission, their scheme won't be up and running for weeks with the first HGV drivers not on the roads until November. This simply isn't good enough."" He called for the use of the military to get petrol to areas of the country in most need, and for fuel stations with supplies to extend opening hours for NHS shift staff and other key workers. ""Normally a tanker would last three to four days, but now it's selling out in 12 hours,"" says Danyal Shoaib, who runs a petrol station near Leatherhead, in Surrey. In the last week he says they've run dry three times. ""I think social media has played a massive part. As soon as anyone sees a tanker, they stick it online and the queues develop all the way down the road,"" he says. Mr Shoaib says he's been surprised by the abuse he and his colleagues have faced from ""a significant minority"" of customers. ""A man tried to bypass the queue and when I politely asked him to join the end, he tried to drive his car into me to get me to move,"" he says. After he asked the man to calm down, he was then subjected to abusive language including ""quite obscene racial slurs"", he adds. Despite this, Mr Shoaib says they've had ""loads of lovely messages"" thanking them, and seen huge relief on people's faces when they can fill up. At his petrol station, he says demand remains high: ""What we're saying to people is, if you can, please be reasonable. If you can make do with half a tank or three quarters of a tank, please do that."" The BBC understands that demand at supermarkets Asda and Morrisons is also easing, continuing a trend seen throughout the week. A Morrisons spokesperson said: ""It is a rapidly moving situation and we are working hard with our suppliers to ensure we can continue to keep our pumps open and serve our customers."" Sainsbury's, which has more than 300 sites in total, said that it was still experiencing high demand for fuel. ""We're working closely with our supplier to maintain supply and all our sites continue to receive fuel,"" a spokesperson said. Tesco added: ""We have good availability of fuel, and we're working really hard to ensure regular deliveries to our petrol filling stations across the UK every day."" The firm operates 500 petrol stations, with another 200 managed by Esso with a Tesco Express store on-site. An Esso spokesman told the BBC that a number of its Tesco Alliance sites were affected. ""The picture is constantly changing, but the situation at the 200 Esso Tesco Alliance sites is stabilising and continues to improve in terms of fuel availability,"" they said. Like a car running low on petrol, the situation at the pumps seems to have slowed and possibly stalled. Fuel demand is still far from normal and the picture is very patchy. While there are hopeful noises from some areas of the industry that fuel is getting through, those who are selling it are still seeing queues, particularly in London and the south east. The situation is not as bad as last weekend, but it still isn't over. The messaging could be tricky for the government. Tell everyone the crisis is solved before it dies down, and ministers risk losing the public's trust. The question now is what will reassure the public to go back to normal buying? The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations It said on Friday there had been little change for its members who are independent fuel retailers. Its survey of 1,100 sites across the UK found that 26% had neither petrol nor diesel in stock, down slightly from 27% on Thursday. Gordon Balmer, its executive director, said: ""Whilst the situation is similar to recent days, there are signs it is improving, but far too slowly. ""Independents, which total 65% of the entire network, are not receiving enough deliveries of fuel compared with other sectors."" Mr Balmer said he believed queues were likely until independent retailers started getting more frequent deliveries. In an attempt to limit disruption, the government has confirmed that 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers can receive temporary UK visas, with the scheme ending on Christmas Eve. A temporary relaxation on drivers' hours has also been extended,externaluntil 31 October. This allows the daily driving limit to be increased from nine hours to 10 hours up to four times in a week. A government spokesperson said it had taken ""immediate action"" to increase the supply of HGV drivers and relieve the pressure on petrol stations. ""We recognise the challenges facing industry and streamlined the testing process in July to boost the number of drivers,"" they said, adding that it was important people continued to buy fuel as normal.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says nuclear power should be part of the power generation mix in the UK Proposals for a new nuclear power plant at Wylfa are being looked at by the UK government, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said previous ministers had failed to take ""tough decisions"" on the technology. It comes as officials holdexploratory talkswith groups wanting to build a nuclear plant at the Anglesey site. A previous bid for a new plant was scrappedearlier this year. Japanese firm Hitachi walked away from the Horizon project after it failed to agree with the UK government on funding. Talks on new Anglesey nuclear plant proposals Hitachi scraps Â£20bn nuclear power plant End for Â£20bn nuclear plant as plans ditched Two groups have been speaking to officials at the UK government's Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A consortium involving US engineering firm Bechtel has proposed building a Westinghouse AP1000 reactor. Talks have also taken place with UK-based Shearwater Energy, he said, which has hybrid plans for small nuclear reactors and a wind farm. Wylfa Newydd nuclear plant was switched off in 2015 and is being decommissioned Speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Johnson said: ""To be frank, governments in this country have refused to take the tough decisions on nuclear for too long. ""We do need to go forward with more nuclear power. I do think it should be part of our baseload. ""So that's why yes, of course, we're looking at Wylfa as well as lots of other projects."" He said the cost of energy can be held down ""if we make the big long-term investments that we need to do now in clean power generation"". A representative of Bechtel has said Anglesey is regarded as the best site in the UK to build a large-scale nuclear power station. Previous plans to build a new nuclear power station on Anglesey were ditched in January Wylfa is currently the site of a decommissioned power station,the last part of which was switched off in 2015. Plans for a new Â£13bn nuclear power plant failed after backers Hitachi failed to come to an agreement with the UK government over how it would be subsidised. Reports suggested the company was offered a ""strike price"" - a price on energy that ministers would guarantee to the builders of the project - of around Â£75 per megawatt hour. The nuclear plant was intended to have a generating capacity of 2,900 megawatts (MW) and have a 60-year operational life. Mr Johnson spoke ahead of the Conservative party conference, which begins in Manchester on Sunday. Defending the decision to scrap the Â£20 universal credit uplift, he told BBC Wales he did not believe it would be right to subsidise low wages. He said a Â£500m hardship fund was being set up - with Â£25m going to the Welsh government, which can spend the cash how it wants. There are 275,000 universal credit claimants in Wales. Mr Johnson continued: ""What I don't think would be right would be to subsidise low wages when companies are paying their workers more. ""That is the right way forward for the UK economy.""

"Rhian Horsey, from Groesfaen, Pontyclun, has been found guilty of seven counts of fraud A carer has been found guilty of defrauding a 100-year-old woman of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Rhian Horsey, 55, of Pontyclun, was employed to look after Iris Sansom between 2003 and 2017. Cardiff Crown Court heard she ""systematically exploited and defrauded"" Mrs Sansom. Her daughter, Kathryn Taylor, alerted police in 2017 after bank statements showed substantial cash withdrawals had been made from her mother's savings. Numerous cheques had also been written out to Horsey. Horsey was ""completely transparent"" about what the cash was for, the court heard. She transferred large sums from Mrs Sansom's savings account to a bank account and withdrew it over the counter and from cash machines. Jodie-Jane Hitchcock, defending, said the withdrawals were ""legitimate"" and made with Mrs Sansom's knowledge. Horsey said the withdrawals were used to pay her wages, care bills, shopping, house repairs and gardening. Carer denies Â£225,000 fraud of 100-year-old woman Welsh government breached data laws over 300 times Horsey appeared at Cardiff Crown Court on Friday Ms Hitchock told the court details of an equity release plan from had been sent to Mrs Sansom's solicitor. ""It's not a secret squirrel exercise between Mrs Horsey and Mrs Sansom,"" she said. Mrs Sansom said in pre-recorded video evidence that she was ""not very good with money matters"". The court heard she was of a generation who wanted to have her cash at home. ""That's what Iris wanted to do,"" Horsey told the court. ""It wasn't for me to question and, in fact, if I had, she wouldn't have listened."" The court was told Horsey ""was living a lifestyle beyond her means"". She had mortgage arrears, spent Â£41,000 on cruises and Â£15,000 renting coastal cottages and woodland retreats. Money was also spent on hotels, theatres, jewellery and eating out. Fraud reports in Wales up by 25% during pandemic Romance fraud on rise in coronavirus lockdown She denied that was out of the ordinary and said it was ""something we have always done"" but the prosecution claimed Horsey exploited Mrs Sansom's vulnerability. ""The nature of the relationship was one of trust,"" said prosecuting counsel James Wilson. ""Iris Sansom trusted Rhian Horsey completely."" Another witness descried their relationship as being ""more like mother and daughter"". Between 2010 and 2013, Â£130,000 was withdrawn from Mrs Sansom's savings. The equity release scheme paid out instalments of Â£67,807, Â£29,965, Â£49,965 and Â£49,965. Each time the plan paid out, withdrawals of Â£500 were made ""on almost a daily basis"". By 2017, nearly all the funds had been depleted, the court heard. Between 2011 and 2017, cash withdrawals from Mrs Sansom's bank account totalled Â£226,300. Seventy-four cheques amounting to Â£55,769 were made out to Horsey and paid into her account, with Â£84,000 in unidentified cash paid into Horsey's bank account during the same period. She claimed she was paid in cash for her childminding work, but it was suggested that income was much lower than the deposits. The prosecution said: ""The level of monies taken from Iris Sansom's account went beyond legitimate living expenses for Iris Sansom or legitimate payments to Rhian Horsey. ""Rhian Horsey stole from Iris Sansom and she exploited her for her own benefit."" The jury found Horsey guilty of all seven charges of fraud and she will be sentenced on Monday.

"This video can not be played Alongside Adrian Ramsay, fellow new Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer says ""it's time for the Greens to shine"" The Green Party's new leaders have vowed to make it a powerful electoral force across England and Wales. Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay have been elected to replace Jonathan Bartley and Sian Berry. Ms Denyer said voters were increasingly seeing Greens ""can get elected"". She said the party agreed with many of the aims of Insulate Britain - thegroup staging protests on motorways- but did not ""necessarily agree"" with their tactics. The new leadership team has pledged to build on recent electoral successes and take more seats at every level, including more MPs. Jonathan Bartley to stand down as Greens co-leader A simple guide to the Green Party Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? The party currently has just one MP, Caroline Lucas, but gained 99 seats in May's local elections and became the joint largest on Bristol City Council. Ms Denyer, who is a councillor in Bristol, said: ""We increasingly are in power. The Greens are part of the administration on 14 councils in England and Wales now and in government in Scotland. ""That's a steep curve, that's improving all the time."" She said the party was the ""electoral wing"" of the Green movement, and while there was a place for ""direct action in the wider political movement"", Insulate Britain is ""not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way"". Mr Ramsay said strong voices are needed to make the case for a Green agenda, not just on the environment but a whole range of issues. ""Our country is in crisis  - pumps running out of petrol, empty shelves in supermarkets and millions heading into winter fearing rising fuel bills"" he added and Green polices would ""help prevent the next crisis"". The Greens launched their 2019 manifesto in Bristol By BBC Political Correspondent Ione Wells Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay put an emphasis in their campaign, and victory speeches, on becoming a serious electoral force. Ms Denyer has often been touted within party circles as the ""obvious next MP"" and came second in the race for the Bristol West seat in 2019. Mr Ramsay was part of the campaign team that got their only MP, Caroline Lucas, elected and has been credited with co-writing the election strategy that saw them deliver more Green councillors on more councils than ever at the English local elections in 2021. They beat a number of other candidates including deputy leader Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion. The new leadership were keen to stress that groups like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion were different from the Green Party, and they don't always support their tactics, but credited the organisations for putting climate at the ""top of the agenda"". For this pair though, winning influence through positions of power is a key aim. They hope to use current issues like rising energy bills and empty petrol pumps to demonstrate their view that the UK is too reliant on fossil fuels. Mr Ramsay said the Greens would create ""sustainable, secure jobs with decent rates of pay"" with policies to install insulation and renewable energy systems in homes, improve public transport system and prioritise sustainable food supplies. Speaking after the result was announced, Ms Denyer said both she and Mr Ramsay would ""focus on getting more Greens elected"" at every level, including more Green MPs. She said: ""It is time for the Greens to shine. ""We intend to lead this party to the electoral success we know is within our grasp"", adding: ""A better future is possible."" Mr Ramsay and Ms Denyer took 44% of the first preference votes in the leadership contest. And in the second round of voting, the new leaders secured 62% of preferences, with 6,274 votes. Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond came second with 30% of first preference votes. Ms Womack will continue to be the party's deputy leader. The election was triggered after Jonathan Bartley announced he would be standing down as party co-leader and Sian Berry decided not to seek re-election.

"Crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse says the Sarah Everard case has struck a ""devastating blow"" to public confidence in the Met Police Wayne Couzens raped and killed Sarah Everard while serving as an officer, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest - he's been handed a whole-life term The London force now faces questions over whether it missed chances to stop him, and has issued safety advice to women Victims Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Vera Bird says female victims' faith in the police has collapsed Malthouse says there is ""a job to be done"" to rebuild trust - but has rejected multiple calls for the Met Police commissioner to resign It comes as Labour calls for concrete action to reduce violence against women We're bringing our live updates to a close this evening but the website will continue to bring you the latest updateshere. This is what has happened today:  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. This live page has been edited by Holly Wallis and Chris Clayton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea and Doug Faulkner. Women have been asking how they should react if they are stopped by a lone police officer. It comes after Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens wassentenced to a whole-life prison termfor the murder of Sarah Everard. Couzens kidnapped, raped and killed Sarah after using his police ID to falsely detain her. So how can you determine is an officer is genuine and his motives legitimate? ""If someone who says they are a police officer stops you, it can be difficult to know what to do,"" says human rights barrister Adam Wagner. He says an officer arresting you should:  Officers on the streets now almost always havebody-worn video cameras,external, which are used to capture evidence when attending incidents or arresting someone. They also act as a safeguard for both the person being stopped and the officer in the event of a dispute. Find out more. North Yorkshire's police, fire and crime commissioner has beencriticised after he said women ""need to be streetwise"" about powers of arrestin the wake of Sarah Everard's murder. Speaking about the case, Conservative Philip Allott told BBC Radio York she ""never should have submitted"" to the arrest. He says women should be aware of ""when they can be arrested and when they can't be"" - pointing out that a breach of Covid guidelines - which Wayne Couzens is thought to have used to trick Ms Everard - is not an indictable offence. ""Perhaps women need to consider in terms of the legal process, to just learn a bit about that legal process,"" he said. But Lucy Arnold, from campaign group Reclaim the Streets, said his comments were ""horrifically offensive"". ""Does anyone really feel like they can stand up to a police officer?"" she said. ""I am very confident I know my rights, I know the law, but no I wouldn't feel confident at all."" The police, fire and crime commissioner has now apologised saying he wishes to retract the comments and realised they may have been offensive. This video can not be played Sarah Everard murder: Boris Johnson on police handling of rape cases The prime minister is urging the public to trust the police but he acknowledges the government needs to get to the bottom of how a serving officer could kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard. Boris Johnson says the ""snarled up"" justice system needs ""fixing"", with ""too few prosecutions"" and ""too few successful convictions"" of rape. Speaking from Downing Street this afternoon, the prime minister says there will be hundreds of thousands of police officers up and down the country who will be ""absolutely heart sick"" by what has happened in the case of Sarah Everard. He says he does believe in the police and says that they do a ""wonderful job"". But he says the government needs to get to the bottom of ""what on earth"" happened and ensure nothing like it happens again. Johnson says the whole justice system is proving a ""nightmare"" for the women concerned and needs ""speeding up"". ""There is a problem in the way we handle rape, domestic violence, sexual violence and the away we handle complaints of women and girls,"" he says. ""The problem is we have too few prosecutions for rape and too few successful convictions. We've got to fix it."" He adds he brought the Crime and Justice Taskforce together on Thursday to look at compressing the timetable between complaints and action which, he says, is ""far too long"" at the moment. You can read morehere. Women's group have called on the police ""to root out the misogyny"" instead of asking women to alter their behaviour - following suggestions over what action the public should take if they fear an officer is not acting legitimately. Refuge chief executive Ruth Davison said: ""Time and again, the Metropolitan Police have responded to incidents of gender-based violence by telling women to change their behaviour. ""Time and again, the responsibility is placed on women to protect themselves. ""This is simply not good enough. Police forces across the country must be prepared for a fundamental shift and overhaul in their attitudes towards women and root out the misogyny that is at the heart of these failings.A spokeswoman for Solace Women's Aid said: ""Any man intent on causing serious harm or murder is unlikely to stop in their tracks if asked some probing questions, even more so a police officer who is in a position of power. ""Instead of deflecting responsibility on to women and creating guidelines to moderate their behaviour to keep themselves safe, the police need to say what they are going to do to address systemic misogyny in their own ranks and to rebuild trust with women.""  Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Affairs Correspondent The Metropolitan Police has issued some extraordinary
guidance to try to reassure women. The force has said if you are approached by an officer in the
street and are worried, ask them where they have come from, why they are there,
exactly why theyâve stopped you, where their colleagues are. Ask to speak to
the operator on their radio and - in an extreme situation â consider running
away, going into a house and dialing 999. The fact that the Metropolitan Police feels it needs to issue
such unprecedented words, reminiscent of the ""Run, Hide, Tell"" counter-terrorism PR campaign, reveals the depths of the existential crisis the
force is now experiencing in the wake of the Couzensâ betrayal. Last night when reporters were at Scotland Yard, it was
clear to all of us listening to Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave that this
was a moment of absolute horror for him as a police leader. At times he was on
the verge of tears â but critics say that amid the genuine emotion they want to
see action. In 1998 the Metropolitan Police was rocked when the inquiry into
the murder of Stephen Lawrence branded the force institutionally racist. There
was shock â but also denial that there were wider problems that needed to be
fixed. For many police critics today this moment feels very, very similar. This video can not be played Sarah Everard: New CCTV footage released in case The court heard how Wayne Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. The 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Wayne Couzens (right) is believed to have shown Sarah Everard his police warrant card Wayne Couzens is believed to have been in a WhatsApp group
withfive police officers who are being investigated for gross misconduct. The officers allegedly shared ""discriminatory""
messages - including misogynistic content. Five serving officers and one former officer are under
investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for allegedly
distributing messages between March and October 2019 which were discovered
during Sarah Everard's murder investigation. Three of them, including the ex-officer, are subject to
criminal investigation for offences under Section 127 of the Communications
Act, which refers to material that is ""grossly offensive or of an
indecent, obscene or menacing character"". Three of the serving officers and the ex-officer are from
the Metropolitan Police, one is from Norfolk Constabulary, and one serves with
the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Couzens raped and murdered Ms Everard while working for the
Met, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. The London force faces questions over whether it missed
chances to stop him, and has issued safety advice to women. Sarah Everardâs murder should prompt an independent inquiry
to examine the âwider questionsâ into the systems and culture in policing, says
the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee. Yvette Cooper says âsorry is not enoughâ from the
Metropolitan Police. She told BBC News: âThey wonât be able to rebuild trust unless
they are open about the things that have gone wrong. âThat means we need an independent inquiry into this case,
into why allegations werenât followed up, into how such a dangerous man could
be a police officer for such a long time.â The Labour MP says there is âan epidemic of violence against
women and girlsâ and that the Home Office needs to instruct forces across the
country to make the issue part of the strategic policing requirement,
âalongside terrorism and some of the most serious crimes.â On guidance issued by the Metropolitan Police that anyone
stopped by a lone plain clothes officer should check their credentials she
says: âIf itâs always about advice to women and not actually about changing the
system then in the end you donât rebuild trust.â Ex-Met Ch Supt Parm Sandhu said she had been ""vilified"" after reporting an incident involving a male colleague. A former senior police officer has described the police service as""very sexist and misogynistic"". Ex-Met Ch Supt Parm Sandhu said female police officers fear reporting male colleagues as they worry they will be abandoned if they need help on duty. Ms Sandhu, who served in the Met for 30 years, told BBC Radio 4 on Thursday: ""A lot of women will not report their colleagues. ""What happens is that male police officers will then close ranks and the fear that most women police officers have got is that when you are calling for help, you press that emergency button or your radio, they're not going to turn up and you're going to get kicked in in the street. ""So you have got to be very careful which battles you can fight and which ones you can actually win."" Read more.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scotland Yard's advice suggesting ways in which members of the public can check the legitimacy of a plain-clothes officer has also been criticised by some politicians. ""This completely derisory advice shows they're still not taking it seriously,"" tweeted Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy. ""And they wonder why trust is at an all-time low?"" she added. Ruth Davidson, former leader for the Scottish Conservatives, tweeted,external: ""This is so grim. If someone believe they are in 'real and imminent danger' - **from a police officer** they've to flag down a bus or start chapping doors. Horrendous.""  Patsy Stevenson, who was arrested at the vigil for Sarah Everard in March, says the Metropolitan Police's suggestions of knocking on a door or waving a bus down are ""almost laughable if it wasn't so disgusting"". She tells the PA news agency: ""I feel like they are just clutching at straws, because the advice isn't relevant. It's like a distraction because, number one, in that situation, you can't just stop and hail down a bus or a taxi or something. ""Can you imagine the distrust that people have right now where they have to protect themselves from the police in that manner? That is shocking."" She says if someone had done something illegal it is the police giving them permission to run off, adding: ""It doesn't make any sense. They could have been enacting change for ages now, but they haven't, and they're still not doing it, they're just putting out a statement to quieten people down."" The force has advised anyone who is concerned a police officer is not acting legitimately during an interaction to ask where the officer's colleagues are; where they have come from; why they are there; and exactly why they are stopping or talking to them. Anyone could verify the police officer by asking to hear their radio operator or asking to speak to the radio operator themselves, the force says, also suggesting that people who are concerned can shout out to a passer-by, run into a house, knock on a door, wave a bus down, or call 999. Stevenson is currently involved in legal action against the Metropolitan Police over its actions at the 13 March vigil. The justice select committee chairman also suggests that misogyny could be made a hate crime, in the light of the Sarah Everard case. âMaybe we should look again at
making misogyny a hate crime,"" Sir Bob Neill tells  Radio 4's The World at One. ""We've made racism [and] racially motivated offences a
hate crime - I think there is a case for looking at misogyny.â Sir Bob Neill, the Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Justice Select Committee, also says he does not believe Dame Cressida Dick should go. ""I don't think that knee-jerk reactions and calling for resignations are the answer,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""There have been errors and the Met Police has some serious questions it needs to answer but I think that actually concentrating one one individual does not actually deal with the serious point which is the failures that clearly took place in terms of vetting of this man, the failures that took place in  incidences which took place while he was which were not called out... and also a very clear strategy from the Met and all other police forces about reassurances to young woman that a) their safety is taken properly and b) that the police will be patrolling in a way which does not give the opportunity for the sort of awful abuse."" He says there will be hundreds of really good police officers out there who will feel ""kicked in the teeth"" by Wayne Couzens' behaviour. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan gives his backing to Dame Cressida Dick as Met commissioner. He says he is confident she is the ""right person to bring about the transformation that is needed"". He adds the issue of violence against women and girls ""won't be addressed by one officer"". ""We've got to make sure the
education our boys receive school is sorted out,"" he says. ""How is it right, that girls in
school [are] having to change their behaviour, because [of] the behaviour of boys. ""Misogyny this should be a hate crime. The harassing a woman in a public place should be a criminal offence."" Khan adds it is unacceptable for police officers ""not just to be saying
things that are racist, homophobic misogynistic, but to be silent if they're
said in their presence"". He adds that policing is done by consent and says ""one of the things about this awful case is a sense of
betrayal, shock, horrible so shame, because he was a serving police officer"". Woman's Hour Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird told Woman's Hour that female victims' faith in policing has collapsed. Dame Vera, who promotes the rights of victims of crime, said while the Everard case had brought the issue of how the police handle violence against women and girls to the fore, it was not a new problem. ""We did a survey a year ago which showed that only 5% of rape complainants thought they could get justice by going to the police... so this collapse is at its worst now, but it is not a new thing."" ""There is really very little faith by women in how the police deal with violence against women and girls."" ""One has to look at the real problem that, probably, inate sexism runs through the police, probably, more deeply than it runs through society."" Dame Vera said, by nature, policing remained ""very male"", adding: ""There is no critical mass of female officers to change the culture.""  An MP and former police officer says Metropolitan Police
chief Cressida Dick âshould be considering her positionâ. Wendy Chamberlain, Liberal Democrat MP North East Fife, says
the force needs to regain trust and Dick is ânot the right person to take that
work forwardâ. She says she feels âalmost a sense of shameâ that trust in
the police has been âsignificantly erodedâ. She says in her experience as a police officer there was a ""canteen culture,
the way of dealing with the stresses, yes I think could be described as
misogynistic in nature"". âAnd clearly if that hasnât changed in the 10 years since I
served it remains a huge issue for the police service particularly when it
comes to tackling violence against women and girls."" She says the Met Policeâs pledge to put more officers on the
street and advice on checking the credentials of lone plain clothes officers âsounds
fairly knee jerk to meâ. Following the sentencing of Wayne Couzens yesterday - policing minister Kit Malthouse has told the BBC ""officers up and down the land recognise the devastating consequences of this event"". ""There is a job to be done to rebuild trust by the police, particularly, I have to say, in London,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Couzens, a serving police officer in the Met, was handed a whole life sentence on Thursday for the kidnap, rape and murder of 33-year-old Sarah Everard, meaning he will never be freed from jail. He abducted her in south London by staging a fake arrest. The Met is facing questions as to how Couzens was able to get a job with the police, despite allegations made against him earlier in his career. It has prompted a wider debate over whether police vetting rules are strict enough. Mr Malthouse told BBC Breakfast: ""One of the lessons that we will need to learn is the allegations that were made against him - where those investigations led to, why they did not pop up on his vetting or have any impact in his employment with the Metropolitan Police. ""That is currently under investigation.""  CCTV footage played in court showed Couzens and Ms Everard beside a vehicle on Poynders Road in Clapham It was only during the sentencing of Wayne Couzens that the full details of his crimes emerged. Couzens' choice of victim was random, but the attack was planned. In his sentencing remarks, Lord Justice Fulford said there had been ""significant planning and premeditation"" by Couzens. The police officer had ""long planned to carry out a violent sexual assault on a yet-to-be-selected victim"" who he intended to coerce into his custody, noted the judge. Couzens spent at least a month travelling to London from Deal, Kent, where he lived, to research how best to carry out his crimes. The BBC's Becky Morton detailswhat Couzens did and how events unfolded on the night Sarah died. Leroy Logan, a former Met Police officer and a founding
member of the Black Police Association, tells BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that the number of sexual offences committed by officers is increasing. He says it shows that both the vetting process is not being
done properly and the force is attracting the wrong people. ""The supervisors - the sergeants and inspectors - what are
they doing? Are they being complicit by their silence or are they somehow
closing ranks?"" He adds that he believes Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick ""has to go"". ""We need a new fresh change to take the Met Police and the other constabularies to the future because at the moment it is going horribly wrong."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Women have been asking how they should react if they are stopped by a lone police officer. It comes after Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens was jailed for using his police ID to kidnap, rape and murder 33-year-old Sarah Everard. The laws are different inScotland,externalandNorthern Ireland,external, so most of this information only applies to England and Wales. Campaigners stress the onus should not be on women to keep themselves safe. Instead, they say the focus should be on tackling violence against women and rebuilding trust in police. Jess Phillips, shadow domestic violence and safeguarding minister, says ""it is not women who need advice"". She saysshe would have got into Wayne Couzens' car - ""almost anybody would"". But if you are stopped by someone claiming to be an officer and something doesn't feel right, what can you do? Former Met Police chief superintendent Parm Sandhu urges people to ""ask for help if you need it"". She says if you're stopped by someone who is alone, in plain clothes and an unmarked car, phone 999 to check who they are. If you can't phone anyone, and you're scared, scream and draw attention to yourself, she says. If they ask you to get into their car, ask them to call for a marked police vehicle or insist they call another officer, she adds. Calling the police station they say they belong to, or 101 to check their warrant card and identity, is a good idea says Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street Chambers. He also suggests calling a family member or friend (or lawyer if you know one) to let them know what is happening. The Met Police says if you are alone with an officer and no others arrive, ask ""searching questions"", such as ""where are your colleagues?"". If they have a radio, ask to hear the voice of the operator and ask them to verify you're with a genuine officer, it says. However, Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, says it is ""absurd"" for police to advise women to challenge officers - as this fails to recognise the power imbalance in the relationship. She says this will be ""felt most by women from black, minority ethnic and migrant communities who commonly experience over-policing"". Officers always carry identification and can be asked for proof. This is usually a warrant card. These can differ from force to force buttypically include,externalthe officer's photograph, name, identity number, the name of the force and a security hologram - although they won't necessarily have all of these. Police in Brent, north-west London, shared an image of a Met Police warrant card back in 2018. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A police community support officer (PCSO)must wear uniform,externalwhen they stop and question you. Police officers don't always wear uniforms. But they must show you their warrant card, especially if they are in plain clothes. It would be highly unusual for a plain-clothes officer to be working alone, the College of Policing says. If they are, it is standard practice that they should call other officers who should arrive soon afterwards. After Couzens' sentencing, the Met Police saidit would no longer deploy plain-clothes officers on their own- although there would be ""occasions"" when that was not possible. A police officer or PCSO can ask questions about who you are, where you are going and what you are doing. This is under ""stop and account"" powers,according to human rights organisation Liberty.,external In most cases you have the right to refuse to answer and can walk away andthis can't be used as the sole reason to search or arrest you.,external However, Liberty advises that if officers have reason to believe you're involved in anti-social behaviour, you must give your name and address - as it is a criminal offence not to. Police can also stop you under separate ""stop and search"" powers. These allow officers to search an individual if they have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect you are carrying illegal drugs, a weapon, stolen property or something which could be used to commit a crime. Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief How a police officer covered up Sarah Everard's murder To arrest you,police need reasonable grounds to suspect you're involved in a crime for which your arrest is necessary,external. If you're arrested, the officer must: identify himself or herself as police tell you that you're being arrested and what crime they think you've committed explain why it's necessary to arrest you explain to you that you're not free to leave ""If someone who says they are a police officer stops you, it can be difficult to know what to do,"" says Adam Wagner. If you are being arrested on your own in a secluded location or at night, you could offer to give the officer your details and ask to attend a police station the next day instead, he suggests. Officers on the streets now almost always havebody-worn video cameras,external, which are used to capture evidence when attending incidents or arresting someone. They act as a safeguard for both the person being stopped and the officer in the event of a dispute. Officers are expected to intervene if they see someone committing an offence or there is another need to protect the public - even when off duty. An officer can exercise most of their powers all the time,external- and as soon as they do so they are classed as being on duty. If an officer is not wearing uniform they should show their warrant card when they stop and question you.

"Wayne Couzens (right) is believed to have shown Sarah Everard his police warrant card Wayne Couzens is believed to have been in a WhatsApp group with five police officers who are being investigated for gross misconduct. The officers allegedly shared ""discriminatory"" messages - including misogynistic content. Couzens raped and murdered Sarah Everard while working for the Met, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. The London force faces questions over whether it missed chances to stop him, and has issued safety advice to women. Five serving officers and one former officer are under investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for allegedly distributing messages between March and October 2019 which were discovered during Ms Everard's murder investigation. Three of them, including the ex-officer, are subject to criminal investigation for offences under Section 127 of the Communications Act, which refers to material that is ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character"". Couzens is understood not to be one of those under investigation, but was involved in sharing messages. Sources have told the BBC that investigating Couzens would not further the interests of justice in these circumstances. Three of the serving officers and the ex-officer are from the Metropolitan Police, one is from Norfolk Constabulary, and one serves with the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. What should you do if you are stopped by police? I would have got into Couzens' car - Jess Phillips Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Couzens, 48, targeted Ms Everard, 33, on a street in south London in March, showing a warrant card and using handcuffs. He has beensentenced to a whole-life prison term. He had been linked to two previous allegations of indecent exposure. Policing minister Kit Malthouse said ""officers up and down the land recognise the devastating consequences of this event"". ""There is a job to be done to rebuild trust by the police, particularly, I have to say, in London,"" he told BBC Breakfast. This video can not be played Policing minister Kit Malthouse says if in doubt ""ask the police officer to identify themselves"" Police must prioritise tackling violence on women How a police officer covered up Sarah Everard's murder Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick faces calls to resign over the force's handling of the case, as Home Secretary Priti Patel said it raised ""serious questions"". Speaking outside the Old Bailey after Couzens was sentenced, Dame Cressida said ""a precious bond of trust has been damaged"" andshe would ensure ""any lessons"" were learned. As part of renewed efforts to ease fears in the capital, the Met will step-up ""reassurance patrols"" and treat indecent exposure allegations more seriously. An extra 650 new officers will patrol busy public areas in London. The body of Sarah Everard was found hidden in woodland Scotland Yard admitted the case was part of a ""much bigger and troubling picture"". The force advised people detained by a lone plain-clothes officer to ask ""searching questions"" such as why they are being stopped, where the officer's colleagues are and where the officer has come from. The force said that, to verify the answers, people should ask to speak to an operator on a police radio to determine if the officer is genuine and acting legitimately. It added that it understood people may be ""more distrusting"" as a result of the case. In the event someone believes they are in ""real and imminent danger"" the Met advised they ""must seek assistance - shouting out to a passer-by, running into a house, knocking on a door, waving a bus down or if you are in the position to do so calling 999"". The Met explained officers are expected to intervene when required, even when off duty, and that they routinely carry warrant cards and sometimes equipment when travelling. Speaking to the London Assembly, Met Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House, said plain-clothes officers will not be deployed on their own and will be in pairs. But he warned there would be occasions when that is not possible given off-duty officers not in uniform ""put themselves on duty"" when they come across an incident. This video can not be played Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says the force has been ""shamed"" and ""rocked"" by the case Couzens, who had been a police officer since 2002, transferred to the Met in 2018 from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. He passed vetting checks. Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave admitted a vetting check on Couzens was not done correctly when he joined the Met. It meant a link to an incident of indecent exposure in Kent in 2015, involving a vehicle linked to Couzens, was missed. Though Mr Ephgrave said that even if it had come up in the vetting process, it would not have changed the outcome as Couzens was not named as a suspect. Around 72 hours before Ms Everard's abduction, Met Police officersreceived a separate allegationof indecent exposure which also identified the vehicle involved, registered to Couzens. He was sacked by the Met in July after pleading guilty to Ms Everard's murder. Measures including a pilot scheme where plain-clothes officerspatrol pubs and clubswere launched in England and Wales in the immediate aftermath of Ms Everard's murder.

"Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has said he ""regrets any inconvenience caused"" by problems with Scotland's Covid vaccine passport app. Many people have said they wereunable to get  their vaccination statusthrough the app when the scheme came into effect on Friday. Mr Yousaf said he hoped the issues would be fixed ""in a matter of hours, but it may be a matter of days"". Aberdeen FC has announced it willpostpone introducing the new scheme. The club had been due to spot check fans before its game against Celtic on Sunday, but said ""unanswered questions on implementation"" of vaccine passports had forced the postponement. Spot checks will be carried out as a trial run at Hearts' stadium on Saturday but no fans will be refused entry for the match with Motherwell. Rangers has also said the match with Hibs on Sunday at Ibrox will be used as a ""test event"" and no supporters will be refused entry due to vaccine status. The new rules came into effect at 05:00 on Friday - but the government announced earlier this week that they would not actually be enforced until 18 October. What do we know about Scotland's vaccine passport? Judge refuses to delay vaccine passport scheme Public 'not ready' for vaccine passport scheme The NHS Scotland Covid Status app only became available to download onApple,externalandAndroid,externaldevices at about 17:30 on Thursday. Opposition parties have described the rollout as a ""shambles"", and questioned why the government had launched the app when it did not work. The Scottish government said that by the end of Thursday more than 70,000 people had downloaded the app, which is used to show proof that people have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events. It said it had since increased the capacity of the NHS systems that sit behind the app. Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland: ""I know it is frustrating because a lot of people have downloaded the app. ""I regret any inconvenience caused to anybody, be it an individual or business, but that shouldn't stop you from going about your activities over the course of the next few days. ""Largely, the issues are down to volume of traffic but what I would say if you're having persistent problems do feel free to call the Covid helpline."" Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said ""there's no reason you should be turned away from an event this weekend"" if you don't have the app working as legal enforcement for the scheme has not started He added: ""We always stress test these things before they go live and we have done so but actually, once it goes live, in the real world there can be these glitches and my hope is those glitches should be resolved - we hope in a matter of hours, but it may be a matter of days."" The vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds. Venues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance. Many people experienced problems with the app when they tried to use their NHS CHI number to register. This step comes after users are asked to take a picture of their passport or driving licence. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there should be an ""indefinite delay"" to the rollout of the new scheme to avoid a ""weekend of chaos"" at venues across the country. He added: ""Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend. ""This plan should really be scrapped altogether but, if the SNP insist on charging ahead, they must indefinitely delay the vaccine passport scheme until the most basic issues are ironed out."" Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said the launch of the app had been a ""complete shambles"", adding: ""It is typical of the SNP to rush this out when it clearly doesn't work."" Many people reported problems registering with the scheme on Friday People have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app. Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the app as the ""worst I have ever tried to use"". He wrote on Twitter: ""I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise. ""And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral. ""But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use."" Another app usershared screenshots,externalof his experience on Twitter during which he was told ""no match found"" followed by: ""Something went wrong. We're working on it."" Others reported issues getting past the initial log in page, while aBBC Good Morning Scotlandlistener told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success. He added: ""It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place."" Mike Rhodes, of the IT firm ConsultMyApp, said he thought the servers being used for the app were being overloaded because of demand, but said this should have been anticipated. He said: ""It is highly likely that those developers that built the app shell also built the interface to the back-end servers that ended up failing. ""Secondly, this wasn't an unforeseen event - the developers absolutely knew this would be downloaded incredibly quickly and was likely to get hundreds of thousands of people attempting to register at the same time."" Mr Rhodes questioned why there was ""so little time"" between the app being launched and it being needed for entry into events. Paul Banham, of Glasgow's Buff Club, toldBBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live: ""We'll be having a look at them over the next few weeks but we won't be refusing entry if someone doesn't have it - there's too many glitches at the moment. ""We've had a lot of students contact us and a lot of them are saying they have been vaccinated in other areas of the UK and that is not showing on their Covid status so there's a few gaps at the moment and hopefully they will be ironed out.""

"The RAC motoring group has said the fuel shortage problem continues to ease, although many areas of the UK are still suffering supply issues. Smaller fuel stations were still facing major supply issues as drivers fill up for the weekend, the RAC said. Earlier, BP said problems at its stations caused by a shortage of HGV drivers was starting to improve. It comes as one of the big fuel delivery firms, Hoyer Petrolog, confirmed it was training army drivers. The RAC said that on Thursday its patrol vehicles dealt with nearly five times the number of out-of-fuel breakdowns than was typical. However, that was down on the 13-times it dealt with on Monday. Mr Williams said: While the fuel delivery situation continues to improve in many areas, that's sadly not the case right across the country. ""Those drivers that rely on independent forecourts, especially where there aren't any supermarkets selling fuel, may still be struggling to fill up."" BPwas the first company to warnit had to close some petrol stations due to a shortage of drivers, which has worsened due to Covid and Brexit. But the company said on Friday the situation was ""stabilising"". A big fuel delivery supplier to BP forecourts and other outlets, Hoyer, confirmed to the BBC it was training army drivers over the last two days. Hoyer, which delivers to about 25% of the UK's petrol stations, was not able to confirm how many army personnel were being trained nor when they would start work. However, the army drivers will use a mix of Hoyer and military vehicles to make deliveries, the company said. The UK has been grappling with a fuel crisis that has caused huge queues outside some petrol stations, and forced customers to drive round multiple sites in search of supplies. BP said the situation had started to improve over the last few days, adding it was ""working flat out"" to keep sites across the country supplied. BP closes some sites due to lorry driver shortage No improvement in fuel supplies, say retailers UK visa plan will not fix lorry crisis, says boss While the government and retailers say there is enough fuel at UK refineries, a shortage of drivers has slowed the transport of fuel to petrol stations. The haulage industry says an existing shortage of lorry drivers has been made worse by a number of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit, an ageing workforce, low wages and poor working conditions. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, policing minister Kit Malthouse said: ""My latest briefing is that the situation is stabilising, that we are seeing more forecourts with a greater supply of fuel and hopefully that, as demand and supply come better into balance over the next few days, week or so, that we will see a return to normality."" He added that if the situation started to deteriorate again, Prime Minister Boris Johnson would review matters. However, Labour leader Kier Starmer said it was time for ""emergency action"" as the ""chaos"" looked set to continue. He said: ""We're going to see this driver shortage problem coming back again in different sectors. ""By the government's own admission, their scheme won't be up and running for weeks with the first HGV drivers not on the roads until November. This simply isn't good enough."" He called for the use of the military to get petrol to areas of the country in most need, and for fuel stations with supplies to extend opening hours for NHS shift staff and other key workers. ""Normally a tanker would last three to four days, but now it's selling out in 12 hours,"" says Danyal Shoaib, who runs a petrol station near Leatherhead, in Surrey. In the last week he says they've run dry three times. ""I think social media has played a massive part. As soon as anyone sees a tanker, they stick it online and the queues develop all the way down the road,"" he says. Mr Shoaib says he's been surprised by the abuse he and his colleagues have faced from ""a significant minority"" of customers. ""A man tried to bypass the queue and when I politely asked him to join the end, he tried to drive his car into me to get me to move,"" he says. After he asked the man to calm down, he was then subjected to abusive language including ""quite obscene racial slurs"", he adds. Despite this, Mr Shoaib says they've had ""loads of lovely messages"" thanking them, and seen huge relief on people's faces when they can fill up. At his petrol station, he says demand remains high: ""What we're saying to people is, if you can, please be reasonable. If you can make do with half a tank or three quarters of a tank, please do that."" The BBC understands that demand at supermarkets Asda and Morrisons is also easing, continuing a trend seen throughout the week. A Morrisons spokesperson said: ""It is a rapidly moving situation and we are working hard with our suppliers to ensure we can continue to keep our pumps open and serve our customers."" Sainsbury's, which has more than 300 sites in total, said that it was still experiencing high demand for fuel. ""We're working closely with our supplier to maintain supply and all our sites continue to receive fuel,"" a spokesperson said. Tesco added: ""We have good availability of fuel, and we're working really hard to ensure regular deliveries to our petrol filling stations across the UK every day."" The firm operates 500 petrol stations, with another 200 managed by Esso with a Tesco Express store on-site. An Esso spokesman told the BBC that a number of its Tesco Alliance sites were affected. ""The picture is constantly changing, but the situation at the 200 Esso Tesco Alliance sites is stabilising and continues to improve in terms of fuel availability,"" they said. Like a car running low on petrol, the situation at the pumps seems to have slowed and possibly stalled. Fuel demand is still far from normal and the picture is very patchy. While there are hopeful noises from some areas of the industry that fuel is getting through, those who are selling it are still seeing queues, particularly in London and the south east. The situation is not as bad as last weekend, but it still isn't over. The messaging could be tricky for the government. Tell everyone the crisis is solved before it dies down, and ministers risk losing the public's trust. The question now is what will reassure the public to go back to normal buying? The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,300 petrol stations It said on Friday there had been little change for its members who are independent fuel retailers. Its survey of 1,100 sites across the UK found that 26% had neither petrol nor diesel in stock, down slightly from 27% on Thursday. Gordon Balmer, its executive director, said: ""Whilst the situation is similar to recent days, there are signs it is improving, but far too slowly. ""Independents, which total 65% of the entire network, are not receiving enough deliveries of fuel compared with other sectors."" Mr Balmer said he believed queues were likely until independent retailers started getting more frequent deliveries. In an attempt to limit disruption, the government has confirmed that 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers can receive temporary UK visas, with the scheme ending on Christmas Eve. A temporary relaxation on drivers' hours has also been extended,externaluntil 31 October. This allows the daily driving limit to be increased from nine hours to 10 hours up to four times in a week. A government spokesperson said it had taken ""immediate action"" to increase the supply of HGV drivers and relieve the pressure on petrol stations. ""We recognise the challenges facing industry and streamlined the testing process in July to boost the number of drivers,"" they said, adding that it was important people continued to buy fuel as normal.

"Jeremy Stansfield co-hosted the BBC's Bang Goes The Theory from 2009-14 A TV presenter who was hurt while playing the role of a human crash test dummy has been awarded Â£1.6m in damages after a High Court battle with the BBC. Jeremy Stansfield, 50, said he suffered spine and brain injuries while filming a 2013 episode of science show Bang Goes The Theory, resulting in more than Â£3m of lost future earnings. Mrs Justice Yip ruled the effect of the injuries was ""to derail the claimant's successful career in television"". The BBC disputed Mr Stansfield's claim. The injuries happened when Mr Stansfield, who was 42 at the time, filmed a Bang Goes The Theory feature about the relative safety of forward and rear-facing child car seats. The episode saw him ""strapped into a rig like a go-cart which was propelled along a track into a post"". In the segment, Mr Stansfield explained he had calculated the experiment to give a similar crash profile to hitting a lamppost in a real car in an urban environment. The crashes were performed forwards and backwards twice each. Mr Stansfield said he had been left with a ""constellation of symptoms"", leading to a significant decline in his health. Mrs Justice Yip ruled that the ""combined effect"" of Mr Stansfield's physical injuries and his psychological reaction to the crash test had caused him ""significant impairment"" and restricted ""his enjoyment of life"". Before the crash tests, Mr Stansfield had been an ""exceptionally fit"" man, the judge said. A BBC physical assessment for a 2012 project involving a human powered aircraft, which he had designed himself as a former engineer, suggested he was performing at the level of a competitive athlete. Jeremy ""Jem"" Stansfield with Bang Goes The Theory co-hosts Liz Bonnin and Maggie Philbin in 2013 Mrs Justice Yip said: ""I must say that I find it astonishing that anyone thought that this exercise was a sensible idea. ""On his own account to camera, the claimant was simulating a road traffic collision of the sort that commonly causes injury. ""It might be thought that someone of his intelligence and scientific background might have appreciated the risk."" The judgement was not assessing liability, but the extent of Mr Stansfield's injuries and the damages owed. The judgement said the BBC argued that ""little more than a moderate whiplash injury with depressive symptoms"" could properly be attributed to the crash tests, so only modest damages should be awarded. She said there was also evidence the BBC actively sought advice and had been warned of the danger yet still allowed the experiment to proceed. The BBC has agreed to share responsibility and loss of earnings, the ruling said. Mr Stansfield had originally claimed almost Â£4m in damages. A BBC spokesman said: ""We take the health and wellbeing of everyone who works for the BBC extremely seriously. ""We keep safety measures on set under constant review and we made adjustments following the incident in 2013. ""We acknowledge the court's judgment in this complex case and wish Mr Stansfield the best for the future."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"JD Wetherspoon has reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. It posted a Â£154.7m loss as sales fell sharply in the year to 25 July, after a Â£34.1m loss a year earlier. Wetherspoon's chairman Tim Martin criticised the ""use of lockdowns and draconian restrictions"". Although the firm suggested that there were signs of recovery since restrictions eased, it is struggling to recruit staff in some areas. The pub chain said that like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new pub openings, were just 8.7% lower in the last nine weeks than in the same period before the pandemic. Sales at its airport sites though, have struggled, it said. Restaurants warn prices will rise due to VAT hike Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? Pubs and restaurants counting on Christmas cheer Overall, revenues generated through pints, meals and soft drinks fell by 38.8% from a year earlier to Â£772.6m. But in an update to investors, Mr Martin said that he felt hopeful for the future. ""Pubs have been at the forefront of business closures during the pandemic, at great cost to the industry - but at even greater cost to the Treasury. ""In spite of these obstacles, Wetherspoon is cautiously optimistic about the outcome for the financial year, on the basis that there is no further resort to lockdowns"". As Covid-related restrictions have eased, the firm has been looking to fill vacancies for pub staff and managers and make the most of the economic recovery. It said overall it had received a ""reasonable"" number of applications for jobs. But in some areas of the country, ""especially 'staycation' areas in the West Country and elsewhere"", it has been harder to draw people in, the company said. Its total number of employees, who are mostly staff paid per hour, increased from an average of 29,025 for the financial year to 42,003 in the week to 20 September 2021. The wider hospitality industry has been struggling with recruitment in recent months. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, the number ofvacancies in the three months to August rose above one millionfor the first time since records began in 2001. Many of those vacancies were for jobs in pubs, restaurants and cafes trying to keep up with demand as customers return. Experts have said that staff may feel cautious about returning to work after the pandemic, as well as facing child-care issues. Recent labour shortages have also been exacerbated by some workers returning to the European Union after the UK's exit from the trade bloc. The firm was also recently affected bya shortage of some beer brandscaused by driver shortages due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. At the time, Mr Martin, a prominent Brexit supporter, was criticised on social media, although the firm said it was ""heart-breaking to be letting any customer down"" after such a difficult time for the hospitality sector. On Friday, it called on government to make a VAT cut that was introduced for pubs and restaurants during the Covid crisis permanent. It had lowered the prices of some items on its food menu and soft drinks as a result. A rise in VAT rates from 5% to 12.5% takes effect on Friday and has beencriticised as ""badly timed"" for business. ""If the chancellor decides to make these VAT reductions permanent, the company intends to retain lower prices indefinitely,"" Wetherspoon said. Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor, said: ""JD Wetherspoon finally began recovering from the turmoil the pandemic and Covid restrictions had put it through, to be greeted with a supply chain hangover and staff shortages."" She pointed out that affordability had always been the brand's selling point, but that the chain might have to rethink that strategy as supply chain issues and rising costs hit.

"Restaurant owner Salima Vellani, said many businesses in the sector were already ""hanging by a thread"" Restaurants and pubs are warning that prices will go up due to a rise in VAT rates, which takes effect from Friday. Owners said the increase from 5% to 12.5% was badly timed, with one restaurant chain owner saying businesses were already ""hanging by a thread"". Trade bodies have called for a halt to any further rises in VAT, to help the industry recover from the pandemic. The government said hospitality had received ""extensive support"". VAT - the tax paid when buying goods or services - has been levied at a reduced rate in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses since July 2020 to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The sales tax won't return to its pre-pandemic rate of 20% until April 2022. However, Salima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, told the BBC she was ""extremely concerned"" about the increase to 12.5%, which she said was a blow to the hospitality industry. ""It's just one thing after the other that we are being hit by,"" said the chief executive, who runs five chicken restaurants across the country. ""We are all hanging on by a thread. We are going to have to put prices up."" What is VAT and how does it work? Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the 5% rate was designed to ""get the sectors moving and to protect jobs"". The hospitality and tourism sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, with many venues closed altogether during lockdowns, and then catering to limited numbers due to social distancing measures. Now staff shortages are preventing some making the most of the recovery. David Moore, the founder of Michelin-star restaurant Pied Ã  Terre, said he had already told one customer who had a Â£95 voucher for a 10-course menu, that their meal would now cost Â£105. He said the government ""could not have picked a worse time"" to implement the VAT increase, with his business having to cope with rising import, energy and staffing costs. ""It just does not feel like life is back to anywhere near like normal,"" he added. ""We just have so many price rises across the board. The utilities are horrendous. The VAT [rise] is not something I can absorb. Every single supplier has increased prices. ""It's not just vegetables, or just meat, everything is more expensive than it was two years ago."" His restaurant was also currently ""massively understaffed"" he said, sometimes meaning table numbers had to be reduced at peak times. Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? What's in short supply and why? What impact has the furlough scheme had? For Sue Whiston, finance and operations director at Kuula Poke, a Hawaiian restaurant in Birmingham, the VAT increase was ""premature"". She believes the 5% rate should have been extended for another six months. She said shipping costs to source Kuula Poke's produce, from countries such as Japan, China and Thailand, had ""shot through the roof"". Sue Whiston says her costs are ""through the roof"" ""Mango is something that we buy in hundreds of kilograms at a time, (it) has suddenly overnight increased by 20%,"" she said. ""We have had problems with food availability. ""Only this week along our main Japanese wholesaler has turned around and said to us they can't make any deliveries to us this week because of the shortage of diesel fuel. ""So right now we are  in this perfect storm of inflationary pressure and VAT is about to go up. She expects prices for diners to rise across the sector. Rob Pitcher, the chief executive of Revolution, predicts there will be further price increases next spring when the VAT rate increases to 20%. The boss of the bar chain, which has 66 venues and employs about 3,000 staff, said businesses could not afford to take on the extra cost, and so it would be passed on to the customer. ""The consumer is going to end up paying twice,"" he said. Trade bodies, including UK Hospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, and Tourism Alliance have called on the government to make the 12.5% VAT rate permanent, rather than increasing the rate again in the spring, to safeguard the future of businesses and protect jobs. In a joint statement, they said returning VAT back to 20% would have ""serious consequences"", with six in 10 businesses noting in a survey that it would ""likely lead to cutbacks and job losses"". Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said keeping the VAT rate at 12.5% would be the ""most effective"" move by the government to ""secure a more rapid recovery and rebuild resilience faster"". But a Treasury spokesman said the government had ""always been clear"" that lower VAT rates were a ""temporary measure to support businesses as they recover from the pandemic"". ""The hospitality sector has benefited from extensive support throughout the pandemic through our Â£400bn Plan for Jobs, with the furlough scheme, grants, tax cuts and deferrals,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Listen to the words from the victim statement of Sarah Everard's mother, Susan, as voiced by an actor The family of Sarah Everard confronted her murderer in court and laid bare their loss and anguish. These are their victim impact statements in full. The following accounts contain details which readers may find distressing. Sarah is gone and I am broken-hearted. She was my precious little girl, our youngest child. The feeling of loss is so great it is visceral. And with the sorrow come waves of panic at not being able to see her again. I can never talk to her, never hold her again, and never more be a part of her life. We have kept her dressing gown - it still smells of her and I hug that instead of her. Sarah died in horrendous circumstances. I am tormented at the thought of what she endured. I play it out in my mind. I go through the terrible sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger; I wonder what her murderer said to her. When he strangled her, for how long was she conscious, knowing she would die? It is torture to think of it. Sarah was handcuffed, unable to defend herself, and there was no one to rescue her. She spent her last hours on this earth with the very worst of humanity. She lost her life because Wayne Couzens wanted to satisfy his perverted desires. It is a ridiculous reason, it is nonsensical. How could he value a human life so cheaply? I cannot comprehend it. I am incandescent with rage at the thought of it. He treated my daughter as if she was nothing and disposed of her as if she was rubbish. If Sarah had died because of an illness, she would have been cared for. We could have looked after her and been with her. If she had died because of an accident, people would have tried to help - there would have been kindness. But there is no comfort to be had, there is no consoling thought in the way Sarah died. In her last hours she was faced with brutality and terror, alone with someone intent on doing her harm. The thought of it is unbearable. I am haunted by the horror of it. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Couzens handcuffed Sarah Everard in false arrest When Sarah went missing we suffered days of agony, not knowing where she was or what had happened to her. Then, when Sarah's burnt remains were found, we spent two terrible days waiting for tests to show how she had died, fearing she had been set alight before she was dead - the thought was appalling. Burning her body was the final insult, it meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye. Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled. I yearn for her. I remember all the lovely things about her. She was caring, she was funny. She was clever, but she was good at practical things too. She was a beautiful dancer. She was a wonderful daughter. She was always there to listen, to advise, or simply to share with the minutiae of the day. And she was also a strongly principled young woman who knew right from wrong and who lived by those values. She was a good person. She had purpose to her life. My outlook on life has changed since Sarah died. I am more cautious, I worry more about our other children. I crave the familiarity and security of home - the wider world has lost its appeal. It is too painful to contemplate a future without Sarah, so I just live in the here and now. I think of Sarah all the time, but the mornings and evenings are particularly painful. In the morning I wake up to the awful reality that Sarah is gone. In the evenings, at the time she was abducted, I let out a silent scream: Don't get in the car, Sarah. Don't believe him. Run! I am repulsed by the thought of Wayne Couzens and what he did to Sarah. I am outraged that he masqueraded as a policeman in order to get what he wanted. Sarah wanted to get married and have children - now all that has gone. He took her life and stole her future and we will never have the joy of sharing that future with her. Each day dawns and I think Sarah should be here, leading her life and embracing new experiences. She had so many years ahead of her. I don't know how anyone could be so cruel as to take my daughter's life. What I do know is that Sarah will never be forgotten and is remembered with boundless love. I cling on to memories of Sarah, I hold them tight to keep them safe. The other night, I dreamt that Sarah appeared at home. In my dream I held her and could feel her physically. Jeremy was there, we were comforting her, saying: 'It's all right Sarah, it's all right'. I would give anything to hold her once more. I hope I dream that dream again. There's a photograph of my beautiful daughter on the screen. She had a beautiful mind too. Mr Couzens, please, will you look at me? The impact of what you have done will never end. The horrendous murder of my daughter, Sarah, is in my mind all the time and will be for the rest of my life. A father wants to look after his children and fix everything, and you have deliberately and with premeditation stopped my ability to do that. Sarah was handcuffed and unable to defend herself. This preys on my mind all the time. I can never forgive you for what you have done, for taking Sarah away from us. You burnt our daughter's body â you further tortured us â so that we could not see her again. We did not know whether you had burnt her alive or dead. You stopped us seeing Sarah for one last time and stopped me from giving my daughter one last kiss goodbye. Jeremy Everard (left), Sarah's father, said no punishment could compare to the family's pain and torture Her body fell apart when she was moved. Her brain and neck bones were removed for months by the pathologist and her body was difficult to preserve so we had to use the services of a specialist embalmer to enable a dignified burial. All my family want is Sarah back with us. No punishment that you receive will ever compare to the pain and torture that you have inflicted on us. You murdered our daughter and forever broke the hearts of her mother, father, brother, sister, family and her friends. Sarah had so much to look forward to and because of you this is now gone forever. She was saving to buy a house and looking forward to marriage and children. We were looking forward to having grandchildren. We loved being a part of Sarah's world and expected her to have a full and happy life. The closest we can get to her now is to visit her grave every day You treated Sarah as if she was nothing. Placed more emphasis on satisfying your sick disgusting perversions than on a life. Her life. You disposed of my sister's body like it was rubbish. Fly-tipped her like she meant nothing. She meant everything. We couldn't even see her, she was so badly burnt. Her brain was removed from her skull to check for trauma and cause of death - I still don't know if they put her brain back in her head or whether it is lying next to her body in her coffin. Shards of her kneecap were returned to us to be placed with her body - shards that you knocked when moving her burnt body from the fridge you had used to hide her and conceal the fire. We are still missing her hyoid bone from her throat, which is being checked to see the force you used to strangle her, to determine how long she may have survived. We know it was broken. Her burnt body still had her necklace and one earring in her ear. The other had fallen from her ear because it had burnt off. You hear from the police that it takes around two minutes to strangle someone, and around eight to ten seconds for them to lose consciousness. At first there is a sense of relief at hearing that your sister might only have been aware of what was happening for eight to 10 seconds. But have you put your hands around your neck and tried pushing hard? Eight to 10 seconds now seems a long time. You used your warrant card to trick my sister into your car. She sat in a car, handcuffed, for hours. What could she have thought she had done wrong? What lies did you tell her? When did she realise that she wasn't going to survive the night? I'm constantly replaying in my head - did you rape her, then kill her? Did you kill her while raping her? You get small nuggets of information and the thought process starts again. Your semen and blood were found in your car. So this suggests you raped her in the car. You find out you may have used a belt to strangle her. New horrendous images forming. You stopped to get a Lucozade and water at a petrol station. Was she still alive at this point? Bound in your car? I am horrified by your ability to flit between what you did and normal, everyday actions. Your casual demeanour on CCTV was very upsetting and shocking to see. Family members repeatedly asked killer Wayne Couzens to look at them as he hung his head in the dock We had to go to the flat and pack up Sarah's whole life - washing left hanging up, half-sewn outfits, deliveries waiting to be returned, packages waiting at the door ready to be opened. All signs of a life waiting to be lived, chores to be done, ready for her to return and continue when she got home. But she never got home because a predator - you - was on the loose. Prowling the streets for hours looking for his prey. You can't comprehend what you are being told when it happened because it is so horrific. Some sort of sick waking nightmare. You can't imagine anyone could do such a thing. You are waiting to hear anything from the police. Every bit you get is different. You hear her body has been found. Then you find out she has been burnt. So badly burnt you can't see her. Can't see her again to say goodbye. The first thought you have in your head after despair and shock is - was she dead before you burnt her? Imagine that even having to be a thought. You find out no soot was found in her lungs, which suggests she was burnt after you murdered her. Imagine being relieved to hear your sister was dead before she was burnt. I replay it continuously round in my head. What you may have said to her, what she may have said back, when she realised she was in grave danger and was not going to survive. Hoping my sister was unconscious and drugged, but we know that was not the case - no drugs found in her body, no trauma to the head. Burst blood vessels in her brain from your strangulation, which meant she was conscious when you were doing these unfathomable things to her. My only hope is that she was in a state of shock and that she wasn't aware of the disgusting things being done to her by a monster. When you forced yourself upon and raped her. When you put your hands around her neck and strangled her. It disgusts me that you were the last person to touch her perfect body, and violate her in the way you did. The last person to see her alive and speak to her. How scared she must have been. The last moments of her life not with loved ones, but frightened and fighting for her life. I hate to think of her being so scared and alone and that in her last moments she had no one with her. No kindness. I hate that I wasn't there to save her. To stop you. I find it hard to believe she is not just living her own life and sick at the thought that her last moments on this earth alive were so horrific. How dare you take her from me? Take away her hopes and dreams. Her life. Children that will never be born. Generations that will never exist. Her future no longer exists. The future I was supposed to live with my sister no longer exists. You have ruined so many lives. Sarah is the very best person, with so many people who love and cherish her. I want to speak to her and hug her and hear her laugh and go out for dinners and drinks and dancing. All those conversations we can never have. There were so many things I wanted to share with her - trips abroad, being each other's bridesmaids, meeting her babies and being an auntie, growing old together and seeing who got the most wrinkles. We weren't even halfway through our journey and you took it all away. I feel like I live in a make-believe world, as if nothing is real. I have to pretend because the thought of not having Sarah forever is too hard to bear. A lifetime now seems a very long time. I should never have to write a eulogy for or bury my little sister. There is no punishment that you could receive that will ever compare to the pain you have caused us. We can never get Sarah back. The last moments of Sarah's life play on my mind constantly. I am so disgusted and appalled. It terrifies me that you have such disregard for a person's life. You have taken from me the most precious person. And I can never get her back.

"""Alcohol is a great deceiver,"" says Kathleen Edge ""In two days I would get through a litre of vodka and four bottles of wine. Easily. ""I knew it was wrong. I knew it was too much."" Before the pandemic Kathleen Edge from Newport, south Wales, had what she described as a healthy relationship with alcohol. Like many people she started to drink a bit more when the stress, strain and boredom of lockdown started to take hold. And that relationship turned sour. 'He drinks six bottles of wine a day' Is my lockdown drinking normal? 'School was my only escape from mum's drinking' ""It got to the middle of December and my friend came over to bring a delivery up, and it had got to the point where I could not walk any moreâ¦ if I wanted to get between the bed and the sofa it was virtually crawling,"" she says. ""And I knew something was wrong. I said to him 'please just take the booze away - it is killing me'. ""I probably owe him my life. He told me I looked dreadful and that he would not leave until I had got help. Until I had got an ambulance."" Kathleen was taken by ambulance to the Grange University Hospital where she met a liver specialist It was at this point the seriousness of the situation really started to hit. ""They had to carry me out. It was very humiliating,"" Kathleen says. ""And I'm thinking 'you've got yourself into this position, there is Covid going on and you're calling an ambulance and this is really selfish'. But I needed an ambulance."" Kathleen went to the new Grange University Hospital near Cwmbran where she says she was lucky to see the liver specialist the next day. ""He said to me 'I think you have something to tell me. You need to say it out loud'. ""And I looked at him and said 'I'm an alcoholic'. That was the first time I had said it out loud and it was very freeing."" The town trying nights out without the booze Could non-alcoholic gin ever be as good as the real thing? Lime and soda? No thanks, say non-drinkers There are fears there could be more people out there like Kathleen who have not yet come forward to get help. Figures from the Kaleidoscope Project, which works on drug and alcohol abuse, suggest an eight percentage point drop year-on-year in the number of people who have problems with alcohol being referred by doctors or other health professionals. In the year to April 2021, 293 people were referred compared with 467 the year before. Self-referrals are down by more than four percentage points. Support services are now waiting to see what happens - hoping for the best and prepared for the worst. This video can not be played Nikki, a recovering alcoholic, describes how she stopped drinking during the pandemic. Rondine Molinaro from the Gwent Drug and Alcohol Service draws parallels between the pandemic and another cataclysmic event, which surprisingly, perhaps does give some hope. ""If you look at the example of American soldiers returning from the Vietnam War in the 1970s, all the drugs services in the US were set up for and prepared for these large cohorts of servicemen who had become addicted to opiates and heroin in Vietnam, continuing their dependency on their return,"" she said. Alcohol dependent mums-to-be urged to seek help Six charts on how the British drink The students opting for booze-free halls at university ""But that did not happen. I think 20% of the American troops were addicted to heroin in Vietnam, but as soon as they came back and their environment changed and those stresses had disappeared only 1% of those soldiers continued with a heroin dependency. ""Hopefully that's the same pattern that we will see, but we are prepared and we are waiting to see what happens over the next 12 months."" Support workers have noticed people from different backgrounds needing help for addiction The service has also noticed a subtle change in the type of person seeking support during the Covid crisis. Rondine explained: ""We are definitely seeing more professional people coming in - they have jobs and they have incomes. ""Our alcohol liaison officer interviewed two gentlemen, who because of the pandemic had been put on furlough. They had income coming in, but no productive activity and no work to go to. Alcohol deaths hit record high during pandemic Shoppers stock up on alcohol amid pub shutdown 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' ""They started to drink and became dependent on alcohol but did not know they were dependent on alcohol and actually ended up in A&E."" The Welsh government says it invests Â£55m every year on substance misuse. In 2020-21 a further Â£4.8m was also made available to support the response to Covid. This video can not be played Musician Nick Davis was in alcohol recovery when lockdown started and has had to find new ways to stay sober Kathleen is now living with the long-term effects that alcohol has had on her body. The damage to her liver caused severe swelling to her legs and she now has to walk with a stick. But she says she is determined to seize her second chance. ""Alcohol is a great deceiver,"" she said. ""It is your best friend, it makes you feel fantastic, it makes you feel good, but it is almost as if alcoholism is grooming you and it can blow up in your face. ""It is all in my hands now. I make the decisions. I have been incredibly lucky. I want to get to the point where we do not talk about it any more. I don't drink and that's that.""

"This video can not be played Alongside Adrian Ramsay, fellow new Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer says ""it's time for the Greens to shine"" The Green Party's new leaders have vowed to make it a powerful electoral force across England and Wales. Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay have been elected to replace Jonathan Bartley and Sian Berry. Ms Denyer said voters were increasingly seeing Greens ""can get elected"". She said the party agreed with many of the aims of Insulate Britain - thegroup staging protests on motorways- but did not ""necessarily agree"" with their tactics. The new leadership team has pledged to build on recent electoral successes and take more seats at every level, including more MPs. Jonathan Bartley to stand down as Greens co-leader A simple guide to the Green Party Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? The party currently has just one MP, Caroline Lucas, but gained 99 seats in May's local elections and became the joint largest on Bristol City Council. Ms Denyer, who is a councillor in Bristol, said: ""We increasingly are in power. The Greens are part of the administration on 14 councils in England and Wales now and in government in Scotland. ""That's a steep curve, that's improving all the time."" She said the party was the ""electoral wing"" of the Green movement, and while there was a place for ""direct action in the wider political movement"", Insulate Britain is ""not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way"". Mr Ramsay said strong voices are needed to make the case for a Green agenda, not just on the environment but a whole range of issues. ""Our country is in crisis  - pumps running out of petrol, empty shelves in supermarkets and millions heading into winter fearing rising fuel bills"" he added and Green polices would ""help prevent the next crisis"". The Greens launched their 2019 manifesto in Bristol By BBC Political Correspondent Ione Wells Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay put an emphasis in their campaign, and victory speeches, on becoming a serious electoral force. Ms Denyer has often been touted within party circles as the ""obvious next MP"" and came second in the race for the Bristol West seat in 2019. Mr Ramsay was part of the campaign team that got their only MP, Caroline Lucas, elected and has been credited with co-writing the election strategy that saw them deliver more Green councillors on more councils than ever at the English local elections in 2021. They beat a number of other candidates including deputy leader Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion. The new leadership were keen to stress that groups like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion were different from the Green Party, and they don't always support their tactics, but credited the organisations for putting climate at the ""top of the agenda"". For this pair though, winning influence through positions of power is a key aim. They hope to use current issues like rising energy bills and empty petrol pumps to demonstrate their view that the UK is too reliant on fossil fuels. Mr Ramsay said the Greens would create ""sustainable, secure jobs with decent rates of pay"" with policies to install insulation and renewable energy systems in homes, improve public transport system and prioritise sustainable food supplies. Speaking after the result was announced, Ms Denyer said both she and Mr Ramsay would ""focus on getting more Greens elected"" at every level, including more Green MPs. She said: ""It is time for the Greens to shine. ""We intend to lead this party to the electoral success we know is within our grasp"", adding: ""A better future is possible."" Mr Ramsay and Ms Denyer took 44% of the first preference votes in the leadership contest. And in the second round of voting, the new leaders secured 62% of preferences, with 6,274 votes. Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond came second with 30% of first preference votes. Ms Womack will continue to be the party's deputy leader. The election was triggered after Jonathan Bartley announced he would be standing down as party co-leader and Sian Berry decided not to seek re-election.

"A squeeze on household finances will become more acute as a new, higher energy price cap takes effect. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, will see bills go up by Â£139 to  Â£1,277 a year, but the more energy a household uses, the higher their bill will be. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use will see a Â£153 increase. The cap has come under the spotlight owing to the crisis among suppliers, which has seen nine firms fold. Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap? Three more energy firms go bust amid gas price rise The cap limits how much providers can raise prices. Even so, the current increase is the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. It represents a 12% rise in energy prices at a time of the year when, charities point out, people are about to use more heating and lighting during colder, darker days. It also coincides with other price rises hitting family budgets and the withdrawal of Covid support schemes, although the government has promised to continuefinancial help for the poorest households. About 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland are affected by the changes. The cap does not apply in Northern Irelandwhere prices are overseen by a regulator. The regulator Ofgem sets a price cap for domestic energy twice a year. The latest level kicked in on 1 October. It is a cap on the price of energy and charges that suppliers can levy. A household's total bill is still determined by how much gas and electricity is used. The latest change means: Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, will see an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year - to their bill People with prepayment meters, with average energy use, will see an annual increase of Â£153 - from Â£1,156 to Â£1,309 Households with larger than average energy use will have a higher annual bill Households on fixed tariffs will be unaffected, but those coming to the end of a contract are automatically moved to a default tariff set at the new level. In the past customers have been able to shop around for cheaper deals, but currently, they won't find anything cheaper, due to the high price of gas. Adam Scorer, from fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said: ""The massive devastating increases in energy prices will drive over 500,000 more households into fuel poverty, leaving them unable to heat or power their homes."" Debbie Wright is about to move into her first flat, but said rising energy bills, as well as lower benefits payments, were detracting from the excitement of her potential independence. ""It's scary - you can't afford to live day by day,"" she said. ""Where is the extra money coming from?"" She was taking part in a life skills class run by charity Christians Against Poverty. All of those in the class used prepayment meters and were in receipt of food parcels. ""We are seeing all sorts of people in debt,"" said life skills manager Shirley Bowen. Shirley Bowen says people will be making tough choices this winter ""There have always been people that struggle to manage their finances and I don't think that will ever change. As soon as there is any expense that they don't expect, it knocks them off and they have to cry out for help. ""It is just going to spiral. It is obvious that there will be people who do not put the heating on this winter. Whether or not they will be able to cook for their kids, it will just be sandwiches and cereal, we will have to just wait and see."" Usually, the introduction of more expensive energy bills is accompanied with advice to consumers on standard tariffs to switch to a cheaper deal. The current crisis in the sector means that, this time, there is no availability of better offers. A tariff set at the price cap limit is the most competitive available. Instead, residents are being encouraged to save money by looking at the energy efficiency of their homes. The Energy Saving Trust said that the price rise could be more than outstripped by changes to our homes and habits. Mr Scorer, from National Energy Action, said: ""We can't lose sight of the long-term solution to reduce the energy waste in our homes. We have some of the least efficient housing in Europe. ""This has left the UK more exposed to the current soaring gas price than many other countries and we are wasting billions of pounds each year as heat escapes through leaky roofs, floors and ceilings."" The new cap was decided in August and is designed to reflect the unavoidable costs faced by energy suppliers. This came slightly ahead of a massive jump in wholesale gas prices which has led tothe collapse of nine suppliers in recent weeks. They have been unable to keep to the price promises they made to their customers, and were uninsured against the increasing costs. Avro Energy, for example, confirmed on Friday that it had fallen into administration. Its customers will be transferred to Octopus Energy, while its 103 staff will be kept on for at least the short-term to help with the change. The tariffs that will be charged for the 1.7 million customers moving to new suppliers after their previous provider collapsed are being set at the same level as the new price cap. Senior executives of bigger suppliers have argued that the price cap is making the situation worse. They say they are shouldering billions of pounds in additional costs by providing customers with energy that costs more to buy than they are allowed to sell it for under the retail price cap. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It costs around Â£600 to take on a new customer at the moment because of the astonishing price of gas in the market and that's the main issue."" She added that more energy suppliers were expected to fail given the current ""volatile"" gas market. Firms have criticised Ofgem, claiming that it should have known many smaller suppliers would not be resilient in the face of gas price rises. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, rejected the criticism, saying that nobody could have predicted the huge rise in the cost of wholesale gas. He accepted that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills in the future. Ofgem will decide the level of the next price cap - which analysts predict to be considerably higher - in February, before it takes effect at the start of April. A spokeswoman for the regulator said: ""We are doing all we can to make sure consumers, especially people in vulnerable circumstances, do not pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter. ""Higher energy costs are never welcome news to anyone and the timing and size of this increase will be particularly difficult for many families still struggling with the impact of the pandemic. Anyone struggling to pay their energy bills should get in touch with their supplier to access the help that is available."" Have you been told that your energy bills will increase?

"Crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse says the Sarah Everard case has struck a ""devastating blow"" to public confidence in the Met Police Wayne Couzens raped and killed Sarah Everard while serving as an officer, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest - he's been handed a whole-life term The London force now faces questions over whether it missed chances to stop him, and has issued safety advice to women Victims Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Vera Bird says female victims' faith in the police has collapsed Malthouse says there is ""a job to be done"" to rebuild trust - but has rejected multiple calls for the Met Police commissioner to resign It comes as Labour calls for concrete action to reduce violence against women We're bringing our live updates to a close this evening but the website will continue to bring you the latest updateshere. This is what has happened today:  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. This live page has been edited by Holly Wallis and Chris Clayton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea and Doug Faulkner. Women have been asking how they should react if they are stopped by a lone police officer. It comes after Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens wassentenced to a whole-life prison termfor the murder of Sarah Everard. Couzens kidnapped, raped and killed Sarah after using his police ID to falsely detain her. So how can you determine is an officer is genuine and his motives legitimate? ""If someone who says they are a police officer stops you, it can be difficult to know what to do,"" says human rights barrister Adam Wagner. He says an officer arresting you should:  Officers on the streets now almost always havebody-worn video cameras,external, which are used to capture evidence when attending incidents or arresting someone. They also act as a safeguard for both the person being stopped and the officer in the event of a dispute. Find out more. North Yorkshire's police, fire and crime commissioner has beencriticised after he said women ""need to be streetwise"" about powers of arrestin the wake of Sarah Everard's murder. Speaking about the case, Conservative Philip Allott told BBC Radio York she ""never should have submitted"" to the arrest. He says women should be aware of ""when they can be arrested and when they can't be"" - pointing out that a breach of Covid guidelines - which Wayne Couzens is thought to have used to trick Ms Everard - is not an indictable offence. ""Perhaps women need to consider in terms of the legal process, to just learn a bit about that legal process,"" he said. But Lucy Arnold, from campaign group Reclaim the Streets, said his comments were ""horrifically offensive"". ""Does anyone really feel like they can stand up to a police officer?"" she said. ""I am very confident I know my rights, I know the law, but no I wouldn't feel confident at all."" The police, fire and crime commissioner has now apologised saying he wishes to retract the comments and realised they may have been offensive. This video can not be played Sarah Everard murder: Boris Johnson on police handling of rape cases The prime minister is urging the public to trust the police but he acknowledges the government needs to get to the bottom of how a serving officer could kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard. Boris Johnson says the ""snarled up"" justice system needs ""fixing"", with ""too few prosecutions"" and ""too few successful convictions"" of rape. Speaking from Downing Street this afternoon, the prime minister says there will be hundreds of thousands of police officers up and down the country who will be ""absolutely heart sick"" by what has happened in the case of Sarah Everard. He says he does believe in the police and says that they do a ""wonderful job"". But he says the government needs to get to the bottom of ""what on earth"" happened and ensure nothing like it happens again. Johnson says the whole justice system is proving a ""nightmare"" for the women concerned and needs ""speeding up"". ""There is a problem in the way we handle rape, domestic violence, sexual violence and the away we handle complaints of women and girls,"" he says. ""The problem is we have too few prosecutions for rape and too few successful convictions. We've got to fix it."" He adds he brought the Crime and Justice Taskforce together on Thursday to look at compressing the timetable between complaints and action which, he says, is ""far too long"" at the moment.

Women's group have called on the police ""to root out the misogyny"" instead of asking women to alter their behaviour - following suggestions over what action the public should take if they fear an officer is not acting legitimately. Refuge chief executive Ruth Davison said: ""Time and again, the Metropolitan Police have responded to incidents of gender-based violence by telling women to change their behaviour. ""Time and again, the responsibility is placed on women to protect themselves. ""This is simply not good enough. Police forces across the country must be prepared for a fundamental shift and overhaul in their attitudes towards women and root out the misogyny that is at the heart of these failings.A spokeswoman for Solace Women's Aid said: ""Any man intent on causing serious harm or murder is unlikely to stop in their tracks if asked some probing questions, even more so a police officer who is in a position of power. ""Instead of deflecting responsibility on to women and creating guidelines to moderate their behaviour to keep themselves safe, the police need to say what they are going to do to address systemic misogyny in their own ranks and to rebuild trust with women.""  Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Affairs Correspondent The Metropolitan Police has issued some extraordinary
guidance to try to reassure women. The force has said if you are approached by an officer in the
street and are worried, ask them where they have come from, why they are there,
exactly why theyâve stopped you, where their colleagues are. Ask to speak to
the operator on their radio and - in an extreme situation â consider running
away, going into a house and dialing 999. The fact that the Metropolitan Police feels it needs to issue
such unprecedented words, reminiscent of the ""Run, Hide, Tell"" counter-terrorism PR campaign, reveals the depths of the existential crisis the
force is now experiencing in the wake of the Couzensâ betrayal. Last night when reporters were at Scotland Yard, it was
clear to all of us listening to Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave that this
was a moment of absolute horror for him as a police leader. At times he was on
the verge of tears â but critics say that amid the genuine emotion they want to
see action. In 1998 the Metropolitan Police was rocked when the inquiry into
the murder of Stephen Lawrence branded the force institutionally racist. There
was shock â but also denial that there were wider problems that needed to be
fixed. For many police critics today this moment feels very, very similar. This video can not be played Sarah Everard: New CCTV footage released in case The court heard how Wayne Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. The 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Wayne Couzens (right) is believed to have shown Sarah Everard his police warrant card Wayne Couzens is believed to have been in a WhatsApp group
withfive police officers who are being investigated for gross misconduct. The officers allegedly shared ""discriminatory""
messages - including misogynistic content. Five serving officers and one former officer are under
investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for allegedly
distributing messages between March and October 2019 which were discovered
during Sarah Everard's murder investigation. Three of them, including the ex-officer, are subject to
criminal investigation for offences under Section 127 of the Communications
Act, which refers to material that is ""grossly offensive or of an
indecent, obscene or menacing character"". Three of the serving officers and the ex-officer are from
the Metropolitan Police, one is from Norfolk Constabulary, and one serves with
the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Couzens raped and murdered Ms Everard while working for the
Met, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. The London force faces questions over whether it missed
chances to stop him, and has issued safety advice to women. Sarah Everardâs murder should prompt an independent inquiry
to examine the âwider questionsâ into the systems and culture in policing, says
the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee. Yvette Cooper says âsorry is not enoughâ from the
Metropolitan Police. She told BBC News: âThey wonât be able to rebuild trust unless
they are open about the things that have gone wrong. âThat means we need an independent inquiry into this case,
into why allegations werenât followed up, into how such a dangerous man could
be a police officer for such a long time.â The Labour MP says there is âan epidemic of violence against
women and girlsâ and that the Home Office needs to instruct forces across the
country to make the issue part of the strategic policing requirement,
âalongside terrorism and some of the most serious crimes.â On guidance issued by the Metropolitan Police that anyone
stopped by a lone plain clothes officer should check their credentials she
says: âIf itâs always about advice to women and not actually about changing the
system then in the end you donât rebuild trust.â Ex-Met Ch Supt Parm Sandhu said she had been ""vilified"" after reporting an incident involving a male colleague. A former senior police officer has described the police service as""very sexist and misogynistic"". Ex-Met Ch Supt Parm Sandhu said female police officers fear reporting male colleagues as they worry they will be abandoned if they need help on duty. Ms Sandhu, who served in the Met for 30 years, told BBC Radio 4 on Thursday: ""A lot of women will not report their colleagues. ""What happens is that male police officers will then close ranks and the fear that most women police officers have got is that when you are calling for help, you press that emergency button or your radio, they're not going to turn up and you're going to get kicked in in the street.

She tells the PA news agency: ""I feel like they are just clutching at straws, because the advice isn't relevant. It's like a distraction because, number one, in that situation, you can't just stop and hail down a bus or a taxi or something. ""Can you imagine the distrust that people have right now where they have to protect themselves from the police in that manner? That is shocking."" She says if someone had done something illegal it is the police giving them permission to run off, adding: ""It doesn't make any sense. They could have been enacting change for ages now, but they haven't, and they're still not doing it, they're just putting out a statement to quieten people down."" The force has advised anyone who is concerned a police officer is not acting legitimately during an interaction to ask where the officer's colleagues are; where they have come from; why they are there; and exactly why they are stopping or talking to them. Anyone could verify the police officer by asking to hear their radio operator or asking to speak to the radio operator themselves, the force says, also suggesting that people who are concerned can shout out to a passer-by, run into a house, knock on a door, wave a bus down, or call 999.

He abducted her in south London by staging a fake arrest. The Met is facing questions as to how Couzens was able to get a job with the police, despite allegations made against him earlier in his career. It has prompted a wider debate over whether police vetting rules are strict enough. Mr Malthouse told BBC Breakfast: ""One of the lessons that we will need to learn is the allegations that were made against him - where those investigations led to, why they did not pop up on his vetting or have any impact in his employment with the Metropolitan Police.

"A Yorkshire farmer has killed hundreds of piglets because labour shortages in local abattoirs mean adult pigs are not being killed fast enough. The resulting backlog means there is less space left on farms for younger pigs, which are cheaper and easier to kill. The farmer had been ""destroyed by it"", according to a friend. ""He had to kill perfectly healthy, viable piglets,"" she told BBC News. According to the National Pig Association (NPA), this may well not be the only case of farmers killing healthy livestock as mature pigs have continued to ""back up"" on farms. The labour shortages are being blamed on Brexit and the Covid pandemic. Hauliers and poultry workers to get temporary visas Turkey farmers warn of shortage due to Brexit Before that, about 80% of staff in two major processing centres in Hull came from Eastern Europe, according to the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA). Nick Allen, from the BMPA, said the workforce in large abattoirs would normally be 10-15% above average ahead of Christmas, but instead it is 15% down. Because centres are unable to process pigs at the usual rate, live animals are mounting up on farms and some farmers were ""quietly starting to cull"", he said. Once a pig gets too big, its butchered processed carcass will no longer fit into supermarket packets so retailers do not want to buy it from farmers. ""The main barrier is labour, with the change in the immigration policy.  We are struggling to get butchers in particular, and it limits how fast you can run the plant,"" Mr Allen added. ""We were offering higher wages, but with the job market at the moment, it's not worked. We do need access to some non-UK labour."" Similar labour shortages among lorry drivers and poultry workers led the government to introduce temporary visas to try to limit disruption in the run-up to Christmas, but this concession was not extended to the pig-meat industry. The Yorkshire farmer's friend, who did not want to be identified, told the BBC: ""It's desperate. I've been producing for 26 years, and never faced the prospect of having to butcher pigs on my own farm before"". These pigs are five months old; they should have been sent to an abattoir but there is no capacity to process the animals. Meryl Ward who runs a family farm in Lincolnshire has 1,600 pigs that should already have gone to slaughter. She has been farming for 35 years and says the current crisis is the worst she has encountered. A humane cull, which is being discussed, would see prime healthy pigs being ""rendered"" for cheap products like lard or pet food, and farmers are unlikely to be compensated for their losses. Parallels are being drawn to the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis, where pyres of cows burned across the countryside. She added: ""Producers are in despair... we can't just waste this food. It's criminal."" She said temporary work visas were needed, like those recently issued for HGV drivers and poultry workers. ""It's such a massive national problem, it needs action and leadership from government. ""If they really care about farm animal welfare, if they really believe in UK animal production and the standards that we have are worth saving, we need some action,"" she urged. A Defra spokesperson said the government was ""keeping the market under close review"" and continuing to ""work closely with the sector to explore options to address the pressures"" that the industry was currently facing. The National Pig Association is urging retailers to back British producers, rather than to buy imported produce. Supermarket chain Lidl described the backlogs as ""alleged"", adding it was ""committed to"" sourcing 100% of its fresh pork from British farmers. Sainsbury's said all its fresh pork was British but that it ""may source bacon and continental meats from the EU to meet demand."" Tesco said it was ""working closely"" with suppliers to make sure supply chains were protected to ""provide availability"" for its shoppers. Aldi said its ""core range"" of meat was ""100% British and Red Tractor assured.""

"Crime and policing minister Kit Malthouse says the Sarah Everard case has struck a ""devastating blow"" to public confidence in the Met Police Wayne Couzens raped and killed Sarah Everard while serving as an officer, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest - he's been handed a whole-life term The London force now faces questions over whether it missed chances to stop him, and has issued safety advice to women Victims Commissioner for England and Wales Dame Vera Bird says female victims' faith in the police has collapsed Malthouse says there is ""a job to be done"" to rebuild trust - but has rejected multiple calls for the Met Police commissioner to resign It comes as Labour calls for concrete action to reduce violence against women We're bringing our live updates to a close this evening but the website will continue to bring you the latest updateshere. This is what has happened today:  Thank you for joining us this afternoon. This live page has been edited by Holly Wallis and Chris Clayton and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea and Doug Faulkner. Women have been asking how they should react if they are stopped by a lone police officer. It comes after Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens wassentenced to a whole-life prison termfor the murder of Sarah Everard. Couzens kidnapped, raped and killed Sarah after using his police ID to falsely detain her. So how can you determine is an officer is genuine and his motives legitimate? ""If someone who says they are a police officer stops you, it can be difficult to know what to do,"" says human rights barrister Adam Wagner. He says an officer arresting you should:  Officers on the streets now almost always havebody-worn video cameras,external, which are used to capture evidence when attending incidents or arresting someone. They also act as a safeguard for both the person being stopped and the officer in the event of a dispute. Find out more. North Yorkshire's police, fire and crime commissioner has beencriticised after he said women ""need to be streetwise"" about powers of arrestin the wake of Sarah Everard's murder. Speaking about the case, Conservative Philip Allott told BBC Radio York she ""never should have submitted"" to the arrest. He says women should be aware of ""when they can be arrested and when they can't be"" - pointing out that a breach of Covid guidelines - which Wayne Couzens is thought to have used to trick Ms Everard - is not an indictable offence. ""Perhaps women need to consider in terms of the legal process, to just learn a bit about that legal process,"" he said. But Lucy Arnold, from campaign group Reclaim the Streets, said his comments were ""horrifically offensive"". ""Does anyone really feel like they can stand up to a police officer?"" she said. ""I am very confident I know my rights, I know the law, but no I wouldn't feel confident at all."" The police, fire and crime commissioner has now apologised saying he wishes to retract the comments and realised they may have been offensive. This video can not be played Sarah Everard murder: Boris Johnson on police handling of rape cases The prime minister is urging the public to trust the police but he acknowledges the government needs to get to the bottom of how a serving officer could kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard. Boris Johnson says the ""snarled up"" justice system needs ""fixing"", with ""too few prosecutions"" and ""too few successful convictions"" of rape. Speaking from Downing Street this afternoon, the prime minister says there will be hundreds of thousands of police officers up and down the country who will be ""absolutely heart sick"" by what has happened in the case of Sarah Everard. He says he does believe in the police and says that they do a ""wonderful job"". But he says the government needs to get to the bottom of ""what on earth"" happened and ensure nothing like it happens again. Johnson says the whole justice system is proving a ""nightmare"" for the women concerned and needs ""speeding up"". ""There is a problem in the way we handle rape, domestic violence, sexual violence and the away we handle complaints of women and girls,"" he says. ""The problem is we have too few prosecutions for rape and too few successful convictions. We've got to fix it."" He adds he brought the Crime and Justice Taskforce together on Thursday to look at compressing the timetable between complaints and action which, he says, is ""far too long"" at the moment.

Women's group have called on the police ""to root out the misogyny"" instead of asking women to alter their behaviour - following suggestions over what action the public should take if they fear an officer is not acting legitimately. Refuge chief executive Ruth Davison said: ""Time and again, the Metropolitan Police have responded to incidents of gender-based violence by telling women to change their behaviour. ""Time and again, the responsibility is placed on women to protect themselves. ""This is simply not good enough. Police forces across the country must be prepared for a fundamental shift and overhaul in their attitudes towards women and root out the misogyny that is at the heart of these failings.A spokeswoman for Solace Women's Aid said: ""Any man intent on causing serious harm or murder is unlikely to stop in their tracks if asked some probing questions, even more so a police officer who is in a position of power. ""Instead of deflecting responsibility on to women and creating guidelines to moderate their behaviour to keep themselves safe, the police need to say what they are going to do to address systemic misogyny in their own ranks and to rebuild trust with women.""  Dominic CascianiHome and Legal Affairs Correspondent The Metropolitan Police has issued some extraordinary
guidance to try to reassure women. The force has said if you are approached by an officer in the
street and are worried, ask them where they have come from, why they are there,
exactly why theyâve stopped you, where their colleagues are. Ask to speak to
the operator on their radio and - in an extreme situation â consider running
away, going into a house and dialing 999. The fact that the Metropolitan Police feels it needs to issue
such unprecedented words, reminiscent of the ""Run, Hide, Tell"" counter-terrorism PR campaign, reveals the depths of the existential crisis the
force is now experiencing in the wake of the Couzensâ betrayal. Last night when reporters were at Scotland Yard, it was
clear to all of us listening to Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave that this
was a moment of absolute horror for him as a police leader. At times he was on
the verge of tears â but critics say that amid the genuine emotion they want to
see action. In 1998 the Metropolitan Police was rocked when the inquiry into
the murder of Stephen Lawrence branded the force institutionally racist. There
was shock â but also denial that there were wider problems that needed to be
fixed. For many police critics today this moment feels very, very similar. This video can not be played Sarah Everard: New CCTV footage released in case The court heard how Wayne Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. The 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Wayne Couzens (right) is believed to have shown Sarah Everard his police warrant card Wayne Couzens is believed to have been in a WhatsApp group
withfive police officers who are being investigated for gross misconduct. The officers allegedly shared ""discriminatory""
messages - including misogynistic content. Five serving officers and one former officer are under
investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) for allegedly
distributing messages between March and October 2019 which were discovered
during Sarah Everard's murder investigation. Three of them, including the ex-officer, are subject to
criminal investigation for offences under Section 127 of the Communications
Act, which refers to material that is ""grossly offensive or of an
indecent, obscene or menacing character"". Three of the serving officers and the ex-officer are from
the Metropolitan Police, one is from Norfolk Constabulary, and one serves with
the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Couzens raped and murdered Ms Everard while working for the
Met, after kidnapping her in a fake arrest. The London force faces questions over whether it missed
chances to stop him, and has issued safety advice to women. Sarah Everardâs murder should prompt an independent inquiry
to examine the âwider questionsâ into the systems and culture in policing, says
the chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee. Yvette Cooper says âsorry is not enoughâ from the
Metropolitan Police. She told BBC News: âThey wonât be able to rebuild trust unless
they are open about the things that have gone wrong. âThat means we need an independent inquiry into this case,
into why allegations werenât followed up, into how such a dangerous man could
be a police officer for such a long time.â The Labour MP says there is âan epidemic of violence against
women and girlsâ and that the Home Office needs to instruct forces across the
country to make the issue part of the strategic policing requirement,
âalongside terrorism and some of the most serious crimes.â On guidance issued by the Metropolitan Police that anyone
stopped by a lone plain clothes officer should check their credentials she
says: âIf itâs always about advice to women and not actually about changing the
system then in the end you donât rebuild trust.â Ex-Met Ch Supt Parm Sandhu said she had been ""vilified"" after reporting an incident involving a male colleague. A former senior police officer has described the police service as""very sexist and misogynistic"".

"Restaurant owner Salima Vellani, said many businesses in the sector were already ""hanging by a thread"" Restaurants and pubs are warning that prices will go up due to a rise in VAT rates, which takes effect from Friday. Owners said the increase from 5% to 12.5% was badly timed, with one restaurant chain owner saying businesses were already ""hanging by a thread"". Trade bodies have called for a halt to any further rises in VAT, to help the industry recover from the pandemic. The government said hospitality had received ""extensive support"". VAT - the tax paid when buying goods or services - has been levied at a reduced rate in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses since July 2020 to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The sales tax won't return to its pre-pandemic rate of 20% until April 2022. However, Salima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, told the BBC she was ""extremely concerned"" about the increase to 12.5%, which she said was a blow to the hospitality industry. ""It's just one thing after the other that we are being hit by,"" said the chief executive, who runs five chicken restaurants across the country. ""We are all hanging on by a thread. We are going to have to put prices up."" What is VAT and how does it work? Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the 5% rate was designed to ""get the sectors moving and to protect jobs"". The hospitality and tourism sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, with many venues closed altogether during lockdowns, and then catering to limited numbers due to social distancing measures. Now staff shortages are preventing some making the most of the recovery. David Moore, the founder of Michelin-star restaurant Pied Ã  Terre, said he had already told one customer who had a Â£95 voucher for a 10-course menu, that their meal would now cost Â£105. He said the government ""could not have picked a worse time"" to implement the VAT increase, with his business having to cope with rising import, energy and staffing costs. ""It just does not feel like life is back to anywhere near like normal,"" he added. ""We just have so many price rises across the board. The utilities are horrendous. The VAT [rise] is not something I can absorb. Every single supplier has increased prices. ""It's not just vegetables, or just meat, everything is more expensive than it was two years ago."" His restaurant was also currently ""massively understaffed"" he said, sometimes meaning table numbers had to be reduced at peak times. Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? What's in short supply and why? What impact has the furlough scheme had? For Sue Whiston, finance and operations director at Kuula Poke, a Hawaiian restaurant in Birmingham, the VAT increase was ""premature"". She believes the 5% rate should have been extended for another six months. She said shipping costs to source Kuula Poke's produce, from countries such as Japan, China and Thailand, had ""shot through the roof"". Sue Whiston says her costs are ""through the roof"" ""Mango is something that we buy in hundreds of kilograms at a time, (it) has suddenly overnight increased by 20%,"" she said. ""We have had problems with food availability. ""Only this week along our main Japanese wholesaler has turned around and said to us they can't make any deliveries to us this week because of the shortage of diesel fuel. ""So right now we are  in this perfect storm of inflationary pressure and VAT is about to go up. She expects prices for diners to rise across the sector. Rob Pitcher, the chief executive of Revolution, predicts there will be further price increases next spring when the VAT rate increases to 20%. The boss of the bar chain, which has 66 venues and employs about 3,000 staff, said businesses could not afford to take on the extra cost, and so it would be passed on to the customer. ""The consumer is going to end up paying twice,"" he said. Trade bodies, including UK Hospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, and Tourism Alliance have called on the government to make the 12.5% VAT rate permanent, rather than increasing the rate again in the spring, to safeguard the future of businesses and protect jobs. In a joint statement, they said returning VAT back to 20% would have ""serious consequences"", with six in 10 businesses noting in a survey that it would ""likely lead to cutbacks and job losses"". Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said keeping the VAT rate at 12.5% would be the ""most effective"" move by the government to ""secure a more rapid recovery and rebuild resilience faster"". But a Treasury spokesman said the government had ""always been clear"" that lower VAT rates were a ""temporary measure to support businesses as they recover from the pandemic"". ""The hospitality sector has benefited from extensive support throughout the pandemic through our Â£400bn Plan for Jobs, with the furlough scheme, grants, tax cuts and deferrals,"" he added.

The Scottish Conservatives are calling for the nation's vaccine passport scheme to be delayed after users were hit with technical issues. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross says there should be a postponement to avoid what a ""weekend of chaos"" as the certification is set to be used for access to large events and nightclubs. ""Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend,"" he says. ""At an incredibly challenging time, businesses will lose out if this app is still not working."" He says the plan should be scrapped altogether but that if the SNP insists on going through with it there should be a delay until the ""most basic issues"" are ironed out. Estimates
from the Office for National Statistics survey suggest that just under 840,000 people in the UK
would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week ending 25 September, up
from about 820,000 people last week. This
is 1.2% of the population â or one in 80 people â the same as
reported last week. The ONS
says the trend for estimated Covid-19 infections in England and Wales increased
in the week to 25 September. Estimated infections were âuncertainâ in
Northern Ireland and decreased in Scotland. In other Covid-related film news, Walt Disney and Scarlett Johansson have settled a legal dispute over the release of the Marvel superhero movie Black Widow. Johansson sued Disney two months ago, accusing it of breaching her contract when it offered the movie on its Disney+ streaming service while it was still showing in cinemas - a move prompted by the pandemic. She said the decision meant that she was deprived of potential earnings. Black Widow, which debuted simultaneously on 9 July in cinemas and via Disney+, set a box office record for a release during the coronavirus pandemic in its first weekend, grossing $218m (Â£161m), but box office receipts then fell sharply. During the pandemic several big Hollywood studios opted to bypass cinemas, many of which had been closed, and release films online instead. Now that most cinemas have reopened, Disney, along with fellow giant Warner Bros, has chosen to maintain a dual release strategy for their major films. Details of the deal between Disney and Johansson have not been disclosed but both parties say they are pleased that the matter has been resolved andlook forward to future collaborations. Lashana Lynch, Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux attended the film's world premiere on Tuesday Daniel Craig's final James Bond film made between Â£4.5m and Â£5m in its first day at the UK box office after being repeatedly postponed during the pandemic. The industry is watching closely to see whether it can lift box office takings to pre-Covid levels. Thursday's takings are 13% higher than 2015's Spectre but 26% below 2012's Skyfall, Universal Pictures said. It was also the UK's ""widest theatrical release of all time"", they added. Universal said No Time to Die opened in 772 cinemas in the UK and Ireland on Thursday - 25 more than the previous record-holder, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, in 2019. Film technology firm Gower Street Analytics predicted it would account for 92% of the total UK and Irelandbox office takings in its opening week. Among those lining up on the starting line on Sunday will be Nadine Brower, whose father Eddie, 73, went to hospital on 13 January with mild Covid symptoms but fell into a coma on her birthday. Nadine says: ""His breathing capacity was very low, so they put him on oxygen and then on the 20 January, which is my birthday, they put him into a coma because his lung had collapsed. ""He was in a coma for three months. He started off in Whipps Cross and then he was moved to the Royal London, which is Whitechapel, in the ICU. The 44-year-old from Tring, Hertfordshire, told the PA news agency that all funds raised will go towards her father's rehabilitation aftercare and the charity hospital, the Royal Hospital for Neuro-Disability, in Putney, south-west London. ""They have been so supportive and I am so thankful,"" she says. Eddie will be undergoing a six-hour operation next week to release the tendons behind the knees as they are locked, in the hope that he will be able to walk again.

Last year coronavirus meant the world-famous race, which was usually takes place in April, had to be postponed to early October, with only elite runners allowed to compete. This time around, the race is again taking place in the autumn - and now charity fundraising runners are being invited back. More than 40,000 will take to London's streets on Sunday, with a further 40,000 participating virtually.

We're reporting that more than 50 countries have missed the World Health Organization (WHO) target to vaccinate 10% of their populations by the end of September - so what is the vaccine progress looking like around the world? More than six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 196 countries worldwide. Overall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about 2.2 billion and 855 million respectively. The US ranks third, with more than 390 million. While countries in Europe and the Americas are progressing well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa have experienced some supply issues. You can use ourlook-up toolto search for the vaccination rates in different countries and territories. More than 50 countries have missed the World Health Organization's (WHO) target for 10% of their populations to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of September. Most are in Africa, where the WHO's overall figure for those fully vaccinated is currently 4.4%. In the UK, nearly 66% of the whole population has been fully vaccinated, in the EU about 62% and in the US it's 55%. Many of the 50 - but not all - are low-income countries, grappling with vaccine supply and health infrastructure issues. Some suffer from conflict or civil unrest such as Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar, while others like Haiti have been hit by natural disasters, making the task of rolling out vaccines very difficult. But wealthy Taiwan, whose vaccine programme has been dogged by delivery delays and other issues, is still just below 10%. Vietnam, which until a few months ago, had some of the lowest numbers of coronavirus cases globally, has also fallen short of the 10% target. We explore why Africa has fallen behind and what has caused vaccine shortages Others struggling with the Scottish vaccine passport app include aBBC Good Morning Scotlandlistener who told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success. He says: ""I tried for a couple of hours last night but no joy and this morning I tried again and although I could get past the biometric part it would take me to the end of the process and it was still not working. ""It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place."" University of Edinburgh scientist Dr Christine Tait-Burkard says she was unable to get the app working, being told a match could not be found for her on the NHS database. However, the academic told the programme that once up and running, the app will help ""persuade some of the hesitant people [to get vaccinated] if the vaccine passport has consequences."" People in Scotland have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app which has been hit by technical issues on its launch day. Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, describes the app as the ""worst I have ever tried to use"". He wrote on Twitter: ""I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise. ""And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral. ""But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use."" Jodie DavisConsultant Statistician, Visual Journalism Statistics, BBC News We've got more figures from the Office for National Statistics on depression during the pandemic. Of those who couldn't afford an unexpected, necessary Â£850 expense, 29%
reported depressive symptoms - compared with 11% of those who could afford such
an expense. The rate among unemployed people was 31% - twice that of employed
or self-employed people at 15%. Trends were consistent across many groups - a peak in the
depths of winter and lockdown in January to March followed by a slow decline
that has not returned to the levels seen before the pandemic. The survey was conducted between 21 July and 15 August, just
after England fully opened up. But the ONS warns against crediting the end of
lockdown with all the improvements seen because depressive symptoms rise in winter and
fall in summer. Jodie DavisConsultant Statistician, Visual Journalism Statistics, BBC News New analysis by the Office for National Statistics suggests that one in six adults in Great
Britain experienced some form of depression during the summer months of 2021. Between July and August, 17% experienced depressive symptoms
â this is down from 21% (one in five) earlier in the year but is still above the rate observed before the pandemic - 10%. Younger adults and women were more likely to experience some
form of depression, with almost a third - 32% - of women aged 16 to 29
experiencing these symptoms compared with 20% of men of the same age. A total of 36% of disabled adults experienced some form of
depression compared with 8% of adults who did not have disabilities. Charities saya hike in energy prices will hit households hardat a time when Covid support measures such as the Â£20 Universal Credit uplift and the furlough scheme are ending. Typical default domestic energy bills will rise by Â£139 a year, with prepayment meter customers paying an extra Â£153, after regulator Ofgem raised the energy price cap for England, Scotland and Wales. The cap limits how much providers can raise prices. Even so, the current increase is the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. The government has announcedÂ£500m in grants to help UK familiesstruggling with the cost of living. Another country planning to ease restrictions is Australia, which will reopen its international border from November, giving long-awaited freedoms to vaccinated citizens and their relatives. Since March 2020, Australia has had some of the world's strictest border rules - even banning its own people from leaving the country. The policy has been praised for helping to suppress Covid, but it has also controversially separated families. ""It's time to give Australians their lives back,"" PM Scott Morrison says. People would be eligible to travel when their state's vaccination rate hit 80%, he told a press briefing earlier. Travel would not immediately be open to foreigners, but the government said it was working ""towards welcoming tourists back to our shores"". Currently, people can leave Australia only for exceptional reasons such as essential work or visiting a dying relative. Entry is permitted for citizens and others with exemptions, but there are tight caps on arrival numbers.This has left tens of thousands stranded overseas. Outside the UK, Portugal is today lifting almost all of the restrictions that
were imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus, after a hugely successful
national effort to vaccinate the population against Covid-19. Portugal's rate of infections, relative to population, is not currently
Europe's lowest. But with more than 85% of its residents now fully
vaccinated - the world's highest percentage, according to official figures
- the vaccination taskforce has been wound up and the government is lifting
the last major constraints on daily life. Remote working is no longer
recommended and masks will no longer be required in the
street or even in most shops - and restrictions on the number of diners in
restaurants are going too. In hotels, the requirement to present a
negative Covid test result or certificate of vaccination is also being
dropped. However a negative test is still needed to travel to the country from outside the EU, including from Portugal's biggest tourism market, the UK. The pub chain saw its sites closed for about 19 weeks under coronavirus-related restrictions. JD Wetherspoon has reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns resulted in its pubs shutting for 19 weeks. It posted a Â£154.7m loss as sales fell sharply in the year to 25 July, after a Â£34.1m loss a year earlier. Wetherspoon's chairman Tim Martin has criticised the ""use of lockdowns and draconian restrictions"". But the company also suggests that there are signs of recovery since coronavirus rules were eased. The pub chain says that like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new pub openings, were just 8.7% lower in the last nine weeks than in the same period before the pandemic. Sales at its airport sites though, have struggled, it says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Carrying out diagnostic tests in community settings is nothing new. A number of hospitals already operate similar clinics - in fact some of the sites included in this announcement are running now. The investment is much needed. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. The aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. But currently nearly a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did. The NHS carries out more than 15 million diagnostic tests a year. The government says these clinics will be able to do 2.8 million. But as there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests, it remains to be seen by how much these clinics will expand capacity rather than just lead to services being transferred from hospital into the community. In other news, clinics for scans and tests will be set up in
community venues in England to help tackle the NHS backlog caused by the
pandemic. Ministers said the network of 40 diagnostic hubs will be in
public places including shopping centres and a Premier League football stadium in Brighton. They will be able to
carry out checks on cancer patients and scans to see if people need surgery for
things such as knee and hip replacements. The government is investing Â£350m in the scheme with the aim
of having the clinics all up and running by March. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says: âTackling
waiting lists will require new and more innovative ways of delivering the
services people need. ""That is why we're making it easier and more convenient to get checked."" Scotlandâs vaccine passport app has been hit by technical
issues on its launch day â so whatâs going on? Anecdotal evidence on social media suggests that problems
may arise when people try to use their NHS CHI number to register. This step comes after users are asked to take a picture of

Since March 2020, Australia has had some of the world's strictest border rules - even banning its own people from leaving the country. The policy has been praised for helping to suppress Covid, but it has also controversially separated families. ""It's time to give Australians their lives back,"" PM Scott Morrison says. People would be eligible to travel when their state's vaccination rate hit 80%, he told a press briefing earlier. Travel would not immediately be open to foreigners, but the government said it was working ""towards welcoming tourists back to our shores"". Currently, people can leave Australia only for exceptional reasons such as essential work or visiting a dying relative. Entry is permitted for citizens and others with exemptions, but there are tight caps on arrival numbers.This has left tens of thousands stranded overseas. Outside the UK, Portugal is today lifting almost all of the restrictions that
were imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus, after a hugely successful
national effort to vaccinate the population against Covid-19. Portugal's rate of infections, relative to population, is not currently
Europe's lowest. But with more than 85% of its residents now fully
vaccinated - the world's highest percentage, according to official figures
- the vaccination taskforce has been wound up and the government is lifting
the last major constraints on daily life. Remote working is no longer
recommended and masks will no longer be required in the
street or even in most shops - and restrictions on the number of diners in
restaurants are going too. In hotels, the requirement to present a
negative Covid test result or certificate of vaccination is also being
dropped. However a negative test is still needed to travel to the country from outside the EU, including from Portugal's biggest tourism market, the UK. The pub chain saw its sites closed for about 19 weeks under coronavirus-related restrictions. JD Wetherspoon has reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns resulted in its pubs shutting for 19 weeks. It posted a Â£154.7m loss as sales fell sharply in the year to 25 July, after a Â£34.1m loss a year earlier. Wetherspoon's chairman Tim Martin has criticised the ""use of lockdowns and draconian restrictions"". But the company also suggests that there are signs of recovery since coronavirus rules were eased. The pub chain says that like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new pub openings, were just 8.7% lower in the last nine weeks than in the same period before the pandemic. Sales at its airport sites though, have struggled, it says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Carrying out diagnostic tests in community settings is nothing new. A number of hospitals already operate similar clinics - in fact some of the sites included in this announcement are running now. The investment is much needed. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. The aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. But currently nearly a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did. The NHS carries out more than 15 million diagnostic tests a year. The government says these clinics will be able to do 2.8 million. But as there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests, it remains to be seen by how much these clinics will expand capacity rather than just lead to services being transferred from hospital into the community. In other news, clinics for scans and tests will be set up in
community venues in England to help tackle the NHS backlog caused by the
pandemic. Ministers said the network of 40 diagnostic hubs will be in
public places including shopping centres and a Premier League football stadium in Brighton. They will be able to
carry out checks on cancer patients and scans to see if people need surgery for
things such as knee and hip replacements. The government is investing Â£350m in the scheme with the aim
of having the clinics all up and running by March. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says: âTackling
waiting lists will require new and more innovative ways of delivering the
services people need. ""That is why we're making it easier and more convenient to get checked."" Scotlandâs vaccine passport app has been hit by technical
issues on its launch day â so whatâs going on? Anecdotal evidence on social media suggests that problems
may arise when people try to use their NHS CHI number to register. This step comes after users are asked to take a picture of
their passport or driving licence.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Restaurant owner Salima Vellani, said many businesses in the sector were already ""hanging by a thread"" Restaurants and pubs are warning that prices will go up due to a rise in VAT rates, which takes effect from Friday. Owners said the increase from 5% to 12.5% was badly timed, with one restaurant chain owner saying businesses were already ""hanging by a thread"". Trade bodies have called for a halt to any further rises in VAT, to help the industry recover from the pandemic. The government said hospitality had received ""extensive support"". VAT - the tax paid when buying goods or services - has been levied at a reduced rate in pubs, restaurants and other hospitality businesses since July 2020 to help them stay afloat during the pandemic. The sales tax won't return to its pre-pandemic rate of 20% until April 2022. However, Salima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, told the BBC she was ""extremely concerned"" about the increase to 12.5%, which she said was a blow to the hospitality industry. ""It's just one thing after the other that we are being hit by,"" said the chief executive, who runs five chicken restaurants across the country. ""We are all hanging on by a thread. We are going to have to put prices up."" What is VAT and how does it work? Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the 5% rate was designed to ""get the sectors moving and to protect jobs"". The hospitality and tourism sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, with many venues closed altogether during lockdowns, and then catering to limited numbers due to social distancing measures. Now staff shortages are preventing some making the most of the recovery. David Moore, the founder of Michelin-star restaurant Pied Ã  Terre, said he had already told one customer who had a Â£95 voucher for a 10-course menu, that their meal would now cost Â£105. He said the government ""could not have picked a worse time"" to implement the VAT increase, with his business having to cope with rising import, energy and staffing costs. ""It just does not feel like life is back to anywhere near like normal,"" he added. ""We just have so many price rises across the board. The utilities are horrendous. The VAT [rise] is not something I can absorb. Every single supplier has increased prices. ""It's not just vegetables, or just meat, everything is more expensive than it was two years ago."" His restaurant was also currently ""massively understaffed"" he said, sometimes meaning table numbers had to be reduced at peak times. Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? What's in short supply and why? What impact has the furlough scheme had? For Sue Whiston, finance and operations director at Kuula Poke, a Hawaiian restaurant in Birmingham, the VAT increase was ""premature"". She believes the 5% rate should have been extended for another six months. She said shipping costs to source Kuula Poke's produce, from countries such as Japan, China and Thailand, had ""shot through the roof"". Sue Whiston says her costs are ""through the roof"" ""Mango is something that we buy in hundreds of kilograms at a time, (it) has suddenly overnight increased by 20%,"" she said. ""We have had problems with food availability. ""Only this week along our main Japanese wholesaler has turned around and said to us they can't make any deliveries to us this week because of the shortage of diesel fuel. ""So right now we are  in this perfect storm of inflationary pressure and VAT is about to go up. She expects prices for diners to rise across the sector. Rob Pitcher, the chief executive of Revolution, predicts there will be further price increases next spring when the VAT rate increases to 20%. The boss of the bar chain, which has 66 venues and employs about 3,000 staff, said businesses could not afford to take on the extra cost, and so it would be passed on to the customer. ""The consumer is going to end up paying twice,"" he said. Trade bodies, including UK Hospitality, the British Beer and Pub Association, and Tourism Alliance have called on the government to make the 12.5% VAT rate permanent, rather than increasing the rate again in the spring, to safeguard the future of businesses and protect jobs. In a joint statement, they said returning VAT back to 20% would have ""serious consequences"", with six in 10 businesses noting in a survey that it would ""likely lead to cutbacks and job losses"". Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said keeping the VAT rate at 12.5% would be the ""most effective"" move by the government to ""secure a more rapid recovery and rebuild resilience faster"". But a Treasury spokesman said the government had ""always been clear"" that lower VAT rates were a ""temporary measure to support businesses as they recover from the pandemic"". ""The hospitality sector has benefited from extensive support throughout the pandemic through our Â£400bn Plan for Jobs, with the furlough scheme, grants, tax cuts and deferrals,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Alongside Adrian Ramsay, fellow new Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer says ""it's time for the Greens to shine"" The Green Party's new leaders have vowed to make it a powerful electoral force across England and Wales. Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay have been elected to replace Jonathan Bartley and Sian Berry. Ms Denyer said voters were increasingly seeing Greens ""can get elected"". She said the party agreed with many of the aims of Insulate Britain - thegroup staging protests on motorways- but did not ""necessarily agree"" with their tactics. The new leadership team has pledged to build on recent electoral successes and take more seats at every level, including more MPs. Jonathan Bartley to stand down as Greens co-leader A simple guide to the Green Party Is the Green Party on the rise - and if so, why? The party currently has just one MP, Caroline Lucas, but gained 99 seats in May's local elections and became the joint largest on Bristol City Council. Ms Denyer, who is a councillor in Bristol, said: ""We increasingly are in power. The Greens are part of the administration on 14 councils in England and Wales now and in government in Scotland. ""That's a steep curve, that's improving all the time."" She said the party was the ""electoral wing"" of the Green movement, and while there was a place for ""direct action in the wider political movement"", Insulate Britain is ""not necessarily always doing it in the most constructive way"". Mr Ramsay said strong voices are needed to make the case for a Green agenda, not just on the environment but a whole range of issues. ""Our country is in crisis  - pumps running out of petrol, empty shelves in supermarkets and millions heading into winter fearing rising fuel bills"" he added and Green polices would ""help prevent the next crisis"". The Greens launched their 2019 manifesto in Bristol By BBC Political Correspondent Ione Wells Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay put an emphasis in their campaign, and victory speeches, on becoming a serious electoral force. Ms Denyer has often been touted within party circles as the ""obvious next MP"" and came second in the race for the Bristol West seat in 2019. Mr Ramsay was part of the campaign team that got their only MP, Caroline Lucas, elected and has been credited with co-writing the election strategy that saw them deliver more Green councillors on more councils than ever at the English local elections in 2021. They beat a number of other candidates including deputy leader Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond, a founding member of Extinction Rebellion. The new leadership were keen to stress that groups like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion were different from the Green Party, and they don't always support their tactics, but credited the organisations for putting climate at the ""top of the agenda"". For this pair though, winning influence through positions of power is a key aim. They hope to use current issues like rising energy bills and empty petrol pumps to demonstrate their view that the UK is too reliant on fossil fuels. Mr Ramsay said the Greens would create ""sustainable, secure jobs with decent rates of pay"" with policies to install insulation and renewable energy systems in homes, improve public transport system and prioritise sustainable food supplies. Speaking after the result was announced, Ms Denyer said both she and Mr Ramsay would ""focus on getting more Greens elected"" at every level, including more Green MPs. She said: ""It is time for the Greens to shine. ""We intend to lead this party to the electoral success we know is within our grasp"", adding: ""A better future is possible."" Mr Ramsay and Ms Denyer took 44% of the first preference votes in the leadership contest. And in the second round of voting, the new leaders secured 62% of preferences, with 6,274 votes. Amelia Womack and Tamsin Omond came second with 30% of first preference votes. Ms Womack will continue to be the party's deputy leader. The election was triggered after Jonathan Bartley announced he would be standing down as party co-leader and Sian Berry decided not to seek re-election.

"Jo Barrie (left) with her mother Nancy Lovering who was discharged from hospital to a care home and was lost to Covid In the early days of the pandemic more than half of elderly hospital patients discharged to nearly 200 Scottish care homes had not been tested for Covid. Data obtained by the BBC from Public Health Scotland (PHS) provides the clearest picture yet on which homes took in untested and positive patients. A lawyer acting for bereaved families at an upcoming inquiry called the data ""explosive evidence"". Aamer Anwar claimed it was proof that people's lives had been put at risk. The figures, which were released 11 months after BBC Scotland had asked for them, focus on hospital discharges between March and May 2020 - which was the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The PHS data, released under freedom of information laws, appears inthis interactive dashboard,externaland shows every hospital discharge by individual care home in Scotland. It reveals what proportion of people discharged were untested or positive and what proportion of beds might have been occupied by discharged patients. Although the data cannot be used to link discharges to outbreaks or deaths in any given home, solicitor Mr Anwar believed it proved that lives had been put at risk. He is acting on behalf of members of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice and told BBC Scotland: ""The data supports what many bereaved families have always suspected, that elderly patients were discharged without any regard for a duty of care owed to them, or to residents and care home staff. ""Many of the grieving families I represent describe what took place in our care homes as a massacre that could have been avoided, had a simple test taken place prior to discharge. ""The data makes for explosive evidence for a pending Scottish Covid-19 Public Inquiry."" Ms Sturgeon has admitted that the way elderly people were discharged from hospital to care homes in the early stages of the pandemic was a mistake At the start of the pandemic, thousands of elderly people who no longer needed to be in hospital were discharged into many of Scotland's 1,000 plus care homes. This was at a time when the Scottish government was being advised that spare capacity was needed in wards to accommodate coronavirus cases. It was also before testing was commonplace. Only on 21 April 2020 it became mandatory for hospital patients to have two negative Covid tests before being discharged, and for all new care home admissions to be isolated for 14 days. Between 1 March and 21 April 2020 in Scotland, 82% of the 3,595 discharged patients were not tested. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later called the way patients were dischargeda ""mistake"". But solicitor Anwar said: ""It's all very well to say with the benefit of hindsight a mistake was made, but we knew at the time elderly people were dying at a rapid rate. A recent PHS reportconcluded it ""cannot rule out"" a link between patients being discharged from hospital and Covid outbreaks in care homes. A Scottish government spokesman said the PHS analysis ""found care home size is very strongly related to outbreaks and concluded there was no clear statistical evidence that hospital discharges were associated with care home outbreaks."" He added: ""These latest figures do not change that conclusion. Decisions to discharge patients are not made by ministers, but health and social care professionals, alongside the patient and their family."" Scottish Conservative social care spokesman Craig Hoy said the figures showed that ""critical errors"" by the Scottish government meant it had ""completely failed to protect our elderly and vulnerable residents in care facilities, which has resulted in thousands of families grieving the loss of a loved one."" This interactive dashboard,externalreveals for the first time the 843 homes into which each of the 5,198 patients was discharged to between 1 March and 31 May 2020. The data also shows the 752 homes which took in untested patients between 1 March and 21 April 2020. And the figures reveal the 75 homes which took in at least one patient who had tested positive - and who had never received a negative test prior to discharge. The data also revealed: That while the average number of discharges to Scottish homes was at least five, Oakminster Healthcare'sChester Park Care Homein Glasgow received the most (46) between March and May 2020 - which equates to more than half of the beds in the home. At least 19 of these were untested hospital patients discharged between during 1 March and 21 April 2020 TheRutherglen Care Homerun by Advinia took in the most untested discharges (28) - that is at least 70% of all the 40 discharges between March and May 2020 TheLower Johnshillhome run by the Methodist Homes Association took in 10 discharged patients - none of them were tested for coronavirus prior to entering the home There were nearly 200 homes where at least half of incoming residents were untested Five patients testing positive were discharged to theDrummond Grange Nursing Homerun by Barchester Healthcare - at least 21% of all 23 discharges to the home An Advinia spokesperson said: ""In the earliest days of the crisis, when, by comparison, little was known about the virus, particularly the asymptomatic nature of transmission, our care homes found themselves on the frontline."" They added that care was given in accordance to guidelines and all of its homes were are ""prepared as they could been at the time the pandemic started"". A statement from Barchester Healthcare said that given ongoing investigations by Police Scotland and the Crown Office it was not appropriate to comment on specific cases. It added: ""The beginning of the pandemic was a very difficult time for everyone with so little known about the virus, testing, or airborne and asymptomatic transmission."" Oakminster Healthcare and Methodist Homes Association has been contacted for a comment. Jo Barrie said there was a ""lot of pressure"" to get her mother into a care home. She recalled: ""I was getting almost daily calls from a social worker just push, push, pushing all the time. They wanted her out of that hospital as soon as."" Nancy Lovering, was admitted to Perth Royal Infirmary in late February 2020 with a chest infection and after several weeks the 88-year-old was deemed well enough to be discharged. Due to her mother's Alzheimer's and increasing frailty, a social worker advised the family to start looking for care homes. They initially thought they had time to find the right accommodation, but Jo was contacted by a senior social worker who told her she just needed to ""find somewhere that's got a space"". ""I ended that phone call in tears,"" she said. Nancy was discharged into the Ancaster House Care Home in mid-March, but she did not take a test. Jo says that after a quarantine period of 14 days, and being symptom free, her mother was allowed into the residence's public areas. Four days later Jo says her family were emailed by the home to inform them that three residents had been diagnosed with coronavirus. Nancy then became ill and was admitted back into hospital where she died six days later from coronavirus. The new data reveals that 13 people were discharged to Ancaster House between March and May 2020. At least one patient was untested, and at least one other was discharged, despite testing positive for coronavirus. Jo said: ""I keep replaying back in my mind the day I dropped her off at the home. I feel as if I gave her a death sentence."" She says thousands of families still have unanswered questions. A statement by the home said: ""We would like to share our deepest sympathies with everyone who has lost a loved one to Covid-19 and send our condolences again to Nancy's family. Since the start of the pandemic, we have rigorously adhered to all guidance provided by the Scottish government, Health Protection Scotland and our local authority."" NHS Tayside, the health board which covers Perth Royal Infirmary, from where Nancy was discharged, said that from early April 2020 patients leaving hospital and going into care homes were tested. A spokesperson added: ""The decision to transfer a patient from hospital to a care home is always based on clinical judgement and is undertaken in discussion with the family and a multi-disciplinary team which includes doctors, nurses and other health and care staff, including staff at the care home."" Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate of nearly 10,500 people in Scotland The Scottish government confirmed last month thatScotland was to hold a public inquiry into the handling of the Covid pandemicby the end of the year and would scrutinise decisions that were taken over the course of the crisis. The Scottish inquiry will investigate ""events causing public concern"", including the high number of deaths in care homes, and will examine the explanations of the decisions that were taken and the causes of ""anything which may not have gone as expected"". Mr Anwar said: ""We aim to hold to account those officials in hospitals who took the decision to discharge without tests, especially at a time when our hospitals were in complete shutdown, fearful of spreading the virus.""

"I'm A Celebrity is heading back to Wales - and a new book reveals some of the secrets behind the castle show Preparations have begun in for the 2021 series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. The ITV show will be filmed at Abergele's Gwrych Castle for a second year, with Covid preventing a return to the Australian jungle. The Conwy county castle has now closed to the public to allow TV producers to begin preparing for the series. A new book gives an idea of the work involved in converting the derelict Grade I listed castle for the show. It reveals the show's production team is made up of 500 people, many of whom worked in a huge tent erected in the castle grounds. On one windy day, the crew had to briefly abandon their offices when some guy ropes came loose. It also reports the celebrities' sleeping and living area had to be roofed over because of the Welsh weather, but this meant building a special chimney and extractor to remove fumes from the camp fire. The filming schedule meant the celebrities' trials, in which they complete tasks involving insects or unpleasant foods, were actually filmed well after midnight. A special kitchen was set up to prepare dishes like fermented duck eggs and blended vomit fruit - well away from the main staff canteen. The castle, near Abergele, was built in the early 19th Century The souvenir guidebook was co-written by Mark Baker, chairman of the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, which owns the castle. ""It was an enormous task to turn a derelict and sometimes dangerous ruin into a TV set,"" he said. ""It was just extraordinary how they repurposed lots of the interior spaces in the historic building - it wasn't just all fake sets, they used the actual castle, and it's quite exciting to show people how that happened."" The man teaching Ant and Dec to speak Welsh Bushtucker trials - are they rehearsed? What does Wales have that Australia doesn't? He said ITV had been ""incredibly sensitive to the history and fabric of the place"" and to Welsh culture. ""Where the celebrities' bathroom was, was also a place where staff would have washed back in history. ""It was lovely to work with them, and exciting to work with them again this autumn."" The sight of a crane over the top of the castle in the past few weeks has led to speculation that new areas of the castle may feature in the 2021 series. Kiosk Cledwyn proved a big hit for the show in 2020 - but will he be back in the castle this year? Sources close to the programme said the most prominent Welsh character - Kiosk Cledwyn - would be making a return to the screen to give the celebrities luxury rewards if they succeed in challenges. Preparations have also begun in the town of Abergele itself, where the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust has opened a souvenir shop to sell merchandise while the castle is closed to visitors for the filming. The throne on which Giovanna Fletcher was crowned queen of the castle at the end of the 2020 series is also in display in the shop. Businesses in Abergele were hoping that the programme would help boost trade and create a buzz in the area. The Veg Shop owner Tracey Brennan hopes the show will bring a boost to trade - and lift spirits after Covid Tracey Brennan, who owns The Veg Shop in the town centre, said she could not wait. ""It's been such a terrible trading year, and when last year's show went out, we were all in lockdown,"" she said. ""From a business point of view, after being locked down for lots of last winter, we can now look forward to a period with more visitors and more footfall, and try to recoup losses from earlier in the year. ""We've already seen lots of tourists who have been talking about coming back in winter and asking us where is the best place to view the castle. ""It will be something between autumn and Christmas to lift people's spirits. ""We can't wait to see the celebs, and are even hoping we'll get to see a bit more of them in the town this year."" Giovanna Fletcher's throne where she was crowned winner last year is on display in the special I'm A Celebrity shop Conwy council has put plans in place to improve safety on the roads in the area,where a woman was killed during last year's showafter being hit by a car while trying to take a photo of the castle. It also hopes the show's producers will look at featuring other locations around north Wales. Louise Emery, cabinet member for the economy, said: ""We're delighted the show is being filmed in Abergele again, and we're looking forward to seeing some familiar locations on national TV. ""Covid restrictions will be less this year, so we're quietly hoping that the production team will be able to do more filming in the surrounding area. ""The mountains, coast and landscapes of Conwy county lend themselves to all sorts of creative challenges for the celebrities - who knows what we'll see. ""This year's show has already brought economic benefits to the area. It's been really good to see local businesses supplying catering and other services to the production crew as they start to get the castle ready. ""We're hoping those economic benefits can continue long after the show comes off air and the celebrities have headed home.""

""It doesn't matter whether it's in six minutes, six days, or six weeks, we're going to get it done,"" he said after a surprise visit to Congress on Friday. Some Democrats refuse to back the plan until a separate $3.5tn welfare and climate change bill is voted in. But centrists in the party want to spend less on those issues. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi admitted on Friday evening that ""more time is needed"" to find a compromise. Thursday's vote on the infrastructure bill was postponed and it was unclear when another attempt to hold a vote would be made. Mr Biden's visit to Capitol Hill on Friday saw him meet privately with House Democrats in a bid to break the deadlock. Media reports said he had sought to encourage compromise between the factions. Reuters quoted a source as saying Mr Biden had suggested scaling back the welfare and climate bill to about $2 trillion, saying ""even a smaller bill can make historic investments"". The bipartisan $1tn public works bill, which would apply to routine transportation, broadband, water systems and other projects, enjoys wide support - but liberal (or progressive) Democrats are linking its passage to their more ambitious welfare and climate change bill. That bill would raise taxes on corporations and the rich, investing the revenue in a broad array of social programmes, including early childhood education, universal preschool, government-funded two-year college education, paid family and medical leave, an expansion of government health insurance and environmental spending. The biggest test of Biden's presidency so far Earlier this week, the White House cancelled Mr Biden's trip to Chicago so he could focus on whipping the needed votes. Reflecting the centrist position, Senator Joe Manchin said he was ready to meet the president less than halfway, at $1.5tn on infrastructure. He described the proposed figure of $3.5tn as ""fiscal insanity"". Senator Bernie Sanders, a leading liberal, tweeted on Friday that ""the fate of the planet"" rested on the $3.5tn bill. ""Without a strong reconciliation bill there will be no serious effort to cut carbon emissions and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel,"" he said. He added: ""There can be no infrastructure bill without a strong reconciliation bill."" Mr Biden's party has the thinnest of majorities in both the House and Senate, and is eager to push through its signature policies before next year's congressional elections, when the Republicans will attempt to regain control. On Thursday Congress did pass a temporary measure to keep the federal government funded until early December. Federal museums, national parks and safety programmes would have had to close without the funding, which also includes hurricane relief and help for Afghan refugees.

"Major problems have been reported with Scotland's Covid vaccine passport app, just hours after its launch. People now need proof they have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events. The NHS Scotland Covid Status app only became available to download onApple,externalandAndroid,externaldevices at about 17:30 on Thursday. But many people have said they were unable to access their vaccination status through the app. The Scottish government said more than 70,000 people had downloaded the app on on Thursday, with a spokesman adding: ""This huge demand did mean that some people experienced delays and we are sorry that happened. ""We have now increased the capacity of the NHS systems that sit behind the app - where most of the issues causing delays have occurred - in order to deal with demand and, as a result, we are seeing increasing numbers of people now able to access their records."" What do we know about Scotland's vaccine passport? Judge refuses to delay vaccine passport scheme Public 'not ready' for vaccine passport scheme Anecdotal evidence on social media suggested that problems may have arisen when people tried to use their NHS CHI number to register. This step comes after users are asked to take a picture of their passport or driving licence. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there should be an ""indefinite delay"" to the rollout of the new scheme to avoid a ""weekend of chaos"" at venues across the country. He added: ""Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend. ""This plan should really be scrapped altogether but, if the SNP insist on charging ahead, they must indefinitely delay the vaccine passport scheme until the most basic issues are ironed out."" Many people reported problems registering with the scheme on Friday People have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app. Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the app as the ""worst I have ever tried to use"". He wrote on Twitter: ""I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise. ""And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral. ""But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use."" Another app usershared screenshots,externalof his experience on Twitter during which he was told ""no match found"" followed by: ""Something went wrong. We're working on it."" Others reported issues getting past the initial log in page, while aBBC Good Morning Scotlandlistener told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success. He said: ""I tried for a couple of hours last night but not joy and this morning I tried again and although I could get past the biometric part it would take me to end of the process and was still not working. ""It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place."" University of Edinburgh scientist Dr Christine Tait-Burkard said she was unable to get the app working, being told a match could not be found for her on the NHS database. However, the academic told the programme that once up and running, the app will help ""persuade some of the hesitant people [to get vaccinated] if the vaccine passport has consequences."" Mike Rhodes, of the IT firm ConsultMyApp, said he thought the servers being used for the app were being overloaded because of demand but this should have been anticipated. He said: ""It is highly likely that those developers that built the app shell also built the interface to the back-end servers that ended up failing. ""Secondly, this wasn't an unforeseen event - the developers absolutely knew this would be downloaded incredibly quickly and was likely to get hundreds of thousands of people attempting to register at the same time."" Mr Rhodes questioned why there was ""so little time"" between the app being launched and it being needed for entry into events. The new rules came into effect at 05:00 on Friday - but the government announced earlier this week that they will not actually be enforced until 18 October. Paul Banham, of Glasgow's Buff Club, toldBBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live: ""We'll be having a look at them over the next few weeks but we won't be refusing entry if someone doesn't have it - there's too many glitches at the moment. ""We've had a lot of students contact us and a lot of them are saying they have been vaccinated in other areas of the UK and that is not showing on their Covid status so there's a few gaps at the moment and hopefully they will be ironed out."" The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which represents nightclub, lost a legal bid to delay the rollout on Thursday. It had argued that the new system was ""discriminatory"" and ""disproportionate"". But judge Lord Burns ruled that the vaccine passports were ""an attempt to address the legitimate issues identified in a balanced way"", and was within the margin of what the government could decide was a reasonable response to the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the court judgement was ""clear and emphatic"". She said: ""This is a targeted and proportionate way to try and reduce the harm the virus will do over the winter months, to keep our economy open and fully functioning. ""We will continue to engage with businesses not just in the run-up to the enforcement of this on 18 October, we will do that afterwards as well so we are listening and understanding and working collectively to keep the country as safe as possible."" The vaccine certification scheme will require venues such as nightclubs to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers over the age of 18 The vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds. Venues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance. Elsewhere in the UK, Wales plans to introduce its ownCovid passport ruleslater this month but England hasscrapped similar plans. Northern Ireland has yet to announce a formal vaccination passport scheme. The Scottish launch comes as latest figures show that a total of 4,189,701 people have received the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland, of which 3,837,689 people have received two doses.

"The launch of Scotland's Covid vaccine passport app is hit by problems - probably due to the volume of people using it, the Scottish Government says Proof of vaccination must be shown for entry to nightclubs from today after a judge refused a legal challenge for a delay Shopping centre clinics will be set up in England to clear the NHS backlog caused by the pandemic Fully vaccinated Australians will be able to travel in and out of the country freely from November for the first time since March 2020 Portugal lifts restrictions as more than 85% of its population is now fully jabbed - the highest proportion in the world We're going to pause our live page coverage but will be back if there are any big developments. In the meantime here are some of the headlines from around the world  Thank you for joining us. Today's coverage so far has been provided by Jen Meierhans and Chris Clayton.  The Scottish Conservatives are calling for the nation's vaccine passport scheme to be delayed after users were hit with technical issues. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross says there should be a postponement to avoid what a ""weekend of chaos"" as the certification is set to be used for access to large events and nightclubs. ""Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend,"" he says. ""At an incredibly challenging time, businesses will lose out if this app is still not working."" He says the plan should be scrapped altogether but that if the SNP insists on going through with it there should be a delay until the ""most basic issues"" are ironed out. Estimates
from the Office for National Statistics survey suggest that just under 840,000 people in the UK
would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week ending 25 September, up
from about 820,000 people last week. This
is 1.2% of the population â or one in 80 people â the same as
reported last week. The ONS
says the trend for estimated Covid-19 infections in England and Wales increased
in the week to 25 September. Estimated infections were âuncertainâ in
Northern Ireland and decreased in Scotland. In other Covid-related film news, Walt Disney and Scarlett Johansson have settled a legal dispute over the release of the Marvel superhero movie Black Widow. Johansson sued Disney two months ago, accusing it of breaching her contract when it offered the movie on its Disney+ streaming service while it was still showing in cinemas - a move prompted by the pandemic. She said the decision meant that she was deprived of potential earnings. Black Widow, which debuted simultaneously on 9 July in cinemas and via Disney+, set a box office record for a release during the coronavirus pandemic in its first weekend, grossing $218m (Â£161m), but box office receipts then fell sharply. During the pandemic several big Hollywood studios opted to bypass cinemas, many of which had been closed, and release films online instead. Now that most cinemas have reopened, Disney, along with fellow giant Warner Bros, has chosen to maintain a dual release strategy for their major films. Details of the deal between Disney and Johansson have not been disclosed but both parties say they are pleased that the matter has been resolved andlook forward to future collaborations. Lashana Lynch, Daniel Craig and Lea Seydoux attended the film's world premiere on Tuesday Daniel Craig's final James Bond film made between Â£4.5m and Â£5m in its first day at the UK box office after being repeatedly postponed during the pandemic. The industry is watching closely to see whether it can lift box office takings to pre-Covid levels. Thursday's takings are 13% higher than 2015's Spectre but 26% below 2012's Skyfall, Universal Pictures said. It was also the UK's ""widest theatrical release of all time"", they added. Universal said No Time to Die opened in 772 cinemas in the UK and Ireland on Thursday - 25 more than the previous record-holder, Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker, in 2019. Film technology firm Gower Street Analytics predicted it would account for 92% of the total UK and Irelandbox office takings in its opening week. Among those lining up on the starting line on Sunday will be Nadine Brower, whose father Eddie, 73, went to hospital on 13 January with mild Covid symptoms but fell into a coma on her birthday. Nadine says: ""His breathing capacity was very low, so they put him on oxygen and then on the 20 January, which is my birthday, they put him into a coma because his lung had collapsed. ""He was in a coma for three months. He started off in Whipps Cross and then he was moved to the Royal London, which is Whitechapel, in the ICU. The 44-year-old from Tring, Hertfordshire, told the PA news agency that all funds raised will go towards her father's rehabilitation aftercare and the charity hospital, the Royal Hospital for Neuro-Disability, in Putney, south-west London. ""They have been so supportive and I am so thankful,"" she says. Eddie will be undergoing a six-hour operation next week to release the tendons behind the knees as they are locked, in the hope that he will be able to walk again. Eddie Brower with his wife Hazel This video can not be played The London Marathon returns in full this weekend - for the first time in over two years due to the pandemic. Last year coronavirus meant the world-famous race, which was usually takes place in April, had to be postponed to early October, with only elite runners allowed to compete. This time around, the race is again taking place in the autumn - and now charity fundraising runners are being invited back. More than 40,000 will take to London's streets on Sunday, with a further 40,000 participating virtually. Race director Hugh Brasher says he expects it to be""the most memorable London Marathon ever"". We're reporting that more than 50 countries have missed the World Health Organization (WHO) target to vaccinate 10% of their populations by the end of September - so what is the vaccine progress looking like around the world? More than six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 196 countries worldwide. Overall, China and India have administered the highest number of doses, with about 2.2 billion and 855 million respectively. The US ranks third, with more than 390 million. While countries in Europe and the Americas are progressing well with their vaccination campaigns,many states in Africa have experienced some supply issues. You can use ourlook-up toolto search for the vaccination rates in different countries and territories. More than 50 countries have missed the World Health Organization's (WHO) target for 10% of their populations to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of September. Most are in Africa, where the WHO's overall figure for those fully vaccinated is currently 4.4%. In the UK, nearly 66% of the whole population has been fully vaccinated, in the EU about 62% and in the US it's 55%. Many of the 50 - but not all - are low-income countries, grappling with vaccine supply and health infrastructure issues. Some suffer from conflict or civil unrest such as Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar, while others like Haiti have been hit by natural disasters, making the task of rolling out vaccines very difficult. But wealthy Taiwan, whose vaccine programme has been dogged by delivery delays and other issues, is still just below 10%. Vietnam, which until a few months ago, had some of the lowest numbers of coronavirus cases globally, has also fallen short of the 10% target. We explore why Africa has fallen behind and what has caused vaccine shortages Others struggling with the Scottish vaccine passport app include aBBC Good Morning Scotlandlistener who told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success. He says: ""I tried for a couple of hours last night but no joy and this morning I tried again and although I could get past the biometric part it would take me to the end of the process and it was still not working.

""And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral. ""But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use."" Jodie DavisConsultant Statistician, Visual Journalism Statistics, BBC News We've got more figures from the Office for National Statistics on depression during the pandemic. Of those who couldn't afford an unexpected, necessary Â£850 expense, 29%
reported depressive symptoms - compared with 11% of those who could afford such
an expense. The rate among unemployed people was 31% - twice that of employed
or self-employed people at 15%. Trends were consistent across many groups - a peak in the
depths of winter and lockdown in January to March followed by a slow decline
that has not returned to the levels seen before the pandemic. The survey was conducted between 21 July and 15 August, just
after England fully opened up. But the ONS warns against crediting the end of
lockdown with all the improvements seen because depressive symptoms rise in winter and
fall in summer. Jodie DavisConsultant Statistician, Visual Journalism Statistics, BBC News New analysis by the Office for National Statistics suggests that one in six adults in Great
Britain experienced some form of depression during the summer months of 2021. Between July and August, 17% experienced depressive symptoms
â this is down from 21% (one in five) earlier in the year but is still above the rate observed before the pandemic - 10%. Younger adults and women were more likely to experience some
form of depression, with almost a third - 32% - of women aged 16 to 29
experiencing these symptoms compared with 20% of men of the same age. A total of 36% of disabled adults experienced some form of
depression compared with 8% of adults who did not have disabilities. Charities saya hike in energy prices will hit households hardat a time when Covid support measures such as the Â£20 Universal Credit uplift and the furlough scheme are ending. Typical default domestic energy bills will rise by Â£139 a year, with prepayment meter customers paying an extra Â£153, after regulator Ofgem raised the energy price cap for England, Scotland and Wales. The cap limits how much providers can raise prices. Even so, the current increase is the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. The government has announcedÂ£500m in grants to help UK familiesstruggling with the cost of living. Another country planning to ease restrictions is Australia, which will reopen its international border from November, giving long-awaited freedoms to vaccinated citizens and their relatives. Since March 2020, Australia has had some of the world's strictest border rules - even banning its own people from leaving the country. The policy has been praised for helping to suppress Covid, but it has also controversially separated families. ""It's time to give Australians their lives back,"" PM Scott Morrison says. People would be eligible to travel when their state's vaccination rate hit 80%, he told a press briefing earlier. Travel would not immediately be open to foreigners, but the government said it was working ""towards welcoming tourists back to our shores"". Currently, people can leave Australia only for exceptional reasons such as essential work or visiting a dying relative. Entry is permitted for citizens and others with exemptions, but there are tight caps on arrival numbers.This has left tens of thousands stranded overseas. Outside the UK, Portugal is today lifting almost all of the restrictions that
were imposed to limit the spread of coronavirus, after a hugely successful
national effort to vaccinate the population against Covid-19. Portugal's rate of infections, relative to population, is not currently
Europe's lowest. But with more than 85% of its residents now fully
vaccinated - the world's highest percentage, according to official figures
- the vaccination taskforce has been wound up and the government is lifting
the last major constraints on daily life. Remote working is no longer
recommended and masks will no longer be required in the
street or even in most shops - and restrictions on the number of diners in
restaurants are going too. In hotels, the requirement to present a
negative Covid test result or certificate of vaccination is also being
dropped. However a negative test is still needed to travel to the country from outside the EU, including from Portugal's biggest tourism market, the UK. The pub chain saw its sites closed for about 19 weeks under coronavirus-related restrictions. JD Wetherspoon has reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns resulted in its pubs shutting for 19 weeks. It posted a Â£154.7m loss as sales fell sharply in the year to 25 July, after a Â£34.1m loss a year earlier. Wetherspoon's chairman Tim Martin has criticised the ""use of lockdowns and draconian restrictions"". But the company also suggests that there are signs of recovery since coronavirus rules were eased. The pub chain says that like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new pub openings, were just 8.7% lower in the last nine weeks than in the same period before the pandemic. Sales at its airport sites though, have struggled, it says. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Carrying out diagnostic tests in community settings is nothing new. A number of hospitals already operate similar clinics - in fact some of the sites included in this announcement are running now. The investment is much needed. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. The aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. But currently nearly a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did. The NHS carries out more than 15 million diagnostic tests a year. The government says these clinics will be able to do 2.8 million. But as there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests, it remains to be seen by how much these clinics will expand capacity rather than just lead to services being transferred from hospital into the community. In other news, clinics for scans and tests will be set up in
community venues in England to help tackle the NHS backlog caused by the
pandemic. Ministers said the network of 40 diagnostic hubs will be in
public places including shopping centres and a Premier League football stadium in Brighton. They will be able to
carry out checks on cancer patients and scans to see if people need surgery for
things such as knee and hip replacements. The government is investing Â£350m in the scheme with the aim
of having the clinics all up and running by March. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says: âTackling
waiting lists will require new and more innovative ways of delivering the
services people need. ""That is why we're making it easier and more convenient to get checked."" Scotlandâs vaccine passport app has been hit by technical
issues on its launch day â so whatâs going on? Anecdotal evidence on social media suggests that problems
may arise when people try to use their NHS CHI number to register. This step comes after users are asked to take a picture of
their passport or driving licence.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Sarah Everard was a talented and much-loved young woman, Lord Justice Fulford said A Met Police officer who murdered Sarah Everard after kidnapping her under the guise of an arrest has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term. Wayne Couzens abducted the 33-year-old as she walked home from a friend's house in south London on 3 March. During the sentencing of Couzens, the judge said the case was ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal"". Ms Everard's family said they were relieved by the fact that Couzens would die in jail. Addressing reporters outside the Old Bailey following his sentencing, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she recognised that a ""precious bond of trust"" had been damaged by Couzens,who had ""brought shame on the Met"". Describing him as a ""coward"", she said his crimes were ""a gross betrayal of everything policing stands for"", adding: ""I am so sorry."" This video can not be played Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says the force has been ""shamed"" and ""rocked"" by the case An ongoingIndependent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) reviewof how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. Speaking to the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee earlier on Thursday, two senior Met officers said they were not aware of rumours that Couzens was nicknamed ""the rapist"" by colleagues. However, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the nickname was known by some officers. Sir Tom, who in his role has responsibility for the inspection of police forces, told BBC Radio 4's the World at One: ""Yes, I did know that. And he also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind."" What Couzens' colleagues knew or suspected about him remains the subject of the IOPC investigation. Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague How a police officer covered up Sarah Everard's murder When sentencing Couzens earlier on Thursday, Lord Justice Fulford described the circumstances of the kidnap, rape and murder as ""grotesque"", telling him he had ""betrayed"" his family. He said Ms Everard was ""an intelligent, resourceful, talented and much-loved young woman, still in the early years of her life"". The judge told 48-year-old Couzens: ""Notwithstanding your guilty pleas, therefore, I have seen no evidence of genuine contrition on your part, as opposed to evident self-pity and attempts by you to avoid or minimise the proper consequences of what you have done."" He said the seriousness of the case was so ""exceptionally high"" that it warranted a whole-life order. ""The misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause,"" he told the Old Bailey. ""All of these situations attack different aspects of the fundamental underpinnings of our democratic way of life."" This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Reacting to the sentencing, Ms Everard's family said they were pleased with the full-life term, adding that although ""nothing can make things better, nothing can bring Sarah back... knowing he will be imprisoned forever brings some relief. ""Sarah lost her life needlessly and cruelly and all the years of life she had yet to enjoy were stolen from her. Wayne Couzens held a position of trust as a police officer and we are outraged and sickened that he abused this trust in order to lure Sarah to her death. The world is a safer place with him imprisoned. ""It is almost seven months since Sarah died and the pain of losing her is overwhelming. We miss her all the time. We hold her safe in our hearts."" Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Lord Justice Fulford called Couzens ""warped, selfish and brutal"" As Wayne Couzens was told he would spend the rest of his life in prison, he kept his head down as he has throughout his time in the dock. He was shaking as he was sentenced. The Everard family looked on. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was in court to hear the sentence. Her officer a convicted murderer and rapist. Mr Justice Fulford told Couzens his offences were ""warped, selfish and brutal"". The judge said Sarah ""was simply walking home"". After Couzens was sentenced, police officers who investigated the murder hugged the Everard family. But as her parents and sister said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens had inflicted on them. Lord Justice Fulford paid tribute to the dignity of Ms Everard's family, whose statements in court on Wednesday ""revealed the human impact"" of Couzens' offending, which he said ""was both sexual and homicidal"". The judge added that Couzenshad eroded public confidence,externalin the police in England and Wales. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Met chief should quit over Everard case - Harman In a letter she wrote before Dame Cressida spoke to reporters, senior Labour MP Harriet Harman called on the Met Police commissioner to resign. Ms Harman saidwomen's confidence in the police ""will have been shattered"",externaland it would be impossible for Dame Cressida to oversee the changes needed to rebuild trust. Home Secretary Priti Patel said there were ""serious questions"" for the Metropolitan Police regarding the Couzens case, adding that the force ""will be held to account"". She described the crimes as ""sickening"" and said it was right that this ""monster"" had been given a whole-life sentence. When Parliament abolished the death penalty more than 50 years ago, it promised the British people that the worst of the very worst offenders would be locked up in jail for the rest of their lives. Since then a series of complex rules for judges has evolved in order for a ""whole-life order"" (WLO) to be imposed. The law says a WLO should ""normally"" only be considered if an offender has murdered more than once, killed a police or prison officer, abducted and sadistically killed a child, or where the motive was ideological. While MPs did not envisage such a serious crime as this when they wrote the law, they said judges could impose a WLO in other unthinkable cases where the seriousness of the crime was exceptionally high. Lord Justice Fulford concluded the misuse of a constable's role to deceive, kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard was as bad as terrorism. It was not only a crime of appalling and prolonged suffering for the victim, but it undermined trust in the police - part of the bedrock of a safe society. And that is why the law allowed the judge to order Couzens will never be released. The Old Bailey sentencing hearing had been told how Couzens used his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card and handcuffs to abduct Ms Everard as she walked from Clapham to her Brixton home on the night of 3 March. The firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, who had clocked off from a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover where he raped Ms Everard. She had been strangled with Couzens' police-issue belt by 02:30 GMT the following morning. Couzens, who was married with two children, then burned the marketing executive's body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, before dumping the remains in a nearby pond. On 9 March, he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, after police connected him to the hire car he used to abduct Ms Everard. Her remains were found by police dogs the next day. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""sickened"" by the details that had emerged during sentencing. ""Our police are there to protect us - and I know that officers will share in our shock and devastation at the total betrayal of this duty. People must be able to walk on our streets without fear of harm and with full confidence that the police are there to keep them safe."" John Apter, national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said Couzens was ""an absolute disgrace to the police service"" and he was ""ashamed he was ever a police officer"". ""I am proud to carry a warrant card, but this vile individual's abuse of that authority has cast a shadow on all those who work within policing. He has brought disgrace to our uniform.

"Major problems have been reported with Scotland's Covid vaccine passport app, just hours after its launch. People now need proof they have had two doses of vaccine in order to enter nightclubs and many other large events. The NHS Scotland Covid Status app only became available to download onApple,externalandAndroid,externaldevices at about 17:30 on Thursday. But many people have said they were unable to access their vaccination status through the app. The Scottish government said more than 70,000 people had downloaded the app on on Thursday, with a spokesman adding: ""This huge demand did mean that some people experienced delays and we are sorry that happened. ""We have now increased the capacity of the NHS systems that sit behind the app - where most of the issues causing delays have occurred - in order to deal with demand and, as a result, we are seeing increasing numbers of people now able to access their records."" What do we know about Scotland's vaccine passport? Judge refuses to delay vaccine passport scheme Public 'not ready' for vaccine passport scheme Anecdotal evidence on social media suggested that problems may have arisen when people tried to use their NHS CHI number to register. This step comes after users are asked to take a picture of their passport or driving licence. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said there should be an ""indefinite delay"" to the rollout of the new scheme to avoid a ""weekend of chaos"" at venues across the country. He added: ""Thousands of people will be at the football and going out to hospitality premises this weekend. ""This plan should really be scrapped altogether but, if the SNP insist on charging ahead, they must indefinitely delay the vaccine passport scheme until the most basic issues are ironed out."" Many people reported problems registering with the scheme on Friday People have been sharing their experiences of trying to download the new vaccine passport app. Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, Roddy Dunlop QC, described the app as the ""worst I have ever tried to use"". He wrote on Twitter: ""I am not prone to hyperbole. I promise. ""And I instantly recognise that I was originally instructed to challenge the introduction of Covid passports and so am not neutral. ""But try the app. This is, literally, the worst app I have ever tried to use."" Another app usershared screenshots,externalof his experience on Twitter during which he was told ""no match found"" followed by: ""Something went wrong. We're working on it."" Others reported issues getting past the initial log in page, while aBBC Good Morning Scotlandlistener told the programme that he had tried twice to download the app without success. He said: ""I tried for a couple of hours last night but not joy and this morning I tried again and although I could get past the biometric part it would take me to end of the process and was still not working. ""It just isn't suitable for purpose at the moment, they should have known it was going to happen in the first place."" University of Edinburgh scientist Dr Christine Tait-Burkard said she was unable to get the app working, being told a match could not be found for her on the NHS database. However, the academic told the programme that once up and running, the app will help ""persuade some of the hesitant people [to get vaccinated] if the vaccine passport has consequences."" Mike Rhodes, of the IT firm ConsultMyApp, said he thought the servers being used for the app were being overloaded because of demand but this should have been anticipated. He said: ""It is highly likely that those developers that built the app shell also built the interface to the back-end servers that ended up failing. ""Secondly, this wasn't an unforeseen event - the developers absolutely knew this would be downloaded incredibly quickly and was likely to get hundreds of thousands of people attempting to register at the same time."" Mr Rhodes questioned why there was ""so little time"" between the app being launched and it being needed for entry into events. The new rules came into effect at 05:00 on Friday - but the government announced earlier this week that they will not actually be enforced until 18 October. Paul Banham, of Glasgow's Buff Club, toldBBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live: ""We'll be having a look at them over the next few weeks but we won't be refusing entry if someone doesn't have it - there's too many glitches at the moment. ""We've had a lot of students contact us and a lot of them are saying they have been vaccinated in other areas of the UK and that is not showing on their Covid status so there's a few gaps at the moment and hopefully they will be ironed out."" The Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), which represents nightclub, lost a legal bid to delay the rollout on Thursday. It had argued that the new system was ""discriminatory"" and ""disproportionate"". But judge Lord Burns ruled that the vaccine passports were ""an attempt to address the legitimate issues identified in a balanced way"", and was within the margin of what the government could decide was a reasonable response to the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the court judgement was ""clear and emphatic"". She said: ""This is a targeted and proportionate way to try and reduce the harm the virus will do over the winter months, to keep our economy open and fully functioning. ""We will continue to engage with businesses not just in the run-up to the enforcement of this on 18 October, we will do that afterwards as well so we are listening and understanding and working collectively to keep the country as safe as possible."" The vaccine certification scheme will require venues such as nightclubs to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers over the age of 18 The vaccine certification scheme will require venues to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers over the age of 18, with certain exemptions on medical grounds. Venues affected include nightclubs, unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people, and any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance. Elsewhere in the UK, Wales plans to introduce its ownCovid passport ruleslater this month but England hasscrapped similar plans. Northern Ireland has yet to announce a formal vaccination passport scheme. The Scottish launch comes as latest figures show that a total of 4,189,701 people have received the coronavirus vaccine in Scotland, of which 3,837,689 people have received two doses.

"New one-stop shops for scans and tests will be set up in community venues in England, including shopping centres and a Premier League football stadium. Ministers said the network of 40 diagnostic clinics will help tackle the growing backlog in hospital treatment. They will be able to carry out checks on cancer patients and scans to see if people need surgery for things such as knee and hip replacements. The aim is to have them all up and running by March. They will be kitted out with a range of equipment to carry out X-rays, breast screening, ultrasounds and CT and MRI scans. Among the sites chosen for the new clinics are: The Glass Works shopping centre in Barnsley Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club's Amex Stadium A department store in Poole A new community health clinic in Oldham Carrying out diagnostic tests in community settings is nothing new. A number of hospitals already operate similar clinics - in fact some of the sites included in this announcement are running now. The investment is much needed. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. The aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. But currently nearly a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did. The NHS carries out more than 15 million diagnostic tests a year. The government says these clinics will be able to do 2.8 million. But as there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests, it remains to be seen by how much these clinics will expand capacity rather than just lead to services being transferred from hospital into the community. The need for investment in diagnostic tests was highlighted in the NHS Long Term Plan in 2019. A review published last year,external- led by former cancer tsar Prof Sir Mike Richards - said the pandemic had just heightened the need for changes to the way tests are provided. The idea was to create greater capacity in the community so hospital testing and scanning facilities can be focused more on emergency patients. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said the investment - worth Â£350m - would help tackle the backlog in treatment caused by the pandemic. ""Tackling waiting lists will require new and more innovative ways of delivering the services people need,"" he said. ""That is why we're making it easier and more convenient to get checked."" And NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard added: ""These one-stop shops will also help us to improve outcomes for patients with cancer and other serious conditions, ultimately sparing more patients and families the pain and trauma of disease.""

"I'm A Celebrity is heading back to Wales - and a new book reveals some of the secrets behind the castle show Preparations have begun in for the 2021 series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. The ITV show will be filmed at Abergele's Gwrych Castle for a second year, with Covid preventing a return to the Australian jungle. The Conwy county castle has now closed to the public to allow TV producers to begin preparing for the series. A new book gives an idea of the work involved in converting the derelict Grade I listed castle for the show. It reveals the show's production team is made up of 500 people, many of whom worked in a huge tent erected in the castle grounds. On one windy day, the crew had to briefly abandon their offices when some guy ropes came loose. It also reports the celebrities' sleeping and living area had to be roofed over because of the Welsh weather, but this meant building a special chimney and extractor to remove fumes from the camp fire. The filming schedule meant the celebrities' trials, in which they complete tasks involving insects or unpleasant foods, were actually filmed well after midnight. A special kitchen was set up to prepare dishes like fermented duck eggs and blended vomit fruit - well away from the main staff canteen. The castle, near Abergele, was built in the early 19th Century The souvenir guidebook was co-written by Mark Baker, chairman of the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, which owns the castle. ""It was an enormous task to turn a derelict and sometimes dangerous ruin into a TV set,"" he said. ""It was just extraordinary how they repurposed lots of the interior spaces in the historic building - it wasn't just all fake sets, they used the actual castle, and it's quite exciting to show people how that happened."" The man teaching Ant and Dec to speak Welsh Bushtucker trials - are they rehearsed? What does Wales have that Australia doesn't? He said ITV had been ""incredibly sensitive to the history and fabric of the place"" and to Welsh culture. ""Where the celebrities' bathroom was, was also a place where staff would have washed back in history. ""It was lovely to work with them, and exciting to work with them again this autumn."" The sight of a crane over the top of the castle in the past few weeks has led to speculation that new areas of the castle may feature in the 2021 series. Kiosk Cledwyn proved a big hit for the show in 2020 - but will he be back in the castle this year? Sources close to the programme said the most prominent Welsh character - Kiosk Cledwyn - would be making a return to the screen to give the celebrities luxury rewards if they succeed in challenges. Preparations have also begun in the town of Abergele itself, where the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust has opened a souvenir shop to sell merchandise while the castle is closed to visitors for the filming. The throne on which Giovanna Fletcher was crowned queen of the castle at the end of the 2020 series is also in display in the shop. Businesses in Abergele were hoping that the programme would help boost trade and create a buzz in the area. The Veg Shop owner Tracey Brennan hopes the show will bring a boost to trade - and lift spirits after Covid Tracey Brennan, who owns The Veg Shop in the town centre, said she could not wait. ""It's been such a terrible trading year, and when last year's show went out, we were all in lockdown,"" she said. ""From a business point of view, after being locked down for lots of last winter, we can now look forward to a period with more visitors and more footfall, and try to recoup losses from earlier in the year. ""We've already seen lots of tourists who have been talking about coming back in winter and asking us where is the best place to view the castle. ""It will be something between autumn and Christmas to lift people's spirits. ""We can't wait to see the celebs, and are even hoping we'll get to see a bit more of them in the town this year."" Giovanna Fletcher's throne where she was crowned winner last year is on display in the special I'm A Celebrity shop Conwy council has put plans in place to improve safety on the roads in the area,where a woman was killed during last year's showafter being hit by a car while trying to take a photo of the castle. It also hopes the show's producers will look at featuring other locations around north Wales. Louise Emery, cabinet member for the economy, said: ""We're delighted the show is being filmed in Abergele again, and we're looking forward to seeing some familiar locations on national TV. ""Covid restrictions will be less this year, so we're quietly hoping that the production team will be able to do more filming in the surrounding area. ""The mountains, coast and landscapes of Conwy county lend themselves to all sorts of creative challenges for the celebrities - who knows what we'll see. ""This year's show has already brought economic benefits to the area. It's been really good to see local businesses supplying catering and other services to the production crew as they start to get the castle ready. ""We're hoping those economic benefits can continue long after the show comes off air and the celebrities have headed home.""

"""Alcohol is a great deceiver,"" says Kathleen Edge ""In two days I would get through a litre of vodka and four bottles of wine. Easily. ""I knew it was wrong. I knew it was too much."" Before the pandemic Kathleen Edge from Newport, south Wales, had what she described as a healthy relationship with alcohol. Like many people she started to drink a bit more when the stress, strain and boredom of lockdown started to take hold. And that relationship turned sour. 'He drinks six bottles of wine a day' Is my lockdown drinking normal? 'School was my only escape from mum's drinking' ""It got to the middle of December and my friend came over to bring a delivery up, and it had got to the point where I could not walk any moreâ¦ if I wanted to get between the bed and the sofa it was virtually crawling,"" she says. ""And I knew something was wrong. I said to him 'please just take the booze away - it is killing me'. ""I probably owe him my life. He told me I looked dreadful and that he would not leave until I had got help. Until I had got an ambulance."" Kathleen was taken by ambulance to the Grange University Hospital where she met a liver specialist It was at this point the seriousness of the situation really started to hit. ""They had to carry me out. It was very humiliating,"" Kathleen says. ""And I'm thinking 'you've got yourself into this position, there is Covid going on and you're calling an ambulance and this is really selfish'. But I needed an ambulance."" Kathleen went to the new Grange University Hospital near Cwmbran where she says she was lucky to see the liver specialist the next day. ""He said to me 'I think you have something to tell me. You need to say it out loud'. ""And I looked at him and said 'I'm an alcoholic'. That was the first time I had said it out loud and it was very freeing."" The town trying nights out without the booze Could non-alcoholic gin ever be as good as the real thing? Lime and soda? No thanks, say non-drinkers There are fears there could be more people out there like Kathleen who have not yet come forward to get help. Figures from the Kaleidoscope Project, which works on drug and alcohol abuse, suggest an eight percentage point drop year-on-year in the number of people who have problems with alcohol being referred by doctors or other health professionals. In the year to April 2021, 293 people were referred compared with 467 the year before. Self-referrals are down by more than four percentage points. Support services are now waiting to see what happens - hoping for the best and prepared for the worst. This video can not be played Nikki, a recovering alcoholic, describes how she stopped drinking during the pandemic. Rondine Molinaro from the Gwent Drug and Alcohol Service draws parallels between the pandemic and another cataclysmic event, which surprisingly, perhaps does give some hope. ""If you look at the example of American soldiers returning from the Vietnam War in the 1970s, all the drugs services in the US were set up for and prepared for these large cohorts of servicemen who had become addicted to opiates and heroin in Vietnam, continuing their dependency on their return,"" she said. Alcohol dependent mums-to-be urged to seek help Six charts on how the British drink The students opting for booze-free halls at university ""But that did not happen. I think 20% of the American troops were addicted to heroin in Vietnam, but as soon as they came back and their environment changed and those stresses had disappeared only 1% of those soldiers continued with a heroin dependency. ""Hopefully that's the same pattern that we will see, but we are prepared and we are waiting to see what happens over the next 12 months."" Support workers have noticed people from different backgrounds needing help for addiction The service has also noticed a subtle change in the type of person seeking support during the Covid crisis. Rondine explained: ""We are definitely seeing more professional people coming in - they have jobs and they have incomes. ""Our alcohol liaison officer interviewed two gentlemen, who because of the pandemic had been put on furlough. They had income coming in, but no productive activity and no work to go to. Alcohol deaths hit record high during pandemic Shoppers stock up on alcohol amid pub shutdown 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' ""They started to drink and became dependent on alcohol but did not know they were dependent on alcohol and actually ended up in A&E."" The Welsh government says it invests Â£55m every year on substance misuse. In 2020-21 a further Â£4.8m was also made available to support the response to Covid. This video can not be played Musician Nick Davis was in alcohol recovery when lockdown started and has had to find new ways to stay sober Kathleen is now living with the long-term effects that alcohol has had on her body. The damage to her liver caused severe swelling to her legs and she now has to walk with a stick. But she says she is determined to seize her second chance. ""Alcohol is a great deceiver,"" she said. ""It is your best friend, it makes you feel fantastic, it makes you feel good, but it is almost as if alcoholism is grooming you and it can blow up in your face. ""It is all in my hands now. I make the decisions. I have been incredibly lucky. I want to get to the point where we do not talk about it any more. I don't drink and that's that.""

"A squeeze on household finances will become more acute as a new, higher energy price cap takes effect. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, will see bills go up by Â£139 to  Â£1,277 a year, but the more energy a household uses, the higher their bill will be. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use will see a Â£153 increase. The cap has come under the spotlight owing to the crisis among suppliers, which has seen nine firms fold. Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap? Three more energy firms go bust amid gas price rise The cap limits how much providers can raise prices. Even so, the current increase is the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. It represents a 12% rise in energy prices at a time of the year when, charities point out, people are about to use more heating and lighting during colder, darker days. It also coincides with other price rises hitting family budgets and the withdrawal of Covid support schemes, although the government has promised to continuefinancial help for the poorest households. About 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland are affected by the changes. The cap does not apply in Northern Irelandwhere prices are overseen by a regulator. The regulator Ofgem sets a price cap for domestic energy twice a year. The latest level kicked in on 1 October. It is a cap on the price of energy and charges that suppliers can levy. A household's total bill is still determined by how much gas and electricity is used. The latest change means: Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, will see an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year - to their bill People with prepayment meters, with average energy use, will see an annual increase of Â£153 - from Â£1,156 to Â£1,309 Households with larger than average energy use will have a higher annual bill Households on fixed tariffs will be unaffected, but those coming to the end of a contract are automatically moved to a default tariff set at the new level. In the past customers have been able to shop around for cheaper deals, but currently, they won't find anything cheaper, due to the high price of gas. Adam Scorer, from fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said: ""The massive devastating increases in energy prices will drive over 500,000 more households into fuel poverty, leaving them unable to heat or power their homes."" Debbie Wright is about to move into her first flat, but said rising energy bills, as well as lower benefits payments, were detracting from the excitement of her potential independence. ""It's scary - you can't afford to live day by day,"" she said. ""Where is the extra money coming from?"" She was taking part in a life skills class run by charity Christians Against Poverty.

Shirley Bowen says people will be making tough choices this winter ""There have always been people that struggle to manage their finances and I don't think that will ever change. As soon as there is any expense that they don't expect, it knocks them off and they have to cry out for help. ""It is just going to spiral. It is obvious that there will be people who do not put the heating on this winter. Whether or not they will be able to cook for their kids, it will just be sandwiches and cereal, we will have to just wait and see."" Usually, the introduction of more expensive energy bills is accompanied with advice to consumers on standard tariffs to switch to a cheaper deal. The current crisis in the sector means that, this time, there is no availability of better offers. A tariff set at the price cap limit is the most competitive available. Instead, residents are being encouraged to save money by looking at the energy efficiency of their homes. The Energy Saving Trust said that the price rise could be more than outstripped by changes to our homes and habits. Mr Scorer, from National Energy Action, said: ""We can't lose sight of the long-term solution to reduce the energy waste in our homes. We have some of the least efficient housing in Europe. ""This has left the UK more exposed to the current soaring gas price than many other countries and we are wasting billions of pounds each year as heat escapes through leaky roofs, floors and ceilings."" The new cap was decided in August and is designed to reflect the unavoidable costs faced by energy suppliers. This came slightly ahead of a massive jump in wholesale gas prices which has led tothe collapse of nine suppliers in recent weeks. They have been unable to keep to the price promises they made to their customers, and were uninsured against the increasing costs. Avro Energy, for example, confirmed on Friday that it had fallen into administration. Its customers will be transferred to Octopus Energy, while its 103 staff will be kept on for at least the short-term to help with the change. The tariffs that will be charged for the 1.7 million customers moving to new suppliers after their previous provider collapsed are being set at the same level as the new price cap. Senior executives of bigger suppliers have argued that the price cap is making the situation worse. They say they are shouldering billions of pounds in additional costs by providing customers with energy that costs more to buy than they are allowed to sell it for under the retail price cap. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry, told the BBC's Today programme: ""It costs around Â£600 to take on a new customer at the moment because of the astonishing price of gas in the market and that's the main issue."" She added that more energy suppliers were expected to fail given the current ""volatile"" gas market. Firms have criticised Ofgem, claiming that it should have known many smaller suppliers would not be resilient in the face of gas price rises. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, rejected the criticism, saying that nobody could have predicted the huge rise in the cost of wholesale gas. He accepted that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills in the future. Ofgem will decide the level of the next price cap - which analysts predict to be considerably higher - in February, before it takes effect at the start of April. A spokeswoman for the regulator said: ""We are doing all we can to make sure consumers, especially people in vulnerable circumstances, do not pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter. ""Higher energy costs are never welcome news to anyone and the timing and size of this increase will be particularly difficult for many families still struggling with the impact of the pandemic.

"A squeeze on household finances will become more acute as a new, higher energy price cap takes effect. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, will see bills go up by Â£139 to  Â£1,277 a year, but the more energy a household uses, the higher their bill will be. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use will see a Â£153 increase. The cap has come under the spotlight owing to the crisis among suppliers, which has seen nine firms fold. Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap? Three more energy firms go bust amid gas price rise The cap limits how much providers can raise prices. Even so, the current increase is the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. It represents a 12% rise in energy prices at a time of the year when, charities point out, people are about to use more heating and lighting during colder, darker days. It also coincides with other price rises hitting family budgets and the withdrawal of Covid support schemes, although the government has promised to continuefinancial help for the poorest households. About 15 million households in England, Wales and Scotland are affected by the changes. The cap does not apply in Northern Irelandwhere prices are overseen by a regulator. The regulator Ofgem sets a price cap for domestic energy twice a year. The latest level kicked in on 1 October. It is a cap on the price of energy and charges that suppliers can levy. A household's total bill is still determined by how much gas and electricity is used. The latest change means: Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, will see an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year - to their bill People with prepayment meters, with average energy use, will see an annual increase of Â£153 - from Â£1,156 to Â£1,309 Households with larger than average energy use will have a higher annual bill Households on fixed tariffs will be unaffected, but those coming to the end of a contract are automatically moved to a default tariff set at the new level. In the past customers have been able to shop around for cheaper deals, but currently, they won't find anything cheaper, due to the high price of gas. Adam Scorer, from fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, said: ""The massive devastating increases in energy prices will drive over 500,000 more households into fuel poverty, leaving them unable to heat or power their homes."" Debbie Wright is about to move into her first flat, but said rising energy bills, as well as lower benefits payments, were detracting from the excitement of her potential independence. ""It's scary - you can't afford to live day by day,"" she said. ""Where is the extra money coming from?"" She was taking part in a life skills class run by charity Christians Against Poverty. All of those in the class used prepayment meters and were in receipt of food parcels. ""We are seeing all sorts of people in debt,"" said life skills manager Shirley Bowen.

"Sarah Everard was a talented and much-loved young woman, Lord Justice Fulford said A Met Police officer who murdered Sarah Everard after kidnapping her under the guise of an arrest has been sentenced to a whole-life prison term. Wayne Couzens abducted the 33-year-old as she walked home from a friend's house in south London on 3 March. During the sentencing of Couzens, the judge said the case was ""devastating, tragic and wholly brutal"". Ms Everard's family said they were relieved by the fact that Couzens would die in jail. Addressing reporters outside the Old Bailey following his sentencing, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said she recognised that a ""precious bond of trust"" had been damaged by Couzens,who had ""brought shame on the Met"". Describing him as a ""coward"", she said his crimes were ""a gross betrayal of everything policing stands for"", adding: ""I am so sorry."" This video can not be played Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick says the force has been ""shamed"" and ""rocked"" by the case An ongoingIndependent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) reviewof how Couzens became a Met officer has found that vetting procedures missed that two of his previous cars had been linked to allegations of indecent exposure. Speaking to the London Assembly's Police and Crime Committee earlier on Thursday, two senior Met officers said they were not aware of rumours that Couzens was nicknamed ""the rapist"" by colleagues. However, HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the nickname was known by some officers. Sir Tom, who in his role has responsibility for the inspection of police forces, told BBC Radio 4's the World at One: ""Yes, I did know that. And he also had allegedly a reputation in terms of drug abuse, extreme pornography and other offences of this kind."" What Couzens' colleagues knew or suspected about him remains the subject of the IOPC investigation. Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague How a police officer covered up Sarah Everard's murder When sentencing Couzens earlier on Thursday, Lord Justice Fulford described the circumstances of the kidnap, rape and murder as ""grotesque"", telling him he had ""betrayed"" his family. He said Ms Everard was ""an intelligent, resourceful, talented and much-loved young woman, still in the early years of her life"". The judge told 48-year-old Couzens: ""Notwithstanding your guilty pleas, therefore, I have seen no evidence of genuine contrition on your part, as opposed to evident self-pity and attempts by you to avoid or minimise the proper consequences of what you have done."" He said the seriousness of the case was so ""exceptionally high"" that it warranted a whole-life order. ""The misuse of a police officer's role such as occurred in this case in order to kidnap, rape and murder a lone victim is of equal seriousness as a murder for the purpose of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause,"" he told the Old Bailey. ""All of these situations attack different aspects of the fundamental underpinnings of our democratic way of life."" This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Reacting to the sentencing, Ms Everard's family said they were pleased with the full-life term, adding that although ""nothing can make things better, nothing can bring Sarah back... knowing he will be imprisoned forever brings some relief. ""Sarah lost her life needlessly and cruelly and all the years of life she had yet to enjoy were stolen from her. Wayne Couzens held a position of trust as a police officer and we are outraged and sickened that he abused this trust in order to lure Sarah to her death. The world is a safer place with him imprisoned. ""It is almost seven months since Sarah died and the pain of losing her is overwhelming. We miss her all the time. We hold her safe in our hearts."" Lucy Manning, BBC special correspondent, from the Old Bailey: Lord Justice Fulford called Couzens ""warped, selfish and brutal"" As Wayne Couzens was told he would spend the rest of his life in prison, he kept his head down as he has throughout his time in the dock. He was shaking as he was sentenced. The Everard family looked on. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was in court to hear the sentence. Her officer a convicted murderer and rapist. Mr Justice Fulford told Couzens his offences were ""warped, selfish and brutal"". The judge said Sarah ""was simply walking home"". After Couzens was sentenced, police officers who investigated the murder hugged the Everard family. But as her parents and sister said yesterday, all they want is Sarah back and no punishment will ever compare to the pain and torture Couzens had inflicted on them. Lord Justice Fulford paid tribute to the dignity of Ms Everard's family, whose statements in court on Wednesday ""revealed the human impact"" of Couzens' offending, which he said ""was both sexual and homicidal"". The judge added that Couzenshad eroded public confidence,externalin the police in England and Wales. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Met chief should quit over Everard case - Harman In a letter she wrote before Dame Cressida spoke to reporters, senior Labour MP Harriet Harman called on the Met Police commissioner to resign. Ms Harman saidwomen's confidence in the police ""will have been shattered"",externaland it would be impossible for Dame Cressida to oversee the changes needed to rebuild trust. Home Secretary Priti Patel said there were ""serious questions"" for the Metropolitan Police regarding the Couzens case, adding that the force ""will be held to account"". She described the crimes as ""sickening"" and said it was right that this ""monster"" had been given a whole-life sentence. When Parliament abolished the death penalty more than 50 years ago, it promised the British people that the worst of the very worst offenders would be locked up in jail for the rest of their lives. Since then a series of complex rules for judges has evolved in order for a ""whole-life order"" (WLO) to be imposed. The law says a WLO should ""normally"" only be considered if an offender has murdered more than once, killed a police or prison officer, abducted and sadistically killed a child, or where the motive was ideological. While MPs did not envisage such a serious crime as this when they wrote the law, they said judges could impose a WLO in other unthinkable cases where the seriousness of the crime was exceptionally high. Lord Justice Fulford concluded the misuse of a constable's role to deceive, kidnap, rape and murder Sarah Everard was as bad as terrorism. It was not only a crime of appalling and prolonged suffering for the victim, but it undermined trust in the police - part of the bedrock of a safe society. And that is why the law allowed the judge to order Couzens will never be released. The Old Bailey sentencing hearing had been told how Couzens used his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card and handcuffs to abduct Ms Everard as she walked from Clapham to her Brixton home on the night of 3 March. The firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, who had clocked off from a 12-hour shift at the US Embassy that morning, drove to a secluded rural area near Dover where he raped Ms Everard. She had been strangled with Couzens' police-issue belt by 02:30 GMT the following morning. Couzens, who was married with two children, then burned the marketing executive's body in a refrigerator in an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, near Ashford, before dumping the remains in a nearby pond. On 9 March, he was arrested at his home in Deal, Kent, after police connected him to the hire car he used to abduct Ms Everard. Her remains were found by police dogs the next day. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""sickened"" by the details that had emerged during sentencing. ""Our police are there to protect us - and I know that officers will share in our shock and devastation at the total betrayal of this duty. People must be able to walk on our streets without fear of harm and with full confidence that the police are there to keep them safe."" John Apter, national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said Couzens was ""an absolute disgrace to the police service"" and he was ""ashamed he was ever a police officer"". ""I am proud to carry a warrant card, but this vile individual's abuse of that authority has cast a shadow on all those who work within policing. He has brought disgrace to our uniform. ""The way he took advantage of Sarah's trust makes me feel sick to the stomach.""
