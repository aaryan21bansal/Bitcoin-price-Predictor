"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford: Governments could not persuade people ""this wasnât the year to get together over Christmas"" Tougher restrictions in Wales are being considered for the run up to Christmas, the first minister has confirmed. Mark Drakeford said he is ""looking carefully"" at similar coronavirus rules to those that will be in place in areas in theupper end of the tier systemsof England and Scotland. However he said they would ""most likely"" be imposed on a Wales-wide basis, rather than a tier system. The Welsh Government cabinet is due to discuss the matter on Thursday. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales Live he believes, unless further action is taken, ""we could end up at Christmas with a virus really heading very fast in the wrong direction"". He said: ""We're looking carefully at the tier system that they've got now in Scotland and in England, looking at what further restrictions they have at that point in the tier system where it begins to be effective, seeing if there's anything more we can take from that for Wales. ""Let me be clear I'm not talking about using a tiered system. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? Call for UK-wide Covid rules after Christmas Will Covid rule changes make or break Christmas? ""I'm looking to see what measures are in place at, say, tier three in Scotland and England. ""Are there things that they do there that we're not doing here in Wales, that we would do, most likely, on a Wales-wide basisâ¦ in the run up to Christmas. We've got four weeks left."" England'snew tier systemcomes into force when its lockdown ends next week, with Tier 3 being the highest level of restrictions. Under Tier 3, people must not meet indoors or in most outdoor places with people they do not live with or who are not in their support bubble, pubs and restaurants are closed except for takeaway and hotels and indoor entertainment venues must close. Scotland has afive-level systemthat runs from 0 to four. At Level 3 alcohol sales are not allowed and cafes and restaurants can only serve food and non-alcoholic drinks and must close at 18:00. Mr Drakeford said preventing people getting together would have helped moves to control the spread of coronavirus. However he admitted that Christmas was ""too important"" to people to ask them to not celebrate. ""If we could have persuaded people that this wasn't the year to get together over Christmas that would have been better from the virus's perspective, but we were never going to be able to do that,"" he said. ""In an incredibly difficult year we weren't going to be able to persuade people that they could just act as though Christmas wasn't happening."" Wales could see tough restrictions like in England and Scotland in the run-up to Christmas Asked whether Wales was ready to distribute a coronavirus vaccine, Mr Drakeford said: ""We have everything in place once a vaccine gets regulatory approval."" He added: ""Even the most promising vaccine is yet to have approval by the regulator. Once it gets it, within a week we are ready to start vaccinating people in Wales."" How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales If Wales were to use the Pfizer vaccine, which has to be stored at -70 degrees, he said the plan is to use equipment from the Welsh Blood Service. ""We can use the equipment the Wales Blood service already has to store material at that temperature and we can make it available for this vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine will have limitations, it will be difficult to transport but we will find ways of doing it. Whatever vaccine comes our way, we will want to use here in Wales.""

"This video can not be played What you need to know about Chancellor Rishi Sunak's speech â in two minutes The ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid-19 has only just begun, according to chancellor Rishi Sunak, as he warned the pandemic would deal lasting damage to growth and jobs. Official forecasts now predict the biggest economic decline in 300 years. The UK economy is expected to shrink by 11.3% this year and not return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022. Government borrowing will rise to its highest outside of wartime to deal with the economic impact. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects the number of unemployed people to surge to 2.6 million by the middle of next year. It meansthe unemployment rate will hit 7.5%, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2009. However, fewer jobs are expected to be lost than predicted this summer. Setting out his Spending Review detailing how much would be spent on public services, Mr Sunak said the government was dealing with an ""economic emergency"". He added: ""That's why we have taken, and continue to take, extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes."" The government hassubsidised the wagesof employees unable to work due to the pandemic, in an effort to protect jobs. It saidextending these schemes to next Marchmeant 300,000 fewer people would be out of work. Mr Sunakconfirmed that around 1.3 million public sector workers - excluding some NHS staff and those earning less than Â£24,000- will have their pay frozen next year. The chancellor said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis. But Mr Sunak said lower-paid public sector workers would be guaranteed at least a Â£250 pay rise next year. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, criticised the pay freeze. She said: ""Earlier this year the chancellor stood on his doorstep and clapped for key workers. Today, his government institutes a pay freeze for many of them. This takes a sledgehammer to consumer confidence."" Civil servant Robert said he was 'deeply disappointed' Robert, a 25-year-old civil servant and representative for the PCS Union, saidhe was ""deeply disappointed"". ""[Civil servants] have spearheaded the response to the pandemic and worked tirelessly to deliver Brexit. We've stepped up and delivered... and I'd like to be recognised for that."" Having worked for various government departments since graduating from university a few years ago, he says he feels ""let down"". Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance How will the Spending Review affect you? The UK economy remains in rescue mode The minimum wage - which has been rebranded as the National Living Wage - will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to Â£8.91 an hour, with the rate extended to those aged 23 and over. Other rates were also increased. From next April, 16 and 17 year-olds will see their pay go up to Â£4.62 per hour, from Â£4.55 today. TheUK also ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national incomeon overseas aid to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home. Mr Sunak said the new 0.5% target - which adds up to about Â£4bn in savings - will be ""temporary"". Andmillions of retirees will see the future value of their pension cutowing to a planned change in the way payments are calculated from 2030. Mr Sunak said the government had already spent Â£280bn to help support the economy through the coronavirus. It will spend a further Â£55bn next year as part of a package of measures to support the recovery. This includes billions of pounds to help people find jobs. The UK is expected to borrow Â£393.5bn this financial year to help pay for economic relief measures. Borrowing is also forecast by the OBR to remain above Â£100bn-a-year - or 4% of the size of the UK economy - in five years time. In recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable. At the moment it pays just 0.32% interest to borrow for ten years. However, Mr Sunak said long-term scarring meant the economy would be 3% smaller in 2025 than expected in the March budget. What is GDP? Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Sunak cuts UK overseas aid budget Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million The OBR said the coronavirus pandemic had ""delivered the largest peacetime shock to the global economy on record"", while recent restrictions across the UK had taken ""the wind out of an already flagging recovery"". It said the UK's later and longer lockdown this spring meant it had experienced ""a deeper fall and slower recovery in economic activity"" than some of its European neighbours. The independent forecaster also warned that tax rises or spending cuts would be needed in future years to stabilise the UK's growing debt pile. Richard Hughes, the OBR's chairman said: ""The chancellor will need to find Â£20bn to Â£30bn in spending cuts or tax rises if he wants to balance revenues and day-to-day spending, and stop debt rising by the end of this parliament."" Is that the end of it? The official forecasts assume that 2 December spells the end of lockdown, that we remain in the equivalent of Tier 3 restrictions until the spring - and then the vaccine becomes widely adopted in the second half of 2021. Too cautious - or optimistic? If anything, 2020 has taught us that assumptions can last as long as a disposable face covering. But it'll take longer for economic life to spring back to rude health. Reviving job prospects, investment and consumption will take TLC. Even when the official crystal ball gets misty, in 2025, output is still 3% lower than it was previously expected to be. And that's without the  risk of a no-deal; the OBR says that could mean that output is a further 1.5% by 2025. Some economists think the hit could be greater (indeed, the Governor of the Bank of England says the long term impact of a no- deal could exceed that of a virus). Rishi Sunak has to decide when to turn off the support to the convalescing economy - and when to  start  patching up the public finances by firing up tax rises. The extreme uncertainty underlines how fraught - and costly - that decision could be. House prices are expected to fall in 2021 and 2022. The OBR expects a recent revival in the market to end next year when astamp duty holidaystops in March and more people lose their jobs as government support schemes are pared back. However, the end of the tax break is expected to contribute to a 3.5% fall in house prices next year and a further 2.6% drop in 2022. The OBR added: ""Despite a steady recovery from 2022 onwards, the level of house prices remains around 17% lower (in 2025) compared to our March forecast."" The OBR said the ""unresolved nature"" of the negotiations between the UK and EU over a Brexit deal had ""further clouded"" the economic outlook. It said failure to secure a deal would reduce the size of the UK economy by a further 2% in 2021, with permanent damage to growth and living standards in future years. Under this no-deal scenario, the economy would not return to the size it was before the pandemic hit until the second half of 2023, while unemployment would peak at a higher rate of 8.3%.

"US President Donald Trump has pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The president said the widely expected act of clemency was his ""Great Honor"". Mr Flynn was convicted during a justice department inquiry into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. Leading Democrats condemned the pardon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it ""an act of grave corruption and a brazen abuse of power"". The White House said that the pardon would finally end ""the relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Flynn, who admitted in 2017 to lying to the FBI about contacts with Russia's ambassador but then tried to withdraw his plea, responded by posting a tweet containing a US flag emoji and a Biblical verse, Jeremiah 1:19. The verse says: ""'They will fight against you but will not overcomeÂ you, for I am with youÂ and will rescueÂ you,' declares theÂ Lord."" The retired US Army three-star lieutenant general was an early and ardent supporter of Mr Trump during the 2016 campaign, though he had been a life-long Democrat before. Mr Flynn was among the new president's first appointments - Mr Trump brought him on just days after winning the election. The two saw eye-to-eye on many issues, including the advantages of closer ties with Russia, renegotiating the Iran nuclear deal and combating the threat from Islamic State militants. Profile: Michael Flynn, Trump's ex-adviser The White House revolving door: Who's gone? But he lasted just 23 days as national security adviser, the president's chief counsellor on international affairs and defence. Mr Trump fired him after it emerged that he had discussed lifting sanctions on Russia with Moscow's ambassador to Washington before Mr Trump took office, and misled the vice-president about that conversation. This video can not be played ""Michael Flynn's loyalty to Trump has paid off"" - former Trump adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman Although he initially agreed to co-operate with prosecutors, Mr Flynn asked to withdraw his guilty plea in January this year, arguing he had been duped into the agreement. The Department of Justice had sought for his charges to be dropped, prompting a legal battle that ran for much of 2020. Former President Barack Obama said he had warned Mr Trump against hiring the former general less than 48 hours after the November 2016 election. Mr Flynn's supporters see him as the victim of a political vendetta by the outgoing Obama administration to de-legitimise the incoming Trump administration with claims of Russian collusion. A 22-month inquiry led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller concluded in 2019 that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election, but found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The White House statement on Wednesday described Mr Flynn as ""the victim of partisan government officials engaged in a co-ordinated attempt to subvert the election of 2016"". Mr Trump has made frequent but unsubstantiated claims that millions of votes were illegally cast in 2016, and continues to make similarly unsubstantiated claims of fraud in the 2020 poll. Pardons wipe out a conviction while commutations lessen the punishment - both are clemency rights granted to the president by the Constitution. It is common for outgoing presidents to issue pardons. This video can not be played Are presidential pardons Trump's secret weapon? Mr Trump currently has the least number of pardons and commutations of any modern US president,according to the Pew Research Center,external. His predecessor Barack Obama granted 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations - the most since President Harry Truman. Here are some of the big names from the 28 pardons and 16 commutations Mr Trump has issued so far: Roger Stone, a long-time ally, who was convicted last year of lying to Congress and witness tampering. He had his prison sentence commuted Arizona's ""toughest sheriff""Joe Arpaio, convicted of criminal contempt after defying an order to stop patrols targeting suspected undocumented immigrants, was pardoned Former vice-president Dick Cheney's chief of staffScooter Libby, who was found guilty of lying about leaks to the media, was also pardoned Women's voting rights pioneerSusan B Anthony, who was convicted of illegal voting and fined in 1873 was granted a posthumous pardon Crystal Munoz, Judith Negron and Tynice Hall, three mothers of young children who were serving sentences for drug and white-collar crimes and whose cases were brought to the president by Kim Kardashian, had their sentences commuted US media report that a number of Trump allies are also hoping for clemency in the days to come, including ex-advisers Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, who were both convicted in the Mueller investigation. Republicans described Mr Flynn as a hero who suffered an unfair prosecution. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said: ""General Flynn was NOT a Russian agent. Instead, he was the victim of a politically motivated investigation and prosecution where the ends justified the means."" In the US House of Representatives, Republican minority leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted: ""What happened to @GenFlynn was a national disgrace. No American should ever be targeted for simply belonging to a certain political party."" But Democrats swiftly condemned the move. Ms Pelosi said in a statement: ""Sadly, this pardon is further proof that Trump plans to use his final days in office to undermine the rule of law in the wake of his failed presidency."" House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler said in a statement:Â ""This pardon is undeserved, unprincipled, and one more stain on President Trump's rapidly diminishing legacy.""

"The show has defended its use of ""non-invasive"" species Police have given ""suitable advice"" to the producers of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! following complaints about the use of non-native bugs. The TV series is taking place in north Wales instead of the Australian jungle due to Covid-19 restrictions. Welsh naturalist and BBC Springwatch presenter Iolo Williams has questioned whether a licence was gained to release bugs into the wild. The show has defended the use of animals in its trials. A range of insects have been used on celebrities such as athlete Sir Mo Farah, TV presenter Vernon Kay and journalist Victoria Derbyshire during this year's trials. I'm A Celebrity defends animal use in trials The man teaching Ant and Dec to speak Welsh Mr Williams initially raised questions over the programme's use of the creatures last week when he tweeted: ""As well as the moral issue of using wild animals for entertainment, surely there are huge ecological issues here also.""

"Millions of retirees will see the future value of their pension cut owing to a planned change in the way payments are calculated from 2030. Many of those with so-called defined benefit workplace pensions see their pension payments increase each year in line with the rising cost of living. The way this annual rise is calculated is expected to become less generous from February 2030. Chancellor Rishi Sunak ruled out making a change any earlier. Rishi Sunak: Economic emergency has only just begun Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Women and new retirees will be hardest hit by the changes which were revealed in documentsreleased alongside the chancellor's Spending Review,external, but not mentioned in Mr Sunak's speech. Over time, the value of their pensions could be thousands of pounds less than they might have expected. A 65-year-old now will see their total retirement income drop by 4% or 5% compared with their expectations. That is an Â£8,000 drop for a 65-year-old woman with average life expectancy. The proposed changes do not affect the state pension, which will rise by 2.5% in April in line with the government's triple-lock promise. Investors - often pension funds - who buy index-linked gilts (government debt sometimes linked to RPI inflation) would have been hit harder had the change been made earlier. However, there will not be any compensation for those affected, the chancellor has decided. From 2030, there could be some benefit to commuters and those paying back student loans, owing to the changes. The rising cost of living is calculated using various measures, including the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation. National statisticians believe this is no longer a valid measure, saying that other measurements are more reliable. As a result, in 2030 RPI is likely to be aligned with another, newer, measure of inflation called CPIH, which is the Consumer Prices Index plus housing costs. This is generally lower, often by about 0.8%, although the gap is currently narrower. The chancellor could have signalled a change as early as 2025, but said no change should occur before 2030. Some financial products and bills are pegged to RPI, when they increase each year. They include interest on student loans, and the annual rise in rail fares. However, the most significant link is to the majority of defined benefit (often final salary linked) workplace pensions in the private sector. Each year, retirees see their pension increased in line with inflation, as measured by RPI. The same is true of workplace pension pots where contributions have stopped, usually because the holder has moved job but is not yet old enough to draw the pension. In 2010, George Osborne as chancellor switched public sector pension annual uprating from RPI to the, mostly-lower, Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation. As RPI will most likely be lower from 2030 than people would otherwise have expected, so the annual increase in their pension will be lower than they had planned. Women (who live longer) and new retirees (who face years of a less generous pension from 2030) would be affected the most, according to the Pensions Policy Institute. Investors - particularly pension funds - also hold index-linked gilts, which is government debt linked to RPI inflation. These would also become less valuable if RPI was lower. But, pension funds would also pay out less to members in retirement - so how big a hit they face depends on their mix of their investments and what they have to pay out to pensioners. The chancellor ruled out reforming RPI before 2030 because current 10-year index-linked gilts would have matured by then. Anyone investing in them from now will be aware of the change. Tom Selby, from investment firm AJ Bell, said: ""From 2030 onwards the message is unequivocal: if you are negatively impacted by this, tough. The government is clear it will not provide any kind of compensation to those who lose out as a result of the downgrade in the value of RPI."" Official statisticians say RPI should be reformed earlier, irrespective of the effects, but others oppose the move. ""We regret the government's decision that the change should not be made before 2030,"" said Sir David Norgrove, who chairs the UK Statistics Authority. ""It is UK Statistics Authority policy to address the shortcomings of the RPI in full at the earliest practical time. The change we propose can legally and practically be made by the authority in February 2030. ""We continue to urge the government and others to cease to use the RPI, a measure of inflation which the Government itself recognises is not fit for purpose."" But Stian Westlake, chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society, said: ""The government's plan to replace RPI with CPIH is a clear case of using the wrong tool for the job. CPIH is a totally different measure which produces totally different results - and it may have negative consequences for consumers, workers and savers ""As the CPIH is to replace the RPI, then a full review should be conducted to look into what the possible consequences will be, and how to avoid the likely problems.""

"This video can not be played ""We're at war with a virus, not with one another"": President-elect Biden calls on Americans to unite against Covid-19 US President-elect Joe Biden has called for an end to the ""grim season of division"", as the country faces a long, hard winter with Covid-19. In a speech for the Thanksgiving holiday, he said Americans were at war with coronavirus, not each other. The US saw more than 1.2 million cases last week, with 2,200 deaths on Tuesday - the highest number since late May. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump urged supporters to work to overturn the results of the 3 November election. Speaking via phone from the White House to an event organised by Republican state legislators in Pennsylvania, Mr Trump repeated unsubstantiated claims about widespread electoral fraud. Obama attacks Hispanic voters who picked Trump Could Biden's win doom this town? What is the presidential transition? ""We have to turn the election over,"" he said, adding that it was ""rigged"". Mr Trump had been expected to attend the event in person but the trip was cancelled after two associates of his lawyer Rudy Giuliani tested positive for the virus. Mr Giuliani attended in person. Mr Biden won the election with a comfortable victory in electoral college votes, and the transition to his presidency is already well under way. Mr Trump's efforts to challenge the results in key states in courts have so far failed. On Wednesday, China's President Xi Jinping sent a message congratulating Mr Biden, more than two weeks after his victory was projected by US media. However, a number of world leaders have still not reached out to the president-elect, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, who said on Wednesday that he would not offer congratulations until ""the electoral process in the US ends"". In his speech on Wednesday, Mr Biden told the nation: ""I believe you always deserve to hear the truth from your president. We have to slow the growth of this virus. We owe it to the doctors and the nurses and the frontline workers... We owe it to our fellow citizens."" He said Covid-19 had ""brought us pain and loss and frustration"" and cost many lives.

'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked ""It's divided us, angered us, set us against one another. I know the country's grown weary of the fight, but we need to remember - we're at war with the virus, not one another. ""We have to steel our spines, redouble our efforts and recommit ourselves to the fight."" The president-elect urged Americans to modify their Thanksgiving celebrations. He said that instead of the usual large gathering he would be spending the holiday with just his wife Jill and their daughter and son-in-law, while the rest of the family would be in small groups. Millions of Americans are travelling to be with their loved onesdespite warnings from health officials, although numbers are down on previous years. Mayor ignores own Thanksgiving travel advice The president-elect vowed that in due course, the pandemic would be beaten. ""I know that we can and will beat this virus,"" he said. ""Life is going to return to normal, I promise you. I believe this grim season of division... is going to give way to a year of light and unity.""

More than 260,000 Americans have now died with the virus, the largest number of any country in the world, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. Mr Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process to begin on Monday, nearly three weeks after the presidential election. Mr Biden can now access key government officials and millions of dollars in funds as he prepares to take over the presidency on 20 January. He will also receive the Presidential Daily Brief - an update on international threats and developments. Aide Jen Psaki said he would get his first briefing on Monday, and classified information was already being shared with Mr Biden's senior team. On Tuesday he named six key posts in his administration, including his picks for secretary of state and national security adviser. He is set to name more staff including his economic team next week.

"Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet at home during the Christmas period A UK-wide approach to coronavirus rules after Christmas is needed, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. The UK government and ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have agreedthree householdscan meet from 23 December until 27 December. Mr Drakeford said it ""makes sense"" to ""respond to the consequences of greater household mixing"" together in the aftermath of the five-day period. The UK government said it was ""a key example"" of a unified UK-wide response. Mr Drakeford said his own family would make ""some modest use of the freedoms"". Mark Drakford says he was ""cheered"" by the four nations' ability to reach an agreement Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, he said: ""I am cheered up by the fact that by meeting together four times, we've been able to reach a common position on the five days of Christmas. ""But I want us to reach a common position on how we approach the aftermath of Christmas as well and I think it makes sense to do that across the United Kingdom as well - have a common approach to responding to the consequences of greater household mixing. Caution urged over coronavirus Christmas rulesl The new lockdown rules How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas ""I do think that getting around the table together to go through a plan for it should be the next step [in] what I think of as the successful way in which we've been able to plan together for the five days of Christmas itself."" Under the agreement for Christmas, made at a meeting of Cobra on Tuesday afternoon: Travel restrictions will be eased to provide a window for households to come together Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet at home during the period Bubbles must be fixed and ""must not be changed or extended further"" Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, a place of worship or an outdoor public place Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called for the Welsh Government to ""keep a close eye"" on infection rates and impose further restrictions if necessary. Mr Price also called for quicker test results so ""tracing teams can begin their work of clamping down on cases and possible clusters or outbreaks"". Christmas Covid rules: Who are you allowed to see? Support bubbles: How do they work and who is in yours? Covid: What can you do as Wales' firebreak lockdown ends? The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Paul Davies, claimed it was Mr Johnson who had suggested the ""collaborative approach"". Meanwhile a UK government spokesman added: ""We welcome the desire of the Welsh administration to work even more closely with the UK government, delivering for communities across all four corners of the country."" This video can not be played Abby wants her family to be together at Christmas - but there are too many households However some scientists have warned that the relaxation of Covid restrictions over the festive period couldspark another waveof infections and further deaths. They said a typical Christmas gathering at home was the type of environment where infections could spread. People have been advised to take precautions when meeting their Christmas bubble, such as washing hands frequently and opening windows to clear potential virus particles. Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet indoors during the Christmas period When asked what his plans were for Christmas, Mr Drakeford said: ""I am looking forward to seeing some members of my family who I haven't been able to meet indoors for many, many months now, but we will do it in a very contained, careful way. ""We certainly won't be mixing with people who are vulnerable or whose age puts them at a particular disadvantage. ""I am looking forward to being able to make some modest use of the freedoms."" When asked about introducingÂ tougherÂ restrictionsÂ ahead of Christmas, he said his cabinet would meet on Thursday ""to see whether or not the position in Wales means that we have to introduce some further restrictions to create the headroom we need to be able to use those five days over Christmas in a responsible way"". Â Â On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said an agreement to relax Covid rules over Christmas wasnot ""an instruction to meet with other people"". ""So it's not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation. It's having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but we'll do it in a controlled way.""

"The Duchess of Sussex has revealed she had a miscarriage in July, writing in an article of feeling ""an almost unbearable grief"". ""I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second,"" Meghan saidin a piece for the New York Times,external. She went on to describe how she watched ""my husband's heart break as he tried to hold the shattered pieces of mine"". Meghan wrote that ""loss and pain have plagued every one of us in 2020"". The 39-year-old shared her experience to urge people to ""commit to asking others, 'are you OK?'"" over the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Profile: Duchess of Sussex Becoming a mother has been 'struggle' - Meghan Harry and Meghan to step back as senior royals A source close to the duchess confirmed to the BBC that the duchess is currently in good health and the couple wanted to talk about what happened in July, having come to appreciate how common miscarriage is. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""It's a deeply personal matter we would not comment on."" The duchess and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, moved to California to live away from the media spotlight, after stepping back as senior royals in January. Their first child, Archie, was born on 6 May 2019. The duke and duchess visited southern Africa in 2019 with their son Archie The duchess began her article by describing a ""sharp cramp"" she felt while looking after Archie. ""I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right,"" she wrote. ""Hours later, I lay in a hospital bed, holding my husband's hand. I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears. ""Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we'd heal."" Meghan made it clear from the first event that she spoke at as Harry's bride-to-be that she wanted women's voices and women's experiences to be heard more clearly. Now she has written of her loss, and her heartbreak. She has set it in the context of a year of breathtaking turbulence. And she has made a plea for tolerance and compassion. She weaves in the struggles of so many with Covid-19, the battles over truth and lies in our divided age, the killing of black Americans by the police. And on an experience that so many women have lived through, she has made her grief a way of bringing miscarriage closer to the everyday conversation. The duchess continued: ""Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few. ""In the pain of our loss, my husband and I discovered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suffered from miscarriage. ""Yet despite the staggering commonality of this pain, the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning. ""Some have bravely shared their stories; they have opened the door, knowing that when one person speaks truth, it gives license for all of us to do the same."" The duchess alsoreferenced a TV interviewin which she was asked by a journalist if she was ok, during her tour of South Africa last year. She said she was asked the question during a time in which she was ""trying to keep a brave face in the very public eye"". ""I answered him honestly, not knowing that what I said would resonate with so many - new moms and older ones, and anyone who had, in their own way, been silently suffering,"" she said. The duchess is the second member of the Royal Family to open up about having a miscarriage. In 2018 the Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindallspoke about suffering two miscarriagesbefore having her second child. The duchess's miscarriage happened at a time when she was involved in legal action against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a letter she wrote to her father. Last month she was granteda postponement of her privacy trialuntil autumn next year. An estimated one in four pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, according to the charity Tommy's. Tommy's midwife Sophie King said talking about baby loss in pregnancy is ""a real taboo in society"" so ""mothers like Meghan sharing their stories is a vital step in breaking down that stigma and shame"". She said the duchess's ""honesty and openness"" sends a ""powerful message to anyone who loses a baby: this may feel incredibly lonely, but you are not alone"". This video can not be played âI lost eight pregnancies in nine yearsâ Clea Harmer, chief executive of stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said it was a ""sad reality"" there was a stigma surrounding pregnancy loss and baby death, which ""leaves many parents feeling isolated"". ""The isolation we have all felt this year has made it even more difficult for parents whose baby has died during the Covid-19 pandemic and has brought back painful emotions for all those who have lost precious loved ones,"" she said. Dr Christine Ekechi, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said it was ""important"" that any stigma or shame surrounding this issue was removed. ""Sadly, early miscarriages are very common and they can be a devastating loss for parents and their families,"" she said. And Alice Weeden, from charity the Miscarriage Association, told the BBC: ""When somebody, particularly in the public eye, talks about it openly, it's helpful for other people to know that they are not alone."" By Smitha Mundasad, BBC health reporter There are around 250,000 miscarriages every year in the UK alone, the majority occurring within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. It is a shockingly common experience, often dealt with privately at home or swiftly in hospitals. Many parents carry their grief silently and can feel society expects them to ""get back to normal life"" too soon. But charities and scientists say much more needs to be done to acknowledge the longer-term effects of pregnancy loss. Research suggests that one in six women go on to have symptoms of post-traumatic stress. For some, nightmares and flashbacks continue for many months while anxiety and depression are also common afterwards. Partners report suffering too, with one in 12 facing similar issues. Pregnancy experts in the UK say it is vital that women and partners are offered psychological support, alongside physical help, yet this kind of care is often under-resourced. Often, it is not known why miscarriages occur - whether in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, and many pregnancy losses cannot be prevented. Usually, something goes wrong with the development of the foetus in the womb. Warning signs can include bleeding and/or cramping pain in the lower tummy. Pregnant women are advised to seek medical advice if they have either of these symptoms. If you or someone you know has been affected by issues with pregnancy,the following organisations may be able to help.

"The UK has ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home. A junior minister, Baroness Sugg, has quit over the move, calling it ""fundamentally wrong"" at a time of ""unprecedented"" global crisis. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was hard to ""justify"" the policy with the UK facing record borrowing. The cut - to 0.5% of national income - will save about Â£4bn a year. Mr Sunak said this would be ""temporary"" and the 0.7% target would return when finances allowed. Kuenssberg: Sunak grapples with a political paradox Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance The move has been criticised by some Conservatives, who point out that it was a key promise in the party's 2019 general election manifesto. Baroness Sugg, who was David Cameron's chief of staff when he was PM, has quit as minister for sustainable development, overseas territories and the Caribbean. In a letter to Boris Johnson, she said it was ""fundamentally wrong"" to abandon the foreign aid promise, which ""should be kept in the tough times as well as the good"". He responded by praising the minister's ""passion and commitment"" to her work and her ""efforts in support of girls' education in particular"". Currently, the UK commits 0.7% of national income to overseas aid. In 2019, it spent Â£14.6bn ($19.4bn) compared with $34.6bn by the US and $23.8bn by Germany -according to figures from the OECD.,external But if you look at overseas aid spending as a percentage of national income, the UK currently beats them and comes out top of the G7 group of the wealthiest nations. Germany trails closely behind on 0.6%, with France spending 0.44% and the US on 0.16%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that even after the UK drops to 0.5% next year it ""would remain the second-highest aid donor in the G7"". That's right - Germany would take over the lead but France could soon take second place - as itwants to raise its aid contribution to 0.55%,externalof national income in 2022. Mr Sunak did say the government's ""intention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal situation allows"" but he gave no specific timeline. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence committee, told BBC News the foreign aid cut ""will come back and haunt us in the long term"". He said it would reduce British influence, increase poverty and instability - and ""allow China and Russia to take advantage"" by moving quickly to fill the ""vacuum"". In the Commons, Rishi Sunak said the government had to make ""tough"" choices, as he set out his Spending Review for the year ahead. He added that 0.5% of national income would be spent on overseas aid in 2021 - the equivalent of Â£10bn - and the UK would still be the second-highest aid donor in the G7 group of major economies. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is a vocal critic of the aid cut Mr Cameron said the 0.7% promise said ""something great"" about the UK, adding: ""These were brilliant things that we were doing, and I think it's sad that we are standing back from that."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, described Mr Sunak's decision as ""shameful and wrong"". ""I join others in urging MPs to reject it for the good of the poorest, and the UK's own reputation and interest,"" he wrote on Twitter. Oxfam chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah was among dozens of charity bosses to criticise the decision. He said: ""Cutting the UK's lifeline to the world's poorest communities in the midst of a global pandemic will lead to tens of thousands of otherwise preventable deaths."" Baroness Sugg says UK aid spending is a 'source of pride' And Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of turning his back on the world's poorest, adding that it was ""in Britain's national interest to lay the foundations for economic growth across the world"". But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""At last we have a Conservative chancellor that understands Conservative voters on foreign aid."" And Conservative MP Philip Davies said people in the ""real world"" will back the cut. ""I suspect that the vast majority of the British public won't be asking why has he cut so much, they will probably be asking why are we still spending so much,"" he added. Former Conservative Prime Ministers Sir John Major and his Labour successor Tony Blair were among those calling for the 0.7% target to be kept. It could also face opposition from some Tory MPs, including former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, when the Commons votes on it.

"Families on Universal Credit face ""agonising uncertainty"" after Rishi Sunak did not confirm what would happen to their benefits next year, campaigners say. Universal Credit claimants were given a Â£20-a-week boost in response to the coronavirus pandemic in April. The temporary rise is due to come to an end in April 2021. The chancellor did not say whether the increase would be extended, or cut, in his spending review. Speaking after delivering his statement to MPs, he said the increased payment would continue until next spring. Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise He added: ""Let's get through winter, see where we are with the virus and what the economy looks and decide then how best to support people. ""Everyone can rest assured we remain committed to making sure we look after the most vulnerable in our society."" Footballer and anti-poverty campaigner Marcus Rashford tweeted: ""Is the Universal Credit uplift going to be taken away in April?"" Paul Noblet, from youth homelessness charity Centrepoint, said: ""The government's failure to commit to retaining the current uplift in Universal Credit is hugely disappointing and will weigh heavily on the minds of millions of people for whom the Â£20 a week increase has made a huge difference. ""There is still time for the government to reflect on this issue between now and the end of March and we urge them to think again."" Marcus Rashford has helped force government U-turns on school meals The chancellor set out his spending priorities for the year ahead earlier, warning that unemployment is set to peak at 2.6 million next year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. But he faced criticism from opposition MPs for not mentioning what would happen to benefit rates in his speech. Labour MP Stephen Timms, chairman of the work and pensions committee, said: ""Millions of people on Universal Credit are now facing the Christmas period in agonising uncertainty, not knowing whether the government will cut their income by Â£20 a week next April. ""Meanwhile, those on older benefits, who have already missed out on the rise because the DWP's systems are too old-fashioned, will receive an increase of just 0.5% next year.

"Johnny Depp has been refused permission to appeal against a High Court ruling which concluded that he assaulted his ex-wife Amber Heard. The Pirates Of The Caribbean actor sued the publisher of the Sun, News Group Newspapers (NGN), for libel over a 2018 article labelling him a ""wife beater"". The judge whodismissed Mr Depp's claim this monthsaid an appeal did not have a ""reasonable prospect of success"". But he gave him until 7 December to apply directly to the Court of Appeal. Mr Justice Nicol's ruling on the application to overturn his judgement came last week - and was made public on Wednesday. He also ordered the actor to make an initial payment to NGN of almost Â£630,000 for its legal fees. Mr Depp and Ms Heard both gave evidence during the 16-day case at the Royal Courts of Justice in London in July. The allegations spanned the period between 2013 and 2016, when the couple's relationship ended. Mr Depp, 57, denied the claims and his lawyer called the judge's ruling ""perverse"" and announced the actor intended to appeal. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp split up in 2016 Mr Depp sued the Sun after a column by its executive editor Dan Wootton referred to ""overwhelming evidence"" that the actor attacked Ms Heard, 34, during their relationship. Mr Justice Nicol ruled the newspaper had proved what was in the article to be ""substantially true"". He found that 12 of the 14 alleged incidents outlined had occurred. The judge highlighted three incidents where he said Mr Depp had put Ms Heard in ""fear for her life"". In one of those incidents, in Australia in 2015, Mr Depp was allegedly physically and verbally abusive towards her while drinking heavily and taking drugs. Mr Depp accused Ms Heard of severing his finger, but the judge said he did not accept Ms Heard was responsible. The judge rejected a ""recurring theme"" in Mr Depp's evidence ""that Ms Heard had constructed a hoax and that she had done this as an 'insurance policy',"" and that she was a ""gold-digger"". In the April 2018 column, the Sun asked how author JK Rowling could be ""genuinely happy"" that Mr Depp had been cast in the latest film in the Fantastic Beasts franchise she had written, amid allegations made by Ms Heard. After losing the case,Mr Depp said he had left the franchise,adding he had been ""asked to resign"" from his role as Gellert Grindelwald and had ""respected that and agreed to that request"".

"Video showed Kylie Moore-Gilbert being driven away in a mini-van A British-Australian academic serving a 10-year sentence in Iran for espionage has been freed, with Tehran saying it was a swap for three jailed Iranians. In a statement, Kylie Moore-Gilbert thanked those who had worked for her release and said that leaving Iran was ""bittersweet"". Dr Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, had been detained in Iran since September 2018. She was tried in secret and strongly denied all the charges against her. According to Iranian state media, she was exchanged for an Iranian businessman and two Iranian citizens ""who had been detained abroad"". They have not yet been named. News of the exchange first came on Wednesday in a statement on the website of the Young Journalist Club, a news website affiliated to state television in Iran. ""An Iranian businessman and two Iranian citizens who were detained abroad on baseless charges were exchanged for a dual national spy named Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who worked for the Zionist regime,"" it said.

""Thank you also to all of you who have supported me and campaigned for my freedom, it has meant the world to me to have you behind me throughout what has been a long and traumatic ordeal,"" she said. ""I have nothing but respect, love and admiration for the great nation of Iran and its warm-hearted, generous and brave people. It is with bittersweet feelings that I depart your country, despite the injustices which I have been subjected to. I came to Iran as a friend and with friendly intentions, and depart Iran with those sentiments not only still intact, but strengthened."" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she was ""extremely pleased and relieved"" at the release of Dr Moore-Gilbert which she said ""was achieved through diplomatic engagement with the Iranian government"". She made no reference to any exchange of prisoners. ""The Australian government has consistently rejected the grounds on which the Iranian government arrested, detained and convicted Dr Moore-Gilbert. We continue to do so,"" she said in a statement. Iran rejects appeal over doctor sentenced to death Jailed academic 'rejected Iran's offer to be spy' Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Senator Payne said Dr Moore-Gilbert would ""soon be reunited with her family"" but did not specify when she would be returning to Australia. Dr Moore-Gilbert had been travelling on an Australian passport when she was detained at Tehran airport in 2018 as she tried to leave following a conference. In letters smuggled out of Tehran's Evin prison earlier this year, the Cambridge-educated academic said she had ""never been a spy"" and feared for her mental health. She said she had rejected an offer from Iran to become a spy. ""I am not a spy. I have never been a spy, and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country,"" she wrote. Concerns for her wellbeing escalated in August when news emerged that she had been transferred to Qarchak, a notorious prison in the desert. She was visited shortly afterwards by Australia's ambassador to Iran, Lyndall Sachs, who reported that she was ""well"". Kylie Moore-Gilbert was reported to have been in solitary confinement and on several hunger strikes while in Evin prison in Tehran Iran has detained a number of foreign nationals and Iranian dual citizens in recent years, many of them on spying charges. Human rights groups have accused Tehran of using the cases as leverage to try to gain concessions from other countries. British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed on spying charges in 2016. She has always maintained her innocence. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, welcomed reports of Dr Moore-Gilbert's release. ""Nazanin and I are really happy for Kylie and her family,"" he told the BBC. ""They have been through so much, borne with such dignity. And it is an early Christmas present for us all, that one more of us is out and on their way home, one more family can begin to heal.""

"Matthew Mowbray previously admitted downloading hundreds of indecent images of children A former Eton College teacher has been convicted of sexual offences against pupils during ""nocturnal"" visits to their bedrooms. Matthew Mowbray, 49,went into boys' roomsunder the guise of discussing schoolwork, Reading Crown Court heard. He was found guilty of eight counts of sexual activity with a child and not guilty of one against a girl. The defendant previously admitted six counts of making indecent images of children and one of voyeurism. One complainant said Mowbray groped his bottom with a ""forceful squeeze"" Mowbray, of Locks Heath, Southampton, was dismissed from his role at the boys' boarding school, near Windsor, Berkshire, following his arrest. His trial heard he would pay regular ""nocturnal visits"" to boys ""for his own sexual gratification"". One complainant said Mowbray groped his bottom with a ""forceful squeeze"", while another pupilsaid he ""felt really uncomfortable and just froze""when he was sexually touched by the geography teacher. Eton College was founded by King Henry VI in 1440 and has about 1,300 pupils Following his conviction, Marc Thompson, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""Mowbray's victims described feeling uncomfortable with his nocturnal visits to their rooms. ""Whilst not overtly sexual acts, they knew the touching was wrong, but were at a loss to know what to do. ""Mowbray's intentions became clear with the discovery of the indecent images on his computer, it was through this evidence we were able to prove to the jury that the manner in which he touched the boys was intended to satisfy his own sexual desires."" Simon Henderson, head teacher at Eton College, said he was ""outraged"" by the way Mowbray had ""abused his position of trust and betrayed those in his care"". He added there was a ""palpable sense of betrayal, coupled with shock and deep regret that we did not identify his offending earlier"". He said staff would be ""redoubling our efforts to ensure that Eton remains an ever more open and supportive environment for all of our pupils, so that they can continue to feel confident to come forward with any concerns that they may have"". He offered his ""unreserved apologies"" to those affected and paid tribute to their ""extraordinary courage and dignity"". Mowbray did not give evidence in his trial. He will be sentenced at Reading Crown Court at a later date. He was granted bail on the condition he does not contact parents or staff from Eton College, must not enter Eton or the surrounding area, and must not have unsupervised contact with children who are under the age of 16.

"Fire fighters will be affected by the pay freeze Some 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, but low-paid and NHS staff will get raises Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he could not justify across the board rises when many people in the private sector had seen cuts in pay and hours. However, he said 2.1 million public sector workers earning below the median wage of Â£24,000 were ""guaranteed a pay rise of at least Â£250"". More than a million NHS workers will also get a raise, he said. Meanwhile, the minimum wage - which has been rebranded as the National Living Wage - will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to Â£8.91 an hour, with the rate extended to those aged 23 and over. The pay freeze, which was trailed in unconfirmed news reports last week, has sparked anger from unions which say it will affect key workers who have played a vital role during the pandemic. Delivering his Spending Review, the chancellor said the ""majority"" of the UK's public sector workers will see their pay increase in 2021. But he added that pay rises for the rest - about 1.3 million out of a total of 5.5 million public sector workers - will be paused ""to protect jobs"". However, that figure only covers 1.3 million people working for the central government. The total rise could be much higher if local government and devolved pay agreements are frozen. Sunak: Economic emergency has only just begun Millions face cut in value of company pensions He highlighted a disparity between public sector and private sector wages, adding he ""cannot justify a significant, across-the-board"" pay increase for all public sector workers in the circumstances. ""Instead, we are targeting our resources at those who need it most,"" he said. Police Federation chairman John Apter called the pay freeze a ""disgrace"" John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation union, called the pay freeze a ""kick in the teeth"" for police officers. ""Rewarding those who have played a vital role in the fight against the virus with a pay freeze is nothing short of a disgrace,"" he said. ""A handful of officers will get the additional Â£250 for the lowest paid workers, but only those who are already on an appallingly low starting salary for the dangerous job they do."" Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said nursing staff would oppose plans to freeze the pay of equally skilled professionals. ""Those working in social care and the community deserve a pay boost as much as their NHS colleagues."" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the chancellor had delivered a ""body blow"" to staff in schools and colleges. ""Education workers are key workers who have kept the country going during the pandemic but pay cuts are their only reward from this government."" Teacher Esme says she is not surprised the government is freezing pay for many workers. ""Clearly money will need to be clawed back from the damage to the economy, however the concern is how long for?"" She says it will have ""quite an impact"" on her as someone fairly new to the profession, after what has been an ""incredibly challenging year in education"". ""After getting barely any support, the proposal to freeze pay is another confirmation that the government has very little appreciation or respect for the profession, or those working within it."" At the end of last year, the Low Pay Commission - which advises the government on the National Living Wage wage - had said the rate would rise by 6% in April 2021. But the commission has revised this down amid fears it would cost struggling businesses too much and damage jobs. Mr Sunak said the plans would mean the average full-time worker on the rate will see their annual income rise by around Â£345 next year. ""Compared to 2016 when the policy was first introduced, that's a pay rise of over Â£4,000,"" he added. He added that around two million people would benefit from the widened eligibility for the National Living Wage. Bryan Sanderson, chair of the low pay commission, said: ""Recommending minimum wage rates in the midst of an economic crisis coupled with a pandemic is a formidable task. ""We have opted for a prudent increase which consolidates the considerable progress of recent years and provides a base from which we can move towards the government's target over the next few years.""

"Video showed Kylie Moore-Gilbert being driven away in a mini-van A British-Australian academic serving a 10-year sentence in Iran for espionage has been freed, with Tehran saying it was a swap for three jailed Iranians. In a statement, Kylie Moore-Gilbert thanked those who had worked for her release and said that leaving Iran was ""bittersweet"". Dr Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, had been detained in Iran since September 2018. She was tried in secret and strongly denied all the charges against her. According to Iranian state media, she was exchanged for an Iranian businessman and two Iranian citizens ""who had been detained abroad"". They have not yet been named. News of the exchange first came on Wednesday in a statement on the website of the Young Journalist Club, a news website affiliated to state television in Iran. ""An Iranian businessman and two Iranian citizens who were detained abroad on baseless charges were exchanged for a dual national spy named Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who worked for the Zionist regime,"" it said.

""Thank you also to all of you who have supported me and campaigned for my freedom, it has meant the world to me to have you behind me throughout what has been a long and traumatic ordeal,"" she said.

"The Chancellor has delivered his Spending Review - setting out government plans for the economy and spending Rishi Sunak said the government is set to borrow a record Â£394bn this year He told MPs unemployment will rise to 2.6 million by the second quarter of 2021 Mr Sunak said the economy is predicted to contract by 11.3% and grow by 5.5% next year and 6.6% in 2022. Public sector pay will be frozen, except for NHS staff and those earning under Â£24,000 The BBC has been told that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public sector pay freeze Spending on overseas aid will be cut from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income next year The spending plans don't include any tax changes - they are only announced in the Budget The economy has been hit by the cost of borrowing for the coronavirus pandemic and job losses The Office for Budget Responsibility published its forecasts for the economy and public finances The OBR warned the economy is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until the end of 2022 The chancellor told the cabinet this morning the OBR figures were ""sobering"" Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon and Howard Mustoe BBC Politics That's where we'll end our coverage and analysis of the Spending Review, and this week's Prime Minister's Questions. Our reporting today was brought to you by Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Kate Whannel, and Howard Mustoe, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. Thanks for following along with us. Good night.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his Spending Review statement in the Commons earlier Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Chancellor leaving No 11 this morning On rare occasions, nervous chancellors leave No 11
gripping their documents, to deliver news to the country that resets the dial. That happened today. The pandemic has already cost jobs and
hardships, but there can now be no doubt that the economic aftermath will last
for many years. The predictions of job losses, record levels of borrowing and
debt - all huge headlines in themselves. In the last few months, with
almost no dissent, the government has scrambled to expand the state to
help cope with coronavirus. Borrowing rates are at rock bottom. Other countries
have done the same. There is little controversy about the decisions that have
been taken so far. But what lurks on the countryâs balance sheet is the biggest
economic baggage for generations. There is almost zero political pressure to
solve the problem any time soon. But eventually the pressure will force a
reckoning in the Tory party. Itâs a Conservative chancellor - whose
instinct is to pare back the state - who has presided over a generational emergency
expansion. How Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson propose to solve that paradox will
create the contours of political arguments at least until the next election. BBC Politics The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out what the UK government will spend on health, education, transport and other public services next year.  Here's a recap on the main points: For more detailsyou can read more here. The chancellor visited the Imperial Centre for Translation and Experimental Medicine in West London After delivering his speech in the Commons earlier, the chancellor visited the National Institute for Health Research in west London where he met staff, and was talked through the process followed by vaccine volunteers. Speaking to reporters Rishi Sunak said with ""record peacetime debt levels"" he had to make some ""tough decisions"" in his Spending Review. He said the ""fiscal and economic situation"" meant decision had to be made to ""focus on the priorities of the British people"". Asked about the public sector pay freeze, Mr Sunak said ""if you look at the private sector, people are losing their jobs, hours are being cut wages are being cut, and in the context of that, it wouldn't be fair or right to have an across the board increase in public sector pay."" He said the targeted approach ""still means a majority of public sector workers will see an increase in their pay next year, which is a fair and reasonable approach to take"" BBC Politics Earlier today we said 1.3 million people would be directly affected by the central government public sector pay freeze. Here is a bit more detail on that stat. In total there are 5.5 million public sector workers. Around a million NHS workers and 2.1 million lower paid workers won't be affected. The freeze announced today does not apply those paid by local or devolved government - although those bodies may also decide to implement their own  pay rise pause. If that happens the total number of public sector workers impacted will be much higher. Earlier today, Rishi Sunak announced a Â£4bn ""levelling up"" fund to pay for upgrading local infrastructure across the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's PM, Labour Mayor for Greater Manchester Andy Burnham describes the fund ""distinctly underwhelming"". Because the fund is open to every single local authority, he argues that the money will not be prioritised in the areas where it is needed. He also says there will be a Â£20m cap on any project. ""We're talking modest train stations, bus interchanges, small roads - I don't think that amounts to a major strategic plan to level up poorest regions,"" he says. And he notes that local areas will have to apply to central government to get money. ""This is Whitehall wanting to hoard the money and the power,"" he says adding that the funding should be devolved to regions of England. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter The headline figure for Northern
Ireland is Â£920m â but when you break it down, more than half is in relation to
Covid-19 spending, with Â£380m for Stormontâs nine departments to share on
day-to-day matters. The Finance Minister Conor
Murphy has made it clear heâs less than impressed with whatâs been dished out. Heâs also concerned about where
this leaves the executive in terms of investing for economic recovery, both
from the impact of coronavirus and to mitigate any problems arising with Brexit
next year. Decisions on pay awards for
public sector workers are devolved to Stormont, so that will be a difficult
discussion the executive will need to have soon â but Mr Murphy said he did not
support the idea of âdividingâ those providing critical services across the
country. The DUP â former
confidence-and-supply partners of the Conservative Party â has welcomed the
funding announcement but said it would have liked to see armed forces and
police officers included with those who are in line for a pay rise. Read more on the reaction from Northern Ireland here Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC Scotland's Nine The Scottish government will get Â£2.4bn from this Spending Review to spend as it
wishes. A total of Â£570m will go towards maintaining EU funding for farming and another Â£14 million for
fishing. It will also get a portion of the Â£800m ""levelling up"" fund that is being split across the four nations. But a lot of the other spending plans had already been announced, such as freeports and city deals. The majority of public sector pay is met by the Scottish government - apart from some civil servants - so the pay freeze wonât directly impact majority of public sector workers. But it could indirectly hit them through less money being available through the block grant given to them by the UK government. Ministers in Scotland had been calling for a more generous support package and a commitment to the Universal Credit uplift, and are likely to repeat demands for greater financial
powers. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also called on the chancellor to reverse the cut in foreign aid
spending, calling it ""deplorable"". On Twitter she said,externalit ""is a political gesture to the right wing of the Tory party, and the price of it will be paid by some of the poorest people in the world."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC Wales The
spending review today confirms an extra Â£1.3bn for the Welsh Government - some
of which is an increase in their core spending budget, and some of it is extra
cash as a result of more spending in England to tackle coronavirus. The
UK Government's also outlined plans to spend Â£240m to support farmers and
land managers in Wales, and Â£2m to support fisheries. A farmers union claim
this is a cut of at least Â£95m compared to previous EU funding. But UK Government ministers insisted they are
honouring a commitment to maintain farm incomes. There
are still questions, however, about what funding Wales is going to get to
replace EU funding for the poorest regions of the UK. European structural and investment funding in Wales
amounts to approximately four times the UK average per person. West Wales and
the Valleys received the highest level of EU Structural Funds available in each
funding period for the past twenty years. The
Treasury have announced the replacement fund - known as the Shared Prosperity
Fund - will at least match EU funds UK-wide. But what's not yet clear is whether
Wales will get the same amount it did from the EU. UK ministers previously
promised Wales would not get ""a penny less."" You can read more reaction from Wales here Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Local businessman Peter Boys says Rossendale has faced four decades of austerity Back in East Lancashire, and some are finding the figures from the Office of Budget Responsibility - predicting the biggest economic decline in 300 years - hard to fathom. Peter Boys is the director of
B+E Boys, a family construction firm which is one of the biggest employers in
Rossendale. He says the numbers are so huge the scale is âvery difficult to understand.â âYou just know itâs a large number and itâs going to take some sorting out some point in the future, perhaps not this generation, but for the generation to follow, and I do worry about that,"" he says. But Peter warns against more austerity measures for his part of the world. âTowns like Rossendale have
not only had a decade of austerity, theyâve probably had about four decades of
austerity, from the late 80s and the early 90s, with industry taken out of the
country, and we started to see more imports of goods,"" he says. âWeâve suffered since then
really, so it really needs some funding to back that up in the future.â Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Lewis and Oliver are both on the hunt for jobs I've been
speaking to people in Rossendale and Darwen, East
Lancashire, about what they needed from the chancellor in today's Spending Review. For Oliver and Lewis, both 19, it is jobs, with both men unemployed and looking for work. Oliver was a commercial
bodyworks engineer but was made redundant during the pandemic and has been
looking for work ever since. âItâs demoralising,"" he said. ""Youâre applying for jobs all day and you get no response half of the
time, and if you do get a response itâs a no, and thatâs no way to live your
life.â Lewis says heâs probably applied for about 50 jobs recently, describing the hunt as ""horrible"" and ""painful"". He said: âI thought going to college
would be a good idea to get my experience up and that would be the push to get
a job. ""But Iâve got nothing so far... so Iâm stuck here with qualifications I
canât use.â Former Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, has
said itâs a ""very sad moment"" that the government hasabandoned its commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid. Mr Cameron has said the chancellor is making ""a
mistake"". He told reporters it was a promise made that the government doesnât have to break. The former PM said he ""totally
understands"" the economic climate and that difficult decisions have to be made, but the commitment was a
manifesto promise and was set down in legislation. He added that commitment ""really said something about Britain"" and allowed the country to do âbrilliant thingsâ. Head of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady tells BBC News the public sector pay freeze will hit ""the very people who have been caring for the rest of us throughout this crisis"". And she argues that the Â£250 pay rise for low earners ""won't go very far when food and rent are taking into account"". She says the Treasury is justifying the pay freeze on the grounds that those in the public sector are paid more than the private sector. However she says this is incorrect and cites a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which found that once qualifications and age are taken into account, there is no difference between private and public salaries. The
BBC understands that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public
sector pay freeze. Sonny, Melissa, Matt and Robert told us what they thought of the chancellor's spending plans The coronavirus pandemic has hit young people across the UK hard.

with no reassurance forthcoming"" about Universal Credit. The charity's director, Helen Barnard, said there was ""no conceivable scenario in which this support will
not be needed"" and the government's ""inaction risks a sharp rise in poverty"". She added: ""Itâs not too late for the chancellor to do the right thing. ""We urge the government in the strongest terms
to correct its course and commit to making the Â£20 uplift permanent and extend
it to legacy benefits at the earliest opportunity.â Historically, economists often got twitchy when a country's debts exceeded the vale of its annual output, since it raised concerns about whether the debts would be repaid. But the cost of borrowing is now close to zero. But those low rates must hold, says the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is there to check
over the Treasury's sums. The OBR thinks debt interest payments as compared to revenue will actually fall to historical lows because interest rates are so low. But debt compared to gross domestic product (GDP) will rise to 105%, it thinks. ""So
long as these conditions hold, a debt-to-GDP ratio over 100 per cent should not prove
particularly onerous by historical standards,"" says the OBR. TheCounty Councils Network,external- which represents England's 37 county councils and county unitary authorities - has welcomed a rise in funds from the chancellor's spending review. Councillor David Williams, chairman of the group and leader of Hertfordshire County Council, said the Â£1.55bn - plus Â£300m for adults and
childrenâs social care would ""ease
the burden on councils next year, especially in relation to the continuing
costs of the coronavirus"". But he said there was still ""an onus on local authorities raising
more from council tax to fund their social care costs"". Councillor Williams added: ""With councils facing
an underlying funding shortfall before the pandemic, they still face some
difficult decisions next year on what services to reduce."" Last month, the County Councils Network warned about the risks to servicesas many councils face huge problems balancing their books. Earlier this year the England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford forced the government into a U-turn onextending free school meals.

The government increased Universal Credit by Â£20 a week during the pandemic. However it has insisted this is only a temporary measure to support those financially hit by coronavirus. The raise is currently due to expire at the end of March next year. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Today's assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed not just that the pandemic hit the UK economy this year by the biggest amount in three centuries, 11.3%, but that it was also set to be the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations. It also said that government borrowing in this year was 19% of the size of the economy, a peacetime record, just under Â£400bn in one year. And yet the paradox is that next year the amount of money it costs to fund that debt will also reach a post-war record: a record low. Since World War Two, our debts have never been bigger. And yet they've never been cheaper. How long this situation will last is the fundamental judgement for this chancellor. Read more from Faisal Islam here. Reality Check Chancellor
Rishi Sunak defended the governmentâs decision to cut foreign aid spending from
0.7% of national income to 0.5%. He said that, even after the change next
year, âthe UK would remain the second highest aid donor in the G7â. According
to the latest data from theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,external(OECD) the UKâs current foreign aid budget is smaller in absolute terms than both the
United Statesâ and Germanyâs. In
2019, the UK spent $19.4bn (Â£14.6bn) on foreign aid, while the US allocated
$34.6bn (Â£25.9bn) to foreign aid and Germany spent $23.8bn (Â£17.9bn). Mr
Sunak has said that UK aid spending will fall to $13.3 (Â£10bn) in 2021. Both
the US and Germany have larger economies than the UK so when you look at aid
spending as a proportion of national income, the UK â with its current 0.7% -
ranks higher than them â and tops the list of the G7 wealthiest countries: When
the UK aid budget falls to 0.5% next year - it will drop behind Germany (0.6%),
putting it in second place in the G7 - as the Chancellor said. But
if the reduced aid budget remained the same into 2022, the UK would alsofall behind France,external- which plans to increase its aid budget to 0.55% of GDP by 2022 Mr
Sunak did say the governmentâs âintention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal
situation allowsâ but gave no specific timeline.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999838
"Millions of retirees will see the future value of their pension cut owing to a planned change in the way payments are calculated from 2030. Many of those with so-called defined benefit workplace pensions see their pension payments increase each year in line with the rising cost of living. The way this annual rise is calculated is expected to become less generous from February 2030. Chancellor Rishi Sunak ruled out making a change any earlier. Rishi Sunak: Economic emergency has only just begun Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Women and new retirees will be hardest hit by the changes which were revealed in documentsreleased alongside the chancellor's Spending Review,external, but not mentioned in Mr Sunak's speech. Over time, the value of their pensions could be thousands of pounds less than they might have expected. A 65-year-old now will see their total retirement income drop by 4% or 5% compared with their expectations. That is an Â£8,000 drop for a 65-year-old woman with average life expectancy. The proposed changes do not affect the state pension, which will rise by 2.5% in April in line with the government's triple-lock promise. Investors - often pension funds - who buy index-linked gilts (government debt sometimes linked to RPI inflation) would have been hit harder had the change been made earlier. However, there will not be any compensation for those affected, the chancellor has decided. From 2030, there could be some benefit to commuters and those paying back student loans, owing to the changes. The rising cost of living is calculated using various measures, including the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation. National statisticians believe this is no longer a valid measure, saying that other measurements are more reliable. As a result, in 2030 RPI is likely to be aligned with another, newer, measure of inflation called CPIH, which is the Consumer Prices Index plus housing costs. This is generally lower, often by about 0.8%, although the gap is currently narrower. The chancellor could have signalled a change as early as 2025, but said no change should occur before 2030. Some financial products and bills are pegged to RPI, when they increase each year. They include interest on student loans, and the annual rise in rail fares. However, the most significant link is to the majority of defined benefit (often final salary linked) workplace pensions in the private sector. Each year, retirees see their pension increased in line with inflation, as measured by RPI. The same is true of workplace pension pots where contributions have stopped, usually because the holder has moved job but is not yet old enough to draw the pension. In 2010, George Osborne as chancellor switched public sector pension annual uprating from RPI to the, mostly-lower, Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation. As RPI will most likely be lower from 2030 than people would otherwise have expected, so the annual increase in their pension will be lower than they had planned. Women (who live longer) and new retirees (who face years of a less generous pension from 2030) would be affected the most, according to the Pensions Policy Institute. Investors - particularly pension funds - also hold index-linked gilts, which is government debt linked to RPI inflation. These would also become less valuable if RPI was lower. But, pension funds would also pay out less to members in retirement - so how big a hit they face depends on their mix of their investments and what they have to pay out to pensioners. The chancellor ruled out reforming RPI before 2030 because current 10-year index-linked gilts would have matured by then. Anyone investing in them from now will be aware of the change. Tom Selby, from investment firm AJ Bell, said: ""From 2030 onwards the message is unequivocal: if you are negatively impacted by this, tough. The government is clear it will not provide any kind of compensation to those who lose out as a result of the downgrade in the value of RPI."" Official statisticians say RPI should be reformed earlier, irrespective of the effects, but others oppose the move. ""We regret the government's decision that the change should not be made before 2030,"" said Sir David Norgrove, who chairs the UK Statistics Authority. ""It is UK Statistics Authority policy to address the shortcomings of the RPI in full at the earliest practical time. The change we propose can legally and practically be made by the authority in February 2030. ""We continue to urge the government and others to cease to use the RPI, a measure of inflation which the Government itself recognises is not fit for purpose."" But Stian Westlake, chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society, said: ""The government's plan to replace RPI with CPIH is a clear case of using the wrong tool for the job. CPIH is a totally different measure which produces totally different results - and it may have negative consequences for consumers, workers and savers ""As the CPIH is to replace the RPI, then a full review should be conducted to look into what the possible consequences will be, and how to avoid the likely problems.""

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: Government set 'to fund the priorities of British people' The number of unemployed people in the UK is expected to surge to 2.6 million by mid-2021, Rishi Sunak has warned. In his Spending Review, the chancellor said the ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid-19 had ""only just begun"". The government expected to borrow Â£394bn this year - the ""highest"" level ""in our peacetime history"" - he added. The latest figures show 1.62 million people are unemployed, a number which has risen by more than 300,000 since last year. In the House of Commons, Mr Sunak said the government would spend Â£280bn this year ""to get our country through coronavirus"". He also announced that most public sector workers would have their pay frozen, with only the lowest paid, as well as nurses, doctors and other NHS staff, getting a salary rise. Chancellor warns of 'lasting' damage to UK economy How many people could become unemployed? Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance And the chancellor said spending on overseas aid, as a proportion of national income, would be 0.5% in 2021-2 - down from the 0.7% currently set in law. The document accompanying Mr Sunak's statement makes no mention of extending the temporary Â£20 uplift in Universal Credit beyond next April, but this is expected to be reviewed in the new year. The last time the UK unemployment figure was as high as 2.6 million was in May to July 2012. The number exceeded three million from 1983 to 1987 and for a few months in early 1993. Mr Sunak told MPs the economy was predicted to contract by 11.3% this year - ""the largest fall in output for more than 300 years"" - and grow by 5.5% next year and 6.6% in 2022. He added: ""Even with growth returning, our economic output is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels until the fourth quarter of 2022. And the economic damage is likely to be lasting."" The government's Covid response, including furlough, has led to huge spending rises, at a time when its income from taxation is down. Mr Sunak said the UK was expected to borrow Â£394bn this year, which was predicted to fall to Â£164bn next year and Â£105bn in 2022-3. Some other Spending Review announcements were trailed before his statement, including: An extra Â£3bn for the NHSin England to help tackle the backlog of operations delayed due to Covid An increase in defence spending A Â£4.6bn package to help the unemployed back to work The chancellor had intended - as usual - to set out plans for the next three years, but this was reduced to just one year due to the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic. For Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said a longer-term spending review was needed soon ""to build a future for our country as the best place in the world to grow up in and the best place to grow old in"". She criticised Mr Sunak for not mentioning Brexit in his speech, with the UK set to leave the EU single market and customs area at the end of the year. Ms Dodds added: ""There's still no trade deal. So does the chancellor truly believe that his government is prepared and that he's done enough to help those businesses that will be heavily affected?"" Why should I care what Rishi Sunak says? How much will coronavirus cost the UK? The Office for Budget Responsibility said that if no deal was reached, and the UK and EU had to trade under World Trade Organization rules - including tariffs - this could ""reduce real GDP"" by 2% in 2021, on top of the damage caused by coronavirus. The economic shock of the ""various temporary disruptions to cross-border trade and the knock-on impacts"" would continue for years, it predicted. But a Treasury spokesman insisted the government was confident about the future of the UK, whatever the outcome of negotiations with Brussels. He said the chancellor was focussed on Covid, which he described as the ""core economic challenge"" and ""the one that matters today to people's jobs"". Dave Prentis, general secretary of the union Unison, called the pay freeze for most public sector workers ""austerity, plain and simple"" and a ""bitter pill"" for those affected.

"The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has vowed to ""do more"" after an internal investigation prompted by human rights abuse reports. The probe comes after a series of articles published last year by BuzzFeed News. These accused the WWF of funding and working with anti-poaching guards who allegedly tortured and killed people in national parks in Asia and Africa. ""We feel deep and unreserved sorrow for those who have suffered,"" the WWF said. A 160-page report released on Tuesday,externalsaid the charity ""should have been more transparent"" and needed to ""more firmly engage governments to uphold human rights"". But some accused the WWF of a ""lack of contrition"" after the report's publication, and have demanded apologies and a change in how the charity is run. Last March,BuzzFeed published a series of articles,externalaccusing the WWF of funding ""vicious paramilitary forces to fight poaching"". Indigenous people and villagers had been shot, beaten unconscious, sexually assaulted, and whipped by armed guards in parks in places like Nepal and Cameroon, the news site said. The conservation charity funds, equips and works with these guards, the report said, accusing some staff of turning a blind eye to abuses. Poaching the creature that's more valuable than gold Humans are wiping out wildlife populations BuzzFeed said it carried out a year-long investigation in six countries, based on more than 100 interviews and thousands of pages of documents, including confidential memos, internal budgets, and emails discussing weapons purchases. After the publication of the Buzzfeed report the WWF commissioned an independent review into the allegations, vowing to complete it as soon as possible. Former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay led the panel of independent experts. The panel said there was no evidence the WWF staff directed or took part in any of these alleged abuses, and that those accused of abuses were employed by local governments and not by the conservation group. But the report criticised the WWF's response to allegations of abuses, particularly in terms of how it worked with local governments and how it handled complaints. For instance, it highlighted the WWF's work in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Salonga National Park. WWF staff were ""aware of the potential for human rights abuses by ecoguards"", the report said, but did not ""develop an effective plan to prevent and respond to abuses"". DR Congo's national parks are home to endangered species like gorillas When WWF staff reported allegations of human rights abuses to senior WWF officials in the DRC in 2016, a decision by senior management in the country to investigate the allegations was never implemented, ""apparently out of concern"" of resistance from a state conservation group. ""A desire to avoid conflicts with the government cannot excuse WWF from complying with its responsibility to respect human rights,"" the report said. DRC explores drilling for oil in parks Gorillas, guns and guerrillas - a deadly mix in an African park Another section examines Kaziranga National Park in India. In 2017 the BBC reported that authorities there were given the power to shoot suspected poachers dead in a bid to protect the wildlife. One campaigner told the BBC that major animal conservation groups, including the WWF, turned a blind eye to the park's activities. The park that shoots people to protect rhinos Addressing the BBC article, the report says ""the actions of WWF India cannot be seen as supportive of a 'shoot on sight' policy"", saying they only learnt of many of the allegations from news reports and that WWF India's support for the State Forest Departments there has been ""measured and appropriate"". Until the last few years, the panel said, ""there was no consistent and unified effort... to address complaints about human rights abuses allegedly committed by ecoguards in the Congo Basin and rangers in Nepal and India."" It said the group's own ""diverse and complex structure"", with local and national organisations acting under the umbrella of the WWF, had ""further complicated"" how abuse reports had been handled. The panel recommended the WWF implement its own policies on human rights protections more rigorously and increase its efforts to be transparent.

Despite the panel's ""damning findings"", the conservation group ""fails to take responsibility for its shortcomings or issue a sincere apology to the many individuals who have suffered human rights abuses carried out in their name"", it said.

"The number of domestic abuse offences recorded by police in England and Wales has increased during the pandemic. But the Office for National Statistics said such offences gradually rose in recent years so it cannot be determined if it was related to the pandemic. Police recorded 259,324 domestic abuse offences between March and June - 7% up on the same period in 2019. During and after the first lockdown in April, May and June, roughly one-fifth of offences involved domestic abuse. TheONS data,external, released on Wednesday, includes information from a range of sources - including police forces' own figures on the number of offences recorded and then flagged as related to domestic abuse. Domestic abuse is not a specific criminal offence, so police record incidents under the type of offence (for example, assault with injury) but then flag that it is related to domestic abuse. 'My boyfriend held me under hot water in lockdown' Domestic abuse helpline sees lockdown surge Escape from my lockdown abuser in five objects In April, May and June - which covers the period during and immediately after the first national coronavirus lockdown - domestic abuse offences took up a larger proportion of all offences compared to previous years. Around 20% of all offences recorded by police were flagged as domestic abuse related during these months - compared to less than 15% in previous years. The number of offences also rose each month, the figures showed. One woman, Davina, told the BBC that it was increased time at home with her abuser that made her seek help. ""Lockdown was the worst time in my life,"" she told BBC Scotland's The Nine programme. ""That was when I first paid attention to Women's Aid, I wondered if they could get me out the situation, so took the number from the television. ""I wasn't allowed to use the phone in the house so I took the number and went out with the dog and I phoned it. ""I wasn't ready to go but they had nowhere for me anyway. But I was in constant contact with Rebecca from Women's Aid and she helped me eventually leave. ""If it hadn't been for them I don't know what would have happened. I think eventually I would be dead. Mentally, physically, emotionally - I couldn't do it any more."" Davina was allocated a place in a refuge and although she says it took her a month to stop waking up in the night crying, she finally feels safe. Read more here. As the lockdown eased, the proportion of offences flagged as domestic abuse went down. But this was likely because the overall amount of criminal offences increased when lockdown was lifted. Between March and June, police recorded 206,492 ""violence against the person"" offences that were flagged as domestic abuse - a 9% rise on the same period in 2019. The ""violence against the person"" category includes offences such as harassment, assault and murder. Other offences outside this category can also be flagged as linked to domestic abuse, such as sexual offences. And provisional data showed there were 64 domestic homicides in England and Wales recorded by police between January and June 2020 - 30 of them in the period between April and June. This is nearly 10 more than the same period in 2019, although the figure is slightly lower than in 2018. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Domestic abuse - âYouâre with each other 24/7' ""The number of domestic abuse-related crimes recorded by the police continued to increase in the year ending March 2020; this may reflect improvements in police recording and an increase in victims' willingness to come forward,"" said Helen Ross, from the ONS's Centre for Crime and Justice. ""Up-to-date evidence shows this increase continued into the lockdown period - however, it cannot be determined whether this can be directly attributed to the coronavirus pandemic."" Ms Ross added that data showed there had been an increase in demand for domestic abuse support services during the pandemic, particularly following the easing of lockdown measures. ""Data suggests that experiences of domestic abuse may have intensified during the lockdown and that victims faced difficulties in safely seeking support under these conditions,"" she said. Charities dealing with domestic abusehave reported a surge in appeals for helpsince the start of the pandemic. Earlier this week, train companies and charity Women's Aidconfirmed they were extending a schemethat offers free travel to people fleeing domestic abuse. The ""Rail to Refuge"" scheme - which provides free tickets for women, men and children travelling to refuge services - will continue until March next year. The charity New Era, which helps victims in Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent, said the ONS figures was ""more disturbing"" evidence and showed there was ""more to do to tackle and end relationship abuse"". Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced that Â£3.7m of City Hall and government money would be invested in measures to support victims of domestic abuse. He said it would be funding new ""safe spaces"" for victims, training for police and schemes focused on perpetrators, adding: ""Sadly, we already know that during lockdown home is not always a safe place for everyone.""

"A mural of The Beatles, painted on a wall in the Baltic Triangle area of their home city Liverpool Craig Brown's book One Two Three Four: The Beatles in Time has won a leading non-fiction award, the Baillie Gifford Prize, whose judges said it had ""reinvented the art of biography"". The book tells the history of the Fab Four through a mixture of diaries, letters, interviews and charts. The annual Â£50,000 prize is given to the UK's best non-fiction work. Martha Kearney, the chair of the judges, described the book as ""a highly original take on familiar territory"". It amounted to ""a joyous, irreverent, insightful celebration of the Beatles"", the broadcaster said. Author and journalist Brown has written 18 books. He told the BBC on Wednesday, the fact that so many other good books about the band already existed actually ""freed me up to whatever kind of book I wanted"". He said: ""I could go down much more peculiar paths than if say only one or two books have been written. ""It let me pursue, in particular, minor figures associated with The Beatles, or minor figures knocked out of the way by The Beatles. Or people who hated The Beatles, or strange fans or hangers-on. ""So I could go down these peripheral paths, which if I had just been writing an authorised biography or a normal kind of chronological book or something like that, I wouldn't have been able to do."" Craig Brown also writes Private Eye's diary column For 30 years Brown has also penned a parodic diary column in Private Eye. He was therefore able to see the funny side when someone tried (and failed) to adopt his identity to intercept his winnings. ""The organisers told me this morning they got an email from someone with a sort of Gmail thing with my name asking them to put the money in a PayPal account,"" he laughed.

"The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has vowed to ""do more"" after an internal investigation prompted by human rights abuse reports. The probe comes after a series of articles published last year by BuzzFeed News. These accused the WWF of funding and working with anti-poaching guards who allegedly tortured and killed people in national parks in Asia and Africa. ""We feel deep and unreserved sorrow for those who have suffered,"" the WWF said. A 160-page report released on Tuesday,externalsaid the charity ""should have been more transparent"" and needed to ""more firmly engage governments to uphold human rights"". But some accused the WWF of a ""lack of contrition"" after the report's publication, and have demanded apologies and a change in how the charity is run. Last March,BuzzFeed published a series of articles,externalaccusing the WWF of funding ""vicious paramilitary forces to fight poaching"". Indigenous people and villagers had been shot, beaten unconscious, sexually assaulted, and whipped by armed guards in parks in places like Nepal and Cameroon, the news site said. The conservation charity funds, equips and works with these guards, the report said, accusing some staff of turning a blind eye to abuses. Poaching the creature that's more valuable than gold Humans are wiping out wildlife populations BuzzFeed said it carried out a year-long investigation in six countries, based on more than 100 interviews and thousands of pages of documents, including confidential memos, internal budgets, and emails discussing weapons purchases. After the publication of the Buzzfeed report the WWF commissioned an independent review into the allegations, vowing to complete it as soon as possible. Former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay led the panel of independent experts. The panel said there was no evidence the WWF staff directed or took part in any of these alleged abuses, and that those accused of abuses were employed by local governments and not by the conservation group. But the report criticised the WWF's response to allegations of abuses, particularly in terms of how it worked with local governments and how it handled complaints. For instance, it highlighted the WWF's work in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Salonga National Park. WWF staff were ""aware of the potential for human rights abuses by ecoguards"", the report said, but did not ""develop an effective plan to prevent and respond to abuses"". DR Congo's national parks are home to endangered species like gorillas When WWF staff reported allegations of human rights abuses to senior WWF officials in the DRC in 2016, a decision by senior management in the country to investigate the allegations was never implemented, ""apparently out of concern"" of resistance from a state conservation group. ""A desire to avoid conflicts with the government cannot excuse WWF from complying with its responsibility to respect human rights,"" the report said. DRC explores drilling for oil in parks Gorillas, guns and guerrillas - a deadly mix in an African park Another section examines Kaziranga National Park in India. In 2017 the BBC reported that authorities there were given the power to shoot suspected poachers dead in a bid to protect the wildlife. One campaigner told the BBC that major animal conservation groups, including the WWF, turned a blind eye to the park's activities. The park that shoots people to protect rhinos Addressing the BBC article, the report says ""the actions of WWF India cannot be seen as supportive of a 'shoot on sight' policy"", saying they only learnt of many of the allegations from news reports and that WWF India's support for the State Forest Departments there has been ""measured and appropriate"". Until the last few years, the panel said, ""there was no consistent and unified effort... to address complaints about human rights abuses allegedly committed by ecoguards in the Congo Basin and rangers in Nepal and India."" It said the group's own ""diverse and complex structure"", with local and national organisations acting under the umbrella of the WWF, had ""further complicated"" how abuse reports had been handled. The panel recommended the WWF implement its own policies on human rights protections more rigorously and increase its efforts to be transparent. This video can not be played How should we protect endangered species? ""Reported abuses by government rangers against communities horrify us and go against all the values for which we stand,""a WWF statement published with the report,externalsays. ""We can and will do more."" The conservation group has also releaseda Management Response report,externalon how it will implement the panel's recommendations, and has promised to ""regularly and transparently assess our progress"" starting next year. Other conservation groups however have criticised the WWF's response and demanded change. Rainforest Foundation UK accused the WWF of a ""lack of contrition"" over the independent review. Despite the panel's ""damning findings"", the conservation group ""fails to take responsibility for its shortcomings or issue a sincere apology to the many individuals who have suffered human rights abuses carried out in their name"", it said. It demands that WWF's executives be held accountable for the organisation's ""consistent failure to prevent, detect and remedy abuses across its programmes"". Allow Twitter content?

"The rings found by Open Arms Italy were inscribed with the names Ahmed and Doudou When a migrant rescue team found two wedding rings in a backpack floating in the Mediterranean, they feared the owners were dead. Covered in tiny sea creatures, the bag was on a half-sunken boat that had capsized weeks before, killing five people. But they shared images of the belongings with aid workers in Italy, who started asking around. To their surprise, they found the owners, a young couple from Algeria. Now the pair, whose names Ahmed and Doudou are inscribed on the rings, are set to be reunited with the possessions they thought they had lost forever. ""When I shared the photo I never thought that I would find the person the bag belonged to,"" Ahmad Al Rousan, a cultural mediator for medical charity MSF in Italy, told the BBC. ""At the same time, I was thinking it was probably someone who had died in the Mediterranean."" Five dead after dinghy capsizes in Mediterranean Migrant woman with Covid gives birth in helicopter Mr Al Rousan was part of the team that provided psychological support to Ahmed and Doudou and 13 others after their boat capsized off the island of Lampedusa on 21 October. The couple, thought to be in their early 20s, had been living in Libya but felt forced to make the perilous journey to Europe as the country became increasingly dangerous. Forty-eight hours into the crossing their boat went down. Five people died, including an 18-month-old girl. Ahmed and Doudou, whose full identities are not being released, were rescued by fishermen. They were then moved to a reception centre in Sicily, where they were shown photos taken by the NGO Open Arms Italy of the bag and other belongings. ""I spoke with Ahmed directly and he started to explain about the rings and why they were in the bag,"" said Mr Al Rousan. The rings were broken and the couple had hoped to get them repaired in Europe, he said. ""Ahmed was really emotional. He was happy to find the rings as they are something very personal. But he could not get from his mind the whole incident and the five people who had died."" Other items inside the red rucksack included clothes, shoes, toiletries and phone chargers Mr Al Rousan says that when Open Arms Italy approached him about showing people the photo, he told them he thought it would be ""impossible"" to find the owners. He is often tasked with helping family members find the bodies of loved ones, so tracing the items to Ahmed and his wife instead was ""a very nice feeling"". But the couple are said to still be in shock from the incident. On the same trip, a nine-year-old girl lost her mother and sister, according to MSF. The backpack containing their rings is still onboard the Open Arms ship, off the coast of Sicily. The team reportedly plan to give them back once they leave Covid quarantine. ""We washed everything in the backpack onboard, including clothes and T-shirts,"" Riccardo Gatti, the president of the NGO Open Arms in Italy, told the Guardian. ""We can't wait to deliver it to Ahmed and Doudou. It was a strong emotion for us too. ""It's not just about objects. These bags that we often find are all these people have. Like these rings, a symbol of a love that fortunately, at least this time, the Mediterranean has spared.""

"Diego Maradona scored 34 goals in 91 appearances for Argentina Dazzling, infamous, extraordinary, genius, outrageous. Diego Maradona. A flawed football icon. One of the game's most gifted players, the Argentine boasted a rare combination of flair, flamboyance, vision and speed which mesmerised fans. He also outraged supporters with his controversial 'Hand of God' goal and plunged into a mire of drug abuse and personal crises off the pitch. Born 60 years ago in a Buenos Aires shanty town, Diego Armando Maradona escaped the poverty of his youth to become a football superstar considered by some to be even greater than Brazil's Pele. The Argentine, who scored 259 goals in 491 matches, pipped his South American rival in a poll to determine the greatest player of the 20th Century, before Fifa changed the voting rules so both players were honoured. Maradona showed prodigious ability from a young age, leading Los Cebollitas youth team to a 136-game unbeaten streak and going on to make his international debut aged just 16 years and 120 days. Short and stocky, at just 5ft 5in, he was not your typical athlete. But his silky skills, agility, vision, ball control, dribbling and passing more than compensated for lack of pace and occasional weight problems. He may have been a whizz at running rings round hostile defenders but he found it harder to dodge trouble. Maradona beat Shilton to the ball - and the goal was allowed to stand in 1986 Maradona's 34 goals in 91 appearances for Argentina tell only part of the story of his rollercoaster international career. He led his country to victory at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and a place in the final four years later. In the quarter-final of the earlier tournament, there was a foretaste of the controversy that would later engulf his life. The match against England already had an extra friction, with the Falklands War between the two countries having taken place only four years beforehand. That on-field edge was to become even more intense. With 51 minutes gone and the game goalless, Maradona jumped with opposing goalkeeper Peter Shilton and scored by punching the ball into the net. This video can not be played Argentina legend Maradona explains his infamous 'Hand of God' goal He later said the goal came thanks to ""a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God"". Four minutes later, he scored what has been described as the 'goal of the century' - collecting the ball in his own half before embarking on a bewitching, mazy run that left several players trailing before he rounded Shilton to score. ""You have to say that is magnificent. There is no doubt about that goal. That was just pure football genius,"" said BBC commentator Barry Davies. England pulled one back but Argentina went through, with Maradona saying it was ""much more than winning a match, it was about knocking out the English"". Maradona broke the world transfer record twice - leaving Boca Juniors in his home country for Spanish side Barcelona for Â£3m in 1982 and joining Italian club Napoli two years later for Â£5m. There were more than 80,000 fans in the Stadio San Paolo when he arrived by helicopter. A new hero. He played the best club football of his career in Italy, feted by supporters as he inspired the side to their first league titles in 1987 and 1990 and the Uefa Cup in 1989. A party to celebrate the first triumph lasted five days with hundreds of thousands on the streets, but Maradona was suffocated by the attention and expectation. ""This is a great city but I can hardly breathe. I want to be free to walk around. I'm a lad like any other,"" he said. Maradona became an icon at Napoli, where he scored 81 times in 188 games He became inextricably linked to the Camorra crime syndicate, dragged down by a cocaine addiction and embroiled in a paternity suit. After losing 1-0 to Germany in the final of Italia 90, a positive dope test the following year triggered a 15-month ban. He returned and arrested his slide, appearing to get his act together to play in the 1994 World Cup in the USA. But he alarmed viewers with a maniacal full-face goal celebration into a camera and was withdrawn midway through the tournament after he was found to have taken the banned substance ephedrine. Maradona timeline 1977:Debut for Argentina v Hungary 1991:15-month ban after positive drugs test 1984:Joins Napoli after two-year spell with Barcelona 1994:Plays in fourth World Cup but is ejected after positive test 1986:Wins World Cup with Argentina 1997:Retires from playing after third positive test 1990:World Cup runner-up with Argentina. Second league title at Napoli 2010:Ends two-year spell as Argentina manager after World Cup quarter-final exit After his third positive test three years later, he retired from football on his 37th birthday, but continued to be plagued by problems. Maradona was given a suspended jail sentence of two years and 10 months for an earlier incident where he shot at  journalists with an air rifle. His cocaine habit and alcoholism led to several health issues. He put on weight, rising to 128kg (20 stone) at one point, and suffered a major heart attack in 2004, which left him in intensive care. He had gastric-bypass surgery to help stem his obesity, and  sought sanctuary in Cuba while battling to overcome his drug addiction. Maradona visited Cuba and met president Fidel Castro Despite all this, Maradona was named manager of the Argentina national team in 2008 and took the side to the World Cup quarter-finals two years later before his reign ended with a 4-0 defeat by Germany in the quarter-finals. Various managerial roles followed for a figure who continued to divide opinion, and continued to make headlines. He needed reconstructive surgery on his lip after one of his pet shar pei dogs bit him, and publicly recognised his son Diego Armando Junior who was born from an extra-marital affair.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced how much money the government will spend on hospitals, schools and other public services over the next financial year, starting in April 2021. In his Spending Review, he alsounveiled a new set of official forecasts for the economy,which are predicting the biggest economic decline more than 300 years. The Spending Review determines how much is spent on public services. So anyone who ever visits an NHS hospital, or goes to school, or uses roads or any of the other service provided by government will be directly affected. It's also a chance for the government to deliver on some of the promises it made at the last election, such as improving the economy of less wealthy areas of the UK. The Spending Review also included details of public sector workers' pay next year. One million NHS workers and anyone earning less than Â£24,000 will be given a pay rise. But everyone else, including police officers, fire fighters and teachers, will have a pay freeze, The chancellor's decisions will affect how much the government borrows next year and beyond. The cost of paying back those debts, or at least paying the interest on them, will fall on future taxpayers for years to come. Will teachers get a pay rise in the Spending Review? Usually a Spending Review would cover a period of three or four years to give government departments enough certainty to make long-term plans. The coronavirus pandemic disrupted so many aspects of life this year that long-term planning is particularly difficult. So the government decided that this Spending Review would only cover the 12 months from April 2021. Normally the amount of money a chancellor would allocate in a Spending Review would be strictly limited by how much they would be prepared for the government to borrow. But this year the pandemic has caused government borrowing to skyrocket. With businesses closed and workers on furlough, the government is taking less money in taxes. And it's spending more than planned on measures to fight the virus and support the economy. Before the pandemic, the government expected to borrow around Â£55bn this financial year. Seven months in, the government has already borrowed Â£215bn, and the total is expected to hit Â£394bn this year, the highest level seen in peacetime. The government can't keep borrowing that amount of money for very long. So the chancellor has to balance the fight against coronavirus with the need to keep borrowing to manageable levels. Among the major decisions in the 2020 Spending Review were: The NHS in England will get an extra Â£6.3bn to help meet the government's commitment to get the NHS budget to Â£148.5bn by 2023-24 Schools in England have been promised an extra Â£2.2bn in 2021-22, taking total spending to Â£49.8bn Defence will get an extra Â£16.5bn over four years The government's target for overseas aid spending will be cut from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%, A new Â£4bn levelling up fund for upgrading infrastructure such as roads A full list of measures ishere. The government has already announced an increase in defence spending Alongside the Spending Review, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which keeps tabs on government spending, unveiled a new set of government forecasts which were dismal. It estimates that the economy will shrink by 11.3% this year, the worst figure for more than 300 years. The unemployment rate will peak at 7.5% next year, with 2.6 million people out of work. And the long-term damage to the economy will be severe - even in 2025, national income will be 3% lower than expected before the crisis began. That will present the chancellor with a stark choice in coming years - cut spending, raise taxes, or allow the government to keep on borrowing. Many announcements in the Spending Review only apply to England. Much of government activity elsewhere in the UK is controlled by the devolved administrations - the Scottish government, Welsh government and Northern Ireland Executive. If the chancellor spends extra money on a service which is covered by devolution, such as education, the devolved administrations get extra money too. The idea is that a Â£100 increase in spending per person in England on education, for instance, should be matched with an extra Â£100 per person for each of the devolved administrations to spend as they choose. The way money gets allocated is set out by the Barnett formula,named after Lord Barnett, the politician who devised it in the late 1970s.

"The public sector pay squeeze for more than a million earners outside the NHS will hurt Today's Spending Review is not a Budget. The numbers have not added up, tens of billions were announced in new spending, but nothing on taxation. But it was the first full assessment of the economy from the government's independent forecaster, the Office of Budget Responsibility, since March that took centre stage. It confirmed not just that the pandemic would hit the UK economy this year by the biggest amount in three centuries, 11.3%, but that Britain was set to be the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations. It also said that government borrowing in this year was 19% of the size of the economy, a peacetime record at just under Â£400bn. And yet the paradox is that next year the amount of money it costs to fund that debt will also reach a post-war record: a record low. Since World War Two, our debts have never been bigger. And yet they've never been cheaper. How long this situation will last is the fundamental judgement for this chancellor. Rishi Sunak warns 'economic emergency has only just begun' Spending Review: Millions face cut in value of workplace pensions So Rishi Sunak has made some down payments on budget consolidation, aid and public sector pay, while claiming there is no return to austerity generally. The much bigger, tougher decisions that will be needed arise from the assumed persistence of the economic hit, and therefore of levels of government borrowing above Â£100bn a year for the next few years. By 2025 the economy will still be 3% smaller than anticipated in March. The pandemic will have a long economic shadow. Mr Sunak says employment is the number one priority, with overnight confirmation of Â£400m next year to start a Â£3bn Restart scheme to channel one million long term unemployed back into work. Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Spending Review: Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million The theory here is to take action on a likely rise in long-term unemployment pre-emptively. The chancellor is proud of the fact that the UK's unemployment rate is still comparatively low, even as it is set to rise to 2.6 million. But the public sector pay squeeze for more than a million above average earners outside the NHS will hurt. Huge sums were allocated to fighting the pandemic and protecting the health system. This is an economic intervention as much as it is a health one. The OBR document shows that if test and trace continues to underperform, or if vaccine distribution is delayed, there will be a direct impact on much worse public finances. A no-deal Brexit will, say the OBR, be a further hit to the economy of 2%, and the public finances. There are many uncertainties, not all of them bad. The big decisions on shrinking the deficit or indeed stimulating the economy further, as has been seen in France and Germany, await some of this fog lifting. The nation remains in rescue mode, and for now funding it remains cheap. Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million Millions face cut in value of company pensions Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The rings found by Open Arms Italy were inscribed with the names Ahmed and Doudou When a migrant rescue team found two wedding rings in a backpack floating in the Mediterranean, they feared the owners were dead. Covered in tiny sea creatures, the bag was on a half-sunken boat that had capsized weeks before, killing five people. But they shared images of the belongings with aid workers in Italy, who started asking around. To their surprise, they found the owners, a young couple from Algeria. Now the pair, whose names Ahmed and Doudou are inscribed on the rings, are set to be reunited with the possessions they thought they had lost forever. ""When I shared the photo I never thought that I would find the person the bag belonged to,"" Ahmad Al Rousan, a cultural mediator for medical charity MSF in Italy, told the BBC. ""At the same time, I was thinking it was probably someone who had died in the Mediterranean."" Five dead after dinghy capsizes in Mediterranean Migrant woman with Covid gives birth in helicopter Mr Al Rousan was part of the team that provided psychological support to Ahmed and Doudou and 13 others after their boat capsized off the island of Lampedusa on 21 October. The couple, thought to be in their early 20s, had been living in Libya but felt forced to make the perilous journey to Europe as the country became increasingly dangerous. Forty-eight hours into the crossing their boat went down. Five people died, including an 18-month-old girl. Ahmed and Doudou, whose full identities are not being released, were rescued by fishermen. They were then moved to a reception centre in Sicily, where they were shown photos taken by the NGO Open Arms Italy of the bag and other belongings. ""I spoke with Ahmed directly and he started to explain about the rings and why they were in the bag,"" said Mr Al Rousan. The rings were broken and the couple had hoped to get them repaired in Europe, he said. ""Ahmed was really emotional. He was happy to find the rings as they are something very personal. But he could not get from his mind the whole incident and the five people who had died."" Other items inside the red rucksack included clothes, shoes, toiletries and phone chargers Mr Al Rousan says that when Open Arms Italy approached him about showing people the photo, he told them he thought it would be ""impossible"" to find the owners. He is often tasked with helping family members find the bodies of loved ones, so tracing the items to Ahmed and his wife instead was ""a very nice feeling"". But the couple are said to still be in shock from the incident. On the same trip, a nine-year-old girl lost her mother and sister, according to MSF. The backpack containing their rings is still onboard the Open Arms ship, off the coast of Sicily. The team reportedly plan to give them back once they leave Covid quarantine. ""We washed everything in the backpack onboard, including clothes and T-shirts,"" Riccardo Gatti, the president of the NGO Open Arms in Italy, told the Guardian. ""We can't wait to deliver it to Ahmed and Doudou. It was a strong emotion for us too. ""It's not just about objects. These bags that we often find are all these people have. Like these rings, a symbol of a love that fortunately, at least this time, the Mediterranean has spared.""

"People have been urged to be cautious of the risk of spreading coronavirus when rules are relaxed over Christmas. Up to three households will be allowed to stay together and form a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, as agreed by all four UK nations. A scientific adviser to the government said the relaxation of rules amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". Meanwhile, it is expected most areas of England will be placed in the middle tier of atoughened three-tier system. Details on what will happen when the current lockdown ends on 2 December will be announced on Thursday. The decision will be based on a number of factors including case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and pressure on local NHS services. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says a ""handful"" of areas will be in the lightest regime of limits - tier one - but most of the country is likely to be in either tier two or three. She said London is expected to be placed in tier two. The measures for Christmas will see travel restrictions across the four nations, and between tiers and levels, lifted to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK. Anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland may travel on the 22 and 28 December, but otherwise travel to and from bubbles should be done between the 23 and 27. People will not be able to get together with others from more than two other households, and once a bubble is formed, it must not be changed or be extended further. The guidance says a bubble of three households would be able to stay overnight at each other's home but would not be able to visit hospitality, theatres or retail settings. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Christmas rules 'not an instruction to meet up' Three households can mix over Christmas in UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told people to use ""personal judgement"" on whether to visit elderly relatives. In a video message from Downing Street,,externalthe prime minister described the agreement as a ""special, time-limited dispensation"", saying: ""This year means Christmas will be different."" Mr Johnson said people must consider the risks of who to form a bubble with and whether or not to visit elderly or vulnerable relatives, adding: ""Many of us are longing to spend time with family and friends... And yet we can't afford to throw caution to the wind."" He added: ""'Tis the season to be jolly but 'tis also the season to be jolly careful.""

It comes as the government recorded another 18,213 Covid cases in the UK. Figures also showed a further 696 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths is the highest since the start of May and compares to 608 recorded on Wednesday. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says many of those who have died are likely to have picked up an infection before the current lockdown measures were put in place. He said a rise in the death toll would not be expected to continue into December because the average number of daily cases is now falling and hospital admissions are levelling off. A mid-week rise can also be down to delays in deaths being reported over the weekend. First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said the ministers agreed they had to ease the rules because people would have flouted restrictions - creating further risk - if they were told Christmas had been ""cancelled"". Ministers were shown behavioural science evidence that ""too many people simply would not have been prepared to have gone along with such an instruction"", he told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. Mr Drakeford also saida UK-wide approach to coronavirus rulesafter Christmas was needed. Nicola Sturgeon has said guidance for people in Scotland is still being finalised and will be issued on Thursday, but that her government will not be ""encouraging"" people to meet up. ""The expectation should be that the guidance will probably look to tighten around the edges rather than further expand and that will be true with the travel window of opportunity as well - we want to limit that window, not expand it,"" the first minister said. Published guidance for England,externalgives further details of the rules for 23 to 27 December: You can form a different Christmas bubble from the people you live with normally - so you can choose to stay with different people for the five-day period You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line withthe rules for the tier in which you are staying,external Children under the age of 18 whose parents do not live together may be part of both parents' Christmas bubbles Existing support bubbles count as one household towards the three household limit Students are considered to be part of the household to which they have returned Prof Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, and a member of the government's Sage committee, told BBC Newsnight allowing families to meet up over Christmas amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". He said it would ""definitely lead to increase[d] transmission and likely lead to third wave of infections with hospitals being overrun, and more unnecessary deaths."" Prof Hayward said while you cannot ban Christmas, he called for clearer messaging to families about the ""dangers"" of socialising and inter-generational mixing. This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Gavin Terry, head of policy at the Alzheimer's Society, said thousands of relatives would be in ""complete despair"" at government guidance which says only care home residents of working age should be allowed to leave their care homes to visit family, due to the increased risk of exposure to the virus. ""After eight harrowing months filled with devastation and tragic loss of life, the announcement that many care home residents will be facing Christmas alone is just heartbreaking,"" he said, calling for further testing to allow for more visits. Meanwhile, Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, called on ministers to publish evidence for its Christmas bubble rules, which would ""inflict unnecessary pain and irreversible damage on our sector"". Local rules mean many pubs and restaurants - such as those in England's tier three or Scotland's level four - will remain closed during the festive period, irrespective of the Christmas change.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: Government set 'to fund the priorities of British people' The number of unemployed people in the UK is expected to surge to 2.6 million by mid-2021, Rishi Sunak has warned. In his Spending Review, the chancellor said the ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid-19 had ""only just begun"". The government expected to borrow Â£394bn this year - the ""highest"" level ""in our peacetime history"" - he added. The latest figures show 1.62 million people are unemployed, a number which has risen by more than 300,000 since last year. In the House of Commons, Mr Sunak said the government would spend Â£280bn this year ""to get our country through coronavirus"". He also announced that most public sector workers would have their pay frozen, with only the lowest paid, as well as nurses, doctors and other NHS staff, getting a salary rise. Chancellor warns of 'lasting' damage to UK economy How many people could become unemployed? Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance And the chancellor said spending on overseas aid, as a proportion of national income, would be 0.5% in 2021-2 - down from the 0.7% currently set in law. The document accompanying Mr Sunak's statement makes no mention of extending the temporary Â£20 uplift in Universal Credit beyond next April, but this is expected to be reviewed in the new year. The last time the UK unemployment figure was as high as 2.6 million was in May to July 2012. The number exceeded three million from 1983 to 1987 and for a few months in early 1993. Mr Sunak told MPs the economy was predicted to contract by 11.3% this year - ""the largest fall in output for more than 300 years"" - and grow by 5.5% next year and 6.6% in 2022. He added: ""Even with growth returning, our economic output is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels until the fourth quarter of 2022. And the economic damage is likely to be lasting."" The government's Covid response, including furlough, has led to huge spending rises, at a time when its income from taxation is down. Mr Sunak said the UK was expected to borrow Â£394bn this year, which was predicted to fall to Â£164bn next year and Â£105bn in 2022-3. Some other Spending Review announcements were trailed before his statement, including: An extra Â£3bn for the NHSin England to help tackle the backlog of operations delayed due to Covid An increase in defence spending A Â£4.6bn package to help the unemployed back to work The chancellor had intended - as usual - to set out plans for the next three years, but this was reduced to just one year due to the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic. For Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said a longer-term spending review was needed soon ""to build a future for our country as the best place in the world to grow up in and the best place to grow old in"". She criticised Mr Sunak for not mentioning Brexit in his speech, with the UK set to leave the EU single market and customs area at the end of the year. Ms Dodds added: ""There's still no trade deal. So does the chancellor truly believe that his government is prepared and that he's done enough to help those businesses that will be heavily affected?"" Why should I care what Rishi Sunak says? How much will coronavirus cost the UK? The Office for Budget Responsibility said that if no deal was reached, and the UK and EU had to trade under World Trade Organization rules - including tariffs - this could ""reduce real GDP"" by 2% in 2021, on top of the damage caused by coronavirus. The economic shock of the ""various temporary disruptions to cross-border trade and the knock-on impacts"" would continue for years, it predicted. But a Treasury spokesman insisted the government was confident about the future of the UK, whatever the outcome of negotiations with Brussels. He said the chancellor was focussed on Covid, which he described as the ""core economic challenge"" and ""the one that matters today to people's jobs"". Dave Prentis, general secretary of the union Unison, called the pay freeze for most public sector workers ""austerity, plain and simple"" and a ""bitter pill"" for those affected. He added: ""A decade of spending cuts left public services exposed when Covid came calling. The government is making the same disastrous mistake again.""

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced how much money the government will spend on hospitals, schools and other public services over the next financial year, starting in April 2021. In his Spending Review, he alsounveiled a new set of official forecasts for the economy,which are predicting the biggest economic decline more than 300 years. The Spending Review determines how much is spent on public services. So anyone who ever visits an NHS hospital, or goes to school, or uses roads or any of the other service provided by government will be directly affected. It's also a chance for the government to deliver on some of the promises it made at the last election, such as improving the economy of less wealthy areas of the UK. The Spending Review also included details of public sector workers' pay next year. One million NHS workers and anyone earning less than Â£24,000 will be given a pay rise. But everyone else, including police officers, fire fighters and teachers, will have a pay freeze, The chancellor's decisions will affect how much the government borrows next year and beyond. The cost of paying back those debts, or at least paying the interest on them, will fall on future taxpayers for years to come. Will teachers get a pay rise in the Spending Review? Usually a Spending Review would cover a period of three or four years to give government departments enough certainty to make long-term plans. The coronavirus pandemic disrupted so many aspects of life this year that long-term planning is particularly difficult. So the government decided that this Spending Review would only cover the 12 months from April 2021. Normally the amount of money a chancellor would allocate in a Spending Review would be strictly limited by how much they would be prepared for the government to borrow. But this year the pandemic has caused government borrowing to skyrocket. With businesses closed and workers on furlough, the government is taking less money in taxes. And it's spending more than planned on measures to fight the virus and support the economy. Before the pandemic, the government expected to borrow around Â£55bn this financial year. Seven months in, the government has already borrowed Â£215bn, and the total is expected to hit Â£394bn this year, the highest level seen in peacetime. The government can't keep borrowing that amount of money for very long. So the chancellor has to balance the fight against coronavirus with the need to keep borrowing to manageable levels. Among the major decisions in the 2020 Spending Review were: The NHS in England will get an extra Â£6.3bn to help meet the government's commitment to get the NHS budget to Â£148.5bn by 2023-24 Schools in England have been promised an extra Â£2.2bn in 2021-22, taking total spending to Â£49.8bn Defence will get an extra Â£16.5bn over four years The government's target for overseas aid spending will be cut from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%, A new Â£4bn levelling up fund for upgrading infrastructure such as roads A full list of measures ishere. The government has already announced an increase in defence spending Alongside the Spending Review, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which keeps tabs on government spending, unveiled a new set of government forecasts which were dismal. It estimates that the economy will shrink by 11.3% this year, the worst figure for more than 300 years. The unemployment rate will peak at 7.5% next year, with 2.6 million people out of work. And the long-term damage to the economy will be severe - even in 2025, national income will be 3% lower than expected before the crisis began. That will present the chancellor with a stark choice in coming years - cut spending, raise taxes, or allow the government to keep on borrowing. Many announcements in the Spending Review only apply to England. Much of government activity elsewhere in the UK is controlled by the devolved administrations - the Scottish government, Welsh government and Northern Ireland Executive. If the chancellor spends extra money on a service which is covered by devolution, such as education, the devolved administrations get extra money too. The idea is that a Â£100 increase in spending per person in England on education, for instance, should be matched with an extra Â£100 per person for each of the devolved administrations to spend as they choose. The way money gets allocated is set out by the Barnett formula,named after Lord Barnett, the politician who devised it in the late 1970s.

"The UK has ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home. A junior minister, Baroness Sugg, has quit over the move, calling it ""fundamentally wrong"" at a time of ""unprecedented"" global crisis. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was hard to ""justify"" the policy with the UK facing record borrowing. The cut - to 0.5% of national income - will save about Â£4bn a year. Mr Sunak said this would be ""temporary"" and the 0.7% target would return when finances allowed. Kuenssberg: Sunak grapples with a political paradox Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance The move has been criticised by some Conservatives, who point out that it was a key promise in the party's 2019 general election manifesto. Baroness Sugg, who was David Cameron's chief of staff when he was PM, has quit as minister for sustainable development, overseas territories and the Caribbean. In a letter to Boris Johnson, she said it was ""fundamentally wrong"" to abandon the foreign aid promise, which ""should be kept in the tough times as well as the good"". He responded by praising the minister's ""passion and commitment"" to her work and her ""efforts in support of girls' education in particular"". Currently, the UK commits 0.7% of national income to overseas aid. In 2019, it spent Â£14.6bn ($19.4bn) compared with $34.6bn by the US and $23.8bn by Germany -according to figures from the OECD.,external But if you look at overseas aid spending as a percentage of national income, the UK currently beats them and comes out top of the G7 group of the wealthiest nations. Germany trails closely behind on 0.6%, with France spending 0.44% and the US on 0.16%. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that even after the UK drops to 0.5% next year it ""would remain the second-highest aid donor in the G7"". That's right - Germany would take over the lead but France could soon take second place - as itwants to raise its aid contribution to 0.55%,externalof national income in 2022. Mr Sunak did say the government's ""intention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal situation allows"" but he gave no specific timeline. Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence committee, told BBC News the foreign aid cut ""will come back and haunt us in the long term"". He said it would reduce British influence, increase poverty and instability - and ""allow China and Russia to take advantage"" by moving quickly to fill the ""vacuum"". In the Commons, Rishi Sunak said the government had to make ""tough"" choices, as he set out his Spending Review for the year ahead. He added that 0.5% of national income would be spent on overseas aid in 2021 - the equivalent of Â£10bn - and the UK would still be the second-highest aid donor in the G7 group of major economies. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is a vocal critic of the aid cut Mr Cameron said the 0.7% promise said ""something great"" about the UK, adding: ""These were brilliant things that we were doing, and I think it's sad that we are standing back from that."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, described Mr Sunak's decision as ""shameful and wrong"". ""I join others in urging MPs to reject it for the good of the poorest, and the UK's own reputation and interest,"" he wrote on Twitter. Oxfam chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah was among dozens of charity bosses to criticise the decision. He said: ""Cutting the UK's lifeline to the world's poorest communities in the midst of a global pandemic will lead to tens of thousands of otherwise preventable deaths."" Baroness Sugg says UK aid spending is a 'source of pride' And Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds accused Mr Sunak of turning his back on the world's poorest, adding that it was ""in Britain's national interest to lay the foundations for economic growth across the world"". But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""At last we have a Conservative chancellor that understands Conservative voters on foreign aid."" And Conservative MP Philip Davies said people in the ""real world"" will back the cut. ""I suspect that the vast majority of the British public won't be asking why has he cut so much, they will probably be asking why are we still spending so much,"" he added. Former Conservative Prime Ministers Sir John Major and his Labour successor Tony Blair were among those calling for the 0.7% target to be kept. It could also face opposition from some Tory MPs, including former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, when the Commons votes on it.

"Video showed Kylie Moore-Gilbert being driven away in a mini-van A British-Australian academic serving a 10-year sentence in Iran for espionage has been freed, with Tehran saying it was a swap for three jailed Iranians. In a statement, Kylie Moore-Gilbert thanked those who had worked for her release and said that leaving Iran was ""bittersweet"". Dr Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer at Melbourne University, had been detained in Iran since September 2018. She was tried in secret and strongly denied all the charges against her. According to Iranian state media, she was exchanged for an Iranian businessman and two Iranian citizens ""who had been detained abroad"". They have not yet been named. News of the exchange first came on Wednesday in a statement on the website of the Young Journalist Club, a news website affiliated to state television in Iran. ""An Iranian businessman and two Iranian citizens who were detained abroad on baseless charges were exchanged for a dual national spy named Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who worked for the Zionist regime,"" it said. Video of the exchange was published by state broadcaster IRIB news and the Tasnim website. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement released hours later, Dr Moore-Gilbert thanked Australian officials who had worked ""tirelessly"" to secure her release. ""Thank you also to all of you who have supported me and campaigned for my freedom, it has meant the world to me to have you behind me throughout what has been a long and traumatic ordeal,"" she said. ""I have nothing but respect, love and admiration for the great nation of Iran and its warm-hearted, generous and brave people. It is with bittersweet feelings that I depart your country, despite the injustices which I have been subjected to. I came to Iran as a friend and with friendly intentions, and depart Iran with those sentiments not only still intact, but strengthened."" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said she was ""extremely pleased and relieved"" at the release of Dr Moore-Gilbert which she said ""was achieved through diplomatic engagement with the Iranian government"". She made no reference to any exchange of prisoners. ""The Australian government has consistently rejected the grounds on which the Iranian government arrested, detained and convicted Dr Moore-Gilbert. We continue to do so,"" she said in a statement. Iran rejects appeal over doctor sentenced to death Jailed academic 'rejected Iran's offer to be spy' Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Senator Payne said Dr Moore-Gilbert would ""soon be reunited with her family"" but did not specify when she would be returning to Australia. Dr Moore-Gilbert had been travelling on an Australian passport when she was detained at Tehran airport in 2018 as she tried to leave following a conference. In letters smuggled out of Tehran's Evin prison earlier this year, the Cambridge-educated academic said she had ""never been a spy"" and feared for her mental health. She said she had rejected an offer from Iran to become a spy. ""I am not a spy. I have never been a spy, and I have no interest to work for a spying organisation in any country,"" she wrote. Concerns for her wellbeing escalated in August when news emerged that she had been transferred to Qarchak, a notorious prison in the desert. She was visited shortly afterwards by Australia's ambassador to Iran, Lyndall Sachs, who reported that she was ""well"". Kylie Moore-Gilbert was reported to have been in solitary confinement and on several hunger strikes while in Evin prison in Tehran Iran has detained a number of foreign nationals and Iranian dual citizens in recent years, many of them on spying charges. Human rights groups have accused Tehran of using the cases as leverage to try to gain concessions from other countries. British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was jailed on spying charges in 2016. She has always maintained her innocence. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, welcomed reports of Dr Moore-Gilbert's release. ""Nazanin and I are really happy for Kylie and her family,"" he told the BBC. ""They have been through so much, borne with such dignity. And it is an early Christmas present for us all, that one more of us is out and on their way home, one more family can begin to heal.""

""There may now be renewed grounds for hoping that UK-Iranian dual-nationals like Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori will also be released from their unjust jail terms in Iran in the coming days or weeks,"" she said.

"Gordon Taylor has led the PFA since 1981 Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor will stand down at the end of the season - two years after first announcing his intention to do so. The 75-year-old has held the role since 1981 and a letter announcing his resignation was sent to members on Wednesday afternoon. In 2019, the PFA commenced a ""full and open review"" into its finances. This review - first announced in November 2018 - was completed in July. It came following intense criticism of the players' union. At the time, he said the organisation's entire management committee, including himself, would stand down at the annual general meeting following the report's release. The 2020 AGM will take place on Thursday, where members will vote on a new governance structure in which the outgoing management committee would be replaced by a players' board and an operational board, which would oversee the day-to-day running of the union. ""As I announced at our previous AGM, now that the independent review process has completed, I too will step down, by the end of the current season,"" Taylor wrote. ""A new chief executive will be elected following the recruitment procedure recommended by the independent review, and we have already made substantial progress in that direction. I will of course be available in the future whenever needed to support the PFA."" Taylor is credited with negotiating the PFA's biggest source of income - around Â£25m per year from the Premier League. But the PFA has recently come under more scrutiny around the issue of dementia, which is a growing concern for former players and the subject of fury from some over a perceived lack of action and support by the PFA. Earlier on Wednesday, John Stiles - the son of former England international Nobby Stiles, who died in October - hadcalled for the resignationof Taylor and his leadership team. The PFA announced its Neurodegenerative Disease Working Group (NDWG) last week, which would seek to consult the likes of Dawn Astle - the daughter of Jeff Astle - and former Blackburn Rovers forward Chris Sutton, who has also been critical of the union after his father, a former footballer, was diagnosed with dementia. Sutton has told BBC Sport he has ""no plan to join the taskforce and doesn't want to be associated with the PFA in its current guise"". The PFA also said it would continue to fund Dr Willie Stewart's research into the issue after the neuropathologist found last year that former footballers were between two and five times more likely to die from degenerative brain diseases. And on Friday it called for heading in training to be reduced in order to protect current players while a potential link between heading and long-term brain injuries exists. 1981 - Takes charge of the PFA and introduces a non-contributory pension scheme for members. 1986 - Helps establish the Football in the Community initiative at six clubs before it is rolled out across all 92 Football League clubs. 1988 - Implements a Youth Training Scheme for 16-to-18-year-old players at professional clubs. 1989 - Agrees to join the Football League as chief executive before reconsidering and staying with the players' union. 1994 - Appointed President of FIFPro (the International Association of Football Players' Unions). 2001 - Secures a Â£52.2m three-year deal with the Premier League over television revenue after 99% of players back a threat to strike. 2008 - Recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). 2015 - Issues a public apology after comparing the Ched Evans rape case with the Hillsborough tragedy. 2017 - Dawn Astle, the daughter of former West Brom and England striker Jeff, walks out of a meeting with Taylor criticising the PFA for a lack of action on dementia research. 2018 - The PFA says it is ""disappointing"" that a dispute over the eligibility of Ben Purkiss as chairman had become public knowledge. 2018 - An independent review into the PFA is announced. 2019 - Taylor announces he will step down at the conclusion of the review. 2020 - In a letter to PFA members, Taylor says he will step down at the end of the 2020-21 season. Watch 13 FA Cup second-round games on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app this weekend.Find out more here. Regarded as one of football's finest administrators during the 1980s and 1990s, much of the PFA's influence on the modern game can be traced back to Taylor. His biggest success story at the PFA came in 2001 while negotiating a deal with the Premier League over what the PFA's share of television revenue should be. England internationals including David Beckham and Gary Neville were among 99% of the PFA's membership to approve strike action until a figure of Â£52.2m (over three years) was finally agreed, alongside stipulations relating to future deals. He established community programmes and youth training schemes (now apprenticeships) at all 92 professional football clubs. He also played a key role in founding the 'Let's Kick Racism Out of Football' initiative in 1993, which later became the organisation Kick It Out. More recently, Taylor pushed for football to adopt the 'Rooney Rule' to increase the number of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) coaches in the game. While the annual PFA Awards evening in April has gone from a men-only sportsman's dinner to an inclusive and glitzy bash, it has not been without controversy. Football agent Rachel Anderson sued the PFA after being refused admission in 1998 and was awarded damages of Â£7,500, plus costs. In 2013, black American comedian Reginald D Hunter used an offensive racist term during his performance at the Grosvenor House hotel in Mayfair, with Taylor saying the performer may have been unaware the language had been an ""emotive"" subject in football. There have also been raised eyebrows over perceived lavish expenditure at times, with Â£1.9m spent on LS Lowry's 'Going to the Match' painting. In 2013, national newspapers reported Taylor had run up more than Â£100,000 in gambling debts, and in 2015 he was forced to issue a public apology after comparing the Ched Evans rape case with the Hillsborough tragedy.

"Engineers lowered the first of 10 booster segments into place on 21 November Nasa has started assembling the first Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on a launch platform ahead of its maiden flight next year. The SLS is the giant rocket that will send US astronauts back to the Moon this decade - with the first crewed landing targeted for 2024. Engineers in Florida have begun stacking the segments that make up the vehicle's two solid rocket boosters. The rocket is scheduled to make its debut in November 2021. The SLS consists of a giant, 65m (212ft) - long core stage with four engines that's flanked by the twin solid fuel boosters. Together, these produce a massive 8.8 million pounds (39.1 Meganewtons) of thrust that can loft astronauts into orbit; the rocket subsequently hurls them towards the Moon. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guide Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond The huge SLS core stage was transferred from Louisiana to Mississippi for testing earlier this year Teams at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida lowered the first of 10 booster segments into place on a structure known as the mobile launcher on 21 November. The process is taking place inside the iconic Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at Kennedy. The boosters will burn six tonnes of solid, aluminium-based propellant each second when the SLS launches. They provide 75% of the vehicle's thrust at lift-off. The mobile launcher they're being stacked on is a 115m (380ft) -tall structure that's used to process and assemble the SLS before moving it to the launch pad. It's a huge symbolic step, not only for the SLS - which has been under development for a decade - but also Nasa's plan to send the next man and the first woman to the lunar surface by 2024, known as Artemis. ""Stacking the first piece of the SLS rocket on the mobile launcher marks a major milestone for the Artemis programme,"" said Andrew Shroble, a manager with Jacobs engineering group which is working on the rocket for Nasa. ""It shows the mission is truly taking shape and will soon head to the launch pad."" The solid rocket boosters provide 75% of the vehicle's thrust at launch The other big segment of the SLS - its orange foam-covered core stage - is currently undergoing a programme of tests called the Green Run at Nasa's Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The final two Green Run tests - which consist of loading the huge stage with propellant and, two weeks later, firing its four engines to simulate a launch and ascent -are set to take place in the next few weeks. Once it's fully assembled, the SLS rocket will stand taller than the Statue of Liberty and have about 15% more maximum thrust at lift-off than the Saturn V rocket used to launch the Apollo missions to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s. This video can not be played Ignition: This solid rocket booster will be used for missions to the Moon The booster segments being assembled in Florida will launch Nasa's next-generation astronaut vehicle, Orion, on a loop around the Moon in November next year. Orion will not be carrying any crew on that mission, known as Artemis-1. It will be used to check out the vehicle's performance before humans are allowed onboard for the Artemis-2 mission, currently scheduled for 2023. This will be followed in 2024 by Artemis-3, the first crewed landing on the lunar surface since Apollo 17 in 1972.

"Gordon Taylor has led the PFA since 1981 Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor will stand down at the end of the season - two years after first announcing his intention to do so. The 75-year-old has held the role since 1981 and a letter announcing his resignation was sent to members on Wednesday afternoon. In 2019, the PFA commenced a ""full and open review"" into its finances. This review - first announced in November 2018 - was completed in July. It came following intense criticism of the players' union. At the time, he said the organisation's entire management committee, including himself, would stand down at the annual general meeting following the report's release. The 2020 AGM will take place on Thursday, where members will vote on a new governance structure in which the outgoing management committee would be replaced by a players' board and an operational board, which would oversee the day-to-day running of the union. ""As I announced at our previous AGM, now that the independent review process has completed, I too will step down, by the end of the current season,"" Taylor wrote. ""A new chief executive will be elected following the recruitment procedure recommended by the independent review, and we have already made substantial progress in that direction. I will of course be available in the future whenever needed to support the PFA."" Taylor is credited with negotiating the PFA's biggest source of income - around Â£25m per year from the Premier League. But the PFA has recently come under more scrutiny around the issue of dementia, which is a growing concern for former players and the subject of fury from some over a perceived lack of action and support by the PFA. Earlier on Wednesday, John Stiles - the son of former England international Nobby Stiles, who died in October - hadcalled for the resignationof Taylor and his leadership team. The PFA announced its Neurodegenerative Disease Working Group (NDWG) last week, which would seek to consult the likes of Dawn Astle - the daughter of Jeff Astle - and former Blackburn Rovers forward Chris Sutton, who has also been critical of the union after his father, a former footballer, was diagnosed with dementia. Sutton has told BBC Sport he has ""no plan to join the taskforce and doesn't want to be associated with the PFA in its current guise"". The PFA also said it would continue to fund Dr Willie Stewart's research into the issue after the neuropathologist found last year that former footballers were between two and five times more likely to die from degenerative brain diseases. And on Friday it called for heading in training to be reduced in order to protect current players while a potential link between heading and long-term brain injuries exists. 1981 - Takes charge of the PFA and introduces a non-contributory pension scheme for members. 1986 - Helps establish the Football in the Community initiative at six clubs before it is rolled out across all 92 Football League clubs. 1988 - Implements a Youth Training Scheme for 16-to-18-year-old players at professional clubs. 1989 - Agrees to join the Football League as chief executive before reconsidering and staying with the players' union. 1994 - Appointed President of FIFPro (the International Association of Football Players' Unions). 2001 - Secures a Â£52.2m three-year deal with the Premier League over television revenue after 99% of players back a threat to strike. 2008 - Recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours and appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). 2015 - Issues a public apology after comparing the Ched Evans rape case with the Hillsborough tragedy. 2017 - Dawn Astle, the daughter of former West Brom and England striker Jeff, walks out of a meeting with Taylor criticising the PFA for a lack of action on dementia research. 2018 - The PFA says it is ""disappointing"" that a dispute over the eligibility of Ben Purkiss as chairman had become public knowledge. 2018 - An independent review into the PFA is announced. 2019 - Taylor announces he will step down at the conclusion of the review. 2020 - In a letter to PFA members, Taylor says he will step down at the end of the 2020-21 season.

Regarded as one of football's finest administrators during the 1980s and 1990s, much of the PFA's influence on the modern game can be traced back to Taylor. His biggest success story at the PFA came in 2001 while negotiating a deal with the Premier League over what the PFA's share of television revenue should be. England internationals including David Beckham and Gary Neville were among 99% of the PFA's membership to approve strike action until a figure of Â£52.2m (over three years) was finally agreed, alongside stipulations relating to future deals. He established community programmes and youth training schemes (now apprenticeships) at all 92 professional football clubs. He also played a key role in founding the 'Let's Kick Racism Out of Football' initiative in 1993, which later became the organisation Kick It Out. More recently, Taylor pushed for football to adopt the 'Rooney Rule' to increase the number of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) coaches in the game. While the annual PFA Awards evening in April has gone from a men-only sportsman's dinner to an inclusive and glitzy bash, it has not been without controversy. Football agent Rachel Anderson sued the PFA after being refused admission in 1998 and was awarded damages of Â£7,500, plus costs. In 2013, black American comedian Reginald D Hunter used an offensive racist term during his performance at the Grosvenor House hotel in Mayfair, with Taylor saying the performer may have been unaware the language had been an ""emotive"" subject in football. There have also been raised eyebrows over perceived lavish expenditure at times, with Â£1.9m spent on LS Lowry's 'Going to the Match' painting. In 2013, national newspapers reported Taylor had run up more than Â£100,000 in gambling debts, and in 2015 he was forced to issue a public apology after comparing the Ched Evans rape case with the Hillsborough tragedy. Around 300 high-profile former and current players endorsed an open letter calling for Taylor to step down in November 2018 amid a dispute with PFA chairman Purkiss.

"The number of domestic abuse offences recorded by police in England and Wales has increased during the pandemic. But the Office for National Statistics said such offences gradually rose in recent years so it cannot be determined if it was related to the pandemic. Police recorded 259,324 domestic abuse offences between March and June - 7% up on the same period in 2019. During and after the first lockdown in April, May and June, roughly one-fifth of offences involved domestic abuse. TheONS data,external, released on Wednesday, includes information from a range of sources - including police forces' own figures on the number of offences recorded and then flagged as related to domestic abuse. Domestic abuse is not a specific criminal offence, so police record incidents under the type of offence (for example, assault with injury) but then flag that it is related to domestic abuse. 'My boyfriend held me under hot water in lockdown' Domestic abuse helpline sees lockdown surge Escape from my lockdown abuser in five objects In April, May and June - which covers the period during and immediately after the first national coronavirus lockdown - domestic abuse offences took up a larger proportion of all offences compared to previous years. Around 20% of all offences recorded by police were flagged as domestic abuse related during these months - compared to less than 15% in previous years. The number of offences also rose each month, the figures showed. One woman, Davina, told the BBC that it was increased time at home with her abuser that made her seek help. ""Lockdown was the worst time in my life,"" she told BBC Scotland's The Nine programme. ""That was when I first paid attention to Women's Aid, I wondered if they could get me out the situation, so took the number from the television. ""I wasn't allowed to use the phone in the house so I took the number and went out with the dog and I phoned it. ""I wasn't ready to go but they had nowhere for me anyway. But I was in constant contact with Rebecca from Women's Aid and she helped me eventually leave. ""If it hadn't been for them I don't know what would have happened. I think eventually I would be dead. Mentally, physically, emotionally - I couldn't do it any more."" Davina was allocated a place in a refuge and although she says it took her a month to stop waking up in the night crying, she finally feels safe. Read more here. As the lockdown eased, the proportion of offences flagged as domestic abuse went down. But this was likely because the overall amount of criminal offences increased when lockdown was lifted. Between March and June, police recorded 206,492 ""violence against the person"" offences that were flagged as domestic abuse - a 9% rise on the same period in 2019. The ""violence against the person"" category includes offences such as harassment, assault and murder. Other offences outside this category can also be flagged as linked to domestic abuse, such as sexual offences. And provisional data showed there were 64 domestic homicides in England and Wales recorded by police between January and June 2020 - 30 of them in the period between April and June. This is nearly 10 more than the same period in 2019, although the figure is slightly lower than in 2018. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Domestic abuse - âYouâre with each other 24/7' ""The number of domestic abuse-related crimes recorded by the police continued to increase in the year ending March 2020; this may reflect improvements in police recording and an increase in victims' willingness to come forward,"" said Helen Ross, from the ONS's Centre for Crime and Justice. ""Up-to-date evidence shows this increase continued into the lockdown period - however, it cannot be determined whether this can be directly attributed to the coronavirus pandemic."" Ms Ross added that data showed there had been an increase in demand for domestic abuse support services during the pandemic, particularly following the easing of lockdown measures. ""Data suggests that experiences of domestic abuse may have intensified during the lockdown and that victims faced difficulties in safely seeking support under these conditions,"" she said. Charities dealing with domestic abusehave reported a surge in appeals for helpsince the start of the pandemic. Earlier this week, train companies and charity Women's Aidconfirmed they were extending a schemethat offers free travel to people fleeing domestic abuse. The ""Rail to Refuge"" scheme - which provides free tickets for women, men and children travelling to refuge services - will continue until March next year. The charity New Era, which helps victims in Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent, said the ONS figures was ""more disturbing"" evidence and showed there was ""more to do to tackle and end relationship abuse"". Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced that Â£3.7m of City Hall and government money would be invested in measures to support victims of domestic abuse. He said it would be funding new ""safe spaces"" for victims, training for police and schemes focused on perpetrators, adding: ""Sadly, we already know that during lockdown home is not always a safe place for everyone.""

"Joseph Ray admitted shaking baby Ava at their flat in East Lothian A father who killed his baby daughter in what was described as ""a momentary loss of control"" has been jailed for seven years. Joseph Ray admitted violently shaking two-month-old Ava at their flat in Prestonpans, East Lothian, in 2012. The 33-year-old was convicted after a seven-year investigation saw police consult medical experts to determine the exact cause of Ava's death. He was charged with murder but admitted the lesser charge of culpable homicide. Following the child's death, investigators ruled out the possibility that Ava had died from natural causes and concluded she had suffered a head injury as the result of an assault. Ava's mother Lauren Scott told the BBC: ""I think it's shocking that he only got seven years after all that time."" Ms Scott's father, Richard Scott, added: ""The family feels disappointed in it because for eight years we've suffered mentally and physically through this lad telling lies. ""He could have admitted it long before this. He's gone about laughing and enjoying himself while my daughter Lauren was suffering. ""It's made me, my wife and Lauren ill. I feel like I've done eight years in prison myself."" Ray's defence lawyer Shelagh McCall QC told the High Court in Glasgow that Ray had been woken by Ava crying. He later told social workers of ""feeling overwhelmed and angry"" and he shook Ava twice, Ms McCall said. Ava Ray died after she was taken to Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children She continued: ""He still struggles to understand that what he did could have such a catastrophic consequence. ""He can't ever make amends for the damage done in a momentary loss of control by an exhausted and inexperienced parent."" Ms McCall added the case had taken time to come to court because of ""contrasting medical views"" - at one point it was thought Ava may have had a problem with blood clotting which could have explained her injuries, she said. Father admits killing two-month-old daughter Prosecutor Ashley Edwards QC said Ray and Ms Scott - his partner at the time - had arguments mainly over who would do night time feeds. On the day of the child's death, Ms Scott had gone to work at 18:30, the court was told. About 22:50, Ray told a neighbour his daughter was ""cold to the touch"" and paramedics found her ""white in colour, limp and unresponsive"". She was taken to Edinburgh's Royal Hospital for Sick Children where she died the next morning. Tests revealed her brain had been starved of oxygen and her death was initially treated as ""unascertained"". Two-month-old Ava Ray died in 2012 After ""various experts"" were consulted between 2014 and 2018, it was concluded Ava had died due to a ""head injury"", Ms Edwards said. The judge Lady Stacey said the case had been ""a terrible tragedy"" involving the death of a ""much loved child."" She told Ray: ""As you know, Ava was entitled to look to you for love, affection and support. You failed in that and your failure had terrible consequences. ""Ava's life was snuffed out just as it was starting by one of the people she was entitled to rely on. ""You have to live with that knowledge for the rest of your days."" Ray had no previous convictions at the time of the death but has since been found guilty of two domestic assaults on Ms Scott. The judge said she would have sentenced Ray to eight and a half years had he not pleaded guilty.

"This video can not be played What you need to know about Chancellor Rishi Sunak's speech â in two minutes The ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid-19 has only just begun, according to chancellor Rishi Sunak, as he warned the pandemic would deal lasting damage to growth and jobs. Official forecasts now predict the biggest economic decline in 300 years. The UK economy is expected to shrink by 11.3% this year and not return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022. Government borrowing will rise to its highest outside of wartime to deal with the economic impact. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects the number of unemployed people to surge to 2.6 million by the middle of next year. It meansthe unemployment rate will hit 7.5%, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2009. However, fewer jobs are expected to be lost than predicted this summer. Setting out his Spending Review detailing how much would be spent on public services, Mr Sunak said the government was dealing with an ""economic emergency"". He added: ""That's why we have taken, and continue to take, extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes."" The government hassubsidised the wagesof employees unable to work due to the pandemic, in an effort to protect jobs. It saidextending these schemes to next Marchmeant 300,000 fewer people would be out of work. Mr Sunakconfirmed that around 1.3 million public sector workers - excluding some NHS staff and those earning less than Â£24,000- will have their pay frozen next year. The chancellor said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis. But Mr Sunak said lower-paid public sector workers would be guaranteed at least a Â£250 pay rise next year. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, criticised the pay freeze. She said: ""Earlier this year the chancellor stood on his doorstep and clapped for key workers. Today, his government institutes a pay freeze for many of them. This takes a sledgehammer to consumer confidence."" Civil servant Robert said he was 'deeply disappointed' Robert, a 25-year-old civil servant and representative for the PCS Union, saidhe was ""deeply disappointed"". ""[Civil servants] have spearheaded the response to the pandemic and worked tirelessly to deliver Brexit. We've stepped up and delivered... and I'd like to be recognised for that."" Having worked for various government departments since graduating from university a few years ago, he says he feels ""let down"". Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance How will the Spending Review affect you? The UK economy remains in rescue mode The minimum wage - which has been rebranded as the National Living Wage - will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to Â£8.91 an hour, with the rate extended to those aged 23 and over. Other rates were also increased. From next April, 16 and 17 year-olds will see their pay go up to Â£4.62 per hour, from Â£4.55 today. TheUK also ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national incomeon overseas aid to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home. Mr Sunak said the new 0.5% target - which adds up to about Â£4bn in savings - will be ""temporary"". Andmillions of retirees will see the future value of their pension cutowing to a planned change in the way payments are calculated from 2030. Mr Sunak said the government had already spent Â£280bn to help support the economy through the coronavirus. It will spend a further Â£55bn next year as part of a package of measures to support the recovery. This includes billions of pounds to help people find jobs. The UK is expected to borrow Â£393.5bn this financial year to help pay for economic relief measures. Borrowing is also forecast by the OBR to remain above Â£100bn-a-year - or 4% of the size of the UK economy - in five years time. In recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable. At the moment it pays just 0.32% interest to borrow for ten years. However, Mr Sunak said long-term scarring meant the economy would be 3% smaller in 2025 than expected in the March budget. What is GDP? Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Sunak cuts UK overseas aid budget Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million The OBR said the coronavirus pandemic had ""delivered the largest peacetime shock to the global economy on record"", while recent restrictions across the UK had taken ""the wind out of an already flagging recovery"". It said the UK's later and longer lockdown this spring meant it had experienced ""a deeper fall and slower recovery in economic activity"" than some of its European neighbours. The independent forecaster also warned that tax rises or spending cuts would be needed in future years to stabilise the UK's growing debt pile. Richard Hughes, the OBR's chairman said: ""The chancellor will need to find Â£20bn to Â£30bn in spending cuts or tax rises if he wants to balance revenues and day-to-day spending, and stop debt rising by the end of this parliament."" Is that the end of it? The official forecasts assume that 2 December spells the end of lockdown, that we remain in the equivalent of Tier 3 restrictions until the spring - and then the vaccine becomes widely adopted in the second half of 2021. Too cautious - or optimistic? If anything, 2020 has taught us that assumptions can last as long as a disposable face covering. But it'll take longer for economic life to spring back to rude health. Reviving job prospects, investment and consumption will take TLC. Even when the official crystal ball gets misty, in 2025, output is still 3% lower than it was previously expected to be. And that's without the  risk of a no-deal; the OBR says that could mean that output is a further 1.5% by 2025. Some economists think the hit could be greater (indeed, the Governor of the Bank of England says the long term impact of a no- deal could exceed that of a virus). Rishi Sunak has to decide when to turn off the support to the convalescing economy - and when to  start  patching up the public finances by firing up tax rises. The extreme uncertainty underlines how fraught - and costly - that decision could be. House prices are expected to fall in 2021 and 2022. The OBR expects a recent revival in the market to end next year when astamp duty holidaystops in March and more people lose their jobs as government support schemes are pared back. However, the end of the tax break is expected to contribute to a 3.5% fall in house prices next year and a further 2.6% drop in 2022. The OBR added: ""Despite a steady recovery from 2022 onwards, the level of house prices remains around 17% lower (in 2025) compared to our March forecast."" The OBR said the ""unresolved nature"" of the negotiations between the UK and EU over a Brexit deal had ""further clouded"" the economic outlook. It said failure to secure a deal would reduce the size of the UK economy by a further 2% in 2021, with permanent damage to growth and living standards in future years. Under this no-deal scenario, the economy would not return to the size it was before the pandemic hit until the second half of 2023, while unemployment would peak at a higher rate of 8.3%.

"""We see the data every month, and the shock that our economy is facing at the moment is significant"" - Rishi Sunak. On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak begins setting out plans for what he hopes will be an economy beyond Covid-19. This Spending Review - detailing the money government departments will get for things like the NHS, education, roads, and police - only covers the financial year 2021-22. It will also set out money for the devolved administrations Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In normal times, reviews cover three or four years. But such is the economic uncertainty that this look-ahead has been limited to the next 12 months. Even so, Mr Sunak will point to the direction of travel for spending (and possibly tax rises) for future years. Few reviews can have been so anticipated. Here's what to watch out for. The economic shock has left the UK poorer. By the end of this year the economy is expected to be at least 10% smaller than pre-pandemic. Alongside the Spending Review, Mr Sunak will disclose latest forecasts for the economy and public finances from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Earlier this year, the OBR forecast a 13% contraction. While it is not expected to be that bad, the shrinkage will still likely be in the double-digits, and with public borrowing topping Â£350bn - something not seen in peacetime. A difficulty for the chancellor is that big tranches of public service spending have already been made. Despite that, some areas will reportedly get more: NHS England, schools and defence. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), some two-thirds of public service spending has been pre-determined. The key question is whether the remaining third is enough to go round. The answer is almost certainly not. The IFS thinks ""unprotected"" services such as the courts, prisons or local government are vulnerable to cuts. The overseas aid budget is also in the line of fire. Teachers are among workers who could face a pay freeze Saving, not spending, will dominate Wednesday's agenda. And one of the biggest savings could be a public sector pay freeze. It would be hugely controversial. Media leaks last week claimed Mr Sunak wants a freeze for everyone except frontline NHS staff. That won't go down well with the police, teachers, civil servants or anyone who thinks they've done their bit to ensure the public sector keeps going in tough times. Even a return to a 1% cap is likely to be fiercely resisted. Some commentators think the media reports were Treasury kite-flying. Even so, in the summer, Mr Sunak suggested that as private sector pay had taken a huge hit, in the ""interest of fairness"" the public sector's 5.4 million workers should share some pain. Trouble is, relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay has fallen to its lowest level in decades, according to the IFS. Only during the pandemic has public sector pay performed more strongly than in the private sector. Union leaders have already warned of industrial action to ensure members' pay does not fall further behind. There is speculation some government operations could be relocated from London Many promises have been thrown off-course because of the pandemic, and the government will be keen to get its north-south levelling up agenda back on track as soon as possible. Infrastructure spending is key to this. The north has long complained that the Treasury methodology used to calculate the cost-benefit of spending money on big projects is inherently biased towards London and the rest of the south east. So, expect some changes to these calculations. And watch out for whether any spending promises are new money, or simply projects brought forward. To underline his commitment to spend on big long-term projects, there is talk that Mr Sunak could publish details of a National Infrastructure Strategy and a Research and Development Strategy. And in a symbolic move that levelling up is more than a question of infrastructure, the Financial Times has reported that the chancellor could also announce that parts of government could relocate from the capital - with the Treasury leading the way. Tax hikes are inevitable, but rises too soon will choke off recovery, economists say While Wednesday will be about spending and borrowing, at some point the chancellor will have to decide how it will be paid for. He will start to address this in next March's Budget, although most economic commentators feel the economy will still be too fragile for major tax rises. It is possible that, with the success of a Covid vaccine, the economy could bounce back, limiting the need for big rises. However, Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC that four or five years down the road he still expects the economy to be about 4%-5% smaller than before the pandemic. Rein in spending and raise taxes too early, and recovery will be choked off. Leave it too late, and the public finances will spin out of control. ""It's a fine judgement,"" said Mr Johnson. Both the chancellor and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have, however, said they don't want a return to austerity. There have been reports the Treasury could raise money from changes to Capital Gains Tax, pensions relief or self-employment taxes. But this is tinkering. Mr Johnson believes Â£40bn of tax rises are necessary over the short-term, and that sort of money cannot be raised without touching the Big Three: income tax, VAT or national insurance. These bring in almost two-thirds of government revenue. How will the Spending Review affect you?

"Messages were daubed in white on the sides of the car A car has been driven into the gates of Angela Merkel's Federal Chancellery building in Berlin, German police say. A 54-year-old man was detained but the background to the incident was unclear. The Volkswagen car had messages daubed in white on both sides. One called for an end to ""globalisation politics"" while another referred to ""you damned killers of children and old people"". The incident came hours before Mrs Merkel held talks with regional leaders on extending Covid safety measures. It is not known if she was in the building at the time. Germany's ""lockdown light"" is expected to be extended until 20 December and the restrictions have prompted protests from Covid deniers and far-right activists. Water cannon breaks up Covid protest in Berlin However, there were indications that Wednesday morning's low-speed crash was not related to the protests. An interior ministry spokesman later confirmed German reports that the man detained had also driven into the gate in February 2014. On that occasion the car had different white slogans daubed on the side. One called for an end to climate change while another read simply: ""Nicole, I love you."" Police said they were trying to establish whether the driver on Wednesday had a psychological condition or a particular motive. A government spokesperson said at no point was there any risk to the chancellor or anyone else. The gate was only slightly damaged in the incident Mrs Merkel is discussing a draft proposal agreed by Germany's 16 state premiers to keep hotels and restaurants shut and limit private gatherings to five people (not including children under 14). A special Christmas exemption from 23 December to 1 January would allow gatherings of up to 10 people. German health officials reported 410 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday - the highest daily number since the pandemic began. However, Germany has seen proportionally far fewer fatalities than other Western European countries, with a total of 14,771. Germany has a large protest movement against Covid-19 measures, including many anti-vaccination activists. Protesters rallied in the centre of Berlin last week close to the parliament building, the Reichstag, before the protest was broken up by police. This video can not be played Police used water cannon after repeatedly telling protesters to disperse Angela Merkel, 66, has just marked 15 years as chancellor and is planning to step down from the post next year. She does not live in the chancellery but instead leads a modest life in a Berlin flat with her husband, Prof Joachim Sauer. Her Christian Democrat (CDU) party is doing well in the opinion polls, partly because of her handling of the pandemic. The government agreed on Wednesday to hold parliamentary elections on 26 September 2021 but the race to succeed Mrs Merkel as the CDU's candidate for chancellor is still to run. The CDU will hold an online congress in January 2021 when they are expected to select a new party leadership.

"This video can not be played ""Itâs a team that reflects the fact that America is back,"" says the president-elect US President-elect Joe Biden says the White House has so far been ""sincere"" in helping his transition to power. ""It has not been begrudging so far, and I don't expect it to be,"" he told NBC News in an interview. He spoke as he unveiled his choice of top officials for when he takes over from Donald Trump in January. Mr Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process to begin on Monday, nearly three weeks after the presidential election. Yet he still refuses to admit defeat, repeating unsubstantiated claims that the 3 November vote was ""rigged"". President Trump's efforts to challenge the results in key states in courts have so far failed. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania and Nevada officially certified Mr Biden's victory, a day after the same outcome was announced in Michigan. Mr Trump had been expected later on Wednesday to join his lawyer Rudy Giuliani in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where what is being described as a ""hearing"" of the state senate's Republican majority on allegations of voter fraud is taking place. But media reports say Mr Trump's trip was cancelled after two associates of Mr Giuliani tested positive for Covid-19. The lawyer is still expected to attend. State officials have denied the fraud allegations, and on MondayPennsylvania's supreme court dismissed a Trump campaign lawsuit aimed at invalidating millions of mail-in votes. Speaking to NBC's Nightly News, he confirmed he had not yet spoken to the president but added that he did not expect the beginning of his term to be affected by the delay in beginning the transition. Could Biden's win doom this town? What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us What is the presidential transition? ""It's a slow start but it's starting and there's two months left to go, so I'm feeling good about the ability to be able to get up to speed,"" he said. Mr Biden can now access key government officials and millions of dollars in funds as he prepares to take over on 20 January. He will also receive the Presidential Daily Brief - an update on international threats and developments. Aide Jen Psaki said he would get his first briefing on Monday, and classified information was already being shared with Mr Biden's senior team. Mr Biden, who previously served as Barack Obama's vice-president, said that his time in office would not be a ""third Obama term"" because ""we face a totally different world than we faced in the Obama-Biden administration"". ""America is back"" and ""ready to lead the world, not retreat from it"", he said when he introduced his future team earlier on Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware. He also told reporters he had discussed the Irish border issue with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other leaders. This video can not be played Joe Biden: ""We've just got to keep the border open"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland US doesn't want guarded border on Ireland - Biden The 310-mile border at the heart of Brexit Mr Biden, who has Irish heritage, said he was against a guarded border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland as a result of Brexit, arguing it must be kept open: ""The idea of having the border north and south once again being closed, it's just not right."" Mr Biden unveiled his selections for six key posts: Antony Blinken,secretary of state. Mr Blinken said the US would soon ""with equal measures of humility and confidence"" restore its relationships with other countries John Kerry,climate change envoy.He was one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement, from which President Trump withdrew. Mr Kerry said the world must ""come together to end the climate crisis"" Avril Haines,director of national intelligence - would be the first woman in the post.Mr Biden said: ""I picked a professional... a fierce advocate for telling the truth"". Alejandro Mayorkas,secretary of homeland security-would be the first Latino in the post. Mr Mayorkas said the department had ""a noble mission, to help keep us safe and to advance our proud history as a country of welcome"" Jake Sullivan,White House national security adviser.Mr Sullivan praised his boss, saying he had taught him much about statecraft, but also ""most importantly about human nature"" Linda Thomas-Greenfield,US ambassador to the UN.She said she would bring her southern Louisiana roots to her job Alejandro Mayorkas (left) and Avril Haines (right) have been formally named; Janet Yellen (centre) is expected to be picked for the treasury One choice that is expected but has not been announced yet is former Federal Reserve chairJanet Yellenas treasury secretary. Another is the key post of defence secretary, with MichÃ¨le Flournoy - an Obama-era defence under secretary - a strong contender. Mr Biden would name more key nominees, including his economic team, next week, Ms Psaki said. Apart from Mr Kerry and Mr Sullivan, most of the picks will need confirmation by the Senate. Rejection of a nominee is rare. Joe Biden's picks for the top roles in his administration have been celebrated by centrist Democrats: they speak glowingly of the diversity and experience of the individuals, a group that includes veteran foreign policy experts, and accomplished women and people of colour. Yet progressives feel cheated. They say they helped Mr Biden win, and now they have been shut out of power. These progressives say the cabinet will be filled with ""Clinton and Obama retreads"", as one of them puts it, describing it as a return to the ""Blob"", a term that Ben Rhodes, who served as Mr Obama's speechwriter, once used to describe the Washington establishment. Stephen Wertheim from the Quincy Institute, a think tank focused on foreign policy, says the new Democratic team in the White House may end up acting like the old one, a group of centrists who, he says, focused more on military threats than on issues such as climate change. He adds: ""Progressives have a right to be concerned about whether there will be significant change."" In a brief appearance in the White House press room on Tuesday, Mr Trump praised the work of his administration, hailed the Dow Jones stock index for passing the 30,000 mark and left without taking questions. Later in the Rose Garden, praising the armed forces, he said: ""And as I say, 'America First'. Shouldn't go away from that... 'America First'."" US shares set records as investor optimism grows How is President Trump challenging the result? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Republican Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton said Mr Biden had surrounded himself with ""panda huggers"" who would go soft on China. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who is on the committee that will vote on Mr Blinken's nomination, tweeted: ""Biden's cabinet picks went to Ivy League schools, have strong resumes, attend all the right conferences & will be polite & orderly caretakers of America's decline.""

"This video can not be played ""Itâs a team that reflects the fact that America is back,"" says the president-elect US President-elect Joe Biden says the White House has so far been ""sincere"" in helping his transition to power. ""It has not been begrudging so far, and I don't expect it to be,"" he told NBC News in an interview. He spoke as he unveiled his choice of top officials for when he takes over from Donald Trump in January. Mr Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process to begin on Monday, nearly three weeks after the presidential election. Yet he still refuses to admit defeat, repeating unsubstantiated claims that the 3 November vote was ""rigged"". President Trump's efforts to challenge the results in key states in courts have so far failed. On Tuesday, Pennsylvania and Nevada officially certified Mr Biden's victory, a day after the same outcome was announced in Michigan. Mr Trump had been expected later on Wednesday to join his lawyer Rudy Giuliani in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where what is being described as a ""hearing"" of the state senate's Republican majority on allegations of voter fraud is taking place. But media reports say Mr Trump's trip was cancelled after two associates of Mr Giuliani tested positive for Covid-19. The lawyer is still expected to attend. State officials have denied the fraud allegations, and on MondayPennsylvania's supreme court dismissed a Trump campaign lawsuit aimed at invalidating millions of mail-in votes. Speaking to NBC's Nightly News, he confirmed he had not yet spoken to the president but added that he did not expect the beginning of his term to be affected by the delay in beginning the transition. Could Biden's win doom this town? What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us What is the presidential transition? ""It's a slow start but it's starting and there's two months left to go, so I'm feeling good about the ability to be able to get up to speed,"" he said. Mr Biden can now access key government officials and millions of dollars in funds as he prepares to take over on 20 January. He will also receive the Presidential Daily Brief - an update on international threats and developments. Aide Jen Psaki said he would get his first briefing on Monday, and classified information was already being shared with Mr Biden's senior team. Mr Biden, who previously served as Barack Obama's vice-president, said that his time in office would not be a ""third Obama term"" because ""we face a totally different world than we faced in the Obama-Biden administration"". ""America is back"" and ""ready to lead the world, not retreat from it"", he said when he introduced his future team earlier on Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware. He also told reporters he had discussed the Irish border issue with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other leaders. This video can not be played Joe Biden: ""We've just got to keep the border open"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland US doesn't want guarded border on Ireland - Biden The 310-mile border at the heart of Brexit Mr Biden, who has Irish heritage, said he was against a guarded border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland as a result of Brexit, arguing it must be kept open: ""The idea of having the border north and south once again being closed, it's just not right."" Mr Biden unveiled his selections for six key posts: Antony Blinken,secretary of state. Mr Blinken said the US would soon ""with equal measures of humility and confidence"" restore its relationships with other countries John Kerry,climate change envoy.He was one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement, from which President Trump withdrew. Mr Kerry said the world must ""come together to end the climate crisis"" Avril Haines,director of national intelligence - would be the first woman in the post.Mr Biden said: ""I picked a professional... a fierce advocate for telling the truth"". Alejandro Mayorkas,secretary of homeland security-would be the first Latino in the post. Mr Mayorkas said the department had ""a noble mission, to help keep us safe and to advance our proud history as a country of welcome"" Jake Sullivan,White House national security adviser.Mr Sullivan praised his boss, saying he had taught him much about statecraft, but also ""most importantly about human nature"" Linda Thomas-Greenfield,US ambassador to the UN.She said she would bring her southern Louisiana roots to her job Alejandro Mayorkas (left) and Avril Haines (right) have been formally named; Janet Yellen (centre) is expected to be picked for the treasury One choice that is expected but has not been announced yet is former Federal Reserve chairJanet Yellenas treasury secretary. Another is the key post of defence secretary, with MichÃ¨le Flournoy - an Obama-era defence under secretary - a strong contender. Mr Biden would name more key nominees, including his economic team, next week, Ms Psaki said. Apart from Mr Kerry and Mr Sullivan, most of the picks will need confirmation by the Senate. Rejection of a nominee is rare. Joe Biden's picks for the top roles in his administration have been celebrated by centrist Democrats: they speak glowingly of the diversity and experience of the individuals, a group that includes veteran foreign policy experts, and accomplished women and people of colour. Yet progressives feel cheated. They say they helped Mr Biden win, and now they have been shut out of power. These progressives say the cabinet will be filled with ""Clinton and Obama retreads"", as one of them puts it, describing it as a return to the ""Blob"", a term that Ben Rhodes, who served as Mr Obama's speechwriter, once used to describe the Washington establishment. Stephen Wertheim from the Quincy Institute, a think tank focused on foreign policy, says the new Democratic team in the White House may end up acting like the old one, a group of centrists who, he says, focused more on military threats than on issues such as climate change. He adds: ""Progressives have a right to be concerned about whether there will be significant change."" In a brief appearance in the White House press room on Tuesday, Mr Trump praised the work of his administration, hailed the Dow Jones stock index for passing the 30,000 mark and left without taking questions. Later in the Rose Garden, praising the armed forces, he said: ""And as I say, 'America First'. Shouldn't go away from that... 'America First'."" US shares set records as investor optimism grows How is President Trump challenging the result? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Republican Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton said Mr Biden had surrounded himself with ""panda huggers"" who would go soft on China. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who is on the committee that will vote on Mr Blinken's nomination, tweeted: ""Biden's cabinet picks went to Ivy League schools, have strong resumes, attend all the right conferences & will be polite & orderly caretakers of America's decline.""

"Millions of Americans are travelling home to celebrate Thanksgiving, despite warnings from health officials amid a surge of Covid-19 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has told Americans to stay at home and celebrate only with those they live with Hard-hit regions have reimposed restrictions with El Paso, Texas announcing a night-time curfew People across the UK are being urged to think carefully before they take advantage of the relaxation of restrictions on Christmas Government adviser Prof Andrew Hayward says family gatherings are a ""recipe for regret"" for people UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the UK's ""economic emergency"" has ""only just begun"" as he sets out spending plan The number of unemployed people in the UK is expected to surge to 2.6 million by mid 2021 Nearly 60 million cases have been confirmed globally with around 1.4 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hugo Bachega and Marie Jackson That's all for now. Today's live updates were the work of Penny Spiller, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Katie Wright, John Hand, Hugo Bachega and Marie Jackson. Thanks for joining us. We'll be back on Thursday with all the very latest. It's been a big day of news and we're almost done for the day. Before we go though, here's what the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said about coronavirus in his Spending Review:  And, in other coronavirus news: The government has recorded another 696 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, an increase of 88 on yesterdayâs daily figure. It is the highest daily figure reported since 5 May. The government also recorded a further 18,213 cases of the virus, up 6,914 on Tuesdayâs daily figure. While Americans prepare for their Thanksgiving holiday, cases, hospital admissions and virus deaths tick up across the country. As of Wednesday afternoon, the US has recorded more than 12.6 million infections and more than 260,000 deaths. Here's what else you need you know: Boris Epshteyn (R) is pictured with Rudy Giuliani at a press conference last week. Another member of President Donald Trump's legal team, Boris Epshteyn, has tested positive for coronavirus. ""I am experiencing mild symptoms and am following all appropriate protocols, including quarantining and contact tracing,"" Epshteyn wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Epshteyn was seen at a press conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters last week with White House aide Andrew Giuliani, son of Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Andrew announced last week he had tested positive. Epshteyn has also spent time with the elder Giuliani, who is now leading efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Dozens of people close to President Donald Trump - including First Lady Melania Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie - have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. The president himself tested positive in October.  Two weeks ago Scarborough had the second highest infection rate in England Coronavirus cases in one of England's worst affected areas have more than halved in two weeks. On 11 November, Scarborough's infection rate stood at 611 - the second highest in England.It has now fallen to 296 per 100,000. Cases across North Yorkshire have also declined with the average for the county now 196 cases, lower than the national average of 207. One of the county's health officials, Richard Webb, told a briefing that falling infection rates had given the region some optimism that it could escape the tightest controls set to be announced by the government on Thursday. North Yorkshire was one of the few parts of northern England to remain in tier one - the lowest tier of restrictions - prior to the national lockdown which began on 5 November. England will move to a tougher version of tiered coronavirus restrictions when the lockdown ends on 2 December.Here's a reminder of the new rules. Taxis blocked key roads in Madrid US President-elect Joe Biden will deliver remarks from Wilmington, Delaware, later ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Democrat is expected to discuss the shared sacrifices of Americans during the approaching holiday season, as coronavirus outbreaks surge across the country. On Monday, Donald Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process to begin, nearly three weeks after the presidential election. Biden had previously warned that a lack of co-ordination - particularly on coronavirus policy - meant that ""people may die"". But so far, the Trump White House has been ""sincere"" in its transition to the new administration, Biden said on Tuesday. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says that being active is ""central to health"" but many people have reduced their levels of exercise during the pandemic. He said some people had done more exercise during the crisis but for many, coronavirus has made it harder. Speaking at a summit for ukactive, which represents many in the fitness industry, he said: ""It is very important that we get people who have got out of the habit of regular exercise back in the situation where they are doing so, and encourage others who have taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn't, to continue to do so. ""We need to think this through because exercise is so central. Exercise is the single simplest and most important thing people can do to improve their physical and mental health."" Restrictions in healthcare settings during the pandemic have added to the ""trauma and distress"" already endured by many women who have miscarried, a charity boss has said. Clea Harmer, of stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said coronavirus rules have meant women have had to go to hospital and grieve for their unborn babies alone. ""Attending scans and appointments can be really difficult, especially if you have had a miscarriage before, or your baby has died before, and often the scan is the place where you were told your baby has died,"" she said. ""To be in that position on your own, without your partner there... there are heartbreaking stories of mothers being told on their own and having to go out to the car park or back home and tell their partner themselves."" She added that although the NHS has issued guidance for hospitals to allow women to bring their partners to appointments, the picture is ""very mixed across the country"". Her comments come afterthe Duchess of Sussex revealed she had a miscarriagein July, writing in a New York Times article of feeling ""an almost unbearable grief"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Wuhan's Huanan Seafood market was one of the first places to close as virus cases began to emerge in January China's officialCGTN broadcaster says China has given assurances to the World Health Organization,external(WHO) that the body will be able to send a team to investigate the origins of the coronavirus ""as soon as possible"". Many experts think Covid-19 likely originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has been linked to early confirmed cases. While not a wet market in the strictest sense, reports suggest the market was selling wildlife, including snakes, porcupine and deer. After an initial cluster of cases connected to the market, the virus began spreading dramatically inside China, before reaching much of the world.The origins of the novel virus are unknown, but it most likely emerged in a bat, then made the leap to humans via another wild animal host. But Chinese media have increasingly beenamplifying suggestions that the virus might have been in other countries,externalbefore reaching
China. The country has sought to deflect blame for the outbreak from
countries like the US, and has often shared a message that the WHO views
China as taking an ""active response"" in handling Covid-19. The boss of NHS Wales has said doctors aren't seeing as many cases of flu this year, as a result of record levels of flu vaccination, people wearing masks and social distancing measures. There had been worries the annual flu season would add pressure to the NHS as it struggles with coronavirus, but Dr Andrew Goodall said the impact is ""very negligible"". He said levels of flu in Wales were similar to the low rates seen in the southern hemisphere earlier this year. Walesannounced its largest ever flu campaign in the summer, with free jabs offered to those who were shielding and the over-50s. However, last month the Welsh government said the over-50s ""will be vaccinated in a phased approach starting later this year""amid supply concerns. In England,30 million people are being offered a flu jabin the country's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date, with those over 50 eligible from 1 December. In Scotland, health workers, those with medical conditions, social care workers, families of shielders and over 55sare being offered the flu jab this year- though the roll-out has been called ""poorly managed"". Last week, Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swanndenied there was a shortage in the number of flu vaccinesordered. Cosy rooms packed with people, chatting, laughing, even singing, and sharing food and drink for hours are the norm for the festive season. But unfortunately, almost everything that's great for lifting our spirits at Christmas is also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. Here are a couple of things to think about when you're planning get-togethers. Are you sharing food and drink? Covid-19 can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated, which means you could be handing round the virus as well as the sprouts. In the US,the official advice for this year's Thanksgiving dinners,externalis to break totally with tradition by asking guests to bring their own food and drinks. It's also recommended that you control who's allowed in the kitchen, with one lucky person doing all the serving. Are the windows open? The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A report by government scientific advisers says,externalinfection risks can be increased by four times without proper ventilation. And if people feel too cold? Wear another layer. Read our full list of tips for reducing the risk here. Coronavirus-related crime is a global trend, clearly, as a man who tried to take money whileposing as a Covid-19 contact tracer in England has been jailed. Martin Payne visited houses in Stafford in September wearing a high-visibility bib and claimed to be collecting money for the NHS, Staffordshire Police said. The force said that, when challenged about identification, he walked away. Contact tracers notify, interview, and advise those who have been in contact with people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Payne, 30, has been jailed for six weeks, and also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£128. Two Texas men have been charged with attempting to sell 50 million non-existent medical face masks to a foreign government, according to the US Justice Department. Paschal Ngozi Eleanya, 46, and Arael Doolittle, 55, defrauded an unnamed foreign government out of more than $317m (Â£237m) - the total purchase price of the masks - according to the indictment. With their brokers, the pair allegedly negotiated a sales price for the masks that was five times the public list price of the masks, set by the manufacturers. The two expected to personally receive up to $275m as a result of the scheme, according to the charges. Authorities disrupted the sale before it could be completed but the foreign government had already wired the funds, court documents said. If convicted, Doolittle and Eleanya could face up to 25 years behind bars, and a maximum $250,000 (Â£187,000) fine. In the US ,the pandemic is going to keep many families apart this Thanksgiving, but Texas grandparents Missy and Barry Buchanan have come up with an ingenious way to stay connected with their family.

""But we're just thankful that everybody has been well and safe, and we will be together again around the table."" Ross County are one of the few SPFL clubs permitted to have up to 300 fans in attendance The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is calling for an emergency  meeting with Nicola Sturgeon to discuss a return of fans to Scottish football. The league body, which represents the top four leagues in Scottish football, wants the first minister to follow the UK government, which has outlined plansto allow up to 4,000 spectators into grounds in areas in England where coronavirus levels are low. As it stands, the number allowed in Scotland is 300 - and that is only for clubs in tier one. The SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster says if that continues, it will sound ""the death knell"" for some clubs in Scotland. He added: ""We are now calling on the first minister to do the right thing by Scotland's
hard-pressed football supporters. If it's good enough for English fans, it must
be good enough for Scottish fans."" However, Sturgeon has responded, sayingfootball cannot be treated ""in isolation"". It's been a busy day. If you're just catching up, these are the main UK headlines: The US recorded nearly 2,100 virus deaths on Tuesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project - the highest single-day total since May. As cases and hospital admissions surge across the country, experts have warned that deaths will follow. The daily caseload has not dipped below 100,000 in three weeks, and the US on Tuesday hit a record high in hospital admissions for the 15th consecutive day. The concerning upward trend is expected to worsen in coming days with the US Thanksgiving holiday, which typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. And while fewer Americans are travelling this year, the holiday typically calls for congregating and eating indoors with large groups - risky activities for Covid spread. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK's economy had zero growth in the third quarter of 2024, according to the latest official figures. The strength of the economy affects things like pay increases for workers and the amount of tax the government can raise to pay for services. GDP stands for gross domestic product, and is a measure of all the economic activity of companies, governments and people in a country. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) publishesnew GDP figures every month,external. However, quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are considered more important. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. That's because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid and workers get better pay rises. When GDP is falling, it means the economy is shrinking - which can be bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known asa recession, which can lead to pay freezes and job losses. The UK briefly fell into recession at the end of 2023, when the economy shrank in the last two quarters of the year. It rebounded in the first half of 2024, when GDP increased 0.7% between January and March, and0.5% between April and June,external. However, the economy had zero growth betweenJuly and September. The latest monthly figures show that GDPshrank by 0.1% in October. Analysts said the unexpected fall was linked to measures announcedin that month's Budget, including a rise in employernational insurance contributions (NICs)and ahigher minimum wage. In early December, the influential think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cut its growth forecast for the UK for 2024. It now expects the UK economy to grow by 0.9% across the year as a whole, down from its previous prediction of 1.1%. That would make it the fourth best performer in the G7 group of rich nations,according to the OECD,external, behind the US, Canada and France, but ahead of Italy, Germany and Japan. However, economic forecasts are not always accurate. If GDP is going up steadily, people pay more in tax because they're earning and spending more. This means more money for the government, which it can choose to spend on public services, such as schools, police and hospitals. When the economy shrinks and a country goes into recession, these things can go into reverse. Governments tend to get less money in tax, which means they may decide to freeze or cut public spending, or put taxes up. In 2020, the Covid pandemic caused the most severe UK recession for more than 300 years, which forced the government to borrow hundreds of billions of pounds to support the economy. How much money does the UK government raise and spend each year? Where does the government borrow billions from? GDP can be measured in three ways: Output: The total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction, the service sector and government Expenditure:The value of goods and services bought by households and by government, investment in machinery and buildings - this also includes the value of exports, minus imports Income: The value of the income generated, mostly in terms of profits and wages In the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three measurements. But early estimates mainly use the output measure, using data collected from thousands of companies. The UK produces one of the quickest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question. At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so the figure is revised as more information comes in. The ONS publishes more information about thison its website,external. GDPdoesn't tell the whole story: the hidden economy:unpaid work such as caring for children or elderly relatives isn't captured inequality:it also doesn't show how income is split across a population - rising GDP could result from the richest getting richer, rather than everyone becoming better off, and some people could be worse off To try and address this, the ONS also publishes a figure for GDP per capita - or head of population - which can tell a different story. In fact, when you strip out inflation and population growth, the latest quarterly figures show thatGDP per capita actually fell by 0.1% between July and September 2024,external. Official GDP figures don't take into account unpaid work like looking after children Some critics also argue that GDP doesn't take into account whether the economic growth it measures is sustainable,or the environmental damage it might do. Alternative measures have been developed which try to capture this. Since 2010,the ONS has also measured well-being,externalalongside economic growth. This assesses health, relationships, education and skills, as well as people's personal finances and the environment. But despite its limitations, GDP is still the most widely-used measure for most government decisions and international comparisons.

"The Chancellor has delivered his Spending Review - setting out government plans for the economy and spending Rishi Sunak said the government is set to borrow a record Â£394bn this year He told MPs unemployment will rise to 2.6 million by the second quarter of 2021 Mr Sunak said the economy is predicted to contract by 11.3% and grow by 5.5% next year and 6.6% in 2022. Public sector pay will be frozen, except for NHS staff and those earning under Â£24,000 The BBC has been told that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public sector pay freeze Spending on overseas aid will be cut from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income next year The spending plans don't include any tax changes - they are only announced in the Budget The economy has been hit by the cost of borrowing for the coronavirus pandemic and job losses The Office for Budget Responsibility published its forecasts for the economy and public finances The OBR warned the economy is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until the end of 2022 The chancellor told the cabinet this morning the OBR figures were ""sobering"" Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon and Howard Mustoe BBC Politics That's where we'll end our coverage and analysis of the Spending Review, and this week's Prime Minister's Questions. Our reporting today was brought to you by Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Kate Whannel, and Howard Mustoe, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. Thanks for following along with us. Good night.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his Spending Review statement in the Commons earlier Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Chancellor leaving No 11 this morning On rare occasions, nervous chancellors leave No 11
gripping their documents, to deliver news to the country that resets the dial. That happened today. The pandemic has already cost jobs and
hardships, but there can now be no doubt that the economic aftermath will last
for many years. The predictions of job losses, record levels of borrowing and
debt - all huge headlines in themselves. In the last few months, with
almost no dissent, the government has scrambled to expand the state to
help cope with coronavirus. Borrowing rates are at rock bottom. Other countries
have done the same. There is little controversy about the decisions that have
been taken so far. But what lurks on the countryâs balance sheet is the biggest
economic baggage for generations. There is almost zero political pressure to
solve the problem any time soon. But eventually the pressure will force a
reckoning in the Tory party. Itâs a Conservative chancellor - whose
instinct is to pare back the state - who has presided over a generational emergency
expansion. How Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson propose to solve that paradox will
create the contours of political arguments at least until the next election. BBC Politics The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out what the UK government will spend on health, education, transport and other public services next year.  Here's a recap on the main points: For more detailsyou can read more here. The chancellor visited the Imperial Centre for Translation and Experimental Medicine in West London After delivering his speech in the Commons earlier, the chancellor visited the National Institute for Health Research in west London where he met staff, and was talked through the process followed by vaccine volunteers. Speaking to reporters Rishi Sunak said with ""record peacetime debt levels"" he had to make some ""tough decisions"" in his Spending Review. He said the ""fiscal and economic situation"" meant decision had to be made to ""focus on the priorities of the British people"". Asked about the public sector pay freeze, Mr Sunak said ""if you look at the private sector, people are losing their jobs, hours are being cut wages are being cut, and in the context of that, it wouldn't be fair or right to have an across the board increase in public sector pay."" He said the targeted approach ""still means a majority of public sector workers will see an increase in their pay next year, which is a fair and reasonable approach to take"" BBC Politics Earlier today we said 1.3 million people would be directly affected by the central government public sector pay freeze. Here is a bit more detail on that stat. In total there are 5.5 million public sector workers. Around a million NHS workers and 2.1 million lower paid workers won't be affected. The freeze announced today does not apply those paid by local or devolved government - although those bodies may also decide to implement their own  pay rise pause. If that happens the total number of public sector workers impacted will be much higher. Earlier today, Rishi Sunak announced a Â£4bn ""levelling up"" fund to pay for upgrading local infrastructure across the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's PM, Labour Mayor for Greater Manchester Andy Burnham describes the fund ""distinctly underwhelming"". Because the fund is open to every single local authority, he argues that the money will not be prioritised in the areas where it is needed. He also says there will be a Â£20m cap on any project. ""We're talking modest train stations, bus interchanges, small roads - I don't think that amounts to a major strategic plan to level up poorest regions,"" he says. And he notes that local areas will have to apply to central government to get money. ""This is Whitehall wanting to hoard the money and the power,"" he says adding that the funding should be devolved to regions of England. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter The headline figure for Northern
Ireland is Â£920m â but when you break it down, more than half is in relation to
Covid-19 spending, with Â£380m for Stormontâs nine departments to share on
day-to-day matters. The Finance Minister Conor
Murphy has made it clear heâs less than impressed with whatâs been dished out. Heâs also concerned about where
this leaves the executive in terms of investing for economic recovery, both
from the impact of coronavirus and to mitigate any problems arising with Brexit
next year. Decisions on pay awards for
public sector workers are devolved to Stormont, so that will be a difficult
discussion the executive will need to have soon â but Mr Murphy said he did not
support the idea of âdividingâ those providing critical services across the
country. The DUP â former
confidence-and-supply partners of the Conservative Party â has welcomed the
funding announcement but said it would have liked to see armed forces and
police officers included with those who are in line for a pay rise. Read more on the reaction from Northern Ireland here Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC Scotland's Nine The Scottish government will get Â£2.4bn from this Spending Review to spend as it
wishes. A total of Â£570m will go towards maintaining EU funding for farming and another Â£14 million for
fishing. It will also get a portion of the Â£800m ""levelling up"" fund that is being split across the four nations. But a lot of the other spending plans had already been announced, such as freeports and city deals. The majority of public sector pay is met by the Scottish government - apart from some civil servants - so the pay freeze wonât directly impact majority of public sector workers. But it could indirectly hit them through less money being available through the block grant given to them by the UK government. Ministers in Scotland had been calling for a more generous support package and a commitment to the Universal Credit uplift, and are likely to repeat demands for greater financial
powers. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also called on the chancellor to reverse the cut in foreign aid
spending, calling it ""deplorable"". On Twitter she said,externalit ""is a political gesture to the right wing of the Tory party, and the price of it will be paid by some of the poorest people in the world."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC Wales The
spending review today confirms an extra Â£1.3bn for the Welsh Government - some
of which is an increase in their core spending budget, and some of it is extra
cash as a result of more spending in England to tackle coronavirus. The
UK Government's also outlined plans to spend Â£240m to support farmers and
land managers in Wales, and Â£2m to support fisheries. A farmers union claim
this is a cut of at least Â£95m compared to previous EU funding. But UK Government ministers insisted they are
honouring a commitment to maintain farm incomes. There
are still questions, however, about what funding Wales is going to get to
replace EU funding for the poorest regions of the UK. European structural and investment funding in Wales
amounts to approximately four times the UK average per person. West Wales and
the Valleys received the highest level of EU Structural Funds available in each
funding period for the past twenty years. The
Treasury have announced the replacement fund - known as the Shared Prosperity
Fund - will at least match EU funds UK-wide. But what's not yet clear is whether
Wales will get the same amount it did from the EU. UK ministers previously
promised Wales would not get ""a penny less."" You can read more reaction from Wales here Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Local businessman Peter Boys says Rossendale has faced four decades of austerity Back in East Lancashire, and some are finding the figures from the Office of Budget Responsibility - predicting the biggest economic decline in 300 years - hard to fathom. Peter Boys is the director of
B+E Boys, a family construction firm which is one of the biggest employers in
Rossendale. He says the numbers are so huge the scale is âvery difficult to understand.â âYou just know itâs a large number and itâs going to take some sorting out some point in the future, perhaps not this generation, but for the generation to follow, and I do worry about that,"" he says. But Peter warns against more austerity measures for his part of the world. âTowns like Rossendale have
not only had a decade of austerity, theyâve probably had about four decades of
austerity, from the late 80s and the early 90s, with industry taken out of the
country, and we started to see more imports of goods,"" he says. âWeâve suffered since then
really, so it really needs some funding to back that up in the future.â Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Lewis and Oliver are both on the hunt for jobs I've been
speaking to people in Rossendale and Darwen, East
Lancashire, about what they needed from the chancellor in today's Spending Review. For Oliver and Lewis, both 19, it is jobs, with both men unemployed and looking for work. Oliver was a commercial
bodyworks engineer but was made redundant during the pandemic and has been
looking for work ever since. âItâs demoralising,"" he said. ""Youâre applying for jobs all day and you get no response half of the
time, and if you do get a response itâs a no, and thatâs no way to live your
life.â Lewis says heâs probably applied for about 50 jobs recently, describing the hunt as ""horrible"" and ""painful"". He said: âI thought going to college
would be a good idea to get my experience up and that would be the push to get
a job. ""But Iâve got nothing so far... so Iâm stuck here with qualifications I
canât use.â Former Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, has
said itâs a ""very sad moment"" that the government hasabandoned its commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid. Mr Cameron has said the chancellor is making ""a
mistake"". He told reporters it was a promise made that the government doesnât have to break. The former PM said he ""totally
understands"" the economic climate and that difficult decisions have to be made, but the commitment was a
manifesto promise and was set down in legislation. He added that commitment ""really said something about Britain"" and allowed the country to do âbrilliant thingsâ. Head of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady tells BBC News the public sector pay freeze will hit ""the very people who have been caring for the rest of us throughout this crisis"". And she argues that the Â£250 pay rise for low earners ""won't go very far when food and rent are taking into account"". She says the Treasury is justifying the pay freeze on the grounds that those in the public sector are paid more than the private sector. However she says this is incorrect and cites a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which found that once qualifications and age are taken into account, there is no difference between private and public salaries. The
BBC understands that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public
sector pay freeze. Sonny, Melissa, Matt and Robert told us what they thought of the chancellor's spending plans The coronavirus pandemic has hit young people across the UK hard. RecentBBC researchfound that people aged 16-25 were more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job. So what do they think of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spending Review? Our business reporter Lora Jones hasspoken to four under 25s to gauge their reaction to today's announcements The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has echoedMarcus Rashford's question earlier,external, saying it is ""deeply disappointing"" that today's Spending Review ""is leaving millions to wait out the winter in fear and uncertainty
with no reassurance forthcoming"" about Universal Credit. The charity's director, Helen Barnard, said there was ""no conceivable scenario in which this support will
not be needed"" and the government's ""inaction risks a sharp rise in poverty"". She added: ""Itâs not too late for the chancellor to do the right thing. ""We urge the government in the strongest terms
to correct its course and commit to making the Â£20 uplift permanent and extend
it to legacy benefits at the earliest opportunity.â Historically, economists often got twitchy when a country's debts exceeded the vale of its annual output, since it raised concerns about whether the debts would be repaid. But the cost of borrowing is now close to zero. But those low rates must hold, says the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is there to check
over the Treasury's sums. The OBR thinks debt interest payments as compared to revenue will actually fall to historical lows because interest rates are so low. But debt compared to gross domestic product (GDP) will rise to 105%, it thinks. ""So
long as these conditions hold, a debt-to-GDP ratio over 100 per cent should not prove
particularly onerous by historical standards,"" says the OBR. TheCounty Councils Network,external- which represents England's 37 county councils and county unitary authorities - has welcomed a rise in funds from the chancellor's spending review. Councillor David Williams, chairman of the group and leader of Hertfordshire County Council, said the Â£1.55bn - plus Â£300m for adults and
childrenâs social care would ""ease
the burden on councils next year, especially in relation to the continuing
costs of the coronavirus"". But he said there was still ""an onus on local authorities raising
more from council tax to fund their social care costs"". Councillor Williams added: ""With councils facing
an underlying funding shortfall before the pandemic, they still face some
difficult decisions next year on what services to reduce."" Last month, the County Councils Network warned about the risks to servicesas many councils face huge problems balancing their books. Earlier this year the England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford forced the government into a U-turn onextending free school meals.

The government increased Universal Credit by Â£20 a week during the pandemic. However it has insisted this is only a temporary measure to support those financially hit by coronavirus. The raise is currently due to expire at the end of March next year. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Today's assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed not just that the pandemic hit the UK economy this year by the biggest amount in three centuries, 11.3%, but that it was also set to be the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations. It also said that government borrowing in this year was 19% of the size of the economy, a peacetime record, just under Â£400bn in one year. And yet the paradox is that next year the amount of money it costs to fund that debt will also reach a post-war record: a record low. Since World War Two, our debts have never been bigger. And yet they've never been cheaper. How long this situation will last is the fundamental judgement for this chancellor. Read more from Faisal Islam here. Reality Check Chancellor
Rishi Sunak defended the governmentâs decision to cut foreign aid spending from
0.7% of national income to 0.5%. He said that, even after the change next
year, âthe UK would remain the second highest aid donor in the G7â. According
to the latest data from theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,external(OECD) the UKâs current foreign aid budget is smaller in absolute terms than both the
United Statesâ and Germanyâs. In
2019, the UK spent $19.4bn (Â£14.6bn) on foreign aid, while the US allocated
$34.6bn (Â£25.9bn) to foreign aid and Germany spent $23.8bn (Â£17.9bn). Mr
Sunak has said that UK aid spending will fall to $13.3 (Â£10bn) in 2021. Both
the US and Germany have larger economies than the UK so when you look at aid
spending as a proportion of national income, the UK â with its current 0.7% -
ranks higher than them â and tops the list of the G7 wealthiest countries: When
the UK aid budget falls to 0.5% next year - it will drop behind Germany (0.6%),
putting it in second place in the G7 - as the Chancellor said. But
if the reduced aid budget remained the same into 2022, the UK would alsofall behind France,external- which plans to increase its aid budget to 0.55% of GDP by 2022 Mr
Sunak did say the governmentâs âintention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal
situation allowsâ but gave no specific timeline.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0005251942
" A domestic violence survivor’s journey in five objects by Eleanor Lawrie by Eleanor Lawrie Some people might have been happy at the prospect of being furloughed from their job, but for Victoria this was a terrifying prospect. “I remember that dread in my stomach, driving home from work on the last day thinking: ‘How long until I can get away?’” Victoria had already suffered years of abuse from her partner by the time the UK went into lockdown in March. After that, her life became even more difficult. It is a situation victims of domestic abuse have suffered all over the globe, in what the UN is calling the “shadow pandemic” - a focus ofBBC 100 Womenthis year. For every three months lockdown continues, the UN estimates an additional 15 million women are expected to be affected by intimate partner violence worldwide. For as long as she could remember, Victoria’s partner had been trying to control her every move, and had gradually cut her off from friends and family. He would ring her 10, 20, 30 times a day. One day when her phone was on silent upstairs, he sent a friend of his mother’s to check on her. Before the pandemic, Victoria had almost managed to leave - working punishing night shifts to save the deposit for her own flat. But her plans were derailed when one of the children was hospitalised. And now the couple were locked in the house together 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They could not even leave for shopping or exercise, because the child’s health problems meant the family had to shield. The family had a garden, but Victoria’s partner refused to let them go in it. He told them they could catch coronavirus even in the fresh air, far away from other people. So Victoria tried to get through the long days by taking an online course. Even then, he would sit beside her as she studied, and check her internet history afterwards. The strain became so unbearable that Victoria contemplated suicide. She would lie awake at night, trying to work out how she could get the children to a safe place first. ‘’I was thinking: 'I will have to kill myself, because I can’t live the rest of my life like this, and I can’t see any way out.'” But she found that learning to crochet helped relax her, giving her something else to focus on. Many people began a new hobby in lockdown out of boredom. But for Victoria, it became a lifeline. She began to spend her days making things for the world outside her four walls, such as clothes for a friend’s new baby. “Even though he was sitting there the whole time, or following me around, I could lose myself in crocheting and block him out a bit. It was one of the only things that kept me going.’’ As her partner's furlough was extended to July, and then to September, the situation at home began to spiral out of control. Already a heavy drinker, he started spending up to £500 on alcohol a month. And the drinking brought with it a constant threat of violence. He positioned a baseball bat by the front door and a baton on the stairs, and left knives around the house. Victoria knew he might use them - he had previously told her he would cut her throat if she tried to leave. About two thirds of women in England living with domestic abuse told aWomen’s Aid surveypublished in August that their ordeal had got worse during the UK’s first lockdown. It was one of Victoria’s children who finally triggered their escape. She texted a confidential mental health support service, and then managed to flee the house to stay with a supportive family member. “My daughter had had enough of the way he controlled everybody, and how scared we were all the time,’’ Victoria says. It’s not clear what Victoria’s daughter told the mental health service but police visited the family home to check on her wellbeing. Her partner responded by going on a drinking binge, while she and the children hid upstairs. And then in the early hours of the morning, he went into Victoria’s bedroom and tried to snatch her phone, demanding to know what her daughter had been saying about him. When Victoria refused to hand it over, he punched her in the face. Another daughter called the police, and the younger children were quickly woken up and taken out of the house. It was half past one in the morning. Victoria didn’t have enough time to grab any clothes - she left in shorts and a strappy top. Her daughter gave her a pair of flip flops and they headed into the night. Victoria and her children sought sanctuary with a relative, while the police arrested her partner.  The next morning she slipped back into the house while he was in custody. She quickly scooped up some possessions - toys for the children; her crochet hook. She also grabbed her dressing gown, a gift from her mother. Victoria’s partner hadn’t allowed her to see her mum for two years before she died of cancer. On the first anniversary of her death, he started to claim that he was suffering from the same type of cancer. “The attention wasn’t on him, and he knew saying that would upset me,” she says. Victoria is glad she thought to pack this memento of her mother, as she never returned to the house again. She contacted Women’s Aid, and within days she and the children had moved into a refuge. The first few weeks were difficult. The children reacted badly to loud noises and doors slamming, and Victoria struggled to sleep, imagining that her partner was standing by the door. But eventually they began to truly feel safe. “To not have the constant calls and text messages, or the threat of someone kicking the door open and pulling the covers off you in the middle of the night, it makes you feel relaxed - like you can breathe,” she says. While the refuge offers a safe haven from the outside world, it is not immune to the pandemic. Victoria says she is very relieved to have been given a place there. But repeated lockdowns have meant some families haven’t been able to move on, reducing space for others even as demand has soared by 150%. Messages to the UK's National Domestic Abuse Helplineincreased by 120% on one particular nightearly on in lockdown, and over the past month demand has steadily increased again, the charity Refuge, which runs the helpline, says. And when someone at Victoria’s refuge tested positive, the women were plunged back into isolation, which for many brought back traumatic memories of being trapped with their abuser. “Isolation was really hard to start with, because it took me back ‘there’, to where I wasn’t allowed to do this or do that,” Victoria says. “But after a few days it wasn’t so bad. I thought: ‘I’m surrounded by people who care about you, I can go in the garden. You know you’ll be free in a few weeks.’” While the refuge has given Victoria a haven, she hasn’t been able to have much interaction with the outside world. For her own security, the refuge told her to change her phone number and to keep her new address secret, although she could let friends and family know she was safe. So it was an unexpected surprise when, through a third party, she received a card from an old friend. The message on the front: ‘After the rain, comes the rainbow.’ Victoria is looking forward to starting a new life with her family back in society, free from fear. But the refuge has allowed them to feel normal again. “I didn’t know what we would come to, but everything that we needed was there already. And it just felt comfortable, nice. It feels like home now.” Many people fear the pandemic means Christmas will be different this year, but for Victoria that’s the best part. She’s taught some of the other women to crochet, and they are making Christmas decorations to send to their families. It may only be November, but she has bought all her presents, and her children already have Christmas trees in their rooms. “Christmas is going to be amazing - we can eat what we want, we can do what we want. I am so looking forward to it,” she says.

"The first ever Scottish winner of the Great British Bake Off has described his victory as an ""absolute dream"". Peter Sawkins, a finance student from Edinburgh, said he planned to continue his studies alongside his baking. The 20-year-old, nick-named the ""baby-faced assassin"" by host Noel Fielding, is also the youngest ever winner of the popular show. He said he watched Tuesday's final with his flatmates in Edinburgh, two of whom did not know he had won. Peter celebrated the broadcast by baking a chocolate cake, which he shared with his flatmates when they all sat down to watch the final episode. Bake Off final brings bumper ratings to C4 The Great British Bake Off crowns its 2020 winner He had to keep news of his triumph quiet since the show finished filming in August. Speaking to BBC radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, he said he had told his immediate family and some close friends, but kept everyone else guessing as he progressed through the rounds. He said: ""There is something very nice that I can finally stop keeping the secret and share it with friends and family. ""It's an absolute dream - I was really pleased with how I managed to step through all the challenges. ""I feel in a really privileged position because of course there will be some opportunities that arise from this, and it would be amazing to try and explore them, but at the same time I am going to keep on going with my degree, so I'm in a nice position."" Host Noel Fielding (left), judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith, and co-host Matt Lucas congratulate Peter (centre) Covid restrictions meant the show was filmed in a bubble. Before participating, everyone involved with the production - including contestants, judges, hosts, crew, staff, and cleaners - were required to self-isolate for nine days and take three Covid-19 tests. Upon arrival, they all quarantined at a hotel for 14 days before production began and stayed together in the bubble until filming ended six weeks later. Peter said this added to the intensity of the experience with the other bakers, but also added to the disappointment as each contestant left. He said: ""It was incredibly difficult, we got really close, really fast. ""We were eating together, baking together, in the tent together. ""Any time someone left it felt like a member of your family was being taking away and it didn't get any easier."" Peter won the show's star baker prize twice and impressed the judges throughout. Judge Prue Leith said it was theclosest final they had to judgeand the hardest decision to make. She said:  ""Do you know I am terribly proud of Peter and I feel as if he is my grandson. He is such a nice guy and he is so eager to learn, you can't not like him.""

Several artists sided with The Weeknd, including Sir Elton John, who wrote on Instagram: ""In my humble opinion, Blinding Lights [is] song of the year."" The musician, whose 1970 classic Your Song is sampled on After Hours, tagged his post #GrammySnub. ""Abel was robbed,""agreed rapper Kid Cudi,external, while R&B singer Tinashe simply responded to the nominations with aseries of dustbin emojis,external. BeyoncÃ© led the nominations at this year's Grammys - with nine in total. Dua Lipa, Taylor Swift and Roddy Ricch were close behind, with six each. But The Weeknd wasn't the only artist to complain about the longlist. Justin Bieber, whose album Changes picked up three nominations in the pop field, complained that he had been miscategorised. Changes was Bieber's first new album in five years ""Changes was and is an R&B album,""he wrote in a lengthy Instagram post,external. ""It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album, which is very strange to me. ""I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound. For this not to be put into that category feels weird, considering from the chords to the melodies to the vocal style, all the way down to the hip-hop drums that were chosen, it is undeniably, unmistakably an R&B album!"" Grammy Awards 2021: List of nominees First ever Grammy nomination for K-pop goes to BTS Grammy nominations are selected by experts in their respective genres - including singers, songwriters, producers and record label staff. A screening committee considers thousands of applications to produce a shortlist, which is whittled down further by a nominations board. This can result in some artists falling through the cracks. It is possible that The Weeknd's album was considered a pop record by the R&B committee and vice versa, locking him out of both categories. Although the musician was the highest-profile snub at this year's awards, plenty of other artists walked away empty-handed, including this year's Grammy host Alicia Keys, R&B musicians Summer Walker and Kehlani, and pop star Selena Gomez - whose ballad Lose You To Love Me was considered a likely contender for the song of the year category. Earlier this year, former Recording Academy president Deborah Duganclaimed the voting processwas ""a boys' club"" that was ""ripe with corruption"". The body announced several changes to its procedures after her accusations were made public. However, it is the treatment of black artists that has raised the most controversy in recent years. No rap album has won album of the year since Outkast's Speakerboxxx / The Love Below in 2004, despite hip-hop being the predominant genre in contemporary music. Addressing a pre-Grammys gala in January, Diddy challenged the Academy to change its practices. ""Black music has never been respected by the Grammys,"" said the rapper, who was receiving a lifetime achievement award. Adding that the lack of diversity was a problem across the entire entertainment industry, he added: ""For years we've allowed institutions that have never had our best interests at heart to judge us. And that stops right now."" A night later, after winning best rap album at the Grammys ceremony, Tyler, the Creator accused the awards of relegating ""guys that look like me"" to the rap and urban categories. ""I don't like that 'urban' word,"" he added, ""it's just a politically correct way to say the n-word to me."" In response, the Grammys changed the name of the best urban category to best progressive R&B. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles in England were inadequate for the Covid pandemic and price rises earlier this year cost taxpayers about Â£10bn, the spending watchdog has said. TheNational Audit Office said,externalthere had been a particular shortage of gloves and aprons. The government said the NAO's report recognised that NHS providers had been able to get what they needed in time. Almost Â£12.5bn was spent on 32bn items of PPE between February and July 2020. During the same period in 2019, 1.3bn items were bought at a cost of Â£28.9m. Each item had been ""substantially"" more expensive in 2020, because of very high global demand, the NAO said, from almost triple the cost for respirator masks to more than 14 times as much for body bags. Had the government been able to pay 2019 prices, it would have spent Â£2.5bn on PPE in 2020. In reality, it had spent Â£12.5bn, including hundreds of millions on ""unsuitable"" items that could not be used. Some had ""passed its expiry date or did not meet current safety standards"", the watchdog said, with ""insufficient checks"" meaning Public Health England had had to recall eye protectors that did not meet standards. In Parliament, on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""wasting"" taxpayer's money on equipment that ""can't be used"". But Mr Johnson replied ""99.5%"" of the 32 billion items of PPE bought between February and July 2020 ""conform entirely to our clinical needs"". Earlier, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said ""only 0.49% of all the purchased PPE tested to date"" had not been fit for purpose. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""As PPE stockpiles were inadequate for the pandemic, government needed to take urgent action to boost supplies. ""Once it recognised the gravity of the situation... the price of PPE increased dramatically, and that alone has cost the taxpayer around Â£10bn."" Unions worried care workers did not have proper protective equipment Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Before the Covid-19 pandemic, there were two emergency stockpiles of PPE: one as part of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Programme one built up in case of a no-deal Brexit But the NAO said: ""The EU exit stockpile held few items of PPE other than a large number of gloves."" Meanwhile, the flu stockpile, as well as having shortages of some key items, did not include any gowns or visors despite the fact they had been ""recommended for inclusion in June 2019 by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag)"". Public Health England told the NAO it had been analysing the market to work out which gowns to buy, when the pandemic had begun, which it said was the ""normal approach"" to find a lower price. In mid-March, the government had still believed its two stockpiles would provide ""most of the PPE needed to manage a Covid-19 pandemic"" and so focused on distributing this PPE rather than buying more, the NAO reported. The situation had become ""precarious"" in April and May, with stocks threatening to run out. At one point, only 3% of the required number of gowns had been available. But the nation did not at any point run out of any type of PPE. The scramble for PPE in the early stages of the pandemic was not confined to the UK. Every healthcare system was desperate to secure protective equipment and prices soared. But the National Audit Office lays bare how the UK was at the back of the queue, having failed to spot the warning signs and how woefully inadequate the stockpiles were. A failure to anticipate what might be needed for anything other than a flu pandemic in essence cost the taxpayer Â£10bn - the extra money needed to secure supplies such as gowns and visors during the Covid crisis. The report highlights poor distribution of PPE with many staff saying they did not have the right equipment. The NAO notes starkly that health and care employers have reported more than 100 deaths among staff because of exposure to coronavirus. An official inquiry, when it happens, will look hard at many aspects of the UK's preparedness and handling of the crisis and the PPE issue will be central. With a series of reports, the NAO has now done important groundwork but there is much still to find out. FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? A DHSC official said: ""As the NAO report recognises, during this unprecedented pandemic all the NHS providers audited 'were always able to get what they needed in time' thanks to the Herculean effort of government, NHS, armed forces, civil servants and industry"". But the NAO heard feedback from care workers, doctors and nurses that showed ""significant numbers of them considered that they were not adequately protected during the height of the first wave of the pandemic"". Employers have reported 126 deaths among health and care workers linked to exposure at work. And there were concerns about training and whether the equipment was appropriately fitted, particularly from women and people belonging to ethnic minorities. In a Royal College of Nursing survey of 5,000 NHS staff, 49% of respondents belonging to ethnic minorities said they had been adequately ""fit tested"" for a respirator, compared with 74% of white nurses. The DHSC said it was ""listening to the reported practical difficulties with the use of some PPE experienced by women and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals, among others, and... taking action to make sure user needs are adequately addressed in future provisions"". In a separate report, the Public Accounts Committee, a parliamentary body which works closely with the NAO, said it was ""concerned that the department had no plan before the pandemic for how it might increase critical care equipment in the event of an emergency"". ""This lack of preparedness was exacerbated by the fact that it did not know how many ventilators were available to the NHS to begin with,"" the PAC said. But it added the government had managed to buy an additional 26,000 ventilators for use in the NHS, a ""significant achievement"".

"""It's going to look horrible."" The simple truth about the Spending Review according to a senior MP. The chancellor will bang the drum for his plans to keep people in jobs, or help find new ones. Rishi Sunak will take out the metaphorical megaphone to explain how he'll allocate billions of taxpayers' cash to spend on infrastructure in the coming months. But the headlines of the Spending Review, when governments put their money where their mouths are, won't be in any rhetorical flourishes at the despatch box, nor likely in any surprise announcements kept back as goodies for the public. What may shock, is the cold reality of the cost of the coronavirus, which will be laid bare in the tables and charts published at the same time, presenting to the country in the shape of statistics from the Office for Budget Responsibility how much damage the pandemic has really done to how we make a living. Rishi Sunak's plans: Four things to look out for How will the Spending Review affect you? Without poring over the spreadsheets, the ""horrible"" will mean a massive gap between what the government takes in tax and what is has been spending, a deficit more than ten times what it was last year. There will be an estimate of the number of people who may end up unemployed, perhaps nearing three million before too long. It's likely to mean a freeze on pay for much of the public sector; a cut, even if temporary to the amount of cash the UK spends on foreign aid; tight spending limits for government departments on their day-to-day spending and eye-watering levels of debt and borrowing. One former Treasury minister, who is not prone to hyperbole (unusually for a politician you might wonder) described it as a ""multigenerational debt which will have implications for the rest of our lives in terms of what the British state can afford"". We will on Wednesday, they suggest, ""learn a great deal about the problem"", what months of emergency spending has done to the economy. But before we go on, don't hold your breath to learn much about any solutions. Rishi Sunak will set out the state of the country's finances in a statement to Parliament The chancellor and prime minister have decided politically that while budgets will be tight (and let's see the black and white to assess this for real) there can't be a return to the kind of squeeze of the Cameron and Osborne era. No one in government would pretend in private there is any way to avoid tax rises at some point. But Mr Sunak is not going to announce any of that on Wednesday - any big ways of raising money to fill the hole won't come until the Budget next year at the earliest, and perhaps not until after that. But Wednesday's review will sketch out the very, very serious challenge for the country's finances that is on the way. Most importantly of course that will be reflected in the number of people who might lose their jobs with all the distress that entails, all the business that could be lost, and the impact on people's pay packets. But it also sets the backdrop for the decisions that our politicians have to make, and will be confronted with for many, many years to come. It's notable that while there have been some skirmishes around the edges in the last nine months, there has been very little tension over the government and the Bank of England's central actions to write enormous cheques, and keep the signatures coming as the pandemic has progressed. And it's far from over. But as time goes on the exit from the emergency leaves the government with extremely difficult political decisions. Pubs have been forced to close due to coronavirus restrictions There is no appetite to break any of the prime minister's expensive manifesto promises. New Tory MPs, particularly in new Tory seats are chomping at the bit for evidence to show to their constituents they made the right decision. One former minister said, ""our voters want something tangible they can see at the end of their street,"" and they want it fast. But the chancellor also, according to his allies, says ""we have to be the party of looking after people's money -  he says, if we lose that, why don't you just vote Labour?"" The argument works the other way too, to an extent. If the Tories are racking up levels of public spending that are previously unimaginable, the traditional gap in economic vision doesn't leave Labour with that much space. How and when will either of the main parties try to confront what has really gone on as the cost of trying to deal with the pandemic has gone up and up and up? Some ministers worry even many MPs haven't yet understood the real consequences for how we make a living - the damage the decisions made to protect the country during the emergency of the pandemic have had on the economy. But Wednesday will be the first time, eight months in, when we will be confronted with the size of the likely bill. The argument about who and how to pay will dominate for many years to come.

"This video can not be played What you need to know about Chancellor Rishi Sunak's speech â in two minutes The ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid-19 has only just begun, according to chancellor Rishi Sunak, as he warned the pandemic would deal lasting damage to growth and jobs. Official forecasts now predict the biggest economic decline in 300 years. The UK economy is expected to shrink by 11.3% this year and not return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022. Government borrowing will rise to its highest outside of wartime to deal with the economic impact. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects the number of unemployed people to surge to 2.6 million by the middle of next year. It meansthe unemployment rate will hit 7.5%, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2009. However, fewer jobs are expected to be lost than predicted this summer. Setting out his Spending Review detailing how much would be spent on public services, Mr Sunak said the government was dealing with an ""economic emergency"". He added: ""That's why we have taken, and continue to take, extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes."" The government hassubsidised the wagesof employees unable to work due to the pandemic, in an effort to protect jobs. It saidextending these schemes to next Marchmeant 300,000 fewer people would be out of work. Mr Sunakconfirmed that around 1.3 million public sector workers - excluding some NHS staff and those earning less than Â£24,000- will have their pay frozen next year. The chancellor said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis. But Mr Sunak said lower-paid public sector workers would be guaranteed at least a Â£250 pay rise next year. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, criticised the pay freeze. She said: ""Earlier this year the chancellor stood on his doorstep and clapped for key workers. Today, his government institutes a pay freeze for many of them. This takes a sledgehammer to consumer confidence."" Civil servant Robert said he was 'deeply disappointed' Robert, a 25-year-old civil servant and representative for the PCS Union, saidhe was ""deeply disappointed"". ""[Civil servants] have spearheaded the response to the pandemic and worked tirelessly to deliver Brexit. We've stepped up and delivered... and I'd like to be recognised for that."" Having worked for various government departments since graduating from university a few years ago, he says he feels ""let down"". Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance How will the Spending Review affect you? The UK economy remains in rescue mode The minimum wage - which has been rebranded as the National Living Wage - will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to Â£8.91 an hour, with the rate extended to those aged 23 and over. Other rates were also increased. From next April, 16 and 17 year-olds will see their pay go up to Â£4.62 per hour, from Â£4.55 today. TheUK also ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national incomeon overseas aid to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home. Mr Sunak said the new 0.5% target - which adds up to about Â£4bn in savings - will be ""temporary"". Andmillions of retirees will see the future value of their pension cutowing to a planned change in the way payments are calculated from 2030. Mr Sunak said the government had already spent Â£280bn to help support the economy through the coronavirus. It will spend a further Â£55bn next year as part of a package of measures to support the recovery. This includes billions of pounds to help people find jobs. The UK is expected to borrow Â£393.5bn this financial year to help pay for economic relief measures. Borrowing is also forecast by the OBR to remain above Â£100bn-a-year - or 4% of the size of the UK economy - in five years time. In recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable. At the moment it pays just 0.32% interest to borrow for ten years. However, Mr Sunak said long-term scarring meant the economy would be 3% smaller in 2025 than expected in the March budget. What is GDP? Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Sunak cuts UK overseas aid budget Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million The OBR said the coronavirus pandemic had ""delivered the largest peacetime shock to the global economy on record"", while recent restrictions across the UK had taken ""the wind out of an already flagging recovery"". It said the UK's later and longer lockdown this spring meant it had experienced ""a deeper fall and slower recovery in economic activity"" than some of its European neighbours. The independent forecaster also warned that tax rises or spending cuts would be needed in future years to stabilise the UK's growing debt pile. Richard Hughes, the OBR's chairman said: ""The chancellor will need to find Â£20bn to Â£30bn in spending cuts or tax rises if he wants to balance revenues and day-to-day spending, and stop debt rising by the end of this parliament."" Is that the end of it? The official forecasts assume that 2 December spells the end of lockdown, that we remain in the equivalent of Tier 3 restrictions until the spring - and then the vaccine becomes widely adopted in the second half of 2021. Too cautious - or optimistic? If anything, 2020 has taught us that assumptions can last as long as a disposable face covering. But it'll take longer for economic life to spring back to rude health. Reviving job prospects, investment and consumption will take TLC. Even when the official crystal ball gets misty, in 2025, output is still 3% lower than it was previously expected to be. And that's without the  risk of a no-deal; the OBR says that could mean that output is a further 1.5% by 2025. Some economists think the hit could be greater (indeed, the Governor of the Bank of England says the long term impact of a no- deal could exceed that of a virus). Rishi Sunak has to decide when to turn off the support to the convalescing economy - and when to  start  patching up the public finances by firing up tax rises. The extreme uncertainty underlines how fraught - and costly - that decision could be. House prices are expected to fall in 2021 and 2022. The OBR expects a recent revival in the market to end next year when astamp duty holidaystops in March and more people lose their jobs as government support schemes are pared back. However, the end of the tax break is expected to contribute to a 3.5% fall in house prices next year and a further 2.6% drop in 2022. The OBR added: ""Despite a steady recovery from 2022 onwards, the level of house prices remains around 17% lower (in 2025) compared to our March forecast."" The OBR said the ""unresolved nature"" of the negotiations between the UK and EU over a Brexit deal had ""further clouded"" the economic outlook. It said failure to secure a deal would reduce the size of the UK economy by a further 2% in 2021, with permanent damage to growth and living standards in future years. Under this no-deal scenario, the economy would not return to the size it was before the pandemic hit until the second half of 2023, while unemployment would peak at a higher rate of 8.3%.

Today's live updates were the work of Penny Spiller, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Katie Wright, John Hand, Hugo Bachega and Marie Jackson. Thanks for joining us. We'll be back on Thursday with all the very latest. It's been a big day of news and we're almost done for the day. Before we go though, here's what the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said about coronavirus in his Spending Review:  And, in other coronavirus news: The government has recorded another 696 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, an increase of 88 on yesterdayâs daily figure. It is the highest daily figure reported since 5 May. The government also recorded a further 18,213 cases of the virus, up 6,914 on Tuesdayâs daily figure. While Americans prepare for their Thanksgiving holiday, cases, hospital admissions and virus deaths tick up across the country. As of Wednesday afternoon, the US has recorded more than 12.6 million infections and more than 260,000 deaths. Here's what else you need you know: Boris Epshteyn (R) is pictured with Rudy Giuliani at a press conference last week. Another member of President Donald Trump's legal team, Boris Epshteyn, has tested positive for coronavirus. ""I am experiencing mild symptoms and am following all appropriate protocols, including quarantining and contact tracing,"" Epshteyn wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Epshteyn was seen at a press conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters last week with White House aide Andrew Giuliani, son of Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Andrew announced last week he had tested positive. Epshteyn has also spent time with the elder Giuliani, who is now leading efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Dozens of people close to President Donald Trump - including First Lady Melania Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie - have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. The president himself tested positive in October.  Two weeks ago Scarborough had the second highest infection rate in England Coronavirus cases in one of England's worst affected areas have more than halved in two weeks. On 11 November, Scarborough's infection rate stood at 611 - the second highest in England.It has now fallen to 296 per 100,000. Cases across North Yorkshire have also declined with the average for the county now 196 cases, lower than the national average of 207. One of the county's health officials, Richard Webb, told a briefing that falling infection rates had given the region some optimism that it could escape the tightest controls set to be announced by the government on Thursday. North Yorkshire was one of the few parts of northern England to remain in tier one - the lowest tier of restrictions - prior to the national lockdown which began on 5 November. England will move to a tougher version of tiered coronavirus restrictions when the lockdown ends on 2 December.Here's a reminder of the new rules. Taxis blocked key roads in Madrid US President-elect Joe Biden will deliver remarks from Wilmington, Delaware, later ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Democrat is expected to discuss the shared sacrifices of Americans during the approaching holiday season, as coronavirus outbreaks surge across the country. On Monday, Donald Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process to begin, nearly three weeks after the presidential election. Biden had previously warned that a lack of co-ordination - particularly on coronavirus policy - meant that ""people may die"". But so far, the Trump White House has been ""sincere"" in its transition to the new administration, Biden said on Tuesday. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says that being active is ""central to health"" but many people have reduced their levels of exercise during the pandemic. He said some people had done more exercise during the crisis but for many, coronavirus has made it harder. Speaking at a summit for ukactive, which represents many in the fitness industry, he said: ""It is very important that we get people who have got out of the habit of regular exercise back in the situation where they are doing so, and encourage others who have taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn't, to continue to do so. ""We need to think this through because exercise is so central. Exercise is the single simplest and most important thing people can do to improve their physical and mental health."" Restrictions in healthcare settings during the pandemic have added to the ""trauma and distress"" already endured by many women who have miscarried, a charity boss has said. Clea Harmer, of stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said coronavirus rules have meant women have had to go to hospital and grieve for their unborn babies alone. ""Attending scans and appointments can be really difficult, especially if you have had a miscarriage before, or your baby has died before, and often the scan is the place where you were told your baby has died,"" she said. ""To be in that position on your own, without your partner there... there are heartbreaking stories of mothers being told on their own and having to go out to the car park or back home and tell their partner themselves."" She added that although the NHS has issued guidance for hospitals to allow women to bring their partners to appointments, the picture is ""very mixed across the country"". Her comments come afterthe Duchess of Sussex revealed she had a miscarriagein July, writing in a New York Times article of feeling ""an almost unbearable grief"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Wuhan's Huanan Seafood market was one of the first places to close as virus cases began to emerge in January China's officialCGTN broadcaster says China has given assurances to the World Health Organization,external(WHO) that the body will be able to send a team to investigate the origins of the coronavirus ""as soon as possible"". Many experts think Covid-19 likely originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has been linked to early confirmed cases. While not a wet market in the strictest sense, reports suggest the market was selling wildlife, including snakes, porcupine and deer. After an initial cluster of cases connected to the market, the virus began spreading dramatically inside China, before reaching much of the world.The origins of the novel virus are unknown, but it most likely emerged in a bat, then made the leap to humans via another wild animal host. But Chinese media have increasingly beenamplifying suggestions that the virus might have been in other countries,externalbefore reaching
China. The country has sought to deflect blame for the outbreak from
countries like the US, and has often shared a message that the WHO views
China as taking an ""active response"" in handling Covid-19. The boss of NHS Wales has said doctors aren't seeing as many cases of flu this year, as a result of record levels of flu vaccination, people wearing masks and social distancing measures. There had been worries the annual flu season would add pressure to the NHS as it struggles with coronavirus, but Dr Andrew Goodall said the impact is ""very negligible"". He said levels of flu in Wales were similar to the low rates seen in the southern hemisphere earlier this year. Walesannounced its largest ever flu campaign in the summer, with free jabs offered to those who were shielding and the over-50s. However, last month the Welsh government said the over-50s ""will be vaccinated in a phased approach starting later this year""amid supply concerns. In England,30 million people are being offered a flu jabin the country's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date, with those over 50 eligible from 1 December. In Scotland, health workers, those with medical conditions, social care workers, families of shielders and over 55sare being offered the flu jab this year- though the roll-out has been called ""poorly managed"". Last week, Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swanndenied there was a shortage in the number of flu vaccinesordered. Cosy rooms packed with people, chatting, laughing, even singing, and sharing food and drink for hours are the norm for the festive season. But unfortunately, almost everything that's great for lifting our spirits at Christmas is also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. Here are a couple of things to think about when you're planning get-togethers. Are you sharing food and drink? Covid-19 can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated, which means you could be handing round the virus as well as the sprouts. In the US,the official advice for this year's Thanksgiving dinners,externalis to break totally with tradition by asking guests to bring their own food and drinks. It's also recommended that you control who's allowed in the kitchen, with one lucky person doing all the serving. Are the windows open? The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A report by government scientific advisers says,externalinfection risks can be increased by four times without proper ventilation. And if people feel too cold? Wear another layer. Read our full list of tips for reducing the risk here. Coronavirus-related crime is a global trend, clearly, as a man who tried to take money whileposing as a Covid-19 contact tracer in England has been jailed. Martin Payne visited houses in Stafford in September wearing a high-visibility bib and claimed to be collecting money for the NHS, Staffordshire Police said. The force said that, when challenged about identification, he walked away. Contact tracers notify, interview, and advise those who have been in contact with people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Payne, 30, has been jailed for six weeks, and also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£128. Two Texas men have been charged with attempting to sell 50 million non-existent medical face masks to a foreign government, according to the US Justice Department. Paschal Ngozi Eleanya, 46, and Arael Doolittle, 55, defrauded an unnamed foreign government out of more than $317m (Â£237m) - the total purchase price of the masks - according to the indictment. With their brokers, the pair allegedly negotiated a sales price for the masks that was five times the public list price of the masks, set by the manufacturers. The two expected to personally receive up to $275m as a result of the scheme, according to the charges. Authorities disrupted the sale before it could be completed but the foreign government had already wired the funds, court documents said. If convicted, Doolittle and Eleanya could face up to 25 years behind bars, and a maximum $250,000 (Â£187,000) fine. In the US ,the pandemic is going to keep many families apart this Thanksgiving, but Texas grandparents Missy and Barry Buchanan have come up with an ingenious way to stay connected with their family.

Ross County are one of the few SPFL clubs permitted to have up to 300 fans in attendance The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is calling for an emergency  meeting with Nicola Sturgeon to discuss a return of fans to Scottish football. The league body, which represents the top four leagues in Scottish football, wants the first minister to follow the UK government, which has outlined plansto allow up to 4,000 spectators into grounds in areas in England where coronavirus levels are low. As it stands, the number allowed in Scotland is 300 - and that is only for clubs in tier one. The SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster says if that continues, it will sound ""the death knell"" for some clubs in Scotland. He added: ""We are now calling on the first minister to do the right thing by Scotland's
hard-pressed football supporters. If it's good enough for English fans, it must
be good enough for Scottish fans."" However, Sturgeon has responded, sayingfootball cannot be treated ""in isolation"". It's been a busy day. If you're just catching up, these are the main UK headlines: The US recorded nearly 2,100 virus deaths on Tuesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project - the highest single-day total since May. As cases and hospital admissions surge across the country, experts have warned that deaths will follow. The daily caseload has not dipped below 100,000 in three weeks, and the US on Tuesday hit a record high in hospital admissions for the 15th consecutive day. The concerning upward trend is expected to worsen in coming days with the US Thanksgiving holiday, which typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. And while fewer Americans are travelling this year, the holiday typically calls for congregating and eating indoors with large groups - risky activities for Covid spread. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played What you need to know about Chancellor Rishi Sunak's speech â in two minutes The ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid-19 has only just begun, according to chancellor Rishi Sunak, as he warned the pandemic would deal lasting damage to growth and jobs. Official forecasts now predict the biggest economic decline in 300 years. The UK economy is expected to shrink by 11.3% this year and not return to its pre-crisis size until the end of 2022. Government borrowing will rise to its highest outside of wartime to deal with the economic impact. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) expects the number of unemployed people to surge to 2.6 million by the middle of next year. It meansthe unemployment rate will hit 7.5%, its highest level since the financial crisis in 2009. However, fewer jobs are expected to be lost than predicted this summer. Setting out his Spending Review detailing how much would be spent on public services, Mr Sunak said the government was dealing with an ""economic emergency"". He added: ""That's why we have taken, and continue to take, extraordinary measures to protect people's jobs and incomes."" The government hassubsidised the wagesof employees unable to work due to the pandemic, in an effort to protect jobs. It saidextending these schemes to next Marchmeant 300,000 fewer people would be out of work. Mr Sunakconfirmed that around 1.3 million public sector workers - excluding some NHS staff and those earning less than Â£24,000- will have their pay frozen next year. The chancellor said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis. But Mr Sunak said lower-paid public sector workers would be guaranteed at least a Â£250 pay rise next year. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, criticised the pay freeze. She said: ""Earlier this year the chancellor stood on his doorstep and clapped for key workers. Today, his government institutes a pay freeze for many of them. This takes a sledgehammer to consumer confidence."" Civil servant Robert said he was 'deeply disappointed' Robert, a 25-year-old civil servant and representative for the PCS Union, saidhe was ""deeply disappointed"". ""[Civil servants] have spearheaded the response to the pandemic and worked tirelessly to deliver Brexit. We've stepped up and delivered... and I'd like to be recognised for that."" Having worked for various government departments since graduating from university a few years ago, he says he feels ""let down"". Spending Review: Key points at-a-glance How will the Spending Review affect you? The UK economy remains in rescue mode The minimum wage - which has been rebranded as the National Living Wage - will increase by 2.2% - or 19p - to Â£8.91 an hour, with the rate extended to those aged 23 and over. Other rates were also increased. From next April, 16 and 17 year-olds will see their pay go up to Â£4.62 per hour, from Â£4.55 today. TheUK also ditched its policy of spending 0.7% of national incomeon overseas aid to help deal with the coronavirus crisis at home. Mr Sunak said the new 0.5% target - which adds up to about Â£4bn in savings - will be ""temporary"". Andmillions of retirees will see the future value of their pension cutowing to a planned change in the way payments are calculated from 2030. Mr Sunak said the government had already spent Â£280bn to help support the economy through the coronavirus. It will spend a further Â£55bn next year as part of a package of measures to support the recovery. This includes billions of pounds to help people find jobs. The UK is expected to borrow Â£393.5bn this financial year to help pay for economic relief measures. Borrowing is also forecast by the OBR to remain above Â£100bn-a-year - or 4% of the size of the UK economy - in five years time. In recent years, the government has been able to borrow easily at very low interest rates, which makes its debt more affordable. At the moment it pays just 0.32% interest to borrow for ten years. However, Mr Sunak said long-term scarring meant the economy would be 3% smaller in 2025 than expected in the March budget. What is GDP? Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise Sunak cuts UK overseas aid budget Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million The OBR said the coronavirus pandemic had ""delivered the largest peacetime shock to the global economy on record"", while recent restrictions across the UK had taken ""the wind out of an already flagging recovery"". It said the UK's later and longer lockdown this spring meant it had experienced ""a deeper fall and slower recovery in economic activity"" than some of its European neighbours. The independent forecaster also warned that tax rises or spending cuts would be needed in future years to stabilise the UK's growing debt pile. Richard Hughes, the OBR's chairman said: ""The chancellor will need to find Â£20bn to Â£30bn in spending cuts or tax rises if he wants to balance revenues and day-to-day spending, and stop debt rising by the end of this parliament."" Is that the end of it? The official forecasts assume that 2 December spells the end of lockdown, that we remain in the equivalent of Tier 3 restrictions until the spring - and then the vaccine becomes widely adopted in the second half of 2021. Too cautious - or optimistic? If anything, 2020 has taught us that assumptions can last as long as a disposable face covering. But it'll take longer for economic life to spring back to rude health. Reviving job prospects, investment and consumption will take TLC. Even when the official crystal ball gets misty, in 2025, output is still 3% lower than it was previously expected to be. And that's without the  risk of a no-deal; the OBR says that could mean that output is a further 1.5% by 2025. Some economists think the hit could be greater (indeed, the Governor of the Bank of England says the long term impact of a no- deal could exceed that of a virus). Rishi Sunak has to decide when to turn off the support to the convalescing economy - and when to  start  patching up the public finances by firing up tax rises. The extreme uncertainty underlines how fraught - and costly - that decision could be. House prices are expected to fall in 2021 and 2022. The OBR expects a recent revival in the market to end next year when astamp duty holidaystops in March and more people lose their jobs as government support schemes are pared back. However, the end of the tax break is expected to contribute to a 3.5% fall in house prices next year and a further 2.6% drop in 2022. The OBR added: ""Despite a steady recovery from 2022 onwards, the level of house prices remains around 17% lower (in 2025) compared to our March forecast."" The OBR said the ""unresolved nature"" of the negotiations between the UK and EU over a Brexit deal had ""further clouded"" the economic outlook. It said failure to secure a deal would reduce the size of the UK economy by a further 2% in 2021, with permanent damage to growth and living standards in future years. Under this no-deal scenario, the economy would not return to the size it was before the pandemic hit until the second half of 2023, while unemployment would peak at a higher rate of 8.3%.

"People have been urged to be cautious of the risk of spreading coronavirus when rules are relaxed over Christmas. Up to three households will be allowed to stay together and form a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, as agreed by all four UK nations. A scientific adviser to the government said the relaxation of rules amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". Meanwhile, it is expected most areas of England will be placed in the middle tier of atoughened three-tier system. Details on what will happen when the current lockdown ends on 2 December will be announced on Thursday. The decision will be based on a number of factors including case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and pressure on local NHS services. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says a ""handful"" of areas will be in the lightest regime of limits - tier one - but most of the country is likely to be in either tier two or three. She said London is expected to be placed in tier two. The measures for Christmas will see travel restrictions across the four nations, and between tiers and levels, lifted to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK. Anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland may travel on the 22 and 28 December, but otherwise travel to and from bubbles should be done between the 23 and 27. People will not be able to get together with others from more than two other households, and once a bubble is formed, it must not be changed or be extended further. The guidance says a bubble of three households would be able to stay overnight at each other's home but would not be able to visit hospitality, theatres or retail settings. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Christmas rules 'not an instruction to meet up' Three households can mix over Christmas in UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told people to use ""personal judgement"" on whether to visit elderly relatives. In a video message from Downing Street,,externalthe prime minister described the agreement as a ""special, time-limited dispensation"", saying: ""This year means Christmas will be different."" Mr Johnson said people must consider the risks of who to form a bubble with and whether or not to visit elderly or vulnerable relatives, adding: ""Many of us are longing to spend time with family and friends... And yet we can't afford to throw caution to the wind."" He added: ""'Tis the season to be jolly but 'tis also the season to be jolly careful.""

It comes as the government recorded another 18,213 Covid cases in the UK. Figures also showed a further 696 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths is the highest since the start of May and compares to 608 recorded on Wednesday. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says many of those who have died are likely to have picked up an infection before the current lockdown measures were put in place. He said a rise in the death toll would not be expected to continue into December because the average number of daily cases is now falling and hospital admissions are levelling off. A mid-week rise can also be down to delays in deaths being reported over the weekend. First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said the ministers agreed they had to ease the rules because people would have flouted restrictions - creating further risk - if they were told Christmas had been ""cancelled"". Ministers were shown behavioural science evidence that ""too many people simply would not have been prepared to have gone along with such an instruction"", he told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. Mr Drakeford also saida UK-wide approach to coronavirus rulesafter Christmas was needed. Nicola Sturgeon has said guidance for people in Scotland is still being finalised and will be issued on Thursday, but that her government will not be ""encouraging"" people to meet up. ""The expectation should be that the guidance will probably look to tighten around the edges rather than further expand and that will be true with the travel window of opportunity as well - we want to limit that window, not expand it,"" the first minister said. Published guidance for England,externalgives further details of the rules for 23 to 27 December: You can form a different Christmas bubble from the people you live with normally - so you can choose to stay with different people for the five-day period You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line withthe rules for the tier in which you are staying,external Children under the age of 18 whose parents do not live together may be part of both parents' Christmas bubbles Existing support bubbles count as one household towards the three household limit Students are considered to be part of the household to which they have returned Prof Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, and a member of the government's Sage committee, told BBC Newsnight allowing families to meet up over Christmas amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". He said it would ""definitely lead to increase[d] transmission and likely lead to third wave of infections with hospitals being overrun, and more unnecessary deaths."" Prof Hayward said while you cannot ban Christmas, he called for clearer messaging to families about the ""dangers"" of socialising and inter-generational mixing. This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Gavin Terry, head of policy at the Alzheimer's Society, said thousands of relatives would be in ""complete despair"" at government guidance which says only care home residents of working age should be allowed to leave their care homes to visit family, due to the increased risk of exposure to the virus. ""After eight harrowing months filled with devastation and tragic loss of life, the announcement that many care home residents will be facing Christmas alone is just heartbreaking,"" he said, calling for further testing to allow for more visits. Meanwhile, Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, called on ministers to publish evidence for its Christmas bubble rules, which would ""inflict unnecessary pain and irreversible damage on our sector"". Local rules mean many pubs and restaurants - such as those in England's tier three or Scotland's level four - will remain closed during the festive period, irrespective of the Christmas change.

"Millions of Americans are travelling home to celebrate Thanksgiving, despite warnings from health officials amid a surge of Covid-19 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has told Americans to stay at home and celebrate only with those they live with Hard-hit regions have reimposed restrictions with El Paso, Texas announcing a night-time curfew People across the UK are being urged to think carefully before they take advantage of the relaxation of restrictions on Christmas Government adviser Prof Andrew Hayward says family gatherings are a ""recipe for regret"" for people UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the UK's ""economic emergency"" has ""only just begun"" as he sets out spending plan The number of unemployed people in the UK is expected to surge to 2.6 million by mid 2021 Nearly 60 million cases have been confirmed globally with around 1.4 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hugo Bachega and Marie Jackson That's all for now. Today's live updates were the work of Penny Spiller, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Katie Wright, John Hand, Hugo Bachega and Marie Jackson. Thanks for joining us. We'll be back on Thursday with all the very latest. It's been a big day of news and we're almost done for the day. Before we go though, here's what the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said about coronavirus in his Spending Review:  And, in other coronavirus news: The government has recorded another 696 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, an increase of 88 on yesterdayâs daily figure. It is the highest daily figure reported since 5 May. The government also recorded a further 18,213 cases of the virus, up 6,914 on Tuesdayâs daily figure. While Americans prepare for their Thanksgiving holiday, cases, hospital admissions and virus deaths tick up across the country. As of Wednesday afternoon, the US has recorded more than 12.6 million infections and more than 260,000 deaths. Here's what else you need you know: Boris Epshteyn (R) is pictured with Rudy Giuliani at a press conference last week. Another member of President Donald Trump's legal team, Boris Epshteyn, has tested positive for coronavirus. ""I am experiencing mild symptoms and am following all appropriate protocols, including quarantining and contact tracing,"" Epshteyn wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Epshteyn was seen at a press conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters last week with White House aide Andrew Giuliani, son of Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Andrew announced last week he had tested positive. Epshteyn has also spent time with the elder Giuliani, who is now leading efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Dozens of people close to President Donald Trump - including First Lady Melania Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie - have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. The president himself tested positive in October.  Two weeks ago Scarborough had the second highest infection rate in England Coronavirus cases in one of England's worst affected areas have more than halved in two weeks. On 11 November, Scarborough's infection rate stood at 611 - the second highest in England.It has now fallen to 296 per 100,000. Cases across North Yorkshire have also declined with the average for the county now 196 cases, lower than the national average of 207. One of the county's health officials, Richard Webb, told a briefing that falling infection rates had given the region some optimism that it could escape the tightest controls set to be announced by the government on Thursday. North Yorkshire was one of the few parts of northern England to remain in tier one - the lowest tier of restrictions - prior to the national lockdown which began on 5 November. England will move to a tougher version of tiered coronavirus restrictions when the lockdown ends on 2 December.Here's a reminder of the new rules. Taxis blocked key roads in Madrid US President-elect Joe Biden will deliver remarks from Wilmington, Delaware, later ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Democrat is expected to discuss the shared sacrifices of Americans during the approaching holiday season, as coronavirus outbreaks surge across the country. On Monday, Donald Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process to begin, nearly three weeks after the presidential election. Biden had previously warned that a lack of co-ordination - particularly on coronavirus policy - meant that ""people may die"". But so far, the Trump White House has been ""sincere"" in its transition to the new administration, Biden said on Tuesday. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says that being active is ""central to health"" but many people have reduced their levels of exercise during the pandemic. He said some people had done more exercise during the crisis but for many, coronavirus has made it harder. Speaking at a summit for ukactive, which represents many in the fitness industry, he said: ""It is very important that we get people who have got out of the habit of regular exercise back in the situation where they are doing so, and encourage others who have taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn't, to continue to do so. ""We need to think this through because exercise is so central. Exercise is the single simplest and most important thing people can do to improve their physical and mental health."" Restrictions in healthcare settings during the pandemic have added to the ""trauma and distress"" already endured by many women who have miscarried, a charity boss has said. Clea Harmer, of stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said coronavirus rules have meant women have had to go to hospital and grieve for their unborn babies alone. ""Attending scans and appointments can be really difficult, especially if you have had a miscarriage before, or your baby has died before, and often the scan is the place where you were told your baby has died,"" she said. ""To be in that position on your own, without your partner there... there are heartbreaking stories of mothers being told on their own and having to go out to the car park or back home and tell their partner themselves."" She added that although the NHS has issued guidance for hospitals to allow women to bring their partners to appointments, the picture is ""very mixed across the country"". Her comments come afterthe Duchess of Sussex revealed she had a miscarriagein July, writing in a New York Times article of feeling ""an almost unbearable grief"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Wuhan's Huanan Seafood market was one of the first places to close as virus cases began to emerge in January China's officialCGTN broadcaster says China has given assurances to the World Health Organization,external(WHO) that the body will be able to send a team to investigate the origins of the coronavirus ""as soon as possible"". Many experts think Covid-19 likely originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has been linked to early confirmed cases. While not a wet market in the strictest sense, reports suggest the market was selling wildlife, including snakes, porcupine and deer. After an initial cluster of cases connected to the market, the virus began spreading dramatically inside China, before reaching much of the world.The origins of the novel virus are unknown, but it most likely emerged in a bat, then made the leap to humans via another wild animal host. But Chinese media have increasingly beenamplifying suggestions that the virus might have been in other countries,externalbefore reaching
China. The country has sought to deflect blame for the outbreak from
countries like the US, and has often shared a message that the WHO views
China as taking an ""active response"" in handling Covid-19. The boss of NHS Wales has said doctors aren't seeing as many cases of flu this year, as a result of record levels of flu vaccination, people wearing masks and social distancing measures. There had been worries the annual flu season would add pressure to the NHS as it struggles with coronavirus, but Dr Andrew Goodall said the impact is ""very negligible"". He said levels of flu in Wales were similar to the low rates seen in the southern hemisphere earlier this year. Walesannounced its largest ever flu campaign in the summer, with free jabs offered to those who were shielding and the over-50s. However, last month the Welsh government said the over-50s ""will be vaccinated in a phased approach starting later this year""amid supply concerns. In England,30 million people are being offered a flu jabin the country's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date, with those over 50 eligible from 1 December. In Scotland, health workers, those with medical conditions, social care workers, families of shielders and over 55sare being offered the flu jab this year- though the roll-out has been called ""poorly managed"". Last week, Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swanndenied there was a shortage in the number of flu vaccinesordered. Cosy rooms packed with people, chatting, laughing, even singing, and sharing food and drink for hours are the norm for the festive season. But unfortunately, almost everything that's great for lifting our spirits at Christmas is also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. Here are a couple of things to think about when you're planning get-togethers. Are you sharing food and drink? Covid-19 can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated, which means you could be handing round the virus as well as the sprouts. In the US,the official advice for this year's Thanksgiving dinners,externalis to break totally with tradition by asking guests to bring their own food and drinks. It's also recommended that you control who's allowed in the kitchen, with one lucky person doing all the serving. Are the windows open? The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A report by government scientific advisers says,externalinfection risks can be increased by four times without proper ventilation. And if people feel too cold? Wear another layer. Read our full list of tips for reducing the risk here. Coronavirus-related crime is a global trend, clearly, as a man who tried to take money whileposing as a Covid-19 contact tracer in England has been jailed. Martin Payne visited houses in Stafford in September wearing a high-visibility bib and claimed to be collecting money for the NHS, Staffordshire Police said. The force said that, when challenged about identification, he walked away. Contact tracers notify, interview, and advise those who have been in contact with people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Payne, 30, has been jailed for six weeks, and also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£128. Two Texas men have been charged with attempting to sell 50 million non-existent medical face masks to a foreign government, according to the US Justice Department. Paschal Ngozi Eleanya, 46, and Arael Doolittle, 55, defrauded an unnamed foreign government out of more than $317m (Â£237m) - the total purchase price of the masks - according to the indictment. With their brokers, the pair allegedly negotiated a sales price for the masks that was five times the public list price of the masks, set by the manufacturers. The two expected to personally receive up to $275m as a result of the scheme, according to the charges. Authorities disrupted the sale before it could be completed but the foreign government had already wired the funds, court documents said. If convicted, Doolittle and Eleanya could face up to 25 years behind bars, and a maximum $250,000 (Â£187,000) fine. In the US ,the pandemic is going to keep many families apart this Thanksgiving, but Texas grandparents Missy and Barry Buchanan have come up with an ingenious way to stay connected with their family.

Ross County are one of the few SPFL clubs permitted to have up to 300 fans in attendance The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is calling for an emergency  meeting with Nicola Sturgeon to discuss a return of fans to Scottish football. The league body, which represents the top four leagues in Scottish football, wants the first minister to follow the UK government, which has outlined plansto allow up to 4,000 spectators into grounds in areas in England where coronavirus levels are low. As it stands, the number allowed in Scotland is 300 - and that is only for clubs in tier one. The SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster says if that continues, it will sound ""the death knell"" for some clubs in Scotland. He added: ""We are now calling on the first minister to do the right thing by Scotland's
hard-pressed football supporters. If it's good enough for English fans, it must
be good enough for Scottish fans."" However, Sturgeon has responded, sayingfootball cannot be treated ""in isolation"". It's been a busy day. If you're just catching up, these are the main UK headlines: The US recorded nearly 2,100 virus deaths on Tuesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project - the highest single-day total since May. As cases and hospital admissions surge across the country, experts have warned that deaths will follow. The daily caseload has not dipped below 100,000 in three weeks, and the US on Tuesday hit a record high in hospital admissions for the 15th consecutive day. The concerning upward trend is expected to worsen in coming days with the US Thanksgiving holiday, which typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. And while fewer Americans are travelling this year, the holiday typically calls for congregating and eating indoors with large groups - risky activities for Covid spread. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The show has defended its use of ""non-invasive"" species Police have given ""suitable advice"" to the producers of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! following complaints about the use of non-native bugs. The TV series is taking place in north Wales instead of the Australian jungle due to Covid-19 restrictions. Welsh naturalist and BBC Springwatch presenter Iolo Williams has questioned whether a licence was gained to release bugs into the wild. The show has defended the use of animals in its trials. A range of insects have been used on celebrities such as athlete Sir Mo Farah, TV presenter Vernon Kay and journalist Victoria Derbyshire during this year's trials. I'm A Celebrity defends animal use in trials The man teaching Ant and Dec to speak Welsh Mr Williams initially raised questions over the programme's use of the creatures last week when he tweeted: ""As well as the moral issue of using wild animals for entertainment, surely there are huge ecological issues here also.""

A spokesman for the show said all the insects used were ""non-invasive species"" which are only ever released in a ""contained area and collected immediately after filming"". He said: ""The bugs are UK bred and are commercially purchased in the UK for birds and exotic animal feed for pets and zoo keepers in normal circumstances."" The spokesman added the insects were donated to local wildlife sanctuaries, trusts and zoos for feed after filming. To release a non-native species into the wild, a licence is needed from Natural Resources Wales (NRW) under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. This video can not be played How do you pronounce I'm A Celeb's Gwrych Castle? NRW's chief executive Clare Pillman earlier said it had not received any licence applications from ITV ""in relation to releasing non-natives as part of their production of I'm a Celebrity"".

Earlier this monthITV defended using animals in the trialsafter concerns raised by the RSPCA over welfare. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said it would be ""right"" for police to investigate ""if there have been some infringement"" of the rules.

"This video can not be played Home-schooled children are flourishing, says mother Some parents could not wait to get their children back to school after the first coronavirus lockdown. But Louise's two children remain at home - initially because she was shielding, but increasingly because ""they are flourishing"". They are among 806 children removed from school registers by parents in Wales between March and September this year - up almost 50% since last year. The Welsh Government said it had given councils Â£400,000 for home-schooling. But some parents teaching their children at home have called for more support. The number of children ""deregistered"" from schools to be home-schooled has increased 46% since last year, and 72% since 2018 Figures obtained byBBC Wales Liveshow 552 children were ""deregistered"" from school between March and September in 2019. In 2018, the figure was 466. The actual number will be higher as six local authorities have not given their figures. Local authorities said children were being deregistered for a number of reasons, including anxiety, coronavirus and lifestyle choice. The pandemic has filled Louise and her children ""with uncertainty"", she says Louise, 38, from Abergavenny, said her daughter Orlena struggled with learning at home during the first lockdown, ""but when it came to the children going back to school I was afraid and anxious"". ""It was the unknown with Covid - it just filled both me and them with uncertainty."" Louise suffers with an autoimmune disease which means she would be likely to be ""very sick"" if she caught coronavirus, which made her children ""extremely concerned about bringing it home"". Covid fears prompt 38% rise in parents home educating Home-schooling has been hell, say parents Home-schooling during coronavirus: a child's verdict ""So at the end of August we just decided they weren't going to go back for now,"" she explained. Armed with online resources loosely based around the suggested curriculum for their age, Louise deregistered her children in September. She has been surprised by how readily Orlena, 12, and nine-year-old Roy have adapted to their new style of education. Louise says her children get more one-on-one teaching time at home than they did at school ""We were just plodding along with school - I was aware Orlena was slow in some things and that Roy was a bit rebellious,"" Louise said. ""Home-educating has helped me see their weaknesses and work on them. ""I ask them how they feel about going back to school and both of them say they don't get as much one-on-one with teachers as they have 30 children to deal with. ""They are flourishing now with someone having the time to sit with them and do things. I do learning through play, and if something doesn't tickle their mind I don't force them to do it."" She said she now sees home education as a potentially long-term arrangement for the children, with the possibility of them studying for their GCSEs at home. Louise says she will allow Orlena and Roy to go back to school once it is safe, if they wish ""If the children want to go back once it is safe for them to do so, they can. But I have decided to leave that up to them,"" Louise added. ""We might look at flexi-schooling, where they go to school for part of the week, but spend a couple of days being home educated too."" Although she is sometimes unable to teach them because of her illness, Louise said help from friends, her children's desire to learn and online resources makes home education possible. She said: ""There hasn't been any support, the only support has been through other home-educating parents online."" Monmouthshire council said it worked with home-schooling parents ""in line with Welsh Government guidance"", and that no parents had been in touch to express disappointment with the level of support. There are more than 2,250 children currently being home educated in Wales, figures obtained by the BBC show Freedom of Information requests by Wales Live to local authorities found there were a total of 2,250 children currently being home educated in Wales. In 2019 there were 2,171 while in 2018 that figure was 1,878. The number may be higher as it is not compulsory for parents to register their children as being home schooled if they have never attended school. Lockdown has been like an ""extended free trial"" for home schooling and the ""biggest single boost in home education ever"", according to Alastair Lawson, from education resource website Twinkl. But home schooling has been more challenging for other parents. Polly says she has had ""no official support"" to educate her daughter Meg at home Polly, from Ceredigion, started home schooling her 12-year-old daughter Meg in September to shield her husband - who previously had a kidney transplant - from the virus. ""I can't describe how hard I find it having to be teacher, mother, best friend,"" said Polly. ""I've had no official support. Ceredigion council were very supportive when we chose to withdraw her from education - they didn't oppose it and we didn't have any fines and I think we had one letter with a link to online resources."" Ceredigion council said it was ""not in a position to direct what learning takes place"" at home, but it was ""eager"" to help families find the right learning resources. She said the experience has made them a lot closer as a mother and daughter, but added: ""Some sort of mentoring for me would really help. Some sort of guidelines."" Children's commissioner Sally Holland is reviewing the regulations surrounding home-schooling Plans to set upa compulsory register of children being home schooled,externalwere shelved by the Welsh Government in June due to the pandemic. As a result, Children's Commissioner Sally Holland haslaunched a review into regulations surrounding home schoolingto see if it should be better regulated. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it was updating a leaflet for home-educating parents concerned about coronavirus, and they needed to be aware of the implications of home-schooling. She said: ""We're aware that some parents may have made the decision to remove their children from school due to Covid-related fears, however, we encourage schools and local authorities to work together with families through a supportive approach to enable a return to school during these challenging times."" The spokeswoman added the Welsh Government had allocated Â£400,000 to local authorities this year to support home-schooling families, which is ""unique to Wales"".

"The UK government rejected claims it had ""betrayed"" farmers A row has broken out over the future of agriculture subsidises in Wales after Wednesday's Spending Review. Welsh agriculture will get Â£242m next year from UK ministers, leading to claims from the Farmers Union of Wales that it has been cut by at least Â£95m compared to previous EU funding. The union accused the UK government of a ""betrayal"". But UK government ministers said that was not true, and said farmers will get the same cash in 2021 as 2019. It comes as the chancellor warned unemployment will riseto 2.6m in 2021. Rishi Sunak said the Welsh Government will received an increase in cash of Â£1.3bn next year - he said the review ""underlines our commitment to Wales"". Rebecca Evans, Wales' Finance Minister, accused the chancellor of ""broken promises"" and said a pay freeze for much of the public sector was ""unfair"". Unemployed predicted to rise to 2.6 million How will the Spending Review affect you? Universal Credit top-up 'should be extended' Agriculture funding from the EU has been worth Â£337m to Wales every year, and is paid out by the Welsh Government. The Farmers Union of Wales (FUW) said Conservative ministers had made a manifesto promise to ""guarantee the current annual budget to farmers in every year of the next Parliament"". FUW president Glyn Roberts said: ""The decision to slash the budget is therefore a complete betrayal of the farmers, who have kept producing food and feeding the nation throughout the coronavirus pandemic."" Ms Evans added: ""If you're looking for a serious failure of management of funding, and if you're looking for a betrayal of the farming industry, I think that you can find it right there."" Rishi Sunak warned of an 'economic emergency' with unemployment set to surge EU agriculture funding is split into two - pillar 1 covers direct payments, while pillar 2 is designed to support the development of rural areas. Pillar 2 payments from the EU are continuing for another three years. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the Conservative's manifesto had made a ""clear"" commitment ""to maintain the current annual budget for farmers across the United Kingdom in every year of this Parliament"". ""That is exactly what we are doing. Claims to the contrary are unhelpful and untrue. ""The funding that the Chancellor announced today is on top of the remaining EU funding that farmers and land managers across the UK will receive for agri-environment and rural development projects. ""The fact remains that Welsh farmers will continue to receive the same level of funding in 2021 as they received at the baseline in 2019."" A UK government spokesman said the total the Welsh Government will receive will make up the difference between the Â£242m and the Â£337m. However the Welsh Government say the EU would have provided fresh funding, and said it should not have to rely on funds from old EU programmes. Most of the Welsh Government's cash to spend on the NHS, education and councils comes from the UK government, apart from a limited amount of tax revenue raised in Wales. Rishi Sunak's review said the Welsh Government would receive an ""additional"" Â£1.3bn in 2021-22. But Treasury documents show the Welsh Government will receive Â£16.6bn in the next financial year, less than the Â£20.3bn it is getting this year. That is because this year's funds were bolstered by Â£5bn for Covid, spending which is planned to fall after March to around Â£800m. However money for normal day-to-day spending will rise from Â£12.8bn to Â£13.5bn. Infrastructure spending will remain the same in 2021-22 at Â£2.4bn - Rebecca Evans said the infrastructure capital budget would be lower in real terms. Doctors pay in Wales is set by the Welsh Government Public sector pay outside of the NHS and the lowest paid will be frozen - but decisions on teachers, doctors and nurses pay in Wales will rest with ministers in Cardiff. However the Welsh Government, which funds NHS, local government, education and other devolved services in Wales, can choose how to spend the money. Mr Sunak said: ""Today's Spending Review underlines our commitment to the people of Wales as we look to the future. ""It provides billions of pounds to fight coronavirus, deliver the peoples' priorities and drive the UK's recovery ""The Treasury is, has been, and will always be the Treasury for the whole of the United Kingdom. And this is a Spending Review for the whole United Kingdom."" Simon Hart said Wales as a whole would benefit from the Â£2.9bn Restart programme, aimed at helping unemployed people find work. He said Wales would also benefit from ""planned improvements to mobile and broadband connectivity and investment in green industries like carbon capture and offshore wind"". Wales has received millions economic aid from the European Union The Spending Review said total domestic UK-wide funding for the new Shared Prosperity Fund will ""at least match current EU receipts, on average reaching around of Â£1.5 billion a year"". It does not confirm whether or not Wales will receive the same amount per year as it did from the EU. EU aid programmes previously amounted to Â£375m in Wales annually. UK ministers had previously promised Wales would not receive ""a penny less"" in funding after the Brexit transition period ends. The review said a portion of the Shared Prosperity Fund will target places ""most in need"" across the UK such as ex-industrial areas, deprived towns and rural and coastal communities. It adds that the funding profile for the fund will be set out at the next review. Ms Evans said there was ""absolute silence"" on the fund from the UK government and said it was ""really disappointing not to have any further information"". Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake said: ""Today the Chancellor failed to confirm that Wales's share of the Shared Prosperity Fund will be decided according to need, that it will represent additional investment, and that Wales's share will not be diminished over time.""

"Gareth Smith set up MyMaskFit after wife Valerie, pictured, struggled to find a mask to fit her A nurse who struggled to get face masks to fit her has inspired the design of custom-fitted ones for frontline healthcare workers. Gareth Smith set up MyMaskFit after his wife, intensive care nurse Valerie Bednar, struggled to find a filtering face mask (FFP) to fit her. Based in Swansea, the firm is working with a number of UK universities. Ms Bednar said the masks are reusable so will reduce stress among staff and be better for the environment. ""I'm one of the people the standard disposable FFP3 masks doesn't fit my face,"" said Ms Bednar, who worked at Morriston Hospital in Swansea at the start of the pandemic but is currently on maternity leave. ""It was just the stress of trying to do what you need to do - the reason we go into nursing is to take care of people, and then the added level of 'am I being safe and do I have the protection that I need?' ""That uncertainty I think was stressful for everyone."" This video can not be played Intensive care nurse Valerie Bednar hopes the reusable masks will cut down on PPE being discarded The company hopes to further develop a prototype designed by researchers at Birmingham University and King's College London. Swansea University's School of Engineering will help test and manufacture the face mask, which it is hoped will be available to the NHS in Wales in the new year. MyMaskFit said it is aiming to become the first to make a fully custom-fitted, reusable, filtering face piece masks made to a medical grade standard in the UK. A mould for a face seal is created using a scan of someone's face ""We want to make a reusable mask so that staff can feel confident when they come in for their shift it will be there,"" Ms Bednar explained. ""You're involved in cleaning it and owning it - all of that gives people the sense of security and protection."" To speed up the design process and to achieve a seal which will fit anyone, the company has launched an app which will scan the face and send the data for a mould to be created and 3D printed. MyMaskFit technology director Paul Perera said current masks vary widely in terms of design. ""There is an inevitable variation in the shape of human faces, and BMA surveys have shown that over 20% of hospital doctors have to try one or more masks to find one that fits,"" he said. Clear face masks trialled to 'greatly benefit' patients Coronavirus doctor's diary: 'We are first-hand witnesses of this devastation' Welsh businesses 'essential' to PPE supply Mr Perera said the firm was also working on a face mask which is made with ""renewable plastics that are transparent"" to aid communication. He added: ""We're also using a copper, embedded into the plastics, which kills the virus. Therefore the masks can be reusable and therefore more sustainable for the environment."" The initial manufacturing process and further testing of the prototypes will take place at Swansea University.

"Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet at home during the Christmas period A UK-wide approach to coronavirus rules after Christmas is needed, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. The UK government and ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have agreedthree householdscan meet from 23 December until 27 December. Mr Drakeford said it ""makes sense"" to ""respond to the consequences of greater household mixing"" together in the aftermath of the five-day period. The UK government said it was ""a key example"" of a unified UK-wide response. Mr Drakeford said his own family would make ""some modest use of the freedoms"". Mark Drakford says he was ""cheered"" by the four nations' ability to reach an agreement Speaking on BBC Radio Wales, he said: ""I am cheered up by the fact that by meeting together four times, we've been able to reach a common position on the five days of Christmas. ""But I want us to reach a common position on how we approach the aftermath of Christmas as well and I think it makes sense to do that across the United Kingdom as well - have a common approach to responding to the consequences of greater household mixing. Caution urged over coronavirus Christmas rulesl The new lockdown rules How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas ""I do think that getting around the table together to go through a plan for it should be the next step [in] what I think of as the successful way in which we've been able to plan together for the five days of Christmas itself."" Under the agreement for Christmas, made at a meeting of Cobra on Tuesday afternoon: Travel restrictions will be eased to provide a window for households to come together Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet at home during the period Bubbles must be fixed and ""must not be changed or extended further"" Each Christmas bubble can meet at home, a place of worship or an outdoor public place Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price called for the Welsh Government to ""keep a close eye"" on infection rates and impose further restrictions if necessary. Mr Price also called for quicker test results so ""tracing teams can begin their work of clamping down on cases and possible clusters or outbreaks"". Christmas Covid rules: Who are you allowed to see? Support bubbles: How do they work and who is in yours? Covid: What can you do as Wales' firebreak lockdown ends? The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Paul Davies, claimed it was Mr Johnson who had suggested the ""collaborative approach"". Meanwhile a UK government spokesman added: ""We welcome the desire of the Welsh administration to work even more closely with the UK government, delivering for communities across all four corners of the country."" This video can not be played Abby wants her family to be together at Christmas - but there are too many households However some scientists have warned that the relaxation of Covid restrictions over the festive period couldspark another waveof infections and further deaths. They said a typical Christmas gathering at home was the type of environment where infections could spread. People have been advised to take precautions when meeting their Christmas bubble, such as washing hands frequently and opening windows to clear potential virus particles. Up to three households can form an exclusive ""bubble"" to meet indoors during the Christmas period When asked what his plans were for Christmas, Mr Drakeford said: ""I am looking forward to seeing some members of my family who I haven't been able to meet indoors for many, many months now, but we will do it in a very contained, careful way. ""We certainly won't be mixing with people who are vulnerable or whose age puts them at a particular disadvantage. ""I am looking forward to being able to make some modest use of the freedoms."" When asked about introducingÂ tougherÂ restrictionsÂ ahead of Christmas, he said his cabinet would meet on Thursday ""to see whether or not the position in Wales means that we have to introduce some further restrictions to create the headroom we need to be able to use those five days over Christmas in a responsible way"". Â Â On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said an agreement to relax Covid rules over Christmas wasnot ""an instruction to meet with other people"". ""So it's not a choice between relaxation or no relaxation. It's having a form of relaxation where there are rules that people will recognise that will allow people to enjoy Christmas, but we'll do it in a controlled way.""

"""It's going to look horrible."" The simple truth about the Spending Review according to a senior MP. The chancellor will bang the drum for his plans to keep people in jobs, or help find new ones. Rishi Sunak will take out the metaphorical megaphone to explain how he'll allocate billions of taxpayers' cash to spend on infrastructure in the coming months. But the headlines of the Spending Review, when governments put their money where their mouths are, won't be in any rhetorical flourishes at the despatch box, nor likely in any surprise announcements kept back as goodies for the public. What may shock, is the cold reality of the cost of the coronavirus, which will be laid bare in the tables and charts published at the same time, presenting to the country in the shape of statistics from the Office for Budget Responsibility how much damage the pandemic has really done to how we make a living. Rishi Sunak's plans: Four things to look out for How will the Spending Review affect you? Without poring over the spreadsheets, the ""horrible"" will mean a massive gap between what the government takes in tax and what is has been spending, a deficit more than ten times what it was last year. There will be an estimate of the number of people who may end up unemployed, perhaps nearing three million before too long. It's likely to mean a freeze on pay for much of the public sector; a cut, even if temporary to the amount of cash the UK spends on foreign aid; tight spending limits for government departments on their day-to-day spending and eye-watering levels of debt and borrowing. One former Treasury minister, who is not prone to hyperbole (unusually for a politician you might wonder) described it as a ""multigenerational debt which will have implications for the rest of our lives in terms of what the British state can afford"". We will on Wednesday, they suggest, ""learn a great deal about the problem"", what months of emergency spending has done to the economy. But before we go on, don't hold your breath to learn much about any solutions. Rishi Sunak will set out the state of the country's finances in a statement to Parliament The chancellor and prime minister have decided politically that while budgets will be tight (and let's see the black and white to assess this for real) there can't be a return to the kind of squeeze of the Cameron and Osborne era. No one in government would pretend in private there is any way to avoid tax rises at some point. But Mr Sunak is not going to announce any of that on Wednesday - any big ways of raising money to fill the hole won't come until the Budget next year at the earliest, and perhaps not until after that. But Wednesday's review will sketch out the very, very serious challenge for the country's finances that is on the way.

"""It's going to look horrible."" The simple truth about the Spending Review according to a senior MP. The chancellor will bang the drum for his plans to keep people in jobs, or help find new ones. Rishi Sunak will take out the metaphorical megaphone to explain how he'll allocate billions of taxpayers' cash to spend on infrastructure in the coming months. But the headlines of the Spending Review, when governments put their money where their mouths are, won't be in any rhetorical flourishes at the despatch box, nor likely in any surprise announcements kept back as goodies for the public. What may shock, is the cold reality of the cost of the coronavirus, which will be laid bare in the tables and charts published at the same time, presenting to the country in the shape of statistics from the Office for Budget Responsibility how much damage the pandemic has really done to how we make a living. Rishi Sunak's plans: Four things to look out for How will the Spending Review affect you? Without poring over the spreadsheets, the ""horrible"" will mean a massive gap between what the government takes in tax and what is has been spending, a deficit more than ten times what it was last year. There will be an estimate of the number of people who may end up unemployed, perhaps nearing three million before too long. It's likely to mean a freeze on pay for much of the public sector; a cut, even if temporary to the amount of cash the UK spends on foreign aid; tight spending limits for government departments on their day-to-day spending and eye-watering levels of debt and borrowing. One former Treasury minister, who is not prone to hyperbole (unusually for a politician you might wonder) described it as a ""multigenerational debt which will have implications for the rest of our lives in terms of what the British state can afford"". We will on Wednesday, they suggest, ""learn a great deal about the problem"", what months of emergency spending has done to the economy. But before we go on, don't hold your breath to learn much about any solutions. Rishi Sunak will set out the state of the country's finances in a statement to Parliament The chancellor and prime minister have decided politically that while budgets will be tight (and let's see the black and white to assess this for real) there can't be a return to the kind of squeeze of the Cameron and Osborne era. No one in government would pretend in private there is any way to avoid tax rises at some point. But Mr Sunak is not going to announce any of that on Wednesday - any big ways of raising money to fill the hole won't come until the Budget next year at the earliest, and perhaps not until after that. But Wednesday's review will sketch out the very, very serious challenge for the country's finances that is on the way. Most importantly of course that will be reflected in the number of people who might lose their jobs with all the distress that entails, all the business that could be lost, and the impact on people's pay packets. But it also sets the backdrop for the decisions that our politicians have to make, and will be confronted with for many, many years to come. It's notable that while there have been some skirmishes around the edges in the last nine months, there has been very little tension over the government and the Bank of England's central actions to write enormous cheques, and keep the signatures coming as the pandemic has progressed.

"The Chancellor has delivered his Spending Review - setting out government plans for the economy and spending Rishi Sunak said the government is set to borrow a record Â£394bn this year He told MPs unemployment will rise to 2.6 million by the second quarter of 2021 Mr Sunak said the economy is predicted to contract by 11.3% and grow by 5.5% next year and 6.6% in 2022. Public sector pay will be frozen, except for NHS staff and those earning under Â£24,000 The BBC has been told that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public sector pay freeze Spending on overseas aid will be cut from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income next year The spending plans don't include any tax changes - they are only announced in the Budget The economy has been hit by the cost of borrowing for the coronavirus pandemic and job losses The Office for Budget Responsibility published its forecasts for the economy and public finances The OBR warned the economy is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until the end of 2022 The chancellor told the cabinet this morning the OBR figures were ""sobering"" Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon and Howard Mustoe BBC Politics That's where we'll end our coverage and analysis of the Spending Review, and this week's Prime Minister's Questions. Our reporting today was brought to you by Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon, Kate Whannel, and Howard Mustoe, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. Thanks for following along with us. Good night.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his Spending Review statement in the Commons earlier Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Chancellor leaving No 11 this morning On rare occasions, nervous chancellors leave No 11
gripping their documents, to deliver news to the country that resets the dial. That happened today. The pandemic has already cost jobs and
hardships, but there can now be no doubt that the economic aftermath will last
for many years. The predictions of job losses, record levels of borrowing and
debt - all huge headlines in themselves. In the last few months, with
almost no dissent, the government has scrambled to expand the state to
help cope with coronavirus. Borrowing rates are at rock bottom. Other countries
have done the same. There is little controversy about the decisions that have
been taken so far. But what lurks on the countryâs balance sheet is the biggest
economic baggage for generations. There is almost zero political pressure to
solve the problem any time soon. But eventually the pressure will force a
reckoning in the Tory party. Itâs a Conservative chancellor - whose
instinct is to pare back the state - who has presided over a generational emergency
expansion. How Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson propose to solve that paradox will
create the contours of political arguments at least until the next election. BBC Politics The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out what the UK government will spend on health, education, transport and other public services next year.  Here's a recap on the main points: For more detailsyou can read more here. The chancellor visited the Imperial Centre for Translation and Experimental Medicine in West London After delivering his speech in the Commons earlier, the chancellor visited the National Institute for Health Research in west London where he met staff, and was talked through the process followed by vaccine volunteers. Speaking to reporters Rishi Sunak said with ""record peacetime debt levels"" he had to make some ""tough decisions"" in his Spending Review. He said the ""fiscal and economic situation"" meant decision had to be made to ""focus on the priorities of the British people"". Asked about the public sector pay freeze, Mr Sunak said ""if you look at the private sector, people are losing their jobs, hours are being cut wages are being cut, and in the context of that, it wouldn't be fair or right to have an across the board increase in public sector pay."" He said the targeted approach ""still means a majority of public sector workers will see an increase in their pay next year, which is a fair and reasonable approach to take"" BBC Politics Earlier today we said 1.3 million people would be directly affected by the central government public sector pay freeze. Here is a bit more detail on that stat. In total there are 5.5 million public sector workers. Around a million NHS workers and 2.1 million lower paid workers won't be affected. The freeze announced today does not apply those paid by local or devolved government - although those bodies may also decide to implement their own  pay rise pause. If that happens the total number of public sector workers impacted will be much higher. Earlier today, Rishi Sunak announced a Â£4bn ""levelling up"" fund to pay for upgrading local infrastructure across the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's PM, Labour Mayor for Greater Manchester Andy Burnham describes the fund ""distinctly underwhelming"". Because the fund is open to every single local authority, he argues that the money will not be prioritised in the areas where it is needed. He also says there will be a Â£20m cap on any project. ""We're talking modest train stations, bus interchanges, small roads - I don't think that amounts to a major strategic plan to level up poorest regions,"" he says. And he notes that local areas will have to apply to central government to get money. ""This is Whitehall wanting to hoard the money and the power,"" he says adding that the funding should be devolved to regions of England. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter The headline figure for Northern
Ireland is Â£920m â but when you break it down, more than half is in relation to
Covid-19 spending, with Â£380m for Stormontâs nine departments to share on
day-to-day matters. The Finance Minister Conor
Murphy has made it clear heâs less than impressed with whatâs been dished out. Heâs also concerned about where
this leaves the executive in terms of investing for economic recovery, both
from the impact of coronavirus and to mitigate any problems arising with Brexit
next year. Decisions on pay awards for
public sector workers are devolved to Stormont, so that will be a difficult
discussion the executive will need to have soon â but Mr Murphy said he did not
support the idea of âdividingâ those providing critical services across the
country. The DUP â former
confidence-and-supply partners of the Conservative Party â has welcomed the
funding announcement but said it would have liked to see armed forces and
police officers included with those who are in line for a pay rise. Read more on the reaction from Northern Ireland here Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC Scotland's Nine The Scottish government will get Â£2.4bn from this Spending Review to spend as it
wishes. A total of Â£570m will go towards maintaining EU funding for farming and another Â£14 million for
fishing. It will also get a portion of the Â£800m ""levelling up"" fund that is being split across the four nations. But a lot of the other spending plans had already been announced, such as freeports and city deals. The majority of public sector pay is met by the Scottish government - apart from some civil servants - so the pay freeze wonât directly impact majority of public sector workers. But it could indirectly hit them through less money being available through the block grant given to them by the UK government. Ministers in Scotland had been calling for a more generous support package and a commitment to the Universal Credit uplift, and are likely to repeat demands for greater financial
powers. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also called on the chancellor to reverse the cut in foreign aid
spending, calling it ""deplorable"". On Twitter she said,externalit ""is a political gesture to the right wing of the Tory party, and the price of it will be paid by some of the poorest people in the world."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC Wales The
spending review today confirms an extra Â£1.3bn for the Welsh Government - some
of which is an increase in their core spending budget, and some of it is extra
cash as a result of more spending in England to tackle coronavirus. The
UK Government's also outlined plans to spend Â£240m to support farmers and
land managers in Wales, and Â£2m to support fisheries. A farmers union claim
this is a cut of at least Â£95m compared to previous EU funding. But UK Government ministers insisted they are
honouring a commitment to maintain farm incomes. There
are still questions, however, about what funding Wales is going to get to
replace EU funding for the poorest regions of the UK. European structural and investment funding in Wales
amounts to approximately four times the UK average per person. West Wales and
the Valleys received the highest level of EU Structural Funds available in each
funding period for the past twenty years. The
Treasury have announced the replacement fund - known as the Shared Prosperity
Fund - will at least match EU funds UK-wide. But what's not yet clear is whether
Wales will get the same amount it did from the EU. UK ministers previously
promised Wales would not get ""a penny less."" You can read more reaction from Wales here Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Local businessman Peter Boys says Rossendale has faced four decades of austerity Back in East Lancashire, and some are finding the figures from the Office of Budget Responsibility - predicting the biggest economic decline in 300 years - hard to fathom. Peter Boys is the director of
B+E Boys, a family construction firm which is one of the biggest employers in
Rossendale. He says the numbers are so huge the scale is âvery difficult to understand.â âYou just know itâs a large number and itâs going to take some sorting out some point in the future, perhaps not this generation, but for the generation to follow, and I do worry about that,"" he says. But Peter warns against more austerity measures for his part of the world. âTowns like Rossendale have
not only had a decade of austerity, theyâve probably had about four decades of
austerity, from the late 80s and the early 90s, with industry taken out of the
country, and we started to see more imports of goods,"" he says. âWeâve suffered since then
really, so it really needs some funding to back that up in the future.â Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Lewis and Oliver are both on the hunt for jobs I've been
speaking to people in Rossendale and Darwen, East
Lancashire, about what they needed from the chancellor in today's Spending Review. For Oliver and Lewis, both 19, it is jobs, with both men unemployed and looking for work. Oliver was a commercial
bodyworks engineer but was made redundant during the pandemic and has been
looking for work ever since. âItâs demoralising,"" he said. ""Youâre applying for jobs all day and you get no response half of the
time, and if you do get a response itâs a no, and thatâs no way to live your
life.â Lewis says heâs probably applied for about 50 jobs recently, describing the hunt as ""horrible"" and ""painful"". He said: âI thought going to college
would be a good idea to get my experience up and that would be the push to get
a job. ""But Iâve got nothing so far... so Iâm stuck here with qualifications I
canât use.â Former Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, has
said itâs a ""very sad moment"" that the government hasabandoned its commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid. Mr Cameron has said the chancellor is making ""a
mistake"". He told reporters it was a promise made that the government doesnât have to break. The former PM said he ""totally
understands"" the economic climate and that difficult decisions have to be made, but the commitment was a
manifesto promise and was set down in legislation. He added that commitment ""really said something about Britain"" and allowed the country to do âbrilliant thingsâ. Head of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady tells BBC News the public sector pay freeze will hit ""the very people who have been caring for the rest of us throughout this crisis"". And she argues that the Â£250 pay rise for low earners ""won't go very far when food and rent are taking into account"". She says the Treasury is justifying the pay freeze on the grounds that those in the public sector are paid more than the private sector. However she says this is incorrect and cites a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which found that once qualifications and age are taken into account, there is no difference between private and public salaries. The
BBC understands that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public
sector pay freeze. Sonny, Melissa, Matt and Robert told us what they thought of the chancellor's spending plans The coronavirus pandemic has hit young people across the UK hard. RecentBBC researchfound that people aged 16-25 were more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job. So what do they think of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spending Review? Our business reporter Lora Jones hasspoken to four under 25s to gauge their reaction to today's announcements The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has echoedMarcus Rashford's question earlier,external, saying it is ""deeply disappointing"" that today's Spending Review ""is leaving millions to wait out the winter in fear and uncertainty
with no reassurance forthcoming"" about Universal Credit. The charity's director, Helen Barnard, said there was ""no conceivable scenario in which this support will
not be needed"" and the government's ""inaction risks a sharp rise in poverty"". She added: ""Itâs not too late for the chancellor to do the right thing. ""We urge the government in the strongest terms
to correct its course and commit to making the Â£20 uplift permanent and extend
it to legacy benefits at the earliest opportunity.â Historically, economists often got twitchy when a country's debts exceeded the vale of its annual output, since it raised concerns about whether the debts would be repaid. But the cost of borrowing is now close to zero. But those low rates must hold, says the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is there to check
over the Treasury's sums. The OBR thinks debt interest payments as compared to revenue will actually fall to historical lows because interest rates are so low. But debt compared to gross domestic product (GDP) will rise to 105%, it thinks. ""So
long as these conditions hold, a debt-to-GDP ratio over 100 per cent should not prove
particularly onerous by historical standards,"" says the OBR. TheCounty Councils Network,external- which represents England's 37 county councils and county unitary authorities - has welcomed a rise in funds from the chancellor's spending review. Councillor David Williams, chairman of the group and leader of Hertfordshire County Council, said the Â£1.55bn - plus Â£300m for adults and
childrenâs social care would ""ease
the burden on councils next year, especially in relation to the continuing
costs of the coronavirus"". But he said there was still ""an onus on local authorities raising
more from council tax to fund their social care costs"". Councillor Williams added: ""With councils facing
an underlying funding shortfall before the pandemic, they still face some
difficult decisions next year on what services to reduce."" Last month, the County Councils Network warned about the risks to servicesas many councils face huge problems balancing their books. Earlier this year the England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford forced the government into a U-turn onextending free school meals.

The government increased Universal Credit by Â£20 a week during the pandemic. However it has insisted this is only a temporary measure to support those financially hit by coronavirus. The raise is currently due to expire at the end of March next year. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Today's assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed not just that the pandemic hit the UK economy this year by the biggest amount in three centuries, 11.3%, but that it was also set to be the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations. It also said that government borrowing in this year was 19% of the size of the economy, a peacetime record, just under Â£400bn in one year. And yet the paradox is that next year the amount of money it costs to fund that debt will also reach a post-war record: a record low. Since World War Two, our debts have never been bigger. And yet they've never been cheaper. How long this situation will last is the fundamental judgement for this chancellor. Read more from Faisal Islam here. Reality Check Chancellor
Rishi Sunak defended the governmentâs decision to cut foreign aid spending from
0.7% of national income to 0.5%. He said that, even after the change next
year, âthe UK would remain the second highest aid donor in the G7â. According
to the latest data from theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,external(OECD) the UKâs current foreign aid budget is smaller in absolute terms than both the
United Statesâ and Germanyâs. In
2019, the UK spent $19.4bn (Â£14.6bn) on foreign aid, while the US allocated
$34.6bn (Â£25.9bn) to foreign aid and Germany spent $23.8bn (Â£17.9bn). Mr
Sunak has said that UK aid spending will fall to $13.3 (Â£10bn) in 2021. Both
the US and Germany have larger economies than the UK so when you look at aid
spending as a proportion of national income, the UK â with its current 0.7% -
ranks higher than them â and tops the list of the G7 wealthiest countries: When
the UK aid budget falls to 0.5% next year - it will drop behind Germany (0.6%),
putting it in second place in the G7 - as the Chancellor said. But
if the reduced aid budget remained the same into 2022, the UK would alsofall behind France,external- which plans to increase its aid budget to 0.55% of GDP by 2022 Mr
Sunak did say the governmentâs âintention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal
situation allowsâ but gave no specific timeline.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99789447
"Personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles in England were inadequate for the Covid pandemic and price rises earlier this year cost taxpayers about Â£10bn, the spending watchdog has said. TheNational Audit Office said,externalthere had been a particular shortage of gloves and aprons. The government said the NAO's report recognised that NHS providers had been able to get what they needed in time. Almost Â£12.5bn was spent on 32bn items of PPE between February and July 2020. During the same period in 2019, 1.3bn items were bought at a cost of Â£28.9m. Each item had been ""substantially"" more expensive in 2020, because of very high global demand, the NAO said, from almost triple the cost for respirator masks to more than 14 times as much for body bags. Had the government been able to pay 2019 prices, it would have spent Â£2.5bn on PPE in 2020. In reality, it had spent Â£12.5bn, including hundreds of millions on ""unsuitable"" items that could not be used. Some had ""passed its expiry date or did not meet current safety standards"", the watchdog said, with ""insufficient checks"" meaning Public Health England had had to recall eye protectors that did not meet standards. In Parliament, on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""wasting"" taxpayer's money on equipment that ""can't be used"". But Mr Johnson replied ""99.5%"" of the 32 billion items of PPE bought between February and July 2020 ""conform entirely to our clinical needs"". Earlier, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said ""only 0.49% of all the purchased PPE tested to date"" had not been fit for purpose. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""As PPE stockpiles were inadequate for the pandemic, government needed to take urgent action to boost supplies. ""Once it recognised the gravity of the situation... the price of PPE increased dramatically, and that alone has cost the taxpayer around Â£10bn."" Unions worried care workers did not have proper protective equipment Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Before the Covid-19 pandemic, there were two emergency stockpiles of PPE: one as part of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Programme one built up in case of a no-deal Brexit But the NAO said: ""The EU exit stockpile held few items of PPE other than a large number of gloves."" Meanwhile, the flu stockpile, as well as having shortages of some key items, did not include any gowns or visors despite the fact they had been ""recommended for inclusion in June 2019 by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag)"". Public Health England told the NAO it had been analysing the market to work out which gowns to buy, when the pandemic had begun, which it said was the ""normal approach"" to find a lower price. In mid-March, the government had still believed its two stockpiles would provide ""most of the PPE needed to manage a Covid-19 pandemic"" and so focused on distributing this PPE rather than buying more, the NAO reported. The situation had become ""precarious"" in April and May, with stocks threatening to run out. At one point, only 3% of the required number of gowns had been available. But the nation did not at any point run out of any type of PPE. The scramble for PPE in the early stages of the pandemic was not confined to the UK. Every healthcare system was desperate to secure protective equipment and prices soared. But the National Audit Office lays bare how the UK was at the back of the queue, having failed to spot the warning signs and how woefully inadequate the stockpiles were. A failure to anticipate what might be needed for anything other than a flu pandemic in essence cost the taxpayer Â£10bn - the extra money needed to secure supplies such as gowns and visors during the Covid crisis. The report highlights poor distribution of PPE with many staff saying they did not have the right equipment. The NAO notes starkly that health and care employers have reported more than 100 deaths among staff because of exposure to coronavirus. An official inquiry, when it happens, will look hard at many aspects of the UK's preparedness and handling of the crisis and the PPE issue will be central. With a series of reports, the NAO has now done important groundwork but there is much still to find out. FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? A DHSC official said: ""As the NAO report recognises, during this unprecedented pandemic all the NHS providers audited 'were always able to get what they needed in time' thanks to the Herculean effort of government, NHS, armed forces, civil servants and industry"". But the NAO heard feedback from care workers, doctors and nurses that showed ""significant numbers of them considered that they were not adequately protected during the height of the first wave of the pandemic"". Employers have reported 126 deaths among health and care workers linked to exposure at work. And there were concerns about training and whether the equipment was appropriately fitted, particularly from women and people belonging to ethnic minorities. In a Royal College of Nursing survey of 5,000 NHS staff, 49% of respondents belonging to ethnic minorities said they had been adequately ""fit tested"" for a respirator, compared with 74% of white nurses. The DHSC said it was ""listening to the reported practical difficulties with the use of some PPE experienced by women and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals, among others, and... taking action to make sure user needs are adequately addressed in future provisions"". In a separate report, the Public Accounts Committee, a parliamentary body which works closely with the NAO, said it was ""concerned that the department had no plan before the pandemic for how it might increase critical care equipment in the event of an emergency"". ""This lack of preparedness was exacerbated by the fact that it did not know how many ventilators were available to the NHS to begin with,"" the PAC said.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered his Spending Review statement in the Commons earlier Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Chancellor leaving No 11 this morning On rare occasions, nervous chancellors leave No 11
gripping their documents, to deliver news to the country that resets the dial. That happened today. The pandemic has already cost jobs and
hardships, but there can now be no doubt that the economic aftermath will last
for many years. The predictions of job losses, record levels of borrowing and
debt - all huge headlines in themselves. In the last few months, with
almost no dissent, the government has scrambled to expand the state to
help cope with coronavirus. Borrowing rates are at rock bottom. Other countries
have done the same. There is little controversy about the decisions that have
been taken so far. But what lurks on the countryâs balance sheet is the biggest
economic baggage for generations. There is almost zero political pressure to
solve the problem any time soon. But eventually the pressure will force a
reckoning in the Tory party. Itâs a Conservative chancellor - whose
instinct is to pare back the state - who has presided over a generational emergency
expansion. How Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson propose to solve that paradox will
create the contours of political arguments at least until the next election. BBC Politics The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out what the UK government will spend on health, education, transport and other public services next year.  Here's a recap on the main points: For more detailsyou can read more here. The chancellor visited the Imperial Centre for Translation and Experimental Medicine in West London After delivering his speech in the Commons earlier, the chancellor visited the National Institute for Health Research in west London where he met staff, and was talked through the process followed by vaccine volunteers. Speaking to reporters Rishi Sunak said with ""record peacetime debt levels"" he had to make some ""tough decisions"" in his Spending Review. He said the ""fiscal and economic situation"" meant decision had to be made to ""focus on the priorities of the British people"". Asked about the public sector pay freeze, Mr Sunak said ""if you look at the private sector, people are losing their jobs, hours are being cut wages are being cut, and in the context of that, it wouldn't be fair or right to have an across the board increase in public sector pay."" He said the targeted approach ""still means a majority of public sector workers will see an increase in their pay next year, which is a fair and reasonable approach to take"" BBC Politics Earlier today we said 1.3 million people would be directly affected by the central government public sector pay freeze. Here is a bit more detail on that stat. In total there are 5.5 million public sector workers. Around a million NHS workers and 2.1 million lower paid workers won't be affected. The freeze announced today does not apply those paid by local or devolved government - although those bodies may also decide to implement their own  pay rise pause. If that happens the total number of public sector workers impacted will be much higher. Earlier today, Rishi Sunak announced a Â£4bn ""levelling up"" fund to pay for upgrading local infrastructure across the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's PM, Labour Mayor for Greater Manchester Andy Burnham describes the fund ""distinctly underwhelming"". Because the fund is open to every single local authority, he argues that the money will not be prioritised in the areas where it is needed. He also says there will be a Â£20m cap on any project. ""We're talking modest train stations, bus interchanges, small roads - I don't think that amounts to a major strategic plan to level up poorest regions,"" he says. And he notes that local areas will have to apply to central government to get money. ""This is Whitehall wanting to hoard the money and the power,"" he says adding that the funding should be devolved to regions of England. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter The headline figure for Northern
Ireland is Â£920m â but when you break it down, more than half is in relation to
Covid-19 spending, with Â£380m for Stormontâs nine departments to share on
day-to-day matters. The Finance Minister Conor
Murphy has made it clear heâs less than impressed with whatâs been dished out. Heâs also concerned about where
this leaves the executive in terms of investing for economic recovery, both
from the impact of coronavirus and to mitigate any problems arising with Brexit
next year. Decisions on pay awards for
public sector workers are devolved to Stormont, so that will be a difficult
discussion the executive will need to have soon â but Mr Murphy said he did not
support the idea of âdividingâ those providing critical services across the
country. The DUP â former
confidence-and-supply partners of the Conservative Party â has welcomed the
funding announcement but said it would have liked to see armed forces and
police officers included with those who are in line for a pay rise. Read more on the reaction from Northern Ireland here Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC Scotland's Nine The Scottish government will get Â£2.4bn from this Spending Review to spend as it
wishes. A total of Â£570m will go towards maintaining EU funding for farming and another Â£14 million for
fishing. It will also get a portion of the Â£800m ""levelling up"" fund that is being split across the four nations. But a lot of the other spending plans had already been announced, such as freeports and city deals. The majority of public sector pay is met by the Scottish government - apart from some civil servants - so the pay freeze wonât directly impact majority of public sector workers. But it could indirectly hit them through less money being available through the block grant given to them by the UK government. Ministers in Scotland had been calling for a more generous support package and a commitment to the Universal Credit uplift, and are likely to repeat demands for greater financial
powers. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also called on the chancellor to reverse the cut in foreign aid
spending, calling it ""deplorable"". On Twitter she said,externalit ""is a political gesture to the right wing of the Tory party, and the price of it will be paid by some of the poorest people in the world."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC Wales The
spending review today confirms an extra Â£1.3bn for the Welsh Government - some
of which is an increase in their core spending budget, and some of it is extra
cash as a result of more spending in England to tackle coronavirus. The
UK Government's also outlined plans to spend Â£240m to support farmers and
land managers in Wales, and Â£2m to support fisheries. A farmers union claim
this is a cut of at least Â£95m compared to previous EU funding. But UK Government ministers insisted they are
honouring a commitment to maintain farm incomes. There
are still questions, however, about what funding Wales is going to get to
replace EU funding for the poorest regions of the UK. European structural and investment funding in Wales
amounts to approximately four times the UK average per person. West Wales and
the Valleys received the highest level of EU Structural Funds available in each
funding period for the past twenty years. The
Treasury have announced the replacement fund - known as the Shared Prosperity
Fund - will at least match EU funds UK-wide. But what's not yet clear is whether
Wales will get the same amount it did from the EU. UK ministers previously
promised Wales would not get ""a penny less."" You can read more reaction from Wales here Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Local businessman Peter Boys says Rossendale has faced four decades of austerity Back in East Lancashire, and some are finding the figures from the Office of Budget Responsibility - predicting the biggest economic decline in 300 years - hard to fathom. Peter Boys is the director of
B+E Boys, a family construction firm which is one of the biggest employers in
Rossendale. He says the numbers are so huge the scale is âvery difficult to understand.â âYou just know itâs a large number and itâs going to take some sorting out some point in the future, perhaps not this generation, but for the generation to follow, and I do worry about that,"" he says. But Peter warns against more austerity measures for his part of the world. âTowns like Rossendale have
not only had a decade of austerity, theyâve probably had about four decades of
austerity, from the late 80s and the early 90s, with industry taken out of the
country, and we started to see more imports of goods,"" he says. âWeâve suffered since then
really, so it really needs some funding to back that up in the future.â Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Lewis and Oliver are both on the hunt for jobs I've been
speaking to people in Rossendale and Darwen, East
Lancashire, about what they needed from the chancellor in today's Spending Review. For Oliver and Lewis, both 19, it is jobs, with both men unemployed and looking for work. Oliver was a commercial
bodyworks engineer but was made redundant during the pandemic and has been
looking for work ever since. âItâs demoralising,"" he said. ""Youâre applying for jobs all day and you get no response half of the
time, and if you do get a response itâs a no, and thatâs no way to live your
life.â Lewis says heâs probably applied for about 50 jobs recently, describing the hunt as ""horrible"" and ""painful"". He said: âI thought going to college
would be a good idea to get my experience up and that would be the push to get
a job. ""But Iâve got nothing so far... so Iâm stuck here with qualifications I
canât use.â Former Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, has
said itâs a ""very sad moment"" that the government hasabandoned its commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid. Mr Cameron has said the chancellor is making ""a
mistake"". He told reporters it was a promise made that the government doesnât have to break. The former PM said he ""totally
understands"" the economic climate and that difficult decisions have to be made, but the commitment was a
manifesto promise and was set down in legislation. He added that commitment ""really said something about Britain"" and allowed the country to do âbrilliant thingsâ. Head of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady tells BBC News the public sector pay freeze will hit ""the very people who have been caring for the rest of us throughout this crisis"". And she argues that the Â£250 pay rise for low earners ""won't go very far when food and rent are taking into account"". She says the Treasury is justifying the pay freeze on the grounds that those in the public sector are paid more than the private sector. However she says this is incorrect and cites a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which found that once qualifications and age are taken into account, there is no difference between private and public salaries. The
BBC understands that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public
sector pay freeze. Sonny, Melissa, Matt and Robert told us what they thought of the chancellor's spending plans The coronavirus pandemic has hit young people across the UK hard. RecentBBC researchfound that people aged 16-25 were more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job. So what do they think of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spending Review? Our business reporter Lora Jones hasspoken to four under 25s to gauge their reaction to today's announcements The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has echoedMarcus Rashford's question earlier,external, saying it is ""deeply disappointing"" that today's Spending Review ""is leaving millions to wait out the winter in fear and uncertainty
with no reassurance forthcoming"" about Universal Credit. The charity's director, Helen Barnard, said there was ""no conceivable scenario in which this support will
not be needed"" and the government's ""inaction risks a sharp rise in poverty"". She added: ""Itâs not too late for the chancellor to do the right thing. ""We urge the government in the strongest terms
to correct its course and commit to making the Â£20 uplift permanent and extend
it to legacy benefits at the earliest opportunity.â Historically, economists often got twitchy when a country's debts exceeded the vale of its annual output, since it raised concerns about whether the debts would be repaid. But the cost of borrowing is now close to zero. But those low rates must hold, says the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is there to check
over the Treasury's sums. The OBR thinks debt interest payments as compared to revenue will actually fall to historical lows because interest rates are so low. But debt compared to gross domestic product (GDP) will rise to 105%, it thinks. ""So
long as these conditions hold, a debt-to-GDP ratio over 100 per cent should not prove
particularly onerous by historical standards,"" says the OBR. TheCounty Councils Network,external- which represents England's 37 county councils and county unitary authorities - has welcomed a rise in funds from the chancellor's spending review. Councillor David Williams, chairman of the group and leader of Hertfordshire County Council, said the Â£1.55bn - plus Â£300m for adults and
childrenâs social care would ""ease
the burden on councils next year, especially in relation to the continuing
costs of the coronavirus"". But he said there was still ""an onus on local authorities raising
more from council tax to fund their social care costs"". Councillor Williams added: ""With councils facing
an underlying funding shortfall before the pandemic, they still face some
difficult decisions next year on what services to reduce."" Last month, the County Councils Network warned about the risks to servicesas many councils face huge problems balancing their books.

The government increased Universal Credit by Â£20 a week during the pandemic. However it has insisted this is only a temporary measure to support those financially hit by coronavirus. The raise is currently due to expire at the end of March next year. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Today's assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed not just that the pandemic hit the UK economy this year by the biggest amount in three centuries, 11.3%, but that it was also set to be the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations. It also said that government borrowing in this year was 19% of the size of the economy, a peacetime record, just under Â£400bn in one year. And yet the paradox is that next year the amount of money it costs to fund that debt will also reach a post-war record: a record low. Since World War Two, our debts have never been bigger. And yet they've never been cheaper. How long this situation will last is the fundamental judgement for this chancellor. Read more from Faisal Islam here. Reality Check Chancellor
Rishi Sunak defended the governmentâs decision to cut foreign aid spending from
0.7% of national income to 0.5%. He said that, even after the change next
year, âthe UK would remain the second highest aid donor in the G7â. According
to the latest data from theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,external(OECD) the UKâs current foreign aid budget is smaller in absolute terms than both the
United Statesâ and Germanyâs. In
2019, the UK spent $19.4bn (Â£14.6bn) on foreign aid, while the US allocated
$34.6bn (Â£25.9bn) to foreign aid and Germany spent $23.8bn (Â£17.9bn). Mr
Sunak has said that UK aid spending will fall to $13.3 (Â£10bn) in 2021. Both
the US and Germany have larger economies than the UK so when you look at aid
spending as a proportion of national income, the UK â with its current 0.7% -
ranks higher than them â and tops the list of the G7 wealthiest countries: When
the UK aid budget falls to 0.5% next year - it will drop behind Germany (0.6%),
putting it in second place in the G7 - as the Chancellor said. But
if the reduced aid budget remained the same into 2022, the UK would alsofall behind France,external- which plans to increase its aid budget to 0.55% of GDP by 2022 Mr
Sunak did say the governmentâs âintention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal
situation allowsâ but gave no specific timeline.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999964

The government increased Universal Credit by Â£20 a week during the pandemic. However it has insisted this is only a temporary measure to support those financially hit by coronavirus. The raise is currently due to expire at the end of March next year. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Today's assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed not just that the pandemic hit the UK economy this year by the biggest amount in three centuries, 11.3%, but that it was also set to be the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations. It also said that government borrowing in this year was 19% of the size of the economy, a peacetime record, just under Â£400bn in one year. And yet the paradox is that next year the amount of money it costs to fund that debt will also reach a post-war record: a record low. Since World War Two, our debts have never been bigger. And yet they've never been cheaper. How long this situation will last is the fundamental judgement for this chancellor. Read more from Faisal Islam here. Reality Check Chancellor
Rishi Sunak defended the governmentâs decision to cut foreign aid spending from
0.7% of national income to 0.5%. He said that, even after the change next
year, âthe UK would remain the second highest aid donor in the G7â. According
to the latest data from theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,external(OECD) the UKâs current foreign aid budget is smaller in absolute terms than both the
United Statesâ and Germanyâs. In
2019, the UK spent $19.4bn (Â£14.6bn) on foreign aid, while the US allocated
$34.6bn (Â£25.9bn) to foreign aid and Germany spent $23.8bn (Â£17.9bn). Mr
Sunak has said that UK aid spending will fall to $13.3 (Â£10bn) in 2021. Both
the US and Germany have larger economies than the UK so when you look at aid
spending as a proportion of national income, the UK â with its current 0.7% -
ranks higher than them â and tops the list of the G7 wealthiest countries: When
the UK aid budget falls to 0.5% next year - it will drop behind Germany (0.6%),
putting it in second place in the G7 - as the Chancellor said. But
if the reduced aid budget remained the same into 2022, the UK would alsofall behind France,external- which plans to increase its aid budget to 0.55% of GDP by 2022 Mr
Sunak did say the governmentâs âintention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal
situation allowsâ but gave no specific timeline.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,4.7409158e-06

gripping their documents, to deliver news to the country that resets the dial. That happened today. The pandemic has already cost jobs and
hardships, but there can now be no doubt that the economic aftermath will last
for many years. The predictions of job losses, record levels of borrowing and
debt - all huge headlines in themselves. In the last few months, with
almost no dissent, the government has scrambled to expand the state to
help cope with coronavirus. Borrowing rates are at rock bottom. Other countries
have done the same. There is little controversy about the decisions that have
been taken so far. But what lurks on the countryâs balance sheet is the biggest
economic baggage for generations. There is almost zero political pressure to
solve the problem any time soon. But eventually the pressure will force a
reckoning in the Tory party. Itâs a Conservative chancellor - whose
instinct is to pare back the state - who has presided over a generational emergency
expansion. How Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson propose to solve that paradox will
create the contours of political arguments at least until the next election. BBC Politics The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out what the UK government will spend on health, education, transport and other public services next year.  Here's a recap on the main points: For more detailsyou can read more here. The chancellor visited the Imperial Centre for Translation and Experimental Medicine in West London After delivering his speech in the Commons earlier, the chancellor visited the National Institute for Health Research in west London where he met staff, and was talked through the process followed by vaccine volunteers. Speaking to reporters Rishi Sunak said with ""record peacetime debt levels"" he had to make some ""tough decisions"" in his Spending Review. He said the ""fiscal and economic situation"" meant decision had to be made to ""focus on the priorities of the British people"". Asked about the public sector pay freeze, Mr Sunak said ""if you look at the private sector, people are losing their jobs, hours are being cut wages are being cut, and in the context of that, it wouldn't be fair or right to have an across the board increase in public sector pay."" He said the targeted approach ""still means a majority of public sector workers will see an increase in their pay next year, which is a fair and reasonable approach to take"" BBC Politics Earlier today we said 1.3 million people would be directly affected by the central government public sector pay freeze. Here is a bit more detail on that stat. In total there are 5.5 million public sector workers. Around a million NHS workers and 2.1 million lower paid workers won't be affected. The freeze announced today does not apply those paid by local or devolved government - although those bodies may also decide to implement their own  pay rise pause. If that happens the total number of public sector workers impacted will be much higher. Earlier today, Rishi Sunak announced a Â£4bn ""levelling up"" fund to pay for upgrading local infrastructure across the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's PM, Labour Mayor for Greater Manchester Andy Burnham describes the fund ""distinctly underwhelming"". Because the fund is open to every single local authority, he argues that the money will not be prioritised in the areas where it is needed. He also says there will be a Â£20m cap on any project. ""We're talking modest train stations, bus interchanges, small roads - I don't think that amounts to a major strategic plan to level up poorest regions,"" he says. And he notes that local areas will have to apply to central government to get money. ""This is Whitehall wanting to hoard the money and the power,"" he says adding that the funding should be devolved to regions of England. Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political reporter The headline figure for Northern
Ireland is Â£920m â but when you break it down, more than half is in relation to
Covid-19 spending, with Â£380m for Stormontâs nine departments to share on
day-to-day matters. The Finance Minister Conor
Murphy has made it clear heâs less than impressed with whatâs been dished out. Heâs also concerned about where
this leaves the executive in terms of investing for economic recovery, both
from the impact of coronavirus and to mitigate any problems arising with Brexit
next year. Decisions on pay awards for
public sector workers are devolved to Stormont, so that will be a difficult
discussion the executive will need to have soon â but Mr Murphy said he did not
support the idea of âdividingâ those providing critical services across the
country. The DUP â former
confidence-and-supply partners of the Conservative Party â has welcomed the
funding announcement but said it would have liked to see armed forces and
police officers included with those who are in line for a pay rise. Read more on the reaction from Northern Ireland here Rajdeep SandhuWestminster Correspondent, BBC Scotland's Nine The Scottish government will get Â£2.4bn from this Spending Review to spend as it
wishes. A total of Â£570m will go towards maintaining EU funding for farming and another Â£14 million for
fishing. It will also get a portion of the Â£800m ""levelling up"" fund that is being split across the four nations. But a lot of the other spending plans had already been announced, such as freeports and city deals. The majority of public sector pay is met by the Scottish government - apart from some civil servants - so the pay freeze wonât directly impact majority of public sector workers. But it could indirectly hit them through less money being available through the block grant given to them by the UK government. Ministers in Scotland had been calling for a more generous support package and a commitment to the Universal Credit uplift, and are likely to repeat demands for greater financial
powers. The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has also called on the chancellor to reverse the cut in foreign aid
spending, calling it ""deplorable"". On Twitter she said,externalit ""is a political gesture to the right wing of the Tory party, and the price of it will be paid by some of the poorest people in the world."" Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC Wales The
spending review today confirms an extra Â£1.3bn for the Welsh Government - some
of which is an increase in their core spending budget, and some of it is extra
cash as a result of more spending in England to tackle coronavirus. The
UK Government's also outlined plans to spend Â£240m to support farmers and
land managers in Wales, and Â£2m to support fisheries. A farmers union claim
this is a cut of at least Â£95m compared to previous EU funding. But UK Government ministers insisted they are
honouring a commitment to maintain farm incomes. There
are still questions, however, about what funding Wales is going to get to
replace EU funding for the poorest regions of the UK. European structural and investment funding in Wales
amounts to approximately four times the UK average per person. West Wales and
the Valleys received the highest level of EU Structural Funds available in each
funding period for the past twenty years. The
Treasury have announced the replacement fund - known as the Shared Prosperity
Fund - will at least match EU funds UK-wide. But what's not yet clear is whether
Wales will get the same amount it did from the EU. UK ministers previously
promised Wales would not get ""a penny less.""

Peter Boys is the director of
B+E Boys, a family construction firm which is one of the biggest employers in
Rossendale. He says the numbers are so huge the scale is âvery difficult to understand.â âYou just know itâs a large number and itâs going to take some sorting out some point in the future, perhaps not this generation, but for the generation to follow, and I do worry about that,"" he says. But Peter warns against more austerity measures for his part of the world. âTowns like Rossendale have
not only had a decade of austerity, theyâve probably had about four decades of
austerity, from the late 80s and the early 90s, with industry taken out of the
country, and we started to see more imports of goods,"" he says. âWeâve suffered since then
really, so it really needs some funding to back that up in the future.â Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent Lewis and Oliver are both on the hunt for jobs I've been
speaking to people in Rossendale and Darwen, East
Lancashire, about what they needed from the chancellor in today's Spending Review. For Oliver and Lewis, both 19, it is jobs, with both men unemployed and looking for work. Oliver was a commercial
bodyworks engineer but was made redundant during the pandemic and has been
looking for work ever since. âItâs demoralising,"" he said. ""Youâre applying for jobs all day and you get no response half of the
time, and if you do get a response itâs a no, and thatâs no way to live your
life.â Lewis says heâs probably applied for about 50 jobs recently, describing the hunt as ""horrible"" and ""painful"". He said: âI thought going to college
would be a good idea to get my experience up and that would be the push to get
a job. ""But Iâve got nothing so far... so Iâm stuck here with qualifications I
canât use.â Former Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, has
said itâs a ""very sad moment"" that the government hasabandoned its commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid. Mr Cameron has said the chancellor is making ""a
mistake"". He told reporters it was a promise made that the government doesnât have to break. The former PM said he ""totally
understands"" the economic climate and that difficult decisions have to be made, but the commitment was a
manifesto promise and was set down in legislation. He added that commitment ""really said something about Britain"" and allowed the country to do âbrilliant thingsâ. Head of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady tells BBC News the public sector pay freeze will hit ""the very people who have been caring for the rest of us throughout this crisis"". And she argues that the Â£250 pay rise for low earners ""won't go very far when food and rent are taking into account"". She says the Treasury is justifying the pay freeze on the grounds that those in the public sector are paid more than the private sector. However she says this is incorrect and cites a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which found that once qualifications and age are taken into account, there is no difference between private and public salaries. The
BBC understands that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public
sector pay freeze. Sonny, Melissa, Matt and Robert told us what they thought of the chancellor's spending plans The coronavirus pandemic has hit young people across the UK hard. RecentBBC researchfound that people aged 16-25 were more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job. So what do they think of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spending Review? Our business reporter Lora Jones hasspoken to four under 25s to gauge their reaction to today's announcements The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has echoedMarcus Rashford's question earlier,external, saying it is ""deeply disappointing"" that today's Spending Review ""is leaving millions to wait out the winter in fear and uncertainty
with no reassurance forthcoming"" about Universal Credit. The charity's director, Helen Barnard, said there was ""no conceivable scenario in which this support will
not be needed"" and the government's ""inaction risks a sharp rise in poverty"". She added: ""Itâs not too late for the chancellor to do the right thing. ""We urge the government in the strongest terms
to correct its course and commit to making the Â£20 uplift permanent and extend
it to legacy benefits at the earliest opportunity.â Historically, economists often got twitchy when a country's debts exceeded the vale of its annual output, since it raised concerns about whether the debts would be repaid. But the cost of borrowing is now close to zero. But those low rates must hold, says the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is there to check
over the Treasury's sums. The OBR thinks debt interest payments as compared to revenue will actually fall to historical lows because interest rates are so low. But debt compared to gross domestic product (GDP) will rise to 105%, it thinks. ""So
long as these conditions hold, a debt-to-GDP ratio over 100 per cent should not prove
particularly onerous by historical standards,"" says the OBR. TheCounty Councils Network,external- which represents England's 37 county councils and county unitary authorities - has welcomed a rise in funds from the chancellor's spending review.

Head of the Trades Union Congress Frances O'Grady tells BBC News the public sector pay freeze will hit ""the very people who have been caring for the rest of us throughout this crisis"". And she argues that the Â£250 pay rise for low earners ""won't go very far when food and rent are taking into account"". She says the Treasury is justifying the pay freeze on the grounds that those in the public sector are paid more than the private sector. However she says this is incorrect and cites a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies which found that once qualifications and age are taken into account, there is no difference between private and public salaries. The
BBC understands that 1.3 million people will be directly affected by the public
sector pay freeze. Sonny, Melissa, Matt and Robert told us what they thought of the chancellor's spending plans The coronavirus pandemic has hit young people across the UK hard. RecentBBC researchfound that people aged 16-25 were more than twice as likely as older workers to have lost their job. So what do they think of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Spending Review? Our business reporter Lora Jones hasspoken to four under 25s to gauge their reaction to today's announcements The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has echoedMarcus Rashford's question earlier,external, saying it is ""deeply disappointing"" that today's Spending Review ""is leaving millions to wait out the winter in fear and uncertainty
with no reassurance forthcoming"" about Universal Credit. The charity's director, Helen Barnard, said there was ""no conceivable scenario in which this support will
not be needed"" and the government's ""inaction risks a sharp rise in poverty"". She added: ""Itâs not too late for the chancellor to do the right thing. ""We urge the government in the strongest terms
to correct its course and commit to making the Â£20 uplift permanent and extend
it to legacy benefits at the earliest opportunity.â Historically, economists often got twitchy when a country's debts exceeded the vale of its annual output, since it raised concerns about whether the debts would be repaid. But the cost of borrowing is now close to zero. But those low rates must hold, says the Office for Budget Responsibility, which is there to check
over the Treasury's sums. The OBR thinks debt interest payments as compared to revenue will actually fall to historical lows because interest rates are so low. But debt compared to gross domestic product (GDP) will rise to 105%, it thinks. ""So
long as these conditions hold, a debt-to-GDP ratio over 100 per cent should not prove
particularly onerous by historical standards,"" says the OBR. TheCounty Councils Network,external- which represents England's 37 county councils and county unitary authorities - has welcomed a rise in funds from the chancellor's spending review. Councillor David Williams, chairman of the group and leader of Hertfordshire County Council, said the Â£1.55bn - plus Â£300m for adults and
childrenâs social care would ""ease
the burden on councils next year, especially in relation to the continuing
costs of the coronavirus"". But he said there was still ""an onus on local authorities raising
more from council tax to fund their social care costs"". Councillor Williams added: ""With councils facing
an underlying funding shortfall before the pandemic, they still face some
difficult decisions next year on what services to reduce."" Last month, the County Councils Network warned about the risks to servicesas many councils face huge problems balancing their books. Earlier this year the England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford forced the government into a U-turn onextending free school meals.

The government increased Universal Credit by Â£20 a week during the pandemic. However it has insisted this is only a temporary measure to support those financially hit by coronavirus. The raise is currently due to expire at the end of March next year. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Today's assessment from the Office for Budget Responsibility confirmed not just that the pandemic hit the UK economy this year by the biggest amount in three centuries, 11.3%, but that it was also set to be the hardest hit of all the G7 major industrialised nations. It also said that government borrowing in this year was 19% of the size of the economy, a peacetime record, just under Â£400bn in one year. And yet the paradox is that next year the amount of money it costs to fund that debt will also reach a post-war record: a record low. Since World War Two, our debts have never been bigger. And yet they've never been cheaper. How long this situation will last is the fundamental judgement for this chancellor. Read more from Faisal Islam here. Reality Check Chancellor
Rishi Sunak defended the governmentâs decision to cut foreign aid spending from
0.7% of national income to 0.5%. He said that, even after the change next
year, âthe UK would remain the second highest aid donor in the G7â. According
to the latest data from theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,external(OECD) the UKâs current foreign aid budget is smaller in absolute terms than both the
United Statesâ and Germanyâs. In
2019, the UK spent $19.4bn (Â£14.6bn) on foreign aid, while the US allocated
$34.6bn (Â£25.9bn) to foreign aid and Germany spent $23.8bn (Â£17.9bn). Mr
Sunak has said that UK aid spending will fall to $13.3 (Â£10bn) in 2021. Both
the US and Germany have larger economies than the UK so when you look at aid
spending as a proportion of national income, the UK â with its current 0.7% -
ranks higher than them â and tops the list of the G7 wealthiest countries: When
the UK aid budget falls to 0.5% next year - it will drop behind Germany (0.6%),
putting it in second place in the G7 - as the Chancellor said. But
if the reduced aid budget remained the same into 2022, the UK would alsofall behind France,external- which plans to increase its aid budget to 0.55% of GDP by 2022 Mr
Sunak did say the governmentâs âintention is to return to 0.7% when the fiscal
situation allowsâ but gave no specific timeline.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,7.5040894e-05

Today's live updates were the work of Penny Spiller, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Katie Wright, John Hand, Hugo Bachega and Marie Jackson. Thanks for joining us. We'll be back on Thursday with all the very latest. It's been a big day of news and we're almost done for the day. Before we go though, here's what the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said about coronavirus in his Spending Review:  And, in other coronavirus news: The government has recorded another 696 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, an increase of 88 on yesterdayâs daily figure. It is the highest daily figure reported since 5 May. The government also recorded a further 18,213 cases of the virus, up 6,914 on Tuesdayâs daily figure. While Americans prepare for their Thanksgiving holiday, cases, hospital admissions and virus deaths tick up across the country. As of Wednesday afternoon, the US has recorded more than 12.6 million infections and more than 260,000 deaths. Here's what else you need you know: Boris Epshteyn (R) is pictured with Rudy Giuliani at a press conference last week. Another member of President Donald Trump's legal team, Boris Epshteyn, has tested positive for coronavirus. ""I am experiencing mild symptoms and am following all appropriate protocols, including quarantining and contact tracing,"" Epshteyn wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Epshteyn was seen at a press conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters last week with White House aide Andrew Giuliani, son of Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Andrew announced last week he had tested positive. Epshteyn has also spent time with the elder Giuliani, who is now leading efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Dozens of people close to President Donald Trump - including First Lady Melania Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie - have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. The president himself tested positive in October.  Two weeks ago Scarborough had the second highest infection rate in England Coronavirus cases in one of England's worst affected areas have more than halved in two weeks. On 11 November, Scarborough's infection rate stood at 611 - the second highest in England.It has now fallen to 296 per 100,000. Cases across North Yorkshire have also declined with the average for the county now 196 cases, lower than the national average of 207. One of the county's health officials, Richard Webb, told a briefing that falling infection rates had given the region some optimism that it could escape the tightest controls set to be announced by the government on Thursday. North Yorkshire was one of the few parts of northern England to remain in tier one - the lowest tier of restrictions - prior to the national lockdown which began on 5 November. England will move to a tougher version of tiered coronavirus restrictions when the lockdown ends on 2 December.Here's a reminder of the new rules. Taxis blocked key roads in Madrid US President-elect Joe Biden will deliver remarks from Wilmington, Delaware, later ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Democrat is expected to discuss the shared sacrifices of Americans during the approaching holiday season, as coronavirus outbreaks surge across the country. On Monday, Donald Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process to begin, nearly three weeks after the presidential election. Biden had previously warned that a lack of co-ordination - particularly on coronavirus policy - meant that ""people may die"". But so far, the Trump White House has been ""sincere"" in its transition to the new administration, Biden said on Tuesday. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says that being active is ""central to health"" but many people have reduced their levels of exercise during the pandemic. He said some people had done more exercise during the crisis but for many, coronavirus has made it harder. Speaking at a summit for ukactive, which represents many in the fitness industry, he said: ""It is very important that we get people who have got out of the habit of regular exercise back in the situation where they are doing so, and encourage others who have taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn't, to continue to do so. ""We need to think this through because exercise is so central. Exercise is the single simplest and most important thing people can do to improve their physical and mental health."" Restrictions in healthcare settings during the pandemic have added to the ""trauma and distress"" already endured by many women who have miscarried, a charity boss has said. Clea Harmer, of stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said coronavirus rules have meant women have had to go to hospital and grieve for their unborn babies alone. ""Attending scans and appointments can be really difficult, especially if you have had a miscarriage before, or your baby has died before, and often the scan is the place where you were told your baby has died,"" she said. ""To be in that position on your own, without your partner there... there are heartbreaking stories of mothers being told on their own and having to go out to the car park or back home and tell their partner themselves."" She added that although the NHS has issued guidance for hospitals to allow women to bring their partners to appointments, the picture is ""very mixed across the country"". Her comments come afterthe Duchess of Sussex revealed she had a miscarriagein July, writing in a New York Times article of feeling ""an almost unbearable grief"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Wuhan's Huanan Seafood market was one of the first places to close as virus cases began to emerge in January China's officialCGTN broadcaster says China has given assurances to the World Health Organization,external(WHO) that the body will be able to send a team to investigate the origins of the coronavirus ""as soon as possible"". Many experts think Covid-19 likely originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has been linked to early confirmed cases. While not a wet market in the strictest sense, reports suggest the market was selling wildlife, including snakes, porcupine and deer. After an initial cluster of cases connected to the market, the virus began spreading dramatically inside China, before reaching much of the world.The origins of the novel virus are unknown, but it most likely emerged in a bat, then made the leap to humans via another wild animal host. But Chinese media have increasingly beenamplifying suggestions that the virus might have been in other countries,externalbefore reaching
China. The country has sought to deflect blame for the outbreak from
countries like the US, and has often shared a message that the WHO views
China as taking an ""active response"" in handling Covid-19. The boss of NHS Wales has said doctors aren't seeing as many cases of flu this year, as a result of record levels of flu vaccination, people wearing masks and social distancing measures. There had been worries the annual flu season would add pressure to the NHS as it struggles with coronavirus, but Dr Andrew Goodall said the impact is ""very negligible"". He said levels of flu in Wales were similar to the low rates seen in the southern hemisphere earlier this year. Walesannounced its largest ever flu campaign in the summer, with free jabs offered to those who were shielding and the over-50s. However, last month the Welsh government said the over-50s ""will be vaccinated in a phased approach starting later this year""amid supply concerns. In England,30 million people are being offered a flu jabin the country's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date, with those over 50 eligible from 1 December. In Scotland, health workers, those with medical conditions, social care workers, families of shielders and over 55sare being offered the flu jab this year- though the roll-out has been called ""poorly managed"". Last week, Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swanndenied there was a shortage in the number of flu vaccinesordered. Cosy rooms packed with people, chatting, laughing, even singing, and sharing food and drink for hours are the norm for the festive season. But unfortunately, almost everything that's great for lifting our spirits at Christmas is also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. Here are a couple of things to think about when you're planning get-togethers. Are you sharing food and drink? Covid-19 can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated, which means you could be handing round the virus as well as the sprouts. In the US,the official advice for this year's Thanksgiving dinners,externalis to break totally with tradition by asking guests to bring their own food and drinks. It's also recommended that you control who's allowed in the kitchen, with one lucky person doing all the serving. Are the windows open? The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A report by government scientific advisers says,externalinfection risks can be increased by four times without proper ventilation. And if people feel too cold? Wear another layer. Read our full list of tips for reducing the risk here. Coronavirus-related crime is a global trend, clearly, as a man who tried to take money whileposing as a Covid-19 contact tracer in England has been jailed. Martin Payne visited houses in Stafford in September wearing a high-visibility bib and claimed to be collecting money for the NHS, Staffordshire Police said. The force said that, when challenged about identification, he walked away. Contact tracers notify, interview, and advise those who have been in contact with people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Payne, 30, has been jailed for six weeks, and also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£128. Two Texas men have been charged with attempting to sell 50 million non-existent medical face masks to a foreign government, according to the US Justice Department. Paschal Ngozi Eleanya, 46, and Arael Doolittle, 55, defrauded an unnamed foreign government out of more than $317m (Â£237m) - the total purchase price of the masks - according to the indictment. With their brokers, the pair allegedly negotiated a sales price for the masks that was five times the public list price of the masks, set by the manufacturers. The two expected to personally receive up to $275m as a result of the scheme, according to the charges. Authorities disrupted the sale before it could be completed but the foreign government had already wired the funds, court documents said. If convicted, Doolittle and Eleanya could face up to 25 years behind bars, and a maximum $250,000 (Â£187,000) fine. In the US ,the pandemic is going to keep many families apart this Thanksgiving, but Texas grandparents Missy and Barry Buchanan have come up with an ingenious way to stay connected with their family.

their children to expect something large in the mail. ""It just kinda takes the seriousness and sadness out,"" her daughter Mindy Whittington said. ""It's really hard not to laugh when you have 6ft parents behind you!"" Son Matthew Buchanan said his children had been having fun placing
their cardboard grandparents around the house and in the garden. ""It's not as gratifying as having a grandchild crawl up in your lap and being able to give them a hug,"" Missy said. ""But we're just thankful that everybody has been well and safe, and we will be together again around the table."" Ross County are one of the few SPFL clubs permitted to have up to 300 fans in attendance The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is calling for an emergency  meeting with Nicola Sturgeon to discuss a return of fans to Scottish football. The league body, which represents the top four leagues in Scottish football, wants the first minister to follow the UK government, which has outlined plansto allow up to 4,000 spectators into grounds in areas in England where coronavirus levels are low. As it stands, the number allowed in Scotland is 300 - and that is only for clubs in tier one. The SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster says if that continues, it will sound ""the death knell"" for some clubs in Scotland. He added: ""We are now calling on the first minister to do the right thing by Scotland's
hard-pressed football supporters. If it's good enough for English fans, it must
be good enough for Scottish fans."" However, Sturgeon has responded, sayingfootball cannot be treated ""in isolation"". It's been a busy day. If you're just catching up, these are the main UK headlines: The US recorded nearly 2,100 virus deaths on Tuesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project - the highest single-day total since May. As cases and hospital admissions surge across the country, experts have warned that deaths will follow. The daily caseload has not dipped below 100,000 in three weeks, and the US on Tuesday hit a record high in hospital admissions for the 15th consecutive day. The concerning upward trend is expected to worsen in coming days with the US Thanksgiving holiday, which typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. And while fewer Americans are travelling this year, the holiday typically calls for congregating and eating indoors with large groups - risky activities for Covid spread. Â© 2025 BBC.

hard-pressed football supporters. If it's good enough for English fans, it must
be good enough for Scottish fans."" However, Sturgeon has responded, sayingfootball cannot be treated ""in isolation"". It's been a busy day. If you're just catching up, these are the main UK headlines: The US recorded nearly 2,100 virus deaths on Tuesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project - the highest single-day total since May. As cases and hospital admissions surge across the country, experts have warned that deaths will follow. The daily caseload has not dipped below 100,000 in three weeks, and the US on Tuesday hit a record high in hospital admissions for the 15th consecutive day. The concerning upward trend is expected to worsen in coming days with the US Thanksgiving holiday, which typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. And while fewer Americans are travelling this year, the holiday typically calls for congregating and eating indoors with large groups - risky activities for Covid spread. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Jamaican immigrants welcomed by RAF officials at Tilbury Docks, Essex The Home Office unlawfully ignored warnings that changes to immigration rules would create ""serious injustices"" for the Windrush generation, a report by the equalities watchdog says. It found the ""hostile environment"" policy, designed to deter ""irregular"" migrants from settling, had harmed many people already living in the UK. The Windrush generation came from the Caribbean to the UK from 1948 to 1971. The Home Office said it was determined to ""right the wrongs suffered"" by them. Labour said ministers should be ""deeply ashamed"" of the report's findings. Windrush victims died before getting compensation Who are the Windrush generation? Windrush campaigner who faced deportation dies An estimated 500,000 people living in the UK make up the surviving members of the Windrush generation. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971, but thousands were children who had travelled on their parents' passports. Because of this, many were unable to prove they had the right to live in the country when hostile environment immigration policies - demanding the showing of documentation - began in 2012, under Theresa May as home secretary. This adversely affected their access to housing, banking, work, benefits, healthcare and driving, while many were threatened with deportation. The Equality and Human Rights Commission's (EHRC) report found a ""lack of organisation-wide commitment, including by senior leadership, to the importance of equality and the Home Office's obligations under the equality duty placed on government departments"". It added: ""Any action taken to record and respond to negative equality impacts was perfunctory, and therefore insufficient."" The report also said: ""From 2012, this [hostile environment] agenda accelerated the impact of decades of complex policy and practice based on a history of white and black immigrants being treated differently."" The EHRC recommended that, to ensure ""measurable action"", the Home Office should enter an agreement with it by the end of January 2021, involving ""preparing and implementing a plan"" of ""specific actions"" to ""avoid a future breach"". This should apply to its immigration work ""in respect of race and colour, and more broadly"", it said. The Home Office has agreed to enter an agreement with the EHRC. The commission's interim chair, Caroline Waters, said: ""The treatment of the Windrush generation as a result of hostile environment policies was a shameful stain on British history. ""It is unacceptable that equality legislation, designed to prevent an unfair or disproportionate impact on people from ethnic minorities and other groups, was effectively ignored in the creation and delivery of policies that had such profound implications for so many people's lives."" This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? In a statement, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Home Office permanent secretary Matthew Rycroft said they were ""determined to right the wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation and make amends for the institutional failings they faced, spanning successive governments over several decades"". They added that the department was already applying a ""a more rigorous approach to policy making"" and would ""increase openness to scrutiny, and create a more inclusive workforce"". It was also launching ""comprehensive training"" for all staff ""to ensure they understand and appreciate the history of migration and race in this country"", they said. But Satbir Singh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said campaigners had ""repeatedly warned the Home Office that their hostile environment policies would inevitably lead to serious discrimination and to the denial of rights, particularly for people of colour"". He added that ""successive home secretaries"" had ""ignored these warnings"" before the situation hit the headlines in 2018. For Labour, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""Ministers must work urgently to rectify this, including getting a grip of the Windrush compensation scheme, which has descended into an offensive mess, piling injustice upon injustice."" And shadow justice secretary David Lammy, who organised the cross-party letter referring the Home Office to the EHRC last year, said: ""Black Britons were detained, deported, denied healthcare, housing and employment by their own government because of the colour of their skin. ""Since the scandal broke, the Home Office has only paid lip service to its victims. It must now urgently rectify this gross injustice.""

"The advert was ""misleading"" in claiming passengers could expect to be over two metres from the driver, the ASA found An advertisement for London black cabs exaggerated how much the vehicles could reduce the spread of Covid-19, a watchdog has found. The radio advert featured a passenger's voice describing how the screen between her and the driver kept her safe. ""It's like being in my own bubble back here"", the promotion by the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) said. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the message was ""exaggerated"" and ""misleading"". The advert, which appeared on 9 July, continued: ""Sat on the back seat, they're over two metres from me. And with contactless payments, it's even safer. I'm a black cab customer and I'm confident I'm safe."" The ASA said this ""exaggerated the extent to which features of a London black cab would reduce the spread of Covid-19"". The LTDA said black cabs were one of the safer ways to travel during the pandemic, ""particularly when compared to some other forms of public transport - with the partition, plenty of space and contactless payment"". It added that the ASA's decision was ""another blow for black cab drivers, who are already suffering greatly as a result of the pandemic and fall in demand due to restrictions"". In a published ruling, the ASA said it: ""Considered consumers would understand from the ad that a passenger sat on the backseat of a London black cab could expect to be over two metres from the driver. ""We also considered that, in the context of the existing Covid-19 pandemic, the reference to being 'divided from the driver' and 'in my own bubble' would be understood as an indication that there would be complete separation from passenger and driver."" Investigations found that in two of the three models of London black cabs, drivers and passengers would be exactly two metres or more apart, the ASA said. ""However, the third model showed that the distance was either two metres or less,"" it added. The watchdog said the advert could not be aired again in the same form The watchdog acknowledged the intention of the advertiser to highlight particular features that were distinct to London black cabs. However, it ruled the ad must not appear again the same form. Steve McNamara of the LTDA said he had no intention of misleading consumers and that the advert will not be used again.

"Messages were daubed in white on the sides of the car A car has been driven into the gates of Angela Merkel's Federal Chancellery building in Berlin, German police say. A 54-year-old man was detained but the background to the incident was unclear. The Volkswagen car had messages daubed in white on both sides. One called for an end to ""globalisation politics"" while another referred to ""you damned killers of children and old people"". The incident came hours before Mrs Merkel held talks with regional leaders on extending Covid safety measures. It is not known if she was in the building at the time. Germany's ""lockdown light"" is expected to be extended until 20 December and the restrictions have prompted protests from Covid deniers and far-right activists. Water cannon breaks up Covid protest in Berlin However, there were indications that Wednesday morning's low-speed crash was not related to the protests. An interior ministry spokesman later confirmed German reports that the man detained had also driven into the gate in February 2014. On that occasion the car had different white slogans daubed on the side. One called for an end to climate change while another read simply: ""Nicole, I love you."" Police said they were trying to establish whether the driver on Wednesday had a psychological condition or a particular motive. A government spokesperson said at no point was there any risk to the chancellor or anyone else. The gate was only slightly damaged in the incident Mrs Merkel is discussing a draft proposal agreed by Germany's 16 state premiers to keep hotels and restaurants shut and limit private gatherings to five people (not including children under 14). A special Christmas exemption from 23 December to 1 January would allow gatherings of up to 10 people. German health officials reported 410 deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday - the highest daily number since the pandemic began. However, Germany has seen proportionally far fewer fatalities than other Western European countries, with a total of 14,771. Germany has a large protest movement against Covid-19 measures, including many anti-vaccination activists. Protesters rallied in the centre of Berlin last week close to the parliament building, the Reichstag, before the protest was broken up by police. This video can not be played Police used water cannon after repeatedly telling protesters to disperse Angela Merkel, 66, has just marked 15 years as chancellor and is planning to step down from the post next year. She does not live in the chancellery but instead leads a modest life in a Berlin flat with her husband, Prof Joachim Sauer. Her Christian Democrat (CDU) party is doing well in the opinion polls, partly because of her handling of the pandemic. The government agreed on Wednesday to hold parliamentary elections on 26 September 2021 but the race to succeed Mrs Merkel as the CDU's candidate for chancellor is still to run. The CDU will hold an online congress in January 2021 when they are expected to select a new party leadership.

"This video can not be played Biden: ""We've just got to keep the border open"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland President-elect Joe Biden has said America does not want a ""guarded border"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland following Brexit. He said it had taken a lot of hard work to reach a settlement on the island of Ireland, ending decades of conflict. The UK government has threatened to overrule the Brexit withdrawal agreement which committed it to keeping the border open. Mr Biden has previously said Brexit must not endanger the peace process. Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday, Mr Biden said: ""We do not want a guarded border. We've worked too long to get Ireland worked out. ""The idea of having a border north and south once again being closed is just not right, we've just got to keep the border open."" Mr Biden - who hasunveiled officials for six important posts as he prepares to take office- said he had spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and the French government. Government suffers Lords defeat over Brexit bill Biden warning for UK over post-Brexit trade deal Progress in tough areas of Brexit talks - EU chief Mr Biden - an Irish American - has previously said that any UK-US post-Brexit trade dealhad to be ""contingent"" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement. Those comments came after the government put forward legislation that would give it the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of Brexit made earlier this year. The Internal Market Bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after 1 January - when the post-Brexit transition period runs out. This video can not be played Biden: ""Itâs a team that reflects the fact that America is back"" The president-elect was quick to criticise the legislation when it was first published, warning that the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland ""cannot become a casualty of Brexit"". Earlier this month, theHouse of Lords voted to remove a section of the billthat would allow ministers to break international law, but the government has said it would reinstate these clauses when the bill returns to the House of Commons next month. The UK and EU are still working to strike a deal to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. The President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said last week thatprogress had been made on some issuesbut there were still ""some metres to the finish line"" to reach agreement. Meanwhile, a senior Democrat with close links to Mr Biden's incoming administration has criticisedthe UK government's plans to cut its overseas aid budget. John Podesta, a former adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, told the BBC the reduction of the spending target was ""extremely unfortunate"".

"People have been urged to be cautious of the risk of spreading coronavirus when rules are relaxed over Christmas. Up to three households will be allowed to stay together and form a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, as agreed by all four UK nations. A scientific adviser to the government said the relaxation of rules amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". Meanwhile, it is expected most areas of England will be placed in the middle tier of atoughened three-tier system. Details on what will happen when the current lockdown ends on 2 December will be announced on Thursday. The decision will be based on a number of factors including case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and pressure on local NHS services. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says a ""handful"" of areas will be in the lightest regime of limits - tier one - but most of the country is likely to be in either tier two or three. She said London is expected to be placed in tier two. The measures for Christmas will see travel restrictions across the four nations, and between tiers and levels, lifted to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK. Anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland may travel on the 22 and 28 December, but otherwise travel to and from bubbles should be done between the 23 and 27. People will not be able to get together with others from more than two other households, and once a bubble is formed, it must not be changed or be extended further. The guidance says a bubble of three households would be able to stay overnight at each other's home but would not be able to visit hospitality, theatres or retail settings. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Christmas rules 'not an instruction to meet up' Three households can mix over Christmas in UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told people to use ""personal judgement"" on whether to visit elderly relatives. In a video message from Downing Street,,externalthe prime minister described the agreement as a ""special, time-limited dispensation"", saying: ""This year means Christmas will be different."" Mr Johnson said people must consider the risks of who to form a bubble with and whether or not to visit elderly or vulnerable relatives, adding: ""Many of us are longing to spend time with family and friends... And yet we can't afford to throw caution to the wind."" He added: ""'Tis the season to be jolly but 'tis also the season to be jolly careful.""

It comes as the government recorded another 18,213 Covid cases in the UK. Figures also showed a further 696 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths is the highest since the start of May and compares to 608 recorded on Wednesday. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says many of those who have died are likely to have picked up an infection before the current lockdown measures were put in place. He said a rise in the death toll would not be expected to continue into December because the average number of daily cases is now falling and hospital admissions are levelling off. A mid-week rise can also be down to delays in deaths being reported over the weekend. First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said the ministers agreed they had to ease the rules because people would have flouted restrictions - creating further risk - if they were told Christmas had been ""cancelled"". Ministers were shown behavioural science evidence that ""too many people simply would not have been prepared to have gone along with such an instruction"", he told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. Mr Drakeford also saida UK-wide approach to coronavirus rulesafter Christmas was needed. Nicola Sturgeon has said guidance for people in Scotland is still being finalised and will be issued on Thursday, but that her government will not be ""encouraging"" people to meet up. ""The expectation should be that the guidance will probably look to tighten around the edges rather than further expand and that will be true with the travel window of opportunity as well - we want to limit that window, not expand it,"" the first minister said. Published guidance for England,externalgives further details of the rules for 23 to 27 December: You can form a different Christmas bubble from the people you live with normally - so you can choose to stay with different people for the five-day period You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line withthe rules for the tier in which you are staying,external Children under the age of 18 whose parents do not live together may be part of both parents' Christmas bubbles Existing support bubbles count as one household towards the three household limit Students are considered to be part of the household to which they have returned Prof Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, and a member of the government's Sage committee, told BBC Newsnight allowing families to meet up over Christmas amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". He said it would ""definitely lead to increase[d] transmission and likely lead to third wave of infections with hospitals being overrun, and more unnecessary deaths."" Prof Hayward said while you cannot ban Christmas, he called for clearer messaging to families about the ""dangers"" of socialising and inter-generational mixing. This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Gavin Terry, head of policy at the Alzheimer's Society, said thousands of relatives would be in ""complete despair"" at government guidance which says only care home residents of working age should be allowed to leave their care homes to visit family, due to the increased risk of exposure to the virus. ""After eight harrowing months filled with devastation and tragic loss of life, the announcement that many care home residents will be facing Christmas alone is just heartbreaking,"" he said, calling for further testing to allow for more visits. Meanwhile, Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, called on ministers to publish evidence for its Christmas bubble rules, which would ""inflict unnecessary pain and irreversible damage on our sector"". Local rules mean many pubs and restaurants - such as those in England's tier three or Scotland's level four - will remain closed during the festive period, irrespective of the Christmas change.

"Gareth Smith set up MyMaskFit after wife Valerie, pictured, struggled to find a mask to fit her A nurse who struggled to get face masks to fit her has inspired the design of custom-fitted ones for frontline healthcare workers. Gareth Smith set up MyMaskFit after his wife, intensive care nurse Valerie Bednar, struggled to find a filtering face mask (FFP) to fit her. Based in Swansea, the firm is working with a number of UK universities. Ms Bednar said the masks are reusable so will reduce stress among staff and be better for the environment. ""I'm one of the people the standard disposable FFP3 masks doesn't fit my face,"" said Ms Bednar, who worked at Morriston Hospital in Swansea at the start of the pandemic but is currently on maternity leave. ""It was just the stress of trying to do what you need to do - the reason we go into nursing is to take care of people, and then the added level of 'am I being safe and do I have the protection that I need?' ""That uncertainty I think was stressful for everyone."" This video can not be played Intensive care nurse Valerie Bednar hopes the reusable masks will cut down on PPE being discarded The company hopes to further develop a prototype designed by researchers at Birmingham University and King's College London. Swansea University's School of Engineering will help test and manufacture the face mask, which it is hoped will be available to the NHS in Wales in the new year. MyMaskFit said it is aiming to become the first to make a fully custom-fitted, reusable, filtering face piece masks made to a medical grade standard in the UK. A mould for a face seal is created using a scan of someone's face ""We want to make a reusable mask so that staff can feel confident when they come in for their shift it will be there,"" Ms Bednar explained. ""You're involved in cleaning it and owning it - all of that gives people the sense of security and protection."" To speed up the design process and to achieve a seal which will fit anyone, the company has launched an app which will scan the face and send the data for a mould to be created and 3D printed. MyMaskFit technology director Paul Perera said current masks vary widely in terms of design. ""There is an inevitable variation in the shape of human faces, and BMA surveys have shown that over 20% of hospital doctors have to try one or more masks to find one that fits,"" he said. Clear face masks trialled to 'greatly benefit' patients Coronavirus doctor's diary: 'We are first-hand witnesses of this devastation' Welsh businesses 'essential' to PPE supply Mr Perera said the firm was also working on a face mask which is made with ""renewable plastics that are transparent"" to aid communication. He added: ""We're also using a copper, embedded into the plastics, which kills the virus. Therefore the masks can be reusable and therefore more sustainable for the environment."" The initial manufacturing process and further testing of the prototypes will take place at Swansea University.

"Millions of Americans are travelling home to celebrate Thanksgiving, despite warnings from health officials amid a surge of Covid-19 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has told Americans to stay at home and celebrate only with those they live with Hard-hit regions have reimposed restrictions with El Paso, Texas announcing a night-time curfew People across the UK are being urged to think carefully before they take advantage of the relaxation of restrictions on Christmas Government adviser Prof Andrew Hayward says family gatherings are a ""recipe for regret"" for people UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the UK's ""economic emergency"" has ""only just begun"" as he sets out spending plan The number of unemployed people in the UK is expected to surge to 2.6 million by mid 2021 Nearly 60 million cases have been confirmed globally with around 1.4 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Hugo Bachega and Marie Jackson That's all for now. Today's live updates were the work of Penny Spiller, George Bowden, Hazel Shearing, Katie Wright, John Hand, Hugo Bachega and Marie Jackson. Thanks for joining us. We'll be back on Thursday with all the very latest. It's been a big day of news and we're almost done for the day. Before we go though, here's what the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said about coronavirus in his Spending Review:  And, in other coronavirus news: The government has recorded another 696 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, an increase of 88 on yesterdayâs daily figure. It is the highest daily figure reported since 5 May. The government also recorded a further 18,213 cases of the virus, up 6,914 on Tuesdayâs daily figure. While Americans prepare for their Thanksgiving holiday, cases, hospital admissions and virus deaths tick up across the country. As of Wednesday afternoon, the US has recorded more than 12.6 million infections and more than 260,000 deaths. Here's what else you need you know: Boris Epshteyn (R) is pictured with Rudy Giuliani at a press conference last week. Another member of President Donald Trump's legal team, Boris Epshteyn, has tested positive for coronavirus. ""I am experiencing mild symptoms and am following all appropriate protocols, including quarantining and contact tracing,"" Epshteyn wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Epshteyn was seen at a press conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters last week with White House aide Andrew Giuliani, son of Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Andrew announced last week he had tested positive. Epshteyn has also spent time with the elder Giuliani, who is now leading efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Dozens of people close to President Donald Trump - including First Lady Melania Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie - have tested positive for Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. The president himself tested positive in October.  Two weeks ago Scarborough had the second highest infection rate in England Coronavirus cases in one of England's worst affected areas have more than halved in two weeks. On 11 November, Scarborough's infection rate stood at 611 - the second highest in England.It has now fallen to 296 per 100,000. Cases across North Yorkshire have also declined with the average for the county now 196 cases, lower than the national average of 207. One of the county's health officials, Richard Webb, told a briefing that falling infection rates had given the region some optimism that it could escape the tightest controls set to be announced by the government on Thursday. North Yorkshire was one of the few parts of northern England to remain in tier one - the lowest tier of restrictions - prior to the national lockdown which began on 5 November. England will move to a tougher version of tiered coronavirus restrictions when the lockdown ends on 2 December.Here's a reminder of the new rules. Taxis blocked key roads in Madrid US President-elect Joe Biden will deliver remarks from Wilmington, Delaware, later ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The Democrat is expected to discuss the shared sacrifices of Americans during the approaching holiday season, as coronavirus outbreaks surge across the country. On Monday, Donald Trump finally agreed to allow the formal transition process to begin, nearly three weeks after the presidential election. Biden had previously warned that a lack of co-ordination - particularly on coronavirus policy - meant that ""people may die"". But so far, the Trump White House has been ""sincere"" in its transition to the new administration, Biden said on Tuesday. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty says that being active is ""central to health"" but many people have reduced their levels of exercise during the pandemic. He said some people had done more exercise during the crisis but for many, coronavirus has made it harder. Speaking at a summit for ukactive, which represents many in the fitness industry, he said: ""It is very important that we get people who have got out of the habit of regular exercise back in the situation where they are doing so, and encourage others who have taken up exercise in a way they previously hadn't, to continue to do so. ""We need to think this through because exercise is so central. Exercise is the single simplest and most important thing people can do to improve their physical and mental health."" Restrictions in healthcare settings during the pandemic have added to the ""trauma and distress"" already endured by many women who have miscarried, a charity boss has said. Clea Harmer, of stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, said coronavirus rules have meant women have had to go to hospital and grieve for their unborn babies alone. ""Attending scans and appointments can be really difficult, especially if you have had a miscarriage before, or your baby has died before, and often the scan is the place where you were told your baby has died,"" she said. ""To be in that position on your own, without your partner there... there are heartbreaking stories of mothers being told on their own and having to go out to the car park or back home and tell their partner themselves."" She added that although the NHS has issued guidance for hospitals to allow women to bring their partners to appointments, the picture is ""very mixed across the country"". Her comments come afterthe Duchess of Sussex revealed she had a miscarriagein July, writing in a New York Times article of feeling ""an almost unbearable grief"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Wuhan's Huanan Seafood market was one of the first places to close as virus cases began to emerge in January China's officialCGTN broadcaster says China has given assurances to the World Health Organization,external(WHO) that the body will be able to send a team to investigate the origins of the coronavirus ""as soon as possible"". Many experts think Covid-19 likely originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has been linked to early confirmed cases. While not a wet market in the strictest sense, reports suggest the market was selling wildlife, including snakes, porcupine and deer. After an initial cluster of cases connected to the market, the virus began spreading dramatically inside China, before reaching much of the world.The origins of the novel virus are unknown, but it most likely emerged in a bat, then made the leap to humans via another wild animal host. But Chinese media have increasingly beenamplifying suggestions that the virus might have been in other countries,externalbefore reaching
China. The country has sought to deflect blame for the outbreak from
countries like the US, and has often shared a message that the WHO views
China as taking an ""active response"" in handling Covid-19. The boss of NHS Wales has said doctors aren't seeing as many cases of flu this year, as a result of record levels of flu vaccination, people wearing masks and social distancing measures. There had been worries the annual flu season would add pressure to the NHS as it struggles with coronavirus, but Dr Andrew Goodall said the impact is ""very negligible"". He said levels of flu in Wales were similar to the low rates seen in the southern hemisphere earlier this year. Walesannounced its largest ever flu campaign in the summer, with free jabs offered to those who were shielding and the over-50s. However, last month the Welsh government said the over-50s ""will be vaccinated in a phased approach starting later this year""amid supply concerns. In England,30 million people are being offered a flu jabin the country's largest flu-immunisation scheme to date, with those over 50 eligible from 1 December. In Scotland, health workers, those with medical conditions, social care workers, families of shielders and over 55sare being offered the flu jab this year- though the roll-out has been called ""poorly managed"". Last week, Northern Ireland's health minister Robin Swanndenied there was a shortage in the number of flu vaccinesordered. Cosy rooms packed with people, chatting, laughing, even singing, and sharing food and drink for hours are the norm for the festive season. But unfortunately, almost everything that's great for lifting our spirits at Christmas is also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. Here are a couple of things to think about when you're planning get-togethers. Are you sharing food and drink? Covid-19 can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated, which means you could be handing round the virus as well as the sprouts. In the US,the official advice for this year's Thanksgiving dinners,externalis to break totally with tradition by asking guests to bring their own food and drinks. It's also recommended that you control who's allowed in the kitchen, with one lucky person doing all the serving. Are the windows open? The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A report by government scientific advisers says,externalinfection risks can be increased by four times without proper ventilation. And if people feel too cold? Wear another layer. Read our full list of tips for reducing the risk here. Coronavirus-related crime is a global trend, clearly, as a man who tried to take money whileposing as a Covid-19 contact tracer in England has been jailed. Martin Payne visited houses in Stafford in September wearing a high-visibility bib and claimed to be collecting money for the NHS, Staffordshire Police said. The force said that, when challenged about identification, he walked away. Contact tracers notify, interview, and advise those who have been in contact with people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Payne, 30, has been jailed for six weeks, and also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£128. Two Texas men have been charged with attempting to sell 50 million non-existent medical face masks to a foreign government, according to the US Justice Department. Paschal Ngozi Eleanya, 46, and Arael Doolittle, 55, defrauded an unnamed foreign government out of more than $317m (Â£237m) - the total purchase price of the masks - according to the indictment. With their brokers, the pair allegedly negotiated a sales price for the masks that was five times the public list price of the masks, set by the manufacturers. The two expected to personally receive up to $275m as a result of the scheme, according to the charges. Authorities disrupted the sale before it could be completed but the foreign government had already wired the funds, court documents said. If convicted, Doolittle and Eleanya could face up to 25 years behind bars, and a maximum $250,000 (Â£187,000) fine. In the US ,the pandemic is going to keep many families apart this Thanksgiving, but Texas grandparents Missy and Barry Buchanan have come up with an ingenious way to stay connected with their family.

Ross County are one of the few SPFL clubs permitted to have up to 300 fans in attendance The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) is calling for an emergency  meeting with Nicola Sturgeon to discuss a return of fans to Scottish football. The league body, which represents the top four leagues in Scottish football, wants the first minister to follow the UK government, which has outlined plansto allow up to 4,000 spectators into grounds in areas in England where coronavirus levels are low. As it stands, the number allowed in Scotland is 300 - and that is only for clubs in tier one. The SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster says if that continues, it will sound ""the death knell"" for some clubs in Scotland. He added: ""We are now calling on the first minister to do the right thing by Scotland's
hard-pressed football supporters. If it's good enough for English fans, it must
be good enough for Scottish fans."" However, Sturgeon has responded, sayingfootball cannot be treated ""in isolation"". It's been a busy day. If you're just catching up, these are the main UK headlines: The US recorded nearly 2,100 virus deaths on Tuesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project - the highest single-day total since May. As cases and hospital admissions surge across the country, experts have warned that deaths will follow. The daily caseload has not dipped below 100,000 in three weeks, and the US on Tuesday hit a record high in hospital admissions for the 15th consecutive day. The concerning upward trend is expected to worsen in coming days with the US Thanksgiving holiday, which typically heralds the busiest week for travel in the US. And while fewer Americans are travelling this year, the holiday typically calls for congregating and eating indoors with large groups - risky activities for Covid spread. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played French lockdown highlights small business struggles (November 2020 report) France will begin to ease its strict coronavirus restrictions this weekend, allowing non-essential shops to reopen, President Emmanuel Macron has said. People will also be able to share ""moments with the family"" over the Christmas period, Mr Macron announced. But he said bars and restaurants would have to remain closed until 20 January. France has reported more than 2.2 million cases and more than 50,000 confirmed coronavirus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. In a televised address on Tuesday evening, Mr Macron said the country had passed the peak of the second wave of virus infections. He said that the bulk of lockdown restrictions would be eased from 15 December for the festive period, with cinemas reopening and general travel restrictions lifted, as long as new infections were at 5,000 a day or less. On Monday, France reported 4,452 daily Covid-19 infections - its lowest tally since 28 September. The latest seven-day rolling average for new infections in France is reported to be 21,918. That figure peaked at 54,440 on 7 November. How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Covid vaccine update: When will one be ready? Mr Macron said the recent news of successful vaccine trials offered ""a glimmer of hope"" and that France would aim to begin vaccinations against Covid-19 ""at the end of December or at the beginning of January"", starting with the elderly and most vulnerable. The French president said the situation would be reviewed on 20 January, and if infections remained low, bars and restaurants would then be permitted to reopen. Universities would also be able to accept students again. However, if the situation had worsened, he said he would look at options to avoid triggering a third wave. ""We must do everything to avoid a third wave, do everything to avoid a third lockdown,"" Mr Macron said. He later tweeted to say that all businesses forced to remain closed during the restrictions, such as restaurants, bars and sports halls, would have the choice of receiving up to â¬10,000 (Â£8,900) from a ""solidarity fund"" or the payment of 20% of their turnover. He said that France's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next year because the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. However, he said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and provide an update in the coming days. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Mr Macron said the lockdown would be replaced by a nationwide curfew between 21:00 and 07:00, except on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. France has been under a second national lockdown since the beginning of November. People have only been permitted to leave home to go to work, buy essential goods, seek medical help or exercise for one hour a day. Anyone going outside must carry a written statement justifying their journey. While all non-essential shops, restaurants and bars have been shut, schools and crÃ¨ches have remained open. Social gatherings have been banned. This video can not be played Empty street in Montmartre, Paris Measures to deal with coronavirus outbreaks remain in place across Europe, but a reduction in daily reported cases in some areas - coupled with the reported success of a number of vaccines - has led countries to revisit their restrictions. Some of the latest developments include: Along with France, politicians from other nations - includingItalianPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte - have said that Europe's ski resorts should close over the winter and that it is too risky to spend the Christmas holiday on the snow The developers ofRussia's main coronavirus vaccine - Sputnik V - have said that it is proving to be up to 95% effective. They have also said that it will be cheaper - and easier to store and transport - than its competitors in the US. Some critics have suggested the vaccine is being rushed through, but Moscow rejects this AustriaandSpainboth announced vaccination plans. Nursing home residents and workers in Spain will be first in line to be vaccinated, while in Austria elderly, at-risk groups and health professionals will be prioritised.

"The USS John S McCain was involved in a deadly collision with a tanker in 2017 Russia says one of its warships caught and chased off a US Navy destroyer after it entered territorial waters in the Sea of Japan on Tuesday. Moscow accused the USS John S McCain of travelling 2km (1.2 miles) across its maritime border in Peter the Great Gulf and says it threatened to ram the ship. The US warship then left the area, according to Russia. However, the US Navy denied any wrongdoing and said its ship had not been ""expelled"". The incident took place on Tuesday in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, a body of water bordered by Japan, Russia and the Koreas. According to the Russian defence ministry, its Pacific Fleet destroyer the Admiral Vinogradov used an international communications channel to warn the US ship about ""the possibility of using ramming to get the intruder out of the territorial waters"". ""The Russian Federation's statement about this mission is false,"" said a spokesman for the US Navy's 7th Fleet, Lt Joe Keiley. ""USS John S McCain was not 'expelled' from any nation's territory."" He said the US ""would ""never bow in intimidation or be coerced into accepting illegitimate maritime claims, such as those made by the Russian Federation"". Such incidents at sea are rare, although the Admiral Vinogradov was also involved in a near-collision with a US cruiser in the East China Sea last year. Both Russia and the US exchanged blame for that incident. This video can not be played The crew of the USS Chancellorsville had a close-up view of the Russian warship Admiral Vinogradov in June 2019 The two countries regularly accuse the other of dangerous military manoeuvres - at sea and in the air.

"The government has scrapped plans to relax Covid rules at Christmas for London and much of south-east England, where tier four restrictions will now apply. In other regions of England - in tiers one to three - Christmas bubbles will now only be allowed on 25 December. Similar plans have been announced in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England's tier four areas, residents will only be allowed to celebrate Christmas with members of their own household and support bubbles. They will not be allowed to travel to other tiers to see family and friends. More parts of south-east and eastern Englandwill be placed in tier fourfrom 00:01 GMT on Saturday 26 December. Residents will be asked to stay at home and all non-essential shops must close. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live In areas in tiers one, two and three Christmas bubbles will no longer be across five days. Instead, three households coming together will now only be allowed on Christmas Day. People in these tiers are also being asked to stay local. They will not be allowed to host people who live in a tier four area. InWales(two households) andScotland(three households up to a maximum of eight people), Christmas bubbles will also only be allowed on 25 December. In both countries, people are being advised not to form a Christmas bubble, even though they are permitted. In Scotland, travel to and from other parts of the UK will not be allowed over the festive period. Northern Irelandhas also cut its Christmas bubble window to a choice of one day between 23 and 27 December. It is being flexible to make allowances for people who are working on Christmas Day. Bubbles can meet each other: In each other's homes At a place of worship In an outdoor public space or garden In England, the government advises people to avoid travelling to other areas and only to stay overnight with someone else if absolutely necessary. You cannot go to the pub with members of your Christmas bubble. In England, if you have formed asupport bubblewith another household, that counts as one household. In Scotland,guidance,externalsays any Christmas bubble should contain no more than one ""extended household"". People who are self-isolatingshould not join a Christmas bubble. If someone tests positive, or develops coronavirus symptoms up to 48 hours after the Christmas bubble last met, everyone has to self-isolate. Under-18s whose parents live apart can join two Christmas bubbles, so they can see both parents without being counted as part of another household.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced how much money the government will spend on hospitals, schools and other public services over the next financial year, starting in April 2021. In his Spending Review, he alsounveiled a new set of official forecasts for the economy,which are predicting the biggest economic decline more than 300 years. The Spending Review determines how much is spent on public services. So anyone who ever visits an NHS hospital, or goes to school, or uses roads or any of the other service provided by government will be directly affected. It's also a chance for the government to deliver on some of the promises it made at the last election, such as improving the economy of less wealthy areas of the UK. The Spending Review also included details of public sector workers' pay next year. One million NHS workers and anyone earning less than Â£24,000 will be given a pay rise. But everyone else, including police officers, fire fighters and teachers, will have a pay freeze, The chancellor's decisions will affect how much the government borrows next year and beyond. The cost of paying back those debts, or at least paying the interest on them, will fall on future taxpayers for years to come. Will teachers get a pay rise in the Spending Review? Usually a Spending Review would cover a period of three or four years to give government departments enough certainty to make long-term plans. The coronavirus pandemic disrupted so many aspects of life this year that long-term planning is particularly difficult. So the government decided that this Spending Review would only cover the 12 months from April 2021. Normally the amount of money a chancellor would allocate in a Spending Review would be strictly limited by how much they would be prepared for the government to borrow. But this year the pandemic has caused government borrowing to skyrocket. With businesses closed and workers on furlough, the government is taking less money in taxes. And it's spending more than planned on measures to fight the virus and support the economy. Before the pandemic, the government expected to borrow around Â£55bn this financial year. Seven months in, the government has already borrowed Â£215bn, and the total is expected to hit Â£394bn this year, the highest level seen in peacetime. The government can't keep borrowing that amount of money for very long. So the chancellor has to balance the fight against coronavirus with the need to keep borrowing to manageable levels. Among the major decisions in the 2020 Spending Review were: The NHS in England will get an extra Â£6.3bn to help meet the government's commitment to get the NHS budget to Â£148.5bn by 2023-24 Schools in England have been promised an extra Â£2.2bn in 2021-22, taking total spending to Â£49.8bn Defence will get an extra Â£16.5bn over four years The government's target for overseas aid spending will be cut from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%, A new Â£4bn levelling up fund for upgrading infrastructure such as roads A full list of measures ishere. The government has already announced an increase in defence spending Alongside the Spending Review, the Office for Budget Responsibility, which keeps tabs on government spending, unveiled a new set of government forecasts which were dismal. It estimates that the economy will shrink by 11.3% this year, the worst figure for more than 300 years. The unemployment rate will peak at 7.5% next year, with 2.6 million people out of work. And the long-term damage to the economy will be severe - even in 2025, national income will be 3% lower than expected before the crisis began. That will present the chancellor with a stark choice in coming years - cut spending, raise taxes, or allow the government to keep on borrowing. Many announcements in the Spending Review only apply to England. Much of government activity elsewhere in the UK is controlled by the devolved administrations - the Scottish government, Welsh government and Northern Ireland Executive. If the chancellor spends extra money on a service which is covered by devolution, such as education, the devolved administrations get extra money too. The idea is that a Â£100 increase in spending per person in England on education, for instance, should be matched with an extra Â£100 per person for each of the devolved administrations to spend as they choose. The way money gets allocated is set out by the Barnett formula,named after Lord Barnett, the politician who devised it in the late 1970s.

"Cosy rooms packed with people chatting, laughing and sharing food and drink are traditional at this time of year. Unfortunately, they are also ideal for fuelling the pandemic. Now, plans for coronavirus restrictions to be eased for Christmas have been scaled back, or abandoned in areas with the toughest restrictions. So, for people still planning to meet others - subject to the rules - here are some of the key things to help avoid giving the unwelcome gift of coronavirus. No-one will be popular for saying this, but the evidence is clear - the larger the group, the greater the risk. If it was summer and we could meet outside, where the virus gets dispersed in fresh air, it would be less of a problem. But it's winter, so everyone's inside. And the more people who are involved, the greater the likelihood that someone may be a carrier of the virus - maybe without realising, as they have no symptoms. A study by Sage,,externalthe government's science advisory panel, concludes that if you double the number of people getting together, the odds of infection increase fourfold. It also matters how many different households are meeting, as this increases the potential for the virus to spread. The rules have changed. Intier four areas(that's London and much of the south-east of England), you can't meet people from other households indoors unless they're part of an existing support bubble. And you aren't allowed to travel to other tiers to meet family and friends. In the other tiers in England, up to three households can meet (subject to social distancing rules), but for Christmas Day only. In Scotland, up to three households (a maximum of eight people, not including children under 12) can only meet on 25 December. In Wales the limit is two households for Christmas Day only. In Northern Ireland, up to three households can meet for one day only between 23-27 December. What are the new rules on mixing at Christmas? A modern browser with Javascript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. Passing around dishes and bottles, encouraging everyone to tuck in, is one of the most natural instincts at Christmas. But coronavirus can survive on surfaces, possibly for several hours, so plates and cutlery can become contaminated. The same applies to board games where everyone's touching the dice and the cards, soSage recommends playing quiz-style games instead,external. It suggests keeping hand sanitiser by the front door and urging everyone arriving to use it. Above all, don't hug granny. ""Elbow bumps or air greetings"" are a safer alternative. Seven things that may be different this Christmas Amid the excitement of reunions, it's perfectly normal for voices to be raised. Add a little alcohol, and maybe have a TV or music on as well, and things can get even noisier. But if someone is infected, the louder they speak, the more virus they release. A lot of research,externalshows that when voices are projected, people emit more tiny droplets of the kind that can carry the coronavirus. So the advice is to avoid singing and dancing. At the very least, try keep those activities quiet or consider wearing masks. Maybe the safest option is to hum Silent Night. Popping in for a quick visit is safer than lingering over dinner for several hours. Researchers say an event's duration has a big impact on the infection risk. In March, more than 50 members of a US choir were confirmed or suspected of being infected, after a two-and-a-half-hour rehearsal session. Scientists reckoned,externalif it had lasted less than an hour, the number of infections would have been reduced by more than half. Prof Cath Noakes, one of the study's authors, says the problem is that tiny particles carrying the virus - known as aerosols - can accumulate in the air: ""There is growing evidence that if you're in a poorly-ventilated space for a long period of time with people who are infected, you may breathe in those aerosols and that might be one of the routes of infection,"" she said. So the recommendation is to plan for shorter events and to try to maximise quality time together. The obvious answer is: ""Of course not, it's too cold outside."" But fresh air dilutes any virus that might be lingering in a crowded room. A Sage report,externalsays the infection risk can be four times greater without proper ventilation. And in this context, ""ventilation"" doesn't mean having fans blowing the air around, but a flow of air from outside. Open up for 10-20 minutes every hour, the report says. According to Prof Noakes, people must dream up creative new options for Christmas That could range from meeting virtually on Zoom, going for a walk, or even delaying big gatherings until next summer. If you are having a meal indoors, try to minimise contact with others for 7-14 days beforehand. Work out a plan for how to minimise the risks - and maybe put up signs or labels to remind people. Also try to avoid having people from different households sitting opposite each other, because speaking face-to-face is another possible route for transmission. The smaller the home, the harder these measures will be, the Sage advisers acknowledge. And laying on hand sanitiser and paying for additional heating while the windows are open may not be affordable for many people. But any social setting increases the risk of infection, says Prof Noakes, and we will have to compromise and do things in a different way. ""The virus doesn't know it's Christmas,"" she says. ""It's just a virus and it thrives on human contact."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one?

"""We see the data every month, and the shock that our economy is facing at the moment is significant"" - Rishi Sunak. On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak begins setting out plans for what he hopes will be an economy beyond Covid-19. This Spending Review - detailing the money government departments will get for things like the NHS, education, roads, and police - only covers the financial year 2021-22. It will also set out money for the devolved administrations Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In normal times, reviews cover three or four years. But such is the economic uncertainty that this look-ahead has been limited to the next 12 months. Even so, Mr Sunak will point to the direction of travel for spending (and possibly tax rises) for future years. Few reviews can have been so anticipated. Here's what to watch out for. The economic shock has left the UK poorer. By the end of this year the economy is expected to be at least 10% smaller than pre-pandemic. Alongside the Spending Review, Mr Sunak will disclose latest forecasts for the economy and public finances from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Earlier this year, the OBR forecast a 13% contraction. While it is not expected to be that bad, the shrinkage will still likely be in the double-digits, and with public borrowing topping Â£350bn - something not seen in peacetime. A difficulty for the chancellor is that big tranches of public service spending have already been made. Despite that, some areas will reportedly get more: NHS England, schools and defence. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), some two-thirds of public service spending has been pre-determined. The key question is whether the remaining third is enough to go round. The answer is almost certainly not. The IFS thinks ""unprotected"" services such as the courts, prisons or local government are vulnerable to cuts. The overseas aid budget is also in the line of fire. Teachers are among workers who could face a pay freeze Saving, not spending, will dominate Wednesday's agenda. And one of the biggest savings could be a public sector pay freeze. It would be hugely controversial. Media leaks last week claimed Mr Sunak wants a freeze for everyone except frontline NHS staff. That won't go down well with the police, teachers, civil servants or anyone who thinks they've done their bit to ensure the public sector keeps going in tough times. Even a return to a 1% cap is likely to be fiercely resisted. Some commentators think the media reports were Treasury kite-flying. Even so, in the summer, Mr Sunak suggested that as private sector pay had taken a huge hit, in the ""interest of fairness"" the public sector's 5.4 million workers should share some pain. Trouble is, relative to pay in the private sector, public sector pay has fallen to its lowest level in decades, according to the IFS. Only during the pandemic has public sector pay performed more strongly than in the private sector. Union leaders have already warned of industrial action to ensure members' pay does not fall further behind. There is speculation some government operations could be relocated from London Many promises have been thrown off-course because of the pandemic, and the government will be keen to get its north-south levelling up agenda back on track as soon as possible. Infrastructure spending is key to this. The north has long complained that the Treasury methodology used to calculate the cost-benefit of spending money on big projects is inherently biased towards London and the rest of the south east. So, expect some changes to these calculations. And watch out for whether any spending promises are new money, or simply projects brought forward. To underline his commitment to spend on big long-term projects, there is talk that Mr Sunak could publish details of a National Infrastructure Strategy and a Research and Development Strategy. And in a symbolic move that levelling up is more than a question of infrastructure, the Financial Times has reported that the chancellor could also announce that parts of government could relocate from the capital - with the Treasury leading the way. Tax hikes are inevitable, but rises too soon will choke off recovery, economists say While Wednesday will be about spending and borrowing, at some point the chancellor will have to decide how it will be paid for. He will start to address this in next March's Budget, although most economic commentators feel the economy will still be too fragile for major tax rises. It is possible that, with the success of a Covid vaccine, the economy could bounce back, limiting the need for big rises. However, Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC that four or five years down the road he still expects the economy to be about 4%-5% smaller than before the pandemic. Rein in spending and raise taxes too early, and recovery will be choked off. Leave it too late, and the public finances will spin out of control. ""It's a fine judgement,"" said Mr Johnson. Both the chancellor and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have, however, said they don't want a return to austerity. There have been reports the Treasury could raise money from changes to Capital Gains Tax, pensions relief or self-employment taxes. But this is tinkering. Mr Johnson believes Â£40bn of tax rises are necessary over the short-term, and that sort of money cannot be raised without touching the Big Three: income tax, VAT or national insurance. These bring in almost two-thirds of government revenue. How will the Spending Review affect you?

"The Duchess of Sussex has revealed she had a miscarriage in July, writing in an article of feeling ""an almost unbearable grief"".

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""It's a deeply personal matter we would not comment on."" The duchess and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, moved to California to live away from the media spotlight, after stepping back as senior royals in January. Their first child, Archie, was born on 6 May 2019. The duke and duchess visited southern Africa in 2019 with their son Archie The duchess began her article by describing a ""sharp cramp"" she felt while looking after Archie. ""I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right,"" she wrote. ""Hours later, I lay in a hospital bed, holding my husband's hand. I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears. ""Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we'd heal."" Meghan made it clear from the first event that she spoke at as Harry's bride-to-be that she wanted women's voices and women's experiences to be heard more clearly. Now she has written of her loss, and her heartbreak. She has set it in the context of a year of breathtaking turbulence. And she has made a plea for tolerance and compassion. She weaves in the struggles of so many with Covid-19, the battles over truth and lies in our divided age, the killing of black Americans by the police. And on an experience that so many women have lived through, she has made her grief a way of bringing miscarriage closer to the everyday conversation. The duchess continued: ""Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few. ""In the pain of our loss, my husband and I discovered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suffered from miscarriage. ""Yet despite the staggering commonality of this pain, the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning. ""Some have bravely shared their stories; they have opened the door, knowing that when one person speaks truth, it gives license for all of us to do the same."" The duchess alsoreferenced a TV interviewin which she was asked by a journalist if she was ok, during her tour of South Africa last year. She said she was asked the question during a time in which she was ""trying to keep a brave face in the very public eye"". ""I answered him honestly, not knowing that what I said would resonate with so many - new moms and older ones, and anyone who had, in their own way, been silently suffering,"" she said. The duchess is the second member of the Royal Family to open up about having a miscarriage. In 2018 the Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindallspoke about suffering two miscarriagesbefore having her second child. The duchess's miscarriage happened at a time when she was involved in legal action against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a letter she wrote to her father. Last month she was granteda postponement of her privacy trialuntil autumn next year. An estimated one in four pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, according to the charity Tommy's. Tommy's midwife Sophie King said talking about baby loss in pregnancy is ""a real taboo in society"" so ""mothers like Meghan sharing their stories is a vital step in breaking down that stigma and shame"".

""Sadly, early miscarriages are very common and they can be a devastating loss for parents and their families,"" she said. And Alice Weeden, from charity the Miscarriage Association, told the BBC: ""When somebody, particularly in the public eye, talks about it openly, it's helpful for other people to know that they are not alone."" By Smitha Mundasad, BBC health reporter There are around 250,000 miscarriages every year in the UK alone, the majority occurring within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. It is a shockingly common experience, often dealt with privately at home or swiftly in hospitals. Many parents carry their grief silently and can feel society expects them to ""get back to normal life"" too soon. But charities and scientists say much more needs to be done to acknowledge the longer-term effects of pregnancy loss. Research suggests that one in six women go on to have symptoms of post-traumatic stress. For some, nightmares and flashbacks continue for many months while anxiety and depression are also common afterwards. Partners report suffering too, with one in 12 facing similar issues. Pregnancy experts in the UK say it is vital that women and partners are offered psychological support, alongside physical help, yet this kind of care is often under-resourced. Often, it is not known why miscarriages occur - whether in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, and many pregnancy losses cannot be prevented. Usually, something goes wrong with the development of the foetus in the womb. Warning signs can include bleeding and/or cramping pain in the lower tummy. Pregnant women are advised to seek medical advice if they have either of these symptoms.

Often, it is not known why miscarriages occur - whether in the first or second trimester of pregnancy, and many pregnancy losses cannot be prevented. Usually, something goes wrong with the development of the foetus in the womb. Warning signs can include bleeding and/or cramping pain in the lower tummy. Pregnant women are advised to seek medical advice if they have either of these symptoms. If you or someone you know has been affected by issues with pregnancy,the following organisations may be able to help.

"This video can not be played French lockdown highlights small business struggles (November 2020 report) France will begin to ease its strict coronavirus restrictions this weekend, allowing non-essential shops to reopen, President Emmanuel Macron has said. People will also be able to share ""moments with the family"" over the Christmas period, Mr Macron announced. But he said bars and restaurants would have to remain closed until 20 January. France has reported more than 2.2 million cases and more than 50,000 confirmed coronavirus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. In a televised address on Tuesday evening, Mr Macron said the country had passed the peak of the second wave of virus infections. He said that the bulk of lockdown restrictions would be eased from 15 December for the festive period, with cinemas reopening and general travel restrictions lifted, as long as new infections were at 5,000 a day or less. On Monday, France reported 4,452 daily Covid-19 infections - its lowest tally since 28 September. The latest seven-day rolling average for new infections in France is reported to be 21,918. That figure peaked at 54,440 on 7 November. How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Covid vaccine update: When will one be ready? Mr Macron said the recent news of successful vaccine trials offered ""a glimmer of hope"" and that France would aim to begin vaccinations against Covid-19 ""at the end of December or at the beginning of January"", starting with the elderly and most vulnerable. The French president said the situation would be reviewed on 20 January, and if infections remained low, bars and restaurants would then be permitted to reopen. Universities would also be able to accept students again. However, if the situation had worsened, he said he would look at options to avoid triggering a third wave. ""We must do everything to avoid a third wave, do everything to avoid a third lockdown,"" Mr Macron said. He later tweeted to say that all businesses forced to remain closed during the restrictions, such as restaurants, bars and sports halls, would have the choice of receiving up to â¬10,000 (Â£8,900) from a ""solidarity fund"" or the payment of 20% of their turnover. He said that France's ski resorts may have to remain closed until next year because the current risks associated with the virus made it difficult for such sports to resume. However, he said he would discuss the issue with other European leaders and provide an update in the coming days. Ski resorts were responsible for numerous outbreaks of Covid-19 cases across Europe in the early days of the pandemic. Mr Macron said the lockdown would be replaced by a nationwide curfew between 21:00 and 07:00, except on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. France has been under a second national lockdown since the beginning of November. People have only been permitted to leave home to go to work, buy essential goods, seek medical help or exercise for one hour a day. Anyone going outside must carry a written statement justifying their journey. While all non-essential shops, restaurants and bars have been shut, schools and crÃ¨ches have remained open. Social gatherings have been banned. This video can not be played Empty street in Montmartre, Paris Measures to deal with coronavirus outbreaks remain in place across Europe, but a reduction in daily reported cases in some areas - coupled with the reported success of a number of vaccines - has led countries to revisit their restrictions. Some of the latest developments include: Along with France, politicians from other nations - includingItalianPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte - have said that Europe's ski resorts should close over the winter and that it is too risky to spend the Christmas holiday on the snow The developers ofRussia's main coronavirus vaccine - Sputnik V - have said that it is proving to be up to 95% effective. They have also said that it will be cheaper - and easier to store and transport - than its competitors in the US. Some critics have suggested the vaccine is being rushed through, but Moscow rejects this AustriaandSpainboth announced vaccination plans. Nursing home residents and workers in Spain will be first in line to be vaccinated, while in Austria elderly, at-risk groups and health professionals will be prioritised.

"The inquiry focuses on the work of a consultant urologist at Craigavon Area Hospital Northern Ireland's health minister has ordered a statutory public inquiry into ""serious concerns"" about the clinical practice of a hospital consultant. Robin Swann said that hundreds of families had been contacted by his department as a result of a review into urology consultant Aidan O'Brien. Over 1,000 patients' records have been recalled at the Southern Health Trust. The trust said it shared the ""high level of concern"" and ""will be fully co-operating with the Inquiry process"". Preparing for his retirement in June,  Mr O'Brien handed over his case files to the health trust. The BBC understands that it emerged that the treatment of two patients was incomplete - they still required surgery. On further inspection of cases, other issues emerged which eventually led to an investigation of Mr O'Brien's work between January 2019 and June 2020. It comes as an independent inquiry into neurologist Dr Michael Watt is upgraded to a public inquiry. Public inquiries are set up to uncover the truth following scandals or perceived injustices, and have the power to compel people to give testimony, and gather other forms of evidence. Dr Watt was at the centre of Northern Ireland'sbiggest ever patient recall. In 2018, about 3,000 patients were recalled as part of an investigation into his work at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. Mr Swann ""unreservedly"" apologised to patients and their families for the ""upset and distress caused"" by the review into consultant Aidan O'Brien. Urology, the healthcare area he worked in, deals with the urinary tract in both men and women and male genital organs. Like other areas of NI's healthcare system, it has extensive waiting lists. In a statement to the assembly, Mr Swann said that the Southern Trust contacted his department on 31 July, ""to report an early alert concerning the clinical practice of this consultant"". The minister said the trust informed his department that it had become aware of potential concerns by 7 June, regarding delays of treatment for surgery patients under the care of the consultant urologist. The trust had become aware that two out of 10 patients listed for surgery were not on the hospital's patient administration system at that time. Robin Swann made a statement to the Northern Ireland Assembly After these issues were raised, a look back at the consultant's work was undertaken, with Mr Swann telling the assembly 1,159 patients' records have initially been reviewed and 271 patients or families have been contacted by the trust. Patients recalled after urology review Neurology inquiry concerns not unique, says chair Children's hospital deaths were avoidable Mr Swann said nine cases have so far been identified that meet the threshold for a serious adverse incident (SAI) review, while a further six cases are being reviewed in more detail to establish if those patients have come to harm. Mr Swann said the concerns about clinical practice of the consultant urologist are ""of the gravest concern"". The health minister said it would ""take some time"" before the inquiry began, and the families and patients would have an ""opportunity to influence the terms of reference of the inquiry"". Within an hour, two public health inquiries were announced and an apology was delivered by the health minister. It's not often that events move so quickly in Northern Ireland. Such haste around the urology inquiry signals two things: It is extremely serious, and Robin Swann wants to be seen to be taking the lead. Both recalls have much in common, centring on the work of two individual consultants and the health and welfare of hundreds of patients. The General Medical Council - the healthcare regulator for medical professionals - is also involved with both consultants. And there are questions over the private work that both men were carrying out - in Mr O'Brien's case at his home. By now, Northern Ireland should be an expert in holding public health inquiries. While theinquiry into hyponatraemiawas one of the longest-running in the UK,those into neurologyandthe scandal at Muckamoreare likely to take years to complete. While Northern Ireland is gathering experience in this field, one obvious question has to be asked: When do lessons start being learned? The Southern Trust's Chief Executive Shane Devlin said it was likely more patients would be contacted as reviews of patient notes continue to be carried out. ""I sincerely apologise for the distress and concern this news will cause,"" he said. ""We have already been in touch with patients/families who we have identified through our urgent review of cases, and invited those who we have clinical concerns about to come for a review appointment so we can be assured that their treatment is appropriate."" Colm Gildernew, chairman of the Stormont health committee described the situation as ""concerning"" but welcomed the announcement of an inquiry. DUP MLA Jonathan Buckley said it would ""no doubt cause concern for patients across the southern trust"". Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw said the common factor connecting the medical scandals related toMuckamore,neurology,hyponatraemiaand this are all clinical governance. ""How many times are we going to be brought to this chamber as MLAs to discuss breakdowns in clinical governance?"" she asked. Neurology Inquiry, November 2020Robin Swann announced on Tuesday the Independent Neurological Inquiry would be upgraded to a public inquiry. It is looking at concerns raised about potential misdiagnoses by neurologist Michael Watt in the Belfast Trust, in whichmore than 3,000 patients were recalled. The independent inquiry was launched in May 2018. Muckamore Abbey Hospital, September 2020A public inquiry intoallegations of physical and mental abuse of patientsdating back to 2017 was announced in September. So far 15 people have been arrested in relation to the ill-treatment of patients at the facility, with the most recent arrest taking place on Monday. No one has yet been charged. Hyponatraemia, November 2004The 14-year inquiry into the hyponatraemia-related deaths of five children in Northern Ireland's hospitals was the longest running in British history whenit reported in January 2018. Hyponatraemia is a medical condition that occurs when there is a shortage of sodium in the bloodstream, and the inquiry found four out of the five deaths were avoidable. The minister said he hoped the inquiries would get to the ""root cause"" of the problems. Sinn FÃ©in MLA John O'Dowd described the minister's announcements as probably one of the most disturbing he had heard. He said there was a problem within the ""culture"" of the health service, and that consultants ""have too much power"". Mr Swann said he ""unfortunately recognised"" what Mr O'Dowd had said.

"One of the bones comes from the tibia (lower leg bone) of a two-legged meat-eater similar to Sarcosaurus The only dinosaur bones ever found in Ireland have been confirmed to belong to two different species. The bones were previously discovered on the east coast of County Antrim. But a new scientific study from the universities of Portsmouth and Queen's in Belfast has confirmed the origins of the bones for the first time. One is part of the lower leg bone of a carnivore similar to Sarcosaurus; the other is from the upper leg bone of a Scelidosaurus, a four-legged herbivore. The two fossil bones, confirmed to be from early Jurassic rocks, were discovered in Islandmagee during two separate finds in the late 19th Century and the 1980s. Originally it was assumed the fossils were from the same animal, but new analysis published in the Proceedings of the Geologists' Association has confirmed they belong to the two different species. Ireland was underwater for most of the period during which dinosaurs roamed the earth, so there is less chance the remains of land animals would be preserved in rocks dating to that period. Ulster Museum has announced plans to put the bones on display when it reopens after the current coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Dr Mike Simms, a curator and palaeontologist at National Museums NI, said the development was ""a hugely significant discovery"". Experts suggest Scelidosaurus may have been a coastal animal, perhaps even eating seaweed like modern-day marine iguanas ""The great rarity of such fossils here is because most of Ireland's rocks are the wrong age for dinosaurs, either too old or too young, making it nearly impossible to confirm dinosaurs existed on these shores,"" he said. ""The two dinosaur fossils... found were perhaps swept out to sea, alive or dead, sinking to the Jurassic seabed where they were buried and fossilised."" Robert Smyth, researcher at the University of Portsmouth and Professor David Martill, used high-resolution 3D digital models of the fossils in their analysis of the bone fragments, produced by Dr Patrick Collins of Queen's University Belfast. ""Analysing the shape and internal structure of the bones, we realised that they belonged to two very different animals,"" said Mr Smyth, who is originally from Ballymoney. ""Despite being fragmentary, these fossils provide valuable insight on a very important period in dinosaur evolution, about 200 million years ago. ""It's at this time that dinosaurs really start to dominate the world's terrestrial ecosystems."" Professor Martill said: ""Scelidosaurus keeps on turning up in marine strata, and I am beginning to think that it may have been a coastal animal, perhaps even eating seaweed like marine iguanas do today."" The study is part of a larger project to document Jurassic rocks in Northern Ireland and draws on many fossils in Ulster Museum's collections.

"The USS John S McCain was involved in a deadly collision with a tanker in 2017 Russia says one of its warships caught and chased off a US Navy destroyer after it entered territorial waters in the Sea of Japan on Tuesday. Moscow accused the USS John S McCain of travelling 2km (1.2 miles) across its maritime border in Peter the Great Gulf and says it threatened to ram the ship. The US warship then left the area, according to Russia. However, the US Navy denied any wrongdoing and said its ship had not been ""expelled"". The incident took place on Tuesday in the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea, a body of water bordered by Japan, Russia and the Koreas. According to the Russian defence ministry, its Pacific Fleet destroyer the Admiral Vinogradov used an international communications channel to warn the US ship about ""the possibility of using ramming to get the intruder out of the territorial waters"". ""The Russian Federation's statement about this mission is false,"" said a spokesman for the US Navy's 7th Fleet, Lt Joe Keiley. ""USS John S McCain was not 'expelled' from any nation's territory."" He said the US ""would ""never bow in intimidation or be coerced into accepting illegitimate maritime claims, such as those made by the Russian Federation"". Such incidents at sea are rare, although the Admiral Vinogradov was also involved in a near-collision with a US cruiser in the East China Sea last year. Both Russia and the US exchanged blame for that incident. This video can not be played The crew of the USS Chancellorsville had a close-up view of the Russian warship Admiral Vinogradov in June 2019 The two countries regularly accuse the other of dangerous military manoeuvres - at sea and in the air.

"US shares hit fresh records on Tuesday with the Dow Jones index closing above 30,000 points for the first time amid hopes of a strong economic recovery and end of political uncertainty. The S&P 500 also hit an all-time high as investors bought economically sensitive financial and energy stocks. Trading was fuelled by positive Covid vaccine news and moves to start the Joe Biden presidential transition. Europe's main markets also jumped, with London's FTSE 100 closing up 1.5%. President Donald Trump has given the green light for the formal transfer of power to begin following Mr Biden's election victory. And positive news about coronavirus vaccines has boosted hopes that the US and global economies could be on the path to normality next year. Asian markets followed Wall Street's lead, with Japan's Nikkei up nearly 2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index 1.4% higher. Indexes in South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore have all edged higher. ""The possibility of having a vaccine next year increases the odds that we're going to see demand return in the new year,"" said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at US-based Baird, said: ""If 2020 has shown us anything it is that stock markets have a tremendous ability to look past bad news if there is sun on the horizon.""

A rise in Tesla shares took the electric carmaker's market value above $500bn (Â£374bn). At the close, the Dow Jones was up 1.54% at 30,046.2, while the S&P 500 gained 1.62% to 3,635.4. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose 1.3%, to 12,036.7. Oil prices also rose, with US crude up 4.25% to $44.89 a barrel and Brent up 4% at $47.89. The gold price, a favoured asset when investors are fearful, fell 1.6% to $1,806 an ounce. But the bullish sentiment comes despite US coronavirus cases surging and millions of Americans still unemployed, and some analysts fear shares are due a reality check.

"Up to three households will be able to meet up during a five-day Christmas period of 23 to 27 December, leaders of the four UK nations have agreed. People can mix in homes, places of worship and outdoor spaces, and travel restrictions will also be eased. But a formed ""Christmas bubble"" must be ""exclusive"" and would not be able to visit pubs or restaurants together. The leaders urged people to ""think carefully about what they do"" to keep the risk of increased transmission low. They added 2020 ""cannot be a normal Christmas"" but family and friends will be able to see each other in a ""limited and cautious"" way. However, some scientists have warned that the relaxation of Covid restrictions over the festive period could spark another wave of infections and further deaths. The measures will see travel restrictions across the four nations, and between tiers and levels, lifted to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK. Anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland may travel on the 22 and 28 December, but otherwise travel to and from bubbles should be done between the 23 and 27. People will not be able to get together with others from more than two other households, and once a bubble is formed, it must not be changed or be extended further. The guidance says a bubble of three households would be able to stay overnight at each other's home but would not be able to visit hospitality, theatres or retail settings. However, existing local restrictions will still be in place mean many pubs and restaurants - such as those in England's tier three or Scotland's level four - will remain closed during the festive period. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Christmas rules 'not an instruction to meet up' The leaders of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland reached the agreement at a meeting on Tuesday afternoon. In a joint statement, they said: ""Even where it is within the rules, meeting with friends and family over Christmas will be a personal judgement for individuals to take, mindful of the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable. ""Before deciding to come together over the festive period we urge the consideration of alternative approaches such as the use of technology or meeting outside."" This video can not be played People in Cardiff share their views on the relaxation of Covid-19 rules over Christmas Published guidance for England,externalgives further details of the rules for 23 to 27 December: Up to three households will be allowed to stay together and form a ""Christmas bubble"" You can form a different Christmas bubble from the people you live with normally - so you can choose to stay with different people for the five-day period You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line withthe rules for the tier in which you are staying,external. Places you can meet those people include parks, beaches, open countryside, public gardens, allotments and playgrounds Children under the age of 18 whose parents do not live together may be part of both parents' Christmas bubbles Existing support bubbles count as one household towards the three household limit If a care home resident is able to leave their home, they can form a bubble with one other household - but should not form a three-household bubble. However, visits out of care homes should only be considered for residents of working age because of the risks Students are considered to be part of the household to which they have returned Scientists say a typical Christmas gathering at home is the type of environment where infections can spread. The guidance also advises people to take precautions when meeting their Christmas bubble such as washing hands frequently and opening windows to clear potential virus particles. In a video message from Downing Street, the prime minister described the agreement as a ""special, time-limited dispensation"", saying: ""This year means Christmas will be different."" Boris Johnson said people must make a ""personal judgment"" about the risk of who they form a bubble with or if they visit elderly relatives., adding: ""Many of us are longing to spend time with family and friends... And yet we can't afford to throw caution to the wind."" This video can not be played ""All the governments agreed"" on the five-day plan for Christmas in the UK, says Michael Gove Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford saidit was ""not an instruction to travel, it's not an instruction to meet with other people. People should still use a sense of responsibility"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added: ""The virus is not going to be taking Christmas off, so although we want to give a little bit of flexibility for Christmas we are still urging people to be very cautious and to use this flexibility responsibly and only if you think it is necessary."" Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fostersaid she hoped people would have space to plan, adding: ""We of course recognise how important Christmas time is for so many people."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill urged people to ""be responsible"", saying while they wanted to mark Christmas after such a ""desperate"" year the relaxations would increase opportunities for the virus to spread. She added it was hoped that an alignment with rules in the Irish Republic could be achieved. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? What to do about Christmas divides opinion. Increased mixing indoors will certainly mean there is greater transmission of the virus. But, as chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty said on Monday, there is a balance to be struck between the harm the virus can cause and the societal and economic impacts of trying to control it. He called for a ""public-spirited approach"". By that he means adhering to the restrictions in the lead-up to Christmas, being responsible with the opportunity the relaxation gives people, and then immediately switching back to compliance. If that happens, any impact could be minimised - and, of course, it will be up to individuals to decide just how much they mix within the rules. These are very fine judgement calls by ministers. They hope Christmas will provide respite and help steel the public for what is clearly going to be a long, hard winter. They also feel they have little choice, believing large numbers of people would ignore pleas not to mix - and this way they can provide advice on how to enjoy Christmas as safely as possible. But there is also the risk by sanctioning it there will be more mixing than there would have otherwise been. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps earlier said Christmas travellers should plan journeys carefullyand prepare for restrictions on passenger numbers to allow for social distancing. Meanwhile, the government has recorded another 608 UK deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. There have also been a further 11,299 cases of people testing positive for coronavirus. Gyms and non-essential shops in all parts of England will be allowed to reopen from 2 Decemberunder a strengthened three-tiered system. Areas will not find out which tier they are in until Thursday - and the decision will be based on a number of factors including case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and pressure on local NHS services. This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Prof Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, and a member of the government's Sage committee, told BBC Newsnight that allowing families to meet up over Christmas amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". He said it would ""definitely lead to increase[d] transmission and likely lead to third wave of infections with hospitals being overrun, and more unnecessary deaths."" Prof Hayward said while you cannot ban Christmas, he called for clearer messaging to families about the ""dangers"" of socialising and inter-generational mixing. And Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, suggested the relaxation of restrictions at Christmas will ""almost inevitably"" lead to an increase in transmission. But he said: ""Providing that the new tier system is better managed than in October, any increase in cases could be relatively short-lived. ""After Christmas we will still have to live through a few more months of restrictions at least."" Jillian Evans, the director of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, said the easing of restrictions over Christmas would cost lives. ""We've got winter weather, we know that people are more susceptible to infection over the colder period, and we've got a festive period where people will be socialising,"" she said. ""Those are facts, and I would rather be honest and tell you that those are the facts, and be truthful about it so people can understand the risks that they're taking."" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the UKHospitality lobby group, said there was ""muddled thinking"" over the Christmas rules and they would cause the sector more economic harm. She said: ""Hospitality venues should be considered part of the solution for providing people a well-deserved safe and enjoyable Christmas, especially given that allowing multiple households to mix in the confines of private homes presents an exponentially greater risk.""

"People have been urged to be cautious of the risk of spreading coronavirus when rules are relaxed over Christmas. Up to three households will be allowed to stay together and form a ""Christmas bubble"" from 23 to 27 December, as agreed by all four UK nations. A scientific adviser to the government said the relaxation of rules amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". Meanwhile, it is expected most areas of England will be placed in the middle tier of atoughened three-tier system. Details on what will happen when the current lockdown ends on 2 December will be announced on Thursday. The decision will be based on a number of factors including case numbers, the reproduction rate - or R number - and pressure on local NHS services. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says a ""handful"" of areas will be in the lightest regime of limits - tier one - but most of the country is likely to be in either tier two or three. She said London is expected to be placed in tier two. The measures for Christmas will see travel restrictions across the four nations, and between tiers and levels, lifted to allow people to visit families in other parts of the UK. Anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland may travel on the 22 and 28 December, but otherwise travel to and from bubbles should be done between the 23 and 27. People will not be able to get together with others from more than two other households, and once a bubble is formed, it must not be changed or be extended further. The guidance says a bubble of three households would be able to stay overnight at each other's home but would not be able to visit hospitality, theatres or retail settings. What are the Covid rules at Christmas? How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas Christmas rules 'not an instruction to meet up' Three households can mix over Christmas in UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told people to use ""personal judgement"" on whether to visit elderly relatives. In a video message from Downing Street,,externalthe prime minister described the agreement as a ""special, time-limited dispensation"", saying: ""This year means Christmas will be different."" Mr Johnson said people must consider the risks of who to form a bubble with and whether or not to visit elderly or vulnerable relatives, adding: ""Many of us are longing to spend time with family and friends... And yet we can't afford to throw caution to the wind."" He added: ""'Tis the season to be jolly but 'tis also the season to be jolly careful.""

It comes as the government recorded another 18,213 Covid cases in the UK. Figures also showed a further 696 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths is the highest since the start of May and compares to 608 recorded on Wednesday. BBC health editor Hugh Pym says many of those who have died are likely to have picked up an infection before the current lockdown measures were put in place. He said a rise in the death toll would not be expected to continue into December because the average number of daily cases is now falling and hospital admissions are levelling off. A mid-week rise can also be down to delays in deaths being reported over the weekend. First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said the ministers agreed they had to ease the rules because people would have flouted restrictions - creating further risk - if they were told Christmas had been ""cancelled"". Ministers were shown behavioural science evidence that ""too many people simply would not have been prepared to have gone along with such an instruction"", he told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday. Mr Drakeford also saida UK-wide approach to coronavirus rulesafter Christmas was needed. Nicola Sturgeon has said guidance for people in Scotland is still being finalised and will be issued on Thursday, but that her government will not be ""encouraging"" people to meet up. ""The expectation should be that the guidance will probably look to tighten around the edges rather than further expand and that will be true with the travel window of opportunity as well - we want to limit that window, not expand it,"" the first minister said. Published guidance for England,externalgives further details of the rules for 23 to 27 December: You can form a different Christmas bubble from the people you live with normally - so you can choose to stay with different people for the five-day period You can meet people outside your Christmas bubble, but only outside the home and in line withthe rules for the tier in which you are staying,external Children under the age of 18 whose parents do not live together may be part of both parents' Christmas bubbles Existing support bubbles count as one household towards the three household limit Students are considered to be part of the household to which they have returned Prof Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, and a member of the government's Sage committee, told BBC Newsnight allowing families to meet up over Christmas amounted to ""throwing fuel on the Covid fire"". He said it would ""definitely lead to increase[d] transmission and likely lead to third wave of infections with hospitals being overrun, and more unnecessary deaths.""

This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Gavin Terry, head of policy at the Alzheimer's Society, said thousands of relatives would be in ""complete despair"" at government guidance which says only care home residents of working age should be allowed to leave their care homes to visit family, due to the increased risk of exposure to the virus. ""After eight harrowing months filled with devastation and tragic loss of life, the announcement that many care home residents will be facing Christmas alone is just heartbreaking,"" he said, calling for further testing to allow for more visits. Meanwhile, Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, called on ministers to publish evidence for its Christmas bubble rules, which would ""inflict unnecessary pain and irreversible damage on our sector"". Local rules mean many pubs and restaurants - such as those in England's tier three or Scotland's level four - will remain closed during the festive period, irrespective of the Christmas change.

"This video can not be played Biden: ""We've just got to keep the border open"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland President-elect Joe Biden has said America does not want a ""guarded border"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland following Brexit. He said it had taken a lot of hard work to reach a settlement on the island of Ireland, ending decades of conflict. The UK government has threatened to overrule the Brexit withdrawal agreement which committed it to keeping the border open. Mr Biden has previously said Brexit must not endanger the peace process. Speaking to reporters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Tuesday, Mr Biden said: ""We do not want a guarded border. We've worked too long to get Ireland worked out. ""The idea of having a border north and south once again being closed is just not right, we've just got to keep the border open."" Mr Biden - who hasunveiled officials for six important posts as he prepares to take office- said he had spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) and the French government. Government suffers Lords defeat over Brexit bill Biden warning for UK over post-Brexit trade deal Progress in tough areas of Brexit talks - EU chief Mr Biden - an Irish American - has previously said that any UK-US post-Brexit trade dealhad to be ""contingent"" on respect for the Good Friday Agreement. Those comments came after the government put forward legislation that would give it the power to change aspects of the EU withdrawal agreement, a legally binding deal governing the terms of Brexit made earlier this year. The Internal Market Bill is designed to enable goods and services to flow freely across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland after 1 January - when the post-Brexit transition period runs out. This video can not be played Biden: ""Itâs a team that reflects the fact that America is back"" The president-elect was quick to criticise the legislation when it was first published, warning that the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland ""cannot become a casualty of Brexit"". Earlier this month, theHouse of Lords voted to remove a section of the billthat would allow ministers to break international law, but the government has said it would reinstate these clauses when the bill returns to the House of Commons next month. The UK and EU are still working to strike a deal to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. The President of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said last week thatprogress had been made on some issuesbut there were still ""some metres to the finish line"" to reach agreement. Meanwhile, a senior Democrat with close links to Mr Biden's incoming administration has criticisedthe UK government's plans to cut its overseas aid budget. John Podesta, a former adviser to Presidents Obama and Clinton, told the BBC the reduction of the spending target was ""extremely unfortunate"". Mr Podesta may not speak directly for Team Biden but his remarks will be seen as a clear warning shot from across the Atlantic, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale has said.

" A domestic violence survivor’s journey in five objects by Eleanor Lawrie by Eleanor Lawrie Some people might have been happy at the prospect of being furloughed from their job, but for Victoria this was a terrifying prospect. “I remember that dread in my stomach, driving home from work on the last day thinking: ‘How long until I can get away?’” Victoria had already suffered years of abuse from her partner by the time the UK went into lockdown in March. After that, her life became even more difficult. It is a situation victims of domestic abuse have suffered all over the globe, in what the UN is calling the “shadow pandemic” - a focus ofBBC 100 Womenthis year. For every three months lockdown continues, the UN estimates an additional 15 million women are expected to be affected by intimate partner violence worldwide. For as long as she could remember, Victoria’s partner had been trying to control her every move, and had gradually cut her off from friends and family. He would ring her 10, 20, 30 times a day. One day when her phone was on silent upstairs, he sent a friend of his mother’s to check on her. Before the pandemic, Victoria had almost managed to leave - working punishing night shifts to save the deposit for her own flat. But her plans were derailed when one of the children was hospitalised. And now the couple were locked in the house together 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They could not even leave for shopping or exercise, because the child’s health problems meant the family had to shield. The family had a garden, but Victoria’s partner refused to let them go in it. He told them they could catch coronavirus even in the fresh air, far away from other people. So Victoria tried to get through the long days by taking an online course. Even then, he would sit beside her as she studied, and check her internet history afterwards. The strain became so unbearable that Victoria contemplated suicide. She would lie awake at night, trying to work out how she could get the children to a safe place first. ‘’I was thinking: 'I will have to kill myself, because I can’t live the rest of my life like this, and I can’t see any way out.'” But she found that learning to crochet helped relax her, giving her something else to focus on. Many people began a new hobby in lockdown out of boredom. But for Victoria, it became a lifeline. She began to spend her days making things for the world outside her four walls, such as clothes for a friend’s new baby. “Even though he was sitting there the whole time, or following me around, I could lose myself in crocheting and block him out a bit. It was one of the only things that kept me going.’’ As her partner's furlough was extended to July, and then to September, the situation at home began to spiral out of control. Already a heavy drinker, he started spending up to £500 on alcohol a month. And the drinking brought with it a constant threat of violence. He positioned a baseball bat by the front door and a baton on the stairs, and left knives around the house. Victoria knew he might use them - he had previously told her he would cut her throat if she tried to leave. About two thirds of women in England living with domestic abuse told aWomen’s Aid surveypublished in August that their ordeal had got worse during the UK’s first lockdown. It was one of Victoria’s children who finally triggered their escape. She texted a confidential mental health support service, and then managed to flee the house to stay with a supportive family member. “My daughter had had enough of the way he controlled everybody, and how scared we were all the time,’’ Victoria says. It’s not clear what Victoria’s daughter told the mental health service but police visited the family home to check on her wellbeing. Her partner responded by going on a drinking binge, while she and the children hid upstairs. And then in the early hours of the morning, he went into Victoria’s bedroom and tried to snatch her phone, demanding to know what her daughter had been saying about him. When Victoria refused to hand it over, he punched her in the face. Another daughter called the police, and the younger children were quickly woken up and taken out of the house. It was half past one in the morning. Victoria didn’t have enough time to grab any clothes - she left in shorts and a strappy top. Her daughter gave her a pair of flip flops and they headed into the night. Victoria and her children sought sanctuary with a relative, while the police arrested her partner.  The next morning she slipped back into the house while he was in custody. She quickly scooped up some possessions - toys for the children; her crochet hook. She also grabbed her dressing gown, a gift from her mother. Victoria’s partner hadn’t allowed her to see her mum for two years before she died of cancer. On the first anniversary of her death, he started to claim that he was suffering from the same type of cancer. “The attention wasn’t on him, and he knew saying that would upset me,” she says. Victoria is glad she thought to pack this memento of her mother, as she never returned to the house again. She contacted Women’s Aid, and within days she and the children had moved into a refuge. The first few weeks were difficult. The children reacted badly to loud noises and doors slamming, and Victoria struggled to sleep, imagining that her partner was standing by the door. But eventually they began to truly feel safe. “To not have the constant calls and text messages, or the threat of someone kicking the door open and pulling the covers off you in the middle of the night, it makes you feel relaxed - like you can breathe,” she says. While the refuge offers a safe haven from the outside world, it is not immune to the pandemic. Victoria says she is very relieved to have been given a place there. But repeated lockdowns have meant some families haven’t been able to move on, reducing space for others even as demand has soared by 150%. Messages to the UK's National Domestic Abuse Helplineincreased by 120% on one particular nightearly on in lockdown, and over the past month demand has steadily increased again, the charity Refuge, which runs the helpline, says. And when someone at Victoria’s refuge tested positive, the women were plunged back into isolation, which for many brought back traumatic memories of being trapped with their abuser. “Isolation was really hard to start with, because it took me back ‘there’, to where I wasn’t allowed to do this or do that,” Victoria says. “But after a few days it wasn’t so bad. I thought: ‘I’m surrounded by people who care about you, I can go in the garden. You know you’ll be free in a few weeks.’” While the refuge has given Victoria a haven, she hasn’t been able to have much interaction with the outside world. For her own security, the refuge told her to change her phone number and to keep her new address secret, although she could let friends and family know she was safe. So it was an unexpected surprise when, through a third party, she received a card from an old friend. The message on the front: ‘After the rain, comes the rainbow.’ Victoria is looking forward to starting a new life with her family back in society, free from fear. But the refuge has allowed them to feel normal again. “I didn’t know what we would come to, but everything that we needed was there already. And it just felt comfortable, nice. It feels like home now.” Many people fear the pandemic means Christmas will be different this year, but for Victoria that’s the best part. She’s taught some of the other women to crochet, and they are making Christmas decorations to send to their families. It may only be November, but she has bought all her presents, and her children already have Christmas trees in their rooms. “Christmas is going to be amazing - we can eat what we want, we can do what we want. I am so looking forward to it,” she says.

"This video can not be played Home-schooled children are flourishing, says mother Some parents could not wait to get their children back to school after the first coronavirus lockdown. But Louise's two children remain at home - initially because she was shielding, but increasingly because ""they are flourishing"". They are among 806 children removed from school registers by parents in Wales between March and September this year - up almost 50% since last year. The Welsh Government said it had given councils Â£400,000 for home-schooling. But some parents teaching their children at home have called for more support. The number of children ""deregistered"" from schools to be home-schooled has increased 46% since last year, and 72% since 2018 Figures obtained byBBC Wales Liveshow 552 children were ""deregistered"" from school between March and September in 2019. In 2018, the figure was 466. The actual number will be higher as six local authorities have not given their figures. Local authorities said children were being deregistered for a number of reasons, including anxiety, coronavirus and lifestyle choice. The pandemic has filled Louise and her children ""with uncertainty"", she says Louise, 38, from Abergavenny, said her daughter Orlena struggled with learning at home during the first lockdown, ""but when it came to the children going back to school I was afraid and anxious"". ""It was the unknown with Covid - it just filled both me and them with uncertainty."" Louise suffers with an autoimmune disease which means she would be likely to be ""very sick"" if she caught coronavirus, which made her children ""extremely concerned about bringing it home"". Covid fears prompt 38% rise in parents home educating Home-schooling has been hell, say parents Home-schooling during coronavirus: a child's verdict ""So at the end of August we just decided they weren't going to go back for now,"" she explained. Armed with online resources loosely based around the suggested curriculum for their age, Louise deregistered her children in September. She has been surprised by how readily Orlena, 12, and nine-year-old Roy have adapted to their new style of education. Louise says her children get more one-on-one teaching time at home than they did at school ""We were just plodding along with school - I was aware Orlena was slow in some things and that Roy was a bit rebellious,"" Louise said. ""Home-educating has helped me see their weaknesses and work on them. ""I ask them how they feel about going back to school and both of them say they don't get as much one-on-one with teachers as they have 30 children to deal with. ""They are flourishing now with someone having the time to sit with them and do things. I do learning through play, and if something doesn't tickle their mind I don't force them to do it."" She said she now sees home education as a potentially long-term arrangement for the children, with the possibility of them studying for their GCSEs at home. Louise says she will allow Orlena and Roy to go back to school once it is safe, if they wish ""If the children want to go back once it is safe for them to do so, they can. But I have decided to leave that up to them,"" Louise added. ""We might look at flexi-schooling, where they go to school for part of the week, but spend a couple of days being home educated too."" Although she is sometimes unable to teach them because of her illness, Louise said help from friends, her children's desire to learn and online resources makes home education possible. She said: ""There hasn't been any support, the only support has been through other home-educating parents online."" Monmouthshire council said it worked with home-schooling parents ""in line with Welsh Government guidance"", and that no parents had been in touch to express disappointment with the level of support. There are more than 2,250 children currently being home educated in Wales, figures obtained by the BBC show Freedom of Information requests by Wales Live to local authorities found there were a total of 2,250 children currently being home educated in Wales. In 2019 there were 2,171 while in 2018 that figure was 1,878. The number may be higher as it is not compulsory for parents to register their children as being home schooled if they have never attended school. Lockdown has been like an ""extended free trial"" for home schooling and the ""biggest single boost in home education ever"", according to Alastair Lawson, from education resource website Twinkl. But home schooling has been more challenging for other parents. Polly says she has had ""no official support"" to educate her daughter Meg at home Polly, from Ceredigion, started home schooling her 12-year-old daughter Meg in September to shield her husband - who previously had a kidney transplant - from the virus. ""I can't describe how hard I find it having to be teacher, mother, best friend,"" said Polly. ""I've had no official support. Ceredigion council were very supportive when we chose to withdraw her from education - they didn't oppose it and we didn't have any fines and I think we had one letter with a link to online resources."" Ceredigion council said it was ""not in a position to direct what learning takes place"" at home, but it was ""eager"" to help families find the right learning resources. She said the experience has made them a lot closer as a mother and daughter, but added: ""Some sort of mentoring for me would really help. Some sort of guidelines."" Children's commissioner Sally Holland is reviewing the regulations surrounding home-schooling Plans to set upa compulsory register of children being home schooled,externalwere shelved by the Welsh Government in June due to the pandemic. As a result, Children's Commissioner Sally Holland haslaunched a review into regulations surrounding home schoolingto see if it should be better regulated. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it was updating a leaflet for home-educating parents concerned about coronavirus, and they needed to be aware of the implications of home-schooling. She said: ""We're aware that some parents may have made the decision to remove their children from school due to Covid-related fears, however, we encourage schools and local authorities to work together with families through a supportive approach to enable a return to school during these challenging times."" The spokeswoman added the Welsh Government had allocated Â£400,000 to local authorities this year to support home-schooling families, which is ""unique to Wales"".

"Spoiler alert! After providing much-needed escapism, the Great British Bake Off has made Peter Sawkins, 20, its youngest winner to date. Peter beat fellow finalists Laura Adlington and Dave Friday in Tuesday's finale, which included custard slices, a walnut whirl and dessert towers. Peter, from Edinburgh, said he felt like ""an excited giddy kid"". An average of 9.2 million people watched the final live on Channel 4, according to overnight ratings. That was 2.3 million more than tuned in to last year's final live, and was the show's biggest audience since it moved from BBC One in 2017, Channel 4 said. Bake Off winner's 'absolute dream' victory How has the show changed since series one? Finance student Peter said: ""This is going to be a huge chapter in my life,"" but added he would still finish his degree while continuing to bake. He was nicknamed the ""baby-faced assassin"" by host Noel Fielding, and is the first Scottish winner. ""I hope I have made Scotland proud,"" he said. ""I enjoyed using Scottish flavours and themes when I could throughout the competition."" Host Noel Fielding (left), judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith, and co-host Matt Lucas congratulate Peter (centre) Peter won star baker twice and impressed right from the beginning with his accuracy and polished creations. He went slightly off the boil mid-series, only to come back with a vengeance in the semi-final with his second star baker win, prompting judge Paul Hollywood to exclaim: ""Welcome back!"" Talking about the final challenges set by Paul and fellow judge Prue Leith, Peter said: ""Honestly it was never in my mind that I thought I could win this. ""But I was pleased with my first challenge of a Cranachan custard slice - Prue said it was lovely flaky pastry with good custard and that I had ticked every box."" Hollywood defends Bake Off finalist after trolling Matt Lucas charms critics on Bake Off debut The ganache for his walnut whirl in the technical was described as ""good"" by Paul. Peter went all out for the showstopper challenge with his Bonkers Bake Off bubble cake, which was praised for its flavours. ""Dave, Laura and I were so happy to be in the final together, we were so close and really supported each other,"" said Peter. ""This year particularly all the bakers helped support each other through the journey, from day one.  It's a shame we can't all win."" Peter said he had to hide his trophy in a box in the kitchen He added that hosts Noel and Matt Lucas ""were great to be with in the tent"" . It was Lucas's first series after taking over from Sandi Toksvig ""When Noel called me the baby-faced assassin and said Paul knows that the apprentice takes over from the master - it was quite a funny nickname to be given but I wouldn't expect anything less wacky from Noel.  And I promise you I didn't kill the master at the end of the series."" He revealed that after his win, which happened in August, he had to smuggle his trophy on the plane back to Edinburgh. Once home, it stayed on the family worktop in the kitchen hidden in a box. Prue said of Peter: ""I feel as if he is my grandson"" Judges Prue and Paul said it was the closest final they have had to judge and the hardest decision to make, but it was to be Peter's year. ""Peter should be exceptionally proud,"" said Paul. ""He is the youngest winner we have ever had and the first Scottish winner."" Prue added: ""Do you know I am terribly proud of Peter and I feel as if he is my grandson.  He is such a nice guy and he is so eager to learn, you can't not like him."" Runners-up Dave and Laura congratulated Peter on his success with Dave saying: ""I gave Peter a good run for his money, but he really deserves it. ""I am not at all disappointed, if someone had told me at the beginning that I would be a runner-up, I would take that, all day long."" The Great British Bake Off class of 2020 Laura added: ""I am overjoyed but it's bittersweet that it's all over. I am looking forward to going home, and I am really made up that I got some flowers, to be honest! You genuinely couldn't ask for a better winner, he really does deserve it."" This series the bakers have made everything from battenbergs to biscuits and rainbow bagels to brownies. They faced caged tarts in pastry week, steamed buns in Japanese week, and in 80s week, faced making quiches and ice cream cake in the middle of a heatwave. And like almost everything else, the show's production was shaped by the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the changes was a shortened production period, reduced to about half the usual time. ""Bake Off is normally filmed across 12 or 13 weeks, predominantly at weekends, and that's what the bakers were told would happen at the start,"" producer Kieran Smith said earlier this year. ""But within a month we asked, 'Can you take six weeks off work and come and live in a biosphere?' Everything was complicated, everything was different, but everybody wanted to do it."" The show moved location from Welford Park in Berkshire to a hotel in Essex. Before entering the hotel, everyone involved with the production - including contestants, judges, hosts, crew, staff, and cleaners - were required to self-isolate for nine days and take three Covid-19 tests. Upon arrival, they quarantined at the hotel for 14 days before production began and stayed together in the bubble until filming ended. Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"A police car stood outside the department store where the attack took place A woman has been arrested in the southern Swiss city of Lugano after allegedly injuring two other women in a suspected terror attack at a store. She attempted to choke one and stabbed another in the neck with a knife before being stopped by shoppers, police say. One victim is believed to have serious but not life-threatening injuries, while the other was lightly wounded. The suspect, 28, was known to federal police from an investigation into ""jihadist terrorism"" back in 2017. Country profile A Swiss national, she lived locally in the Italian-speaking Ticino region. ""A department store in Lugano was the scene of a suspected terrorist-motivated attack on several people,"" the federal attorney-general's office said. Norman Gobbi, president of Ticino's government, condemned the attack and said extremism ""cannot find a place in our community"". Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, whose own country became the scene of a deadly jihadist shooting earlier this month, tweeted his condemnation of the attack. ""My thoughts are with the victims wishing them a full & swift recovery. We stand with Switzerland in these difficult hours,"" he added.

"Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has topped Microsoft founder Bill Gates to become the world's second richest man after a meteoric rise in his personal fortune. Mr Musk's net worth jumped by $7.2bn (Â£5.4bn) to $128bn after shares in his car firm Tesla surged. Only Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is richer, according to theBloomberg Billionaires Index,external. It comes after news Tesla shares will be added to the S&P 500, one of the main share indexes in the US. That triggered a fresh wave of buying of the electric carmaker's shares, sending the company's market value above $500bn and boosting the value of Mr Musk's holding in the business. Musk: Cheaper Tesla ready 'in about three years' Tesla shrugs off pandemic as sales hit new record Elon Musk 'likely has moderate case' of Covid-19 Tesla is already the most valuable car firm in the world, despite producing a fraction of the vehicles of rivals such as Toyota, VW and General Motors. On Tuesday, in a speech in Germany, Mr Musk said it could ""make sense"" for Tesla to expand in Europe by entering the mass-market segment with a small car. ""In the US, the cars tend to be bigger for personal taste reasons,"" he said. ""In Europe, (they) tend to be smaller."" And after years of losses, Tesla has seen five consecutive quarters of profit as sales of its cars perform well despite the pandemic. The California-based firm will be the biggest new entrant on the S&P 500, with a market value of more than $500bn. It means investment funds tracking the index will automatically hold its stock and benefit from gains in its share price - news that has excited investors. This video can not be played Blast off: Watch the SpaceX rocket head into space Bill Gates, who co-founded Microsoft, was the world's richest person for years before Mr Bezos knocked him off the top spot in 2017. Mr Gates's fortune is worth $127.7bn but would be higher had he not donated large sums to charity over the decades. Jeff Bezos's net worth is estimated at Â£182bn by Bloomberg. He too has seen his personal fortune rise this year as demand for Amazon's services climbed in the pandemic. Mr Musk, who regularly courts controversy, has had an eventful past few weeks. Last weekend he tweeted that he ""most likely"" had a moderate case of Covid-19 and has had symptoms of ""a minor cold."" It came the day before four astronauts were launched to the International Space Station in a rocket built by Mr Musk's SpaceX.

"This video can not be played Biden: ""Itâs a team that reflects the fact that America is back"" US President-elect Joe Biden has unveiled officials for six important posts, as he prepares to take office. ""America is back"", he said, and ""ready to lead the world, not retreat from it"". If confirmed, Avril Haines will be the first female director of national intelligence and Alejandro Mayorkas the first Latino homeland security boss. Donald Trump has agreed transition moves must start and Mr Biden will now get a top secret intelligence brief. However, the sitting president still refuses to admit defeat, repeating unsubstantiated claims that the 3 November vote was ""rigged"". As well as getting the Presidential Daily Brief- an update on international threats and developments - Mr Biden can now access key government officials and millions of dollars in funds as he prepares to take over on 20 January. Could Biden's win doom this town? What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us What is the presidential transition? On Tuesday, Governor Tom Wolf said he had certified Mr Biden's victory in Pennsylvania, a key swing state. Another, Michigan, certified the same outcome on Monday. Speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, the president-elect highlighted the need to rebuild alliances, as well as tackling coronavirus and climate change. World leaders, he suggested, were ""looking forward to the United States reasserting its historic role as a global leader over the Pacific, as well as the Atlantic, all across the world"". Speaking to NBC News, he said: ""This president, President Trump, has changed the landscape. It's become America first, America alone. We find ourselves in a position where our alliances are being frayed."" Mr Biden also told reporters he had discussed the Irish border issue with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other leaders. US doesn't want guarded border on Ireland - Biden The 310-mile border at the heart of Brexit Mr Biden, who has Irish heritage, said he was against a guarded border, arguing it must be kept open: ""The idea of having the border north and south once again being closed, it's just not right."" This video can not be played Biden: ""We've just got to keep the border open"" between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Speaking to NBC, Mr Biden said outreach from the White House had been ""sincere"", not ""begrudging"". There were, he said, plans for him to meet the Covid task force in the White House about vaccine distribution and access. Barack Obama's former vice-president said that his time in office would not be a ""third Obama term"" because ""we face a totally different world than we faced in the Obama-Biden administration"". Mr Biden has chosen Jake Sullivan, Linda Thomas-Greenfield and Antony Blinken for key roles Mr Biden presented six key figures on Tuesday: Antony Blinken,Secretary of state. Mr Blinken said the US would soon ""with equal measures of humility and confidence"" restore its relationships with other countries John Kerry,Climate change envoy.He was one of the leading architects of the Paris climate agreement, from which President Trump withdrew. Mr Kerry said the world must ""come together to end the climate crisis"" Avril Haines,Director of national intelligence. Mr Biden said: ""I picked a professional... a fierce advocate for telling the truth"". Alejandro Mayorkas,Secretary of homeland security. Mr Mayorkas said the department had ""a noble mission, to help keep us safe and to advance our proud history as a country of welcome"" Jake Sullivan,White House national security adviser.Mr Sullivan praised his boss, saying he had taught him much about statecraft, but also ""most importantly about human nature"" Linda Thomas-Greenfield,US ambassador to the UN.She said she brought her southern Louisiana roots to her job, calling it ""a cajun spin"" on ""gumbo diplomacy"" One choice that is expected but has not been announced yet is former Federal Reserve chairJanet Yellenas treasury secretary Alejandro Mayorkas (left) and Avril Haines (right) have been formally named; Janet Yellen (centre) is expected to be picked for the treasury Most of the picks, although not Mr Kerry or Mr Sullivan, will need confirmation by the Senate. Rejection of a nominee is rare. The last was in 1989, although some nominees have withdrawn from consideration. This video can not be played Robert Malley is a school friend of Antony Blinken Joe Biden's picks for the top roles in his administration have been celebrated by centrist Democrats: they speak glowingly of the diversity and experience of the individuals, a group that includes veteran foreign policy experts, and accomplished women and people of colour. Yet progressives feel cheated. They say they helped Mr Biden win, and now they have been shut out of power. These progressives say the cabinet will be filled with ""Clinton and Obama retreads"", as one of them puts it, describing it as a return to the ""Blob"", a term that Ben Rhodes, who served as Mr Obama's speechwriter, once used to describe the Washington establishment. Stephen Wertheim from the Quincy Institute, a think tank focused on foreign policy, says the new Democratic team in the White House may end up acting like the old one, a group of centrists who, he says, focused more on military threats than on issues such as climate change. He adds: ""Progressives have a right to be concerned about whether there will be significant change."" In a  brief appearance in the White House press room on Tuesday, Mr Trump praised the work of his administration, hailed the Dow Jones stock index for passing the 30,000 mark and left without taking questions. While praising the armed forces later in the Rose Garden, he said: ""And as I say, 'America First'. Shouldn't go away from that... 'America First'."" How is President Trump challenging the result?

"Personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles in England were inadequate for the Covid pandemic and price rises earlier this year cost taxpayers about Â£10bn, the spending watchdog has said. TheNational Audit Office said,externalthere had been a particular shortage of gloves and aprons. The government said the NAO's report recognised that NHS providers had been able to get what they needed in time. Almost Â£12.5bn was spent on 32bn items of PPE between February and July 2020. During the same period in 2019, 1.3bn items were bought at a cost of Â£28.9m. Each item had been ""substantially"" more expensive in 2020, because of very high global demand, the NAO said, from almost triple the cost for respirator masks to more than 14 times as much for body bags. Had the government been able to pay 2019 prices, it would have spent Â£2.5bn on PPE in 2020. In reality, it had spent Â£12.5bn, including hundreds of millions on ""unsuitable"" items that could not be used. Some had ""passed its expiry date or did not meet current safety standards"", the watchdog said, with ""insufficient checks"" meaning Public Health England had had to recall eye protectors that did not meet standards. In Parliament, on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""wasting"" taxpayer's money on equipment that ""can't be used"". But Mr Johnson replied ""99.5%"" of the 32 billion items of PPE bought between February and July 2020 ""conform entirely to our clinical needs"". Earlier, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said ""only 0.49% of all the purchased PPE tested to date"" had not been fit for purpose. NAO head Gareth Davies said: ""As PPE stockpiles were inadequate for the pandemic, government needed to take urgent action to boost supplies. ""Once it recognised the gravity of the situation... the price of PPE increased dramatically, and that alone has cost the taxpayer around Â£10bn."" Unions worried care workers did not have proper protective equipment Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Safety chiefs pressed to make incorrect PPE report Before the Covid-19 pandemic, there were two emergency stockpiles of PPE: one as part of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Programme one built up in case of a no-deal Brexit But the NAO said: ""The EU exit stockpile held few items of PPE other than a large number of gloves."" Meanwhile, the flu stockpile, as well as having shortages of some key items, did not include any gowns or visors despite the fact they had been ""recommended for inclusion in June 2019 by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag)"". Public Health England told the NAO it had been analysing the market to work out which gowns to buy, when the pandemic had begun, which it said was the ""normal approach"" to find a lower price. In mid-March, the government had still believed its two stockpiles would provide ""most of the PPE needed to manage a Covid-19 pandemic"" and so focused on distributing this PPE rather than buying more, the NAO reported. The situation had become ""precarious"" in April and May, with stocks threatening to run out. At one point, only 3% of the required number of gowns had been available. But the nation did not at any point run out of any type of PPE. The scramble for PPE in the early stages of the pandemic was not confined to the UK. Every healthcare system was desperate to secure protective equipment and prices soared. But the National Audit Office lays bare how the UK was at the back of the queue, having failed to spot the warning signs and how woefully inadequate the stockpiles were. A failure to anticipate what might be needed for anything other than a flu pandemic in essence cost the taxpayer Â£10bn - the extra money needed to secure supplies such as gowns and visors during the Covid crisis. The report highlights poor distribution of PPE with many staff saying they did not have the right equipment. The NAO notes starkly that health and care employers have reported more than 100 deaths among staff because of exposure to coronavirus. An official inquiry, when it happens, will look hard at many aspects of the UK's preparedness and handling of the crisis and the PPE issue will be central. With a series of reports, the NAO has now done important groundwork but there is much still to find out. FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? A DHSC official said: ""As the NAO report recognises, during this unprecedented pandemic all the NHS providers audited 'were always able to get what they needed in time' thanks to the Herculean effort of government, NHS, armed forces, civil servants and industry"". But the NAO heard feedback from care workers, doctors and nurses that showed ""significant numbers of them considered that they were not adequately protected during the height of the first wave of the pandemic"". Employers have reported 126 deaths among health and care workers linked to exposure at work. And there were concerns about training and whether the equipment was appropriately fitted, particularly from women and people belonging to ethnic minorities. In a Royal College of Nursing survey of 5,000 NHS staff, 49% of respondents belonging to ethnic minorities said they had been adequately ""fit tested"" for a respirator, compared with 74% of white nurses. The DHSC said it was ""listening to the reported practical difficulties with the use of some PPE experienced by women and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals, among others, and... taking action to make sure user needs are adequately addressed in future provisions"". In a separate report, the Public Accounts Committee, a parliamentary body which works closely with the NAO, said it was ""concerned that the department had no plan before the pandemic for how it might increase critical care equipment in the event of an emergency"". ""This lack of preparedness was exacerbated by the fact that it did not know how many ventilators were available to the NHS to begin with,"" the PAC said. But it added the government had managed to buy an additional 26,000 ventilators for use in the NHS, a ""significant achievement"".
