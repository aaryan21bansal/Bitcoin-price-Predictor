"Gigs can return to Wales immediately but will have to follow strict rules Live music can return immediately in Wales, it has been announced. The Welsh government confirmed performances could begin again but the change did not apply to nightclubs. Venues will need risk assessments in line with hospitality andperforming guidance,external. They will need to limit groups to a maximum of six people from six households, use one-way systems and follow ventilation guidelines. The change brings music performances in line with restaurants and theatres, which were able to open earlier in May. What are the lockdown rules in Wales? What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown around the UK? The announcement applies to music venues, bars, pubs, cafes, restaurants and licensed premises. Further activities, such as events and festivals, will be considered in the next review. Tickets for the Green Man festival sold out in 18 minutes when they went on sale earlier this month, despite organisers making it clear it may not go ahead. ""The demand is definitely there,"" director Fiona Stewart told BBC Radio Wales. She added: ""I have 5,000 people who rely on the festival [for work] who want it to go ahead. ""It will be an amazing moment if Green Man goes ahead in Wales - a fist in the air triumph for when we have had to give things up [over the past 14 months]."" Green Man is due to take place in the Brecon Beacons in August However, Ms Stewart said her ""nervousness"" was that Covid insurance was not available for big events and social distancing rules would not work at a festival. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nichols said venues that could have a seated audience would be able to socially distance people. ""However, for many small venues it will simply be impossible for them to manage this with social distancing in place,"" she added. ""And for our nightclubs, it's just impossible to operate. We do need to see the rest of the roadmap for our Welsh businesses too. ""Until we get that final bit of the jigsaw - the social distancing lifted - to be able to allow these businesses to return to profitability, then we're not at the end of the road yet for the sector."" Katie Hall is looking forward to performing for the first time since early 2020 Katie Hall, the lead singer of Chroma, said she was ""elated"" and it was a ""step in the right direction"" with the band unable to play any gigs since before the pandemic. The south Wales act has festival bookings for October, and she added: ""Everyone needs to be paid, and something like 36% of people in the sector have lost their jobs. ""It's had a massive hit on the music industry as a whole."" Trial events have taken place in Liverpool But Daniel Minty, who produces a Cardiff gig guide said he believed conversations were ""much needed"" over live events. ""The Welsh government has not discussed it over the last 16 months,"" he said. ""The train is leaving the station and that's the most important thing."" Mr Minty said he believed there would be a need for trial events while venues would need to decide if they can break even with gigs, adding: ""It's a difficult process, but a process that is now able to start."" In England, socially distanced gigs have been taking place since 17 May. All areas of mainland Scotland are at level two apart from Glasgow, which is at level three. At level two outdoor and indoor events such as concerts can go ahead with limited capacity. Northern Ireland has no date yet set for when live music can resume there. Cardiff Castle is due to stage a Foals concert this summer A Welsh government spokesman said the suspension of gigs and other live performances had been one of ""the biggest shocks to our sense of well-being and the arts economy"". He added: ""We will continue to support our music and arts sectors in Wales through our cultural recovery, freelancer and economic resilience funds."" Welsh music tourism attracts 440,000 people annually, according to industry group UK Music. It said the industry generates about Â£143m for the Welsh economy and supports more than 1,800 jobs. Welsh rockers Feeder, whose UK top 20 hits include Buck Rogers and Just A Day, are due to play an outdoor homecoming concert at Tredegar Park in Newport on 9 July. One of the first big gigs in Wales this summer is Feeder's open air concert in Newport While renowned live band Foals, winners of the best album award at the 2020 Brits, are scheduled to play one of the open-air concerts at Cardiff Castle this summer. Some of Wales' most popular gig venues - like Venue Cymru in Llandudno and Newport Centre - are still Covid vaccination centres. ""It's been a long road, but I think we're finally getting to the end of it,"" said Sam Dabb, the Wales coordinator for the Music Venue Trust. Tell us when we can reopen, nightclubs say Many music venues 'could never reopen' ""I'm really, really happy. ""The gigs are subject to risk assessments and the guidance, and we have to wait for the guidance to come out from Welsh government and then the Music Venue Trust are going to help their members build the risk assessments, to make sure we do everything safely and properly. Sam Dabb of the Music Venue Trust says the best route back is ""safely and slowly"" ""I think the best route back is to do it safely and slowly,"" added Ms Dabb, manager of Newport gig venue Le Pub. ""Whatever the scientific advisers are saying we should do, we're going to make sure our members are doing,"" she said.

"More than half of 18 to 29-year-olds in Wales have had at least one dose of a vaccine A higher proportion of Wales' population has had a dose of a Covid vaccine than any other country with more than a million people. It is quite the contrast with January, when questions were being asked aboutthe sluggish start to vaccinations. People aged 30 and 31 in Englandare being invited to book to have their first dose of Covid vaccine, while in Wales more than half of 18 to 29-year-olds have had at least one dose of a vaccine. So what explains the difference? According toPaul Mainwood,external, a strategy consultant, former academic and ""amateur vaccine sleuth"", Wales took a risk and that risk has paid off in a big way. In some parts of Wales, more than two-thirds of people in the 18 to 29-year-old age group have been given a first dose, including Conwy county (72.1%). Wales is also pushing on with its second doses and has set daily records over the past two days, including 20,715 second doses on Wednesday. A total of 2,120,049 people (67.2%) have now been given a first dose of a vaccine and 1,058,464 people (33.6%) have had a second jab, according to Public Health Wales (PHW) figures. After the slow start, Wales had caught up with England and Scotland by early February, and since 7 April it has been ahead of all the other UK nations. The Welsh government expects all adults to have been offered a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine ""over the next couple of weeks"" - more than a month ahead of schedule. Along with other UK nations, Wales had committed to offering a first dose to all over-18s by the end of July. Covid jabs and blood clots: Your questions answered Covid: How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many people in the UK have been vaccinated so far? Covid in Wales: How many people have died? While the UK government has arranged supplies of vaccine, the distribution programme in Wales is the responsibility of the Welsh government and NHS Wales. A network of vaccination centres and GP surgeries have been giving the vaccine to people in Wales since December. While the Welsh government has not set a new date for when all adults will have been offered a first dose, a spokesperson confirmed the original target of 31 July would now be met in June. A walk-in vaccine centre has been opened in Cardiff to vaccinate people who had not yet come forward One Welsh health board covering the capital city has already offered first vaccination appointments to all adults. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board has begun offering walk-in appointmentsat the Bayside vaccination centre in Cardiff Bay. Speaking onBBC Radio 4's More or Less programme, Mr Mainwood said Wales uses more of its vaccine allocation and delivers them into people's arms within a couple of days. He said this was in stark contrast to other UK nations, including Scotland, which takes between 10 and 12 days to deliver the vaccines to people. Mr Mainwood said there were risks to ""running with a very low stock holding"", like Wales is doing. Despite the encouraging rollout in Wales, there are signs of more no-shows among younger people If people have their first dose appointment cancelled, there is a chance they may not be ""found"" again. ""You really need to be as reliable as possible,"" he explained. And with second doses, it is important to have enough doses available when they become due. But the risk had ""so far paid off,"" Mr Mainwood said. The ""separation of strategy"" between Wales and the rest of the UK came towards the end of February, when it began taking the vaccine allocation very quickly and started administering second doses, he explained. This had the effect of ""building a bit of cover"" in terms of fully vaccinating the most vulnerable groups early, which allowed a quicker acceleration of the first dose roll out to the rest of the population. Welsh health board offers all over-18s vaccine by 30 May Children as young as 12 could get vaccines in Wales Half of young adults vaccinated in some areas of Wales And another thing Wales is doing differently is to move through the age cohorts more quickly than other parts of the UK. In Scotland, Mr Mainwood said, there is a slower progression through the cohorts, but greater uptake than in Wales. ""Wales has raced down a bit and have much lower uptake percentage in those top ones, but are starting to do people in their 30s and their 20s now,"" he said. Mr Mainwood added: ""There are lessons the rest of the country should be learning from Wales.""

"Gina Ingles, 34, and four-year-old Milo Ingles-Bailey died, while her partner Toby Jarrett, 28, suffered serious burns Two men have been found guilty of murder after a mother and her four-year-old son died in a house fire that was started after a drugs-debt row. Gina Ingles, 34, and her son Milo Ingles-Bailey died in July 2018 at their Eastbourne home. Ms Ingles' partner Toby Jarrett was also injured. Jacob Barnard and Andrew Milne have been convicted at Lewes Crown Court of their murder and attempted murder. John Tabakis was found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Barnard and Milne are due to be sentenced on Friday. Judge Mrs Justice Whipple said they ""will be facing lengthy terms"" in prison. Tabakis was released on bail to be sentenced at a later date. Jacob Barnard (left) and Andrew Milne were found guilty of the murder of Ms Ingles and four-year-old Milo Fire investigators concluded the blaze had been started deliberately close to the front door, and outside the house a petrol can and lighter were found. DNA matching Barnard was found on the lighter, and DNA matching Milne was found on the petrol can, the court was told. CCTV images showed two men walking away from scene of the fire just before 01.00 BST on 10 July 2018. Barnard dealt in second-hand cars, buying them in the UK and selling them in Portugal. He also dealt in drugs. Milne worked as a debt collector for Barnard, the court heard. He was arrested in Portugal. The jury was told Mr Jarrett owed money to a local drug dealer, who in turn owed money to Barnard. At the time firefighters described the house fire as ""ferocious"" Mr Jarrett had woken at about 01:30 BST to find the house he shared with Ms Ingles in Croxden Way, Eastbourne, filled with smoke. He fell from the bedroom window, and was seriously injured and suffered from extensive burns, while Ms Ingles went to get Milo from another room. The remains of Ms Ingles and Milo were found in her bedroom under a window several days later, together with the body of a dog, the jury was told. Mobile phone data showed Barnard and Milne exchanged calls the day before the fire. Barnard had also exchanged calls with Tabakis. A Mercecdes ML270 4x4 car, owned by Barnard, was picked up on number plate recognition systems driving into Eastbourne before the fire, and then leaving the town, after the time of the blaze. The same car was then taken by Tabakis on a ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe, and on to Portugal. He had been told by Barnard to ""get the vehicle out of the country as quickly as possible as it had been involved in some criminal activity"", the prosecution told the jury. Barnard, 32, who lived in Portugal, and Milne, 42, from Hastings, were found guilty of murdering Ms Ingles and Milo, and the attempted murder of Toby Jarrett. The jury also found Milne guilty of being in possession of a prohibited weapon. Tabakis, 31, from Hastings, was convicted of one charge of intent to pervert the course of justice. Police said the fire was an attack on a ""defenceless family"" in the middle of the night Senior Investigating Officer, Gordon Denslow from Sussex Police, said the investigation had been ""very long and very complex"". ""At no point have Barnard or Milne accepted responsibility for their actions in the early hours of 10 July 2018, or expressed any remorse or regret. ""Instead, their unfounded denials in the face of compelling evidence have meant that Gina's and Milo's family have had to endure a long and painful wait to find out what really happened that night, and why."" He said: ""This was a carefully planned, cowardly, but horrific attack carried out by Barnard and Milne in the middle of the night against a defenceless family. ""Tabakis then knowingly tried to help them get away with their crimes by driving the car they used during the attack to Portugal just hours afterwards.""

"The warning appears on the app after the account holder logs in NatWest mobile app users are being directed to a warning screen advising them to beware of cryptocurrency scams. The bank said it had received a ""record number"" of reports about such scams between January and March 2021. The alert warns account holders to make sure they have direct control of any digital wallet that is set up to handle transactions, and to beware of promises of big profits. One common scam involves fake celebrity endorsement, it said. Typically, potential investors are prompted to fill in an online contact form and then encouraged over the phone to set up a cryptocurrency wallet - but unknown to them the scammer installs remote access software on their device, granting them access to it as well. The victim is then persuaded over time to invest ever larger amounts - until the criminal empties the wallet. Another ruse is the ""get rich quick"" cryptocurrency investment opportunity, the bank added. ""We have prevented millions of pounds from being sent to crypto-criminals who are exploiting the high levels of interest in the currency. However, consumers should always be alert, especially to the use of fake websites and bogus celebrity endorsements,"" said Jason Costain, NatWest's head of fraud prevention. The Financial Conduct Authority hasa searchable list of unauthorised firms and individuals offering financial services,external. People using these will not be protected by the UK's financial authorities if something goes wrong, the FCA warns. The app alert, which NatWest said was an urgent reminder, tells customers: a ""trader"" getting in touch with promises of big profits and assistance in setting you up on a scheme ""is a scam"" if you can't access your own crypto-wallet or you did not set it up yourself, you should cease all payments to it make sure any cryptocurrency seller you want to use is registered with the Financial Conduct Authority ""You could lose all of your money,"" without following the advice, it warns. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile in value. This monththe price of Bitcoin alone has fluctuated by up to 40%- creating some big winners and losers in the process. It is not regulated by any financial authorities. There has been a flurry of advertising around crypto-investments on social media, and on Wednesdaythe Advertising Standards Authority banned an ""irresponsible"" billboard ad for a cryptocurrency exchange,externalwhich appeared on London transport.

"Farmers have raised concerns over competition from larger-scale Australian operators Trade Minister Greg Hands has said British farmers have nothing to fear from a proposed free trade deal with Australia. Mr Hands told the Commons he gave a ""cast iron guarantee"" that British standards would not be lowered in the search for a deal. Farmers have warned they could struggle to compete if Australia was given tariff-free access to UK markets. But the minister said farmers should ""be positive, not fearful"". Mr Hands also said that beef injected with hormone would not be allowed into the UK. The government is hoping to secure a post-Brexit deal with Australia in the next few weeks. But National Farmers Union president Minette Batters has warned removing tariffs on meat imports would ""have a massive impact"" on British farms, which would be unable to compete, in terms of scale, with Australia's vast cattle and sheep stations. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said during the Commons debate on Thursday that Labour could not support a ""rushed-through"" deal. ""Let me make clear at the outset that we support a trade deal with Australia which is designed in British interests, which will create jobs in our economy and increase our exports and growth,"" she said. Ms Thornberry added: ""We cannot support a deal on agricultural  tariffs that will cost jobs in our farming communities, undercut our food standards, increase our carbon off-shoring and open the door to the destruction of our farming industry through further lop sided trade deals."" Mr Hands rejected any suggestion that UK farmers would be disadvantage. ""There will be no compromise on our standards of animal welfare, food safety and the environment. That is in our manifesto commitment."" UK makes free-trade offer to Australia Why is an Australia trade deal controversial? How many trade deals has the UK done? Another concern of UK farmers is that an Australia deal will be a template for other agreements with countries in Asia, piling more pressure on the sector from cheaper imported goods. But Mr Hands said farmers should see an agreement with Australia as opening new markets overseas for their own produce. ""This will be a great deal for the UK and our farmers will continue to thrive. The agreement is a gateway into the massive CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) free trade area in Asia and Pacific,"" he said. It would, he added, open ""doors for our farmers into some of the biggest economics of now and the future"". The UK has offered trade deal terms to Australia under which both countries would phase out taxes on imports over 15 years. Wine is one of the biggest imports to the UK from Australian The cabinet was reportedly split on what terms to propose, amid concerns UK beef and lamb farmers could be undercut by larger Australian producers. But the dispute was apparently resolved after Boris Johnson pushed for unity. In 2019-20, trade in goods and services between Australia and the UK wasvalued at Â£20.1bn,,externaland both sides are hoping to expand this amount considerably. Currently,metals, wine and machines,externalform the biggest goods exports from Australia to the UK, while Australia'smain UK imports,externalare cars, medicines and alcoholic drinks. Trade in meat between the two countries is small, with 0.15% of all Australian beef exports going to the UK and 14% of sheep meat imports to the UK coming from Australia.

"This video can not be played ""If there is real evidence then I think the responsibility of the US is to share it"" - WHO virologist Marion Koopmans China has denounced US efforts to further investigate whether Covid-19 came from a Chinese lab. US President Joe Biden has said he expects to release the results of an intelligence report on the origins of the virus. China's foreign ministry accused the US of ""political manipulation and blame shifting"". It has rejected any link between Covid-19 and a virus research lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Why the lab-leak theory is being taken seriously Covid-19 was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019. Since then, more than 168 million cases have been confirmed worldwide and about 3.5 million deaths reported. Chinese officials linked early Covid cases to a seafood market in Wuhan, leading scientists to theorise that the virus had first passed to humans from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has saidit is ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus spread from a lab leak, following a visit to Wuhan earlier this year to investigate the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. WHO virologist Marion Koopmans, who was part of that field visit, told the BBC that if the US authorities had any information they should share it. Wuhan: City of silence Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial Covid map: Where are cases the highest? But recent US media reports have suggested growing evidence the virus could instead have emerged from a laboratory in China, perhaps through an accidental leak. In a statement on Wednesday, President Biden said he had asked for a report on the origins of Covid-19 after taking office, ""including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a laboratory accident"". On receiving it this month, he asked for ""additional follow-up"". China has rejected any link between Covid-19 and a virus research lab in Wuhan Mr Biden said the majority of the intelligence community had ""coalesced"" around those two scenarios, but ""do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other"". He said he had now asked agencies to ""redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion"". On Thursday, Mr Biden told reporters he planned to release the report ""unless there's something I'm unaware of"". Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau then voiced his support for efforts made by the US and other countries to better understand the origins of the virus. Wednesday's announcement angered Chinese officials. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said it showed the US ""does not care about facts or truth, and has zero interest in a serious science-based study of origins"". ""Their aim is to use the pandemic to pursue stigmatisation, political manipulation and blame shifting. They are being disrespectful to science, irresponsible to people's lives and counter-productive to the concerted efforts to fight the virus,"" he said. The spokesman also said US intelligence agencies had a ""dark history"" of spreading misinformation. A statement from the Chinese embassy in the US, which did not directly refer to Mr Biden's order, said ""smear campaigns and blame shifting are making a comeback"". Readers now long used to articles dismissing the lab-leak theory as a dangerous, fringe conspiracy may be slightly bemused to find it suddenly front-page, presented as an entirely plausible possibility. The truth is, there's always been plenty of circumstantial evidence to support both competing theories. A zoonotic origin, in which the virus passes naturally from bat to humans, is supported by the fact that coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier in exactly this way before. There are also plenty of precedents for lab leaks in which researchers get accidentally infected by the virus they're working on. The Wuhan outbreak happens to be on the doorstep of the world's leading laboratory for the collection, study and experimentation on bat coronaviruses. What's changed is not the evidence - of which there is none so far to prove either scenario - but the politics. The lab-leak theory, born into an environment poisoned by disinformation, was undermined not so much by China's denials, but by the fact it was being pumped by former US President Donald Trump. Media organisations everywhere gave it the cold shoulder.My own attempts to look seriously at the lab-leak theoryin May last year ran into long and fraught editorial discussions before it finally made it to publication. The prevailing narrative has also loomed large over the science. Despite the dominant voices of some leading virologists insisting that only a zoonotic origin needed be investigated, a determined group of scientists has continued to argue that both scenarios should remain on the table. It may be too late, of course. Wherever the debate goes now, China is extremely unlikely to allow another investigation on its soil. Speculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by Mr Trump. US state department cables came to light in April 2020 that showedembassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a report written jointly with Chinese scientists on the origins of Covid-19 which said the chances of it having started in a lab were ""extremely unlikely"". It said the virus had probably jumped from bats to humans via another intermediary animal, but that more research was needed. A WHO spokesperson on Thursday reiterated to the BBC that further studies were needed ""in a range of areas, including on the early detection of cases and clusters, and the potential roles of animal markets, transmission via the food chain and the laboratory incident hypothesis"". The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was linked to early Covid cases The laboratory theory has received increased public attention in the US amid recent reports attributed to intelligence sources that say three members of the Wuhan Institute of Virology were admitted to hospital in November 2019, several weeks before China acknowledged the first case of the new disease in the community. Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser, has maintained he believes the virus was passed from animals to humans, though he conceded this month he was no longer confident Covid-19 had developed naturally. Mr Biden's order for further investigations came the day after Xavier Becerra, US secretary for health and human services, urged the WHO to ensure a ""transparent"" investigation into the virus's origins. ""Phase 2 of the Covid origins study must be launched with terms of reference that are transparent, science-based and give international experts the independence to fully assess the source of the virus and the early days of the outbreak,"" he said. While there is still no evidence to suggest it is man-made, Facebook on Thursday said that in light of the ongoing investigations and in consultation with public health experts it would ""no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made from our apps"". ""We're continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge,"" it said.

Today's coverage has been written by: Doug Faulkner, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Lauren Turner, Kate Whannel and Sinead WIlson. It was edited by James Clarke and Rob Corp. We'll be back tomorrow for more updates from the UK and around the world. We are bringing our coronavirus live page to a close shortly. These are some of the stories we have been looking at today:  Remember you can find out more about the number of coronavirus cases in your areahere.    Reality Check Most of the questions from
journalists to Health Secretary Matt Hancock at the Downing Street press conference focused on a claim about care
homes made by Dominic Cummings yesterday. ""We were told categorically
in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We
only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened,"" Cummings said,
adding that it was Hancock who had made that claim. But Hancock said that the
testing capacity was not available at the time. âMy
recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for
people going from hospital into care homes when we could do it,â he said. âI then went
away and built the testing capacityâ¦ and then delivered on the commitment that
I made.â You can read more about Cummings' claims here. The daughter of a man who died with Covid-19 says if he had been tested when he was ready to be discharged from hospital, he would ""probably still be alive today"". Bernard Kirton died on 7 April last year. His daughter Fiona is a member of he Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which is calling for an urgent inquiry into the governmentâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but spoke to the BBC in a personal capacity. She said her father was fit for discharge after going into hospital following a fall - but the care home they found for him would only accept him if he had a Covid test. The hospital refused to do this, she said, as he had no symptoms, later telling her this was a Public Health England decision. Two weeks after this, another care home was found - but four hours later, he tested positive for coronavirus. ""It wasn't just something that was missed,"" she said. ""He caught it in the ward in a time period when he didn't need to be there, because the hospital wouldn't test him. ""That care home that insisted on testing did not have any cases throughout the pandemic. Had he been tested...he would probably still be alive today."" She said she had been ""relieved"" to hear Dominic Cummings speak yesterday on care homes and testing as he confirmed what she had suspected. She added: ""I can only thank Dominic Cummings, who I didnât have a very high opinion of, for exposing what has gone on."" This video can not be played When he found out his son had leukaemia Jason Josephson says he just wanted to rush in to the hospital to hug his child and wife. But he had to stay sitting in the car park of their local hospital in Carmarthen - he wasn't allowed to go inside because of Covid rules. ""It crushed me,"" he says. ""I couldn't imagine how my wife was feeling. ""I just wanted to get into the hospital and put my arms around both of them but I was informed that I was not allowed. I couldn't think of a worse pain."" Now 19 months old, Carson needs regular treatment at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff. The rule is still that only one parent can go with him for appointments, so Jason has to continue to wait for hours for news of his son's condition. Each health board is allowed discretion to agree to visits under the Welsh government guidance, but Cardiff and Vale health board says it makes allowances ""as appropriate"". Packs of tests have been handed out in public The number of rapid Covid-19 tests carried out in England has fallen to its lowest level in five weeks. That's despite all members of the public being eligible to take two rapid tests a week, for free. The latest Test and Trace figures show just under 4.9 million of the lateral flow device tests were carried out in the week to 19 May, which is down 4% from the previous week. It is the fourth week in a row the number has decreased. The swab tests give results in 30 minutes or less, without samples having to be sent to a lab for processing. Some are carried out in places such as schools and care homes but many are done at home, with people then expected to report their results. The number of rapid tests peaked at just over 7.6 million in the week to 17 March, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school. The latest figures also show 974,412 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests - which do need to be sent to a lab - were conducted in the week to 19 May. It is the second highest weekly total since the end of March. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Stefan LÃ¶fven warned that 'the message today is not that the pandemic is over' Swedenâs Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has announced his country will begin easing its Covid-19 restrictions from next week, as part of a five-phase plan. The Nordic nation has never had a lockdown, but it did introduce a number of legally-binding rules to slow the spread of the virus. The first phase comes in on 1 June and will include allowing bars and restaurants to stay open until 10.30pm (two hours later than the current closing time). A maximum number of four people per table will remain in place. Sports arenas will also be able to host socially-distanced events for up to 500 people. This is a major shift, since public events such as sports matches, film screenings and theatre performances have been limited to a maximum of just eight people since the end of 2020, and were capped to 50 people early in the pandemic. Subsequent phases will see numbers gradually increased for both indoor and outdoor events, with the goal of limiting all restrictions for indoor gatherings by September. Sweden was badly hit by the third wave of the coronavirus, but the shifting approach reflects a downward trend in daily cases since mid-April. LÃ¶fven told a news conference that he wanted to offer âa warm thank youâ to Swedes who had made sacrifices. But he said âthe message today is not that the pandemic is overâ and warned that the easing of restrictions could be reversed if the spread of infection went back in the wrong direction. Today's press conference with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, has just come to an end. Here are some of the main points covered:  Jen Williams, of the Manchester Evening News, says local health leaders in Greater Manchester implemented a testing regime before discharging care home residents in March and asks why it took a month to become national policy. She also asks about whether the surge vaccination support in Bolton could be rolled out to other areas of Greater Manchester which are now seeing rising Covid cases. Matt Hancock says ""unfortunately we didn't have the testing capacity to put that policy in place across the whole country"". On Bolton, he says there are ""some early signs"" that the increase in rates is starting to ""cap out"". Dr Jenny Harries says the spread tends to have focal points, such as a school, community centre or faith building and says it is important local understanding is brought into the picture so that surge testing can be put in place in those areas. The Times' Steven Swinford asks if Hancock has spoken to the prime minister since Dominic Cummings accused him of lying and asks if the PM has confidence in his health secretary. He also asks if the roadmap is in doubt, given the spread of the Indian variant. ""The prime minister and I talk all the time,"" Hancock replies. He says they are focused on getting the country out of the pandemic On the second question, Dr Harries says ""the pure data looks quite worrying"" with Indian variant cases doubling in a week. However she adds that this could be due to authorities ""actively detecting"" cases, rather than the variant spreading. Pippa Crerar, of the Daily Mirror, quotes the families of people who died in care homes and asks why Matt Hancock signed off the discharge plan without the proper testing system in place. The health secretary says that the government was dealing with an ""unprecedented situation"" and says it worked ""Incredibly hard to put in place what is needed to fight a pandemic"". ""Of course my heart goes out to all those who have lost loved ones but all I can say is we worked to do everything we could in difficult circumstances,"" he says. He says that the policy has developed and improved as the testing capacity has improved, along with understanding about asymptomatic transmission. Dr Jenny Harries says that looking at the evidence the discharge from hospital ""was actually a very tiny proportional cause"" of cases. She says testing of staff and residents has had a huge impact. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks the health secretary if it is correct that he said in March 2020 hospital-to-care home testing would take place but that didn't turn out to be true because the testing capacity wasn't in place. ""My recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for people going from hospitals into care homes,"" Hancock replies. ""I then went away to build the testing capacity and then delivered on the commitment I made. He says testing ""wasn't possible"" at first because the capacity wasn't there. ""I'm very proud that we built that testing capacity,"" he adds. Asked again whether he told the prime minister that everyone going from hospital to care home would be tested Matt Hancock says that he committed to getting the policy in place but ""it took time to build the testing"". He says that when there was not much testing it had to be prioritised according to clinical need. ""What we had to do was build the testing capacity because there simply wasn't the testing capacity in place at the start of the pandemic,"" he says. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if, following Dominic Cummings' evidence yesterday, Hancock can say he did protect care homes. ""We worked as hard as we could to protect people who live in care homes,"" replies Hancock. He says that in order to test people leaving hospitals and going into care homes, the government had to first build testing capacity. He says setting the 100,000 tests a day target was ""very effective"" at building that capacity, and enabled the government to introduce the policy of testing people going into care homes. Harries adds that the data is complex but their research shows that people going from hospitals to care homes was not ""the majority route of entry"" and that cases were most likely to come through community transmission, such as carers. Pete from Derby asks why the government is allowing lockdown easing to continue when there are new variants spreading. Matt Hancock says the government is working as fast as it can to get people to take up the vaccine and says that ""thankfully"" the vaccines appear to be ""effectively the same"" after two doses against the variant first identified in India as against the Kent variant. Dr Jenny Harries says that we are seeing very high vaccine effectiveness against the Indian variant for both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - although slightly lower than against the Kent variant. But she says ""we do need to be really, really vigilant"", adding that testing people coming into the country is very important. We now turn to questions from the public. Janet from Liverpool says the EU is relaxing rules for fully vaccinated visitors, dispensing with test requirements, and asks if the UK will do the same for visitors. Hancock replies that ""not all adults have been offered the jab"" yet. ""We do want to make sure there is a route to safe international travel in the future,"" he says adding ""that is what the global travel taskforce has been working on."" However he says at the moment ""it is the red, amber and green approach that guides us."" But Dr Jenny Harries says we are not seeing a sharp increase in people being admitted to hospital with Covid. She says when it comes to deaths there is a significant decrease and they have ""predominantly been older people who have not been vaccinated"". She finishes by urging people to get their jabs, saying the second dose is important. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says there has been a ""sustained and sharp decline"" in cases from the middle of January but more recent data shows a ""suggestion"" of an upward rise. Dr Harries says this could be partly due to surge testing actively finding more positive cases - but also says we do know in most cases the new variant is taking the place of the Kent variant - which is something ""we need to watch carefully"". The health secretary now turns to work on producing anti-virals which could suppress further outbreaks. He explains that anti-virals have not yet been approved but the government aims to have two available later this year. He says Eddie Gray, who has previously worked for drugs giant GSK, will chair an anti-viral taskforce. Hancock offers praise to drugs firm AstraZeneca, describing the Oxford vaccine as ""Britain's gift to the world"". He says 450 million doses have now been deployed across the globe. He adds that half a million people have signed up to take part in future clinical trials. And he says the UK government is funding an expansion of an Oxford study which will be the first in the world to look at whether different vaccines can be mixed without reducing effectiveness.

It is the fourth week in a row the number has decreased. The swab tests give results in 30 minutes or less, without samples having to be sent to a lab for processing. Some are carried out in places such as schools and care homes but many are done at home, with people then expected to report their results. The number of rapid tests peaked at just over 7.6 million in the week to 17 March, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school. The latest figures also show 974,412 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests - which do need to be sent to a lab - were conducted in the week to 19 May. It is the second highest weekly total since the end of March. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Stefan LÃ¶fven warned that 'the message today is not that the pandemic is over' Swedenâs Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has announced his country will begin easing its Covid-19 restrictions from next week, as part of a five-phase plan. The Nordic nation has never had a lockdown, but it did introduce a number of legally-binding rules to slow the spread of the virus. The first phase comes in on 1 June and will include allowing bars and restaurants to stay open until 10.30pm (two hours later than the current closing time). A maximum number of four people per table will remain in place. Sports arenas will also be able to host socially-distanced events for up to 500 people. This is a major shift, since public events such as sports matches, film screenings and theatre performances have been limited to a maximum of just eight people since the end of 2020, and were capped to 50 people early in the pandemic. Subsequent phases will see numbers gradually increased for both indoor and outdoor events, with the goal of limiting all restrictions for indoor gatherings by September. Sweden was badly hit by the third wave of the coronavirus, but the shifting approach reflects a downward trend in daily cases since mid-April. LÃ¶fven told a news conference that he wanted to offer âa warm thank youâ to Swedes who had made sacrifices. But he said âthe message today is not that the pandemic is overâ and warned that the easing of restrictions could be reversed if the spread of infection went back in the wrong direction. Today's press conference with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, has just come to an end. Here are some of the main points covered:  Jen Williams, of the Manchester Evening News, says local health leaders in Greater Manchester implemented a testing regime before discharging care home residents in March and asks why it took a month to become national policy. She also asks about whether the surge vaccination support in Bolton could be rolled out to other areas of Greater Manchester which are now seeing rising Covid cases. Matt Hancock says ""unfortunately we didn't have the testing capacity to put that policy in place across the whole country"". On Bolton, he says there are ""some early signs"" that the increase in rates is starting to ""cap out"". Dr Jenny Harries says the spread tends to have focal points, such as a school, community centre or faith building and says it is important local understanding is brought into the picture so that surge testing can be put in place in those areas. The Times' Steven Swinford asks if Hancock has spoken to the prime minister since Dominic Cummings accused him of lying and asks if the PM has confidence in his health secretary. He also asks if the roadmap is in doubt, given the spread of the Indian variant. ""The prime minister and I talk all the time,"" Hancock replies. He says they are focused on getting the country out of the pandemic On the second question, Dr Harries says ""the pure data looks quite worrying"" with Indian variant cases doubling in a week. However she adds that this could be due to authorities ""actively detecting"" cases, rather than the variant spreading. Pippa Crerar, of the Daily Mirror, quotes the families of people who died in care homes and asks why Matt Hancock signed off the discharge plan without the proper testing system in place. The health secretary says that the government was dealing with an ""unprecedented situation"" and says it worked ""Incredibly hard to put in place what is needed to fight a pandemic"". ""Of course my heart goes out to all those who have lost loved ones but all I can say is we worked to do everything we could in difficult circumstances,"" he says. He says that the policy has developed and improved as the testing capacity has improved, along with understanding about asymptomatic transmission. Dr Jenny Harries says that looking at the evidence the discharge from hospital ""was actually a very tiny proportional cause"" of cases. She says testing of staff and residents has had a huge impact. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks the health secretary if it is correct that he said in March 2020 hospital-to-care home testing would take place but that didn't turn out to be true because the testing capacity wasn't in place. ""My recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for people going from hospitals into care homes,"" Hancock replies. ""I then went away to build the testing capacity and then delivered on the commitment I made. He says testing ""wasn't possible"" at first because the capacity wasn't there. ""I'm very proud that we built that testing capacity,"" he adds. Asked again whether he told the prime minister that everyone going from hospital to care home would be tested Matt Hancock says that he committed to getting the policy in place but ""it took time to build the testing"". He says that when there was not much testing it had to be prioritised according to clinical need. ""What we had to do was build the testing capacity because there simply wasn't the testing capacity in place at the start of the pandemic,"" he says. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if, following Dominic Cummings' evidence yesterday, Hancock can say he did protect care homes. ""We worked as hard as we could to protect people who live in care homes,"" replies Hancock. He says that in order to test people leaving hospitals and going into care homes, the government had to first build testing capacity. He says setting the 100,000 tests a day target was ""very effective"" at building that capacity, and enabled the government to introduce the policy of testing people going into care homes. Harries adds that the data is complex but their research shows that people going from hospitals to care homes was not ""the majority route of entry"" and that cases were most likely to come through community transmission, such as carers. Pete from Derby asks why the government is allowing lockdown easing to continue when there are new variants spreading. Matt Hancock says the government is working as fast as it can to get people to take up the vaccine and says that ""thankfully"" the vaccines appear to be ""effectively the same"" after two doses against the variant first identified in India as against the Kent variant. Dr Jenny Harries says that we are seeing very high vaccine effectiveness against the Indian variant for both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - although slightly lower than against the Kent variant. But she says ""we do need to be really, really vigilant"", adding that testing people coming into the country is very important. We now turn to questions from the public. Janet from Liverpool says the EU is relaxing rules for fully vaccinated visitors, dispensing with test requirements, and asks if the UK will do the same for visitors. Hancock replies that ""not all adults have been offered the jab"" yet. ""We do want to make sure there is a route to safe international travel in the future,"" he says adding ""that is what the global travel taskforce has been working on."" However he says at the moment ""it is the red, amber and green approach that guides us."" But Dr Jenny Harries says we are not seeing a sharp increase in people being admitted to hospital with Covid. She says when it comes to deaths there is a significant decrease and they have ""predominantly been older people who have not been vaccinated"". She finishes by urging people to get their jabs, saying the second dose is important. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says there has been a ""sustained and sharp decline"" in cases from the middle of January but more recent data shows a ""suggestion"" of an upward rise. Dr Harries says this could be partly due to surge testing actively finding more positive cases - but also says we do know in most cases the new variant is taking the place of the Kent variant - which is something ""we need to watch carefully"". The health secretary now turns to work on producing anti-virals which could suppress further outbreaks. He explains that anti-virals have not yet been approved but the government aims to have two available later this year. He says Eddie Gray, who has previously worked for drugs giant GSK, will chair an anti-viral taskforce. Hancock offers praise to drugs firm AstraZeneca, describing the Oxford vaccine as ""Britain's gift to the world"". He says 450 million doses have now been deployed across the globe. He adds that half a million people have signed up to take part in future clinical trials. And he says the UK government is funding an expansion of an Oxford study which will be the first in the world to look at whether different vaccines can be mixed without reducing effectiveness.

"Simon Woolley, who was knighted in the Queenâs Birthday Honours in June 2019 and is now a life peer, says companies with more than 250 staff should be forced to disclose their pay data ""There's a strong sense that black people are being paid less."" Simon Woolley, a former senior government adviser on race disparity until last year, says it should now be mandatory for companies to disclose their ethnicity pay gap. Unlike gender pay gap reporting, it is not a legal requirement to publish pay-related data based on ethnicity or race. ""It is not the silver bullet,"" Lord Woolley says. ""But your company will be more vibrant if people are being paid what they're worth."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC on Thursday the government took equality ""extremely seriously"", but he wouldn't be drawn on whether ethnicity pay reporting should be a legal requirement. ""We're very focused on equal opportunities for everybody right up and down this country... We want to take people's talents and ingenuity fairly and represent opportunities to everybody,"" he said. Calls for firms to improve diversity and equality in the workplace gathered pace in 2020 - a seismic year. Following the deaths of black Americans George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, the subsequent series of protests calling for an end to racial discrimination prompted a public outpouring of support from the corporate world. Company bosses pledge to recruit more black staff Top 10 tips for diversifying your workplace Companies large and small, around the world, scrambled to make pledges to tackle racism and improve diversity and inclusion. But a year on, what progress have they made? BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme contacted 28 UK-based businesses that were the first to sign up to a pledge to tackle racism in their workplaces. The leaders of those organisations had signed a letter printed in The Sunday Times on 21 June 2020, promising their support to the cause. Sandra Kerr says research shows black employees feel workplace barriers still exist Some of the measures included creating more diverse workforces by setting targets for black talent in recruitment and more diverse shortlists of candidates. Of the 28 companies the BBC approached, 23 responded. A spokesperson for one firm told the BBC they were unable to comment because they were still collecting the relevant information, while three of the businesses did not respond. Accountancy giant KPMG was among those companies to sign the pledge. John McCalla Leacy, a partner and board member, tells the BBC: ""I think, at a personal level, we all saw those awful images come in from the US - and we're a partnership. ""There was just a huge outpouring to do what we could, both individually and corporately. That's what inspired me and my fellow partners to sign this letter."" KPMG quickly published a Black Lives Matter action plan containing five key areas to focus on. Mr McCalla Leacy, who is of black West Indian/Jamaican heritage, says the aim was to create an environment ""where people can talk and learn about challenges that people face, and talk and engage in a constructive way"". George Floyd's death was the catalyst for a summer of protests around the world The pledge KPMG and others signed up to now has more than 80 companies involved, and is being co-ordinated by Involve People, a charity promoting diversity and inclusivity in the workplace. Its chief executive and co-founder, Suki Sandhu, says: ""The aim of the open letter was to effectively hold the companies accountable for driving race and black inclusion in business. ""We're not going to let this be virtue-signalling or something for [businesses] to tick a box. The whole point of them signing is to take the actions in the letter."" Almost every firm that shared their progress with the BBC said they had started conversations or ""listening sessions"", with the company seeking input from colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds to hear their concerns and see what action could be taken as a result. The outsourcing firm Capita said their listening sessions had been attended by more than 2,500 people. Other prominent proponents include Tesco and Marks & Spencer. Many of the 23 businesses said they now deliver training to raise awareness of anti-racism and promote inclusion while the term ""unconscious bias"" was explicitly mentioned by six of the 23 companies. Meanwhile, nine of those 23 firms have committed to publish an ethnicity pay gap report each year. Two of the reports the BBC has seen show a lack of ethnic minority talent in senior roles. Sandra Kerr, race director at Business in the Community, a charity that works with companies to make a social impact, tells the BBC: ""One of the things I wrote last August was a black voices report - and we found real disparities in black employees feeling like they aren't listened to and are unable to get their ideas to the bosses."" Wake Up to Money spoke to a black employee, David (not his real name), who's been working in the rail industry for more than a decade. ""It's a struggle to go any further [in the industry] in terms of career progression. I have applied  for many jobs before, senior roles and I have been knocked back. I've never been given the feedback even though I've requested it."" Several times he has applied for positions unsuccessfully, only for the firm to go and recruit externally. ""Sometimes I feel like your face has got to fit or you've got to know somebody. It's not about your skill set. It's not about what you know, it's about who you know."" Ms Kerr says firms need to ""involve black staff in recruitment processes and idea generation"" to help them climb up the career ladder. Like Lord Woolley she supports mandatory ethnicity pay reporting, adding that leadership is needed from government. A government spokesperson said: ""The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities published its independent report earlier this year, which included recommendations on ethnicity pay reporting. ""We are considering the Commission's findings on this matter alongside feedback to our consultation on this issue and other work, and will respond to the Commission's report in due course."" Suki Sandhu, co-founder and chief executive of Involve People, says improving diversity should not be a ""tick box exercise"" Some measures aimed at making workplaces more diverse and inclusive have been criticised in the past. The government's Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report quoted research from Harvard University, which said that mandatory diversity and inclusion measures have not always been successful, while the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that training on unconscious bias can have limited effect and the potential to back-fire. But the death of George Floyd really has changed the way the corporate world views diversity, KPMG's John McCalla Leacy argues. ""In the time of the pandemic, whereby we're all stuck in lockdown and watching our TVs and phones, you couldn't have missed not only the tragic murder of George Floyd, but the events afterwards. ""There was an outpouring of grief that we've seen among our clients and corporate friends. ""Businesses are making bold claims and want to drive lasting change - and the business community is really supportive of each other so that we can all progress forwards.""

"Prof Heymans has led research trying to unlock the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter An astrophysicist from Edinburgh University is the first woman to be named Astronomer Royal for Scotland. Prof Catherine Heymans was recommended to the Queen for the role by an international panel, convened by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Prof Heymans said she wanted to use the almost 200-year-old title to encourage people to develop passion for science. She also wants to promote Scotland internationally as a world-leading centre for science, she said. Prof Heymans said: ""I don't think anyone forgets the first time they saw the rings of Saturn through a telescope, but too many people never have the chance. ""As Astronomer Royal for Scotland, I want to change that. ""My hope is that once that spark and connection with the universe is made, children will carry that excitement home with them and develop a life-long passion for astronomy or, even better, science as a whole. As the 11th Astronomer Royal, Prof Heymans's main focus will be on sharing her enthusiasm for astronomy with Scots from all walks of life. One of her first targets is to install telescopes at all of Scotland's remote outdoor learning centres, which are visited by most of the country's school pupils. Prof Heymans says she wants to use her role to share her love of science and astronomy with young people Prof Heymans is a world-leading expert on the physics of the so-called dark universe. Her research seeks to shed light on the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter - entities that together account for more than 95% of the universe. As well as working as a professor of astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh she is also director of the German Centre for Cosmological Lensing at Ruhr-University Bochum. Created in 1834, the position of Astronomer Royal for Scotland was originally held by the director of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. Since 1995 it has been awarded as an honorary title. The previous holder, John Brown, died in 2019. Prof Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, said: ""The Astronomer Royal for Scotland has always been a distinguished and respected astronomer, and Professor Heymans is exactly that. ""She will also always be distinguished as the first female to hold the position.""

"Rising numbers of patients needing care and a shortage of GPs is threatening to overwhelm the system, doctors and patient groups are warning. It comes after the pandemic has caused severe disruption to GP practices for more than a year. Analysis of NHS England data by the Health Foundation found more than 28 million appointments were booked in March, among the highest recorded. Doctors' leaders say what they are being asked to achieve is ""undoable"". The analysis of NHS Digital data in England carried out by the Health Foundation for the BBC also found that that between 2019-20 and 2020-21: The total number of appointments dropped by 10% - meaning 31 million fewer consultations with GPs and practice nurses Major shift from face-to-face to remote consultation, with the proportion seen in practices dropping from 79% to 54% The number of patients referred by GPs for urgent cancer check-ups dropped by 15%, putting lives at risk The escalating situation has prompted patient groups to call for an urgent review of access to services, amid reports that patients are struggling to get through. This video can not be played Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster, opened his doors to the BBC to show the pressures facing practices Doncaster-based GP Dr Dean Eggitt has never seen anything like this: ""We have almost a tsunami of patients coming to us - it feels like the river has flooded the banks. ""It just keeps coming and coming and coming in this one massive, endless wave of patients who all are ill and need help and input. ""They're sick, they're complex and we've got very few places to send them. I wouldn't want to be my patient right now."" Dr Eggitt's experience is not unique. There were 28.4 million appointments in March, once you include those made with practice nurses as well as GPs - that is one of the highest on record. But he says he worries most about the ""hidden wave of patients who don't get through"". One of those is Sharron, who ended up in hospital after she struggled on at home for weeks getting more and more sick. She was eventually diagnosed with colitis and had lost so much blood, she needed four emergency blood transfusions. She says a combination of busy phone lines and not wanting to bother the practice meant she deteriorated at home. ""When I finally got through I knew I was really poorly, I had never felt so ill in my life."" She was immediately invited in for a consultation and sent to hospital. There could be millions of people in a similar position. There were 279 million appointments made with GP practices in England from April 2020 to March 2021, compared with 310 million the year before. The biggest drops were seen in the Midlands, North East, Yorkshire and East of England, according to the Health Foundation analysis. The data is not collected elsewhere in the UK, but the reports surfacing suggest the problems are similar. That has, the Health Foundation warns, created a huge amount of unmet need. This much can be seen from the drop in urgent referrals where GPs suspect someone has cancer. The numbers sent to hospital for check-ups have dropped by 15% since the pandemic started - that's potentially 367,000 people with symptoms who have not been sent for further investigations. Sara Bainbridge, from Macmillan Cancer Support, says the disruption to services has had a ""devastating impact"", saying it is leading to fewer diagnoses, and reducing survival chances. And it's not just cancer patients. Dr Becks Fisher, a GP in Oxford and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation, says there are people with other serious conditions, such as heart failure and non-Covid respiratory problems, who have stayed away too. ""Their health will have deteriorated as they have not been getting the help they need. The people we are seeing now are coming in with really complex problems. And it is those in deprived areas who have been affected the most."" She says this is being compounded by a significant rise in people seeking help with mental health problems, as well as those ""ricocheting"" back from hospital because their health has worsened while waiting for treatment. Latest figures show there are more than 400,000 people who have been waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements - up from 1,600 when the pandemic began. ""I think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at the moment - this is going to get a lot worse in the coming months"" added Dr Fisher. One of the key barriers, some say, is the lack of face-to-face care that is available. Social distancing restrictions and infection control procedures mean GPs have had to rely heavily on remote consultations. The number of face-to-face consultations has dropped significantly - down from 79% of total appointments in 2019-20 to 54% in 2020-21. And even now with restrictions easing, the numbers being brought in are still well short of what they were. One of those who has fallen foul of this is Helen Cowley, 55, from Swindon. She had a telephone consultation for ear pain and was advised to seek private treatment for the build-up of ear wax. When she got to the clinic, they diagnosed an ear infection and she had to phone her practice back. ""It was nearly two months before I got the proper treatment - and to be fair I thought it was ear wax too. It was obviously not the most serious problem in the world, but not being able to be seen face-to-face is not ideal. You can see how things can be missed and for some patients that may have huge consequences."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England is particularly concerned about the lack of face-to-face appointments, and is calling for an urgent review into the situation. National Director Imelda Redmond said while remote consultations suit some patients, there are many who have struggled with the arrangements that have been put in place. ""Those affected are often the most vulnerable in our society - older people, disabled people, those affected by homelessness and on low incomes."" The issue has already prompted action at the highest level. NHS England wrote to GPs in mid-May saying patients must be offered face-to-face appointments if that is their preference, unless there was good reason not to, such as the patient displaying Covid symptoms. Extra funding has been provided too. But the move has been met with some opposition from GP leaders who have raised concerns about the lack of space in GP practice buildings, with the British Medical Association's GPs committee even passing a motion of no confidence in NHS England. BMA GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey says doctors were left ""angry, frustrated and disappointed"" by the letter, especially given the ""incredible contribution"" GPs have made to the vaccination programme - around three-quarters of jabs have been given in GP-led settings. In many ways, this is a problem that has been building for a while. There has been a big push in recent years by the government to increase the number of GPs to keep up with rising demand, but once you exclude locums and trainees the number of permanent GPs has actually fallen by nearly 2,000 in the past few years to just under 27,000 full-time GPs. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it means what is being asked of the profession now is simply ""undoable"". ""General practice was already facing intense workforce and workload pressures - the pandemic has only exacerbated these. We urgently need more GPs and other members of the practice team.""

Today's coverage has been written by: Doug Faulkner, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Lauren Turner, Kate Whannel and Sinead WIlson. It was edited by James Clarke and Rob Corp. We'll be back tomorrow for more updates from the UK and around the world. We are bringing our coronavirus live page to a close shortly. These are some of the stories we have been looking at today:  Remember you can find out more about the number of coronavirus cases in your areahere.    Reality Check Most of the questions from
journalists to Health Secretary Matt Hancock at the Downing Street press conference focused on a claim about care
homes made by Dominic Cummings yesterday. ""We were told categorically
in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We
only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened,"" Cummings said,
adding that it was Hancock who had made that claim. But Hancock said that the
testing capacity was not available at the time. âMy
recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for
people going from hospital into care homes when we could do it,â he said. âI then went
away and built the testing capacityâ¦ and then delivered on the commitment that
I made.â You can read more about Cummings' claims here. The daughter of a man who died with Covid-19 says if he had been tested when he was ready to be discharged from hospital, he would ""probably still be alive today"". Bernard Kirton died on 7 April last year. His daughter Fiona is a member of he Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which is calling for an urgent inquiry into the governmentâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but spoke to the BBC in a personal capacity. She said her father was fit for discharge after going into hospital following a fall - but the care home they found for him would only accept him if he had a Covid test. The hospital refused to do this, she said, as he had no symptoms, later telling her this was a Public Health England decision. Two weeks after this, another care home was found - but four hours later, he tested positive for coronavirus. ""It wasn't just something that was missed,"" she said. ""He caught it in the ward in a time period when he didn't need to be there, because the hospital wouldn't test him. ""That care home that insisted on testing did not have any cases throughout the pandemic. Had he been tested...he would probably still be alive today."" She said she had been ""relieved"" to hear Dominic Cummings speak yesterday on care homes and testing as he confirmed what she had suspected.

Packs of tests have been handed out in public The number of rapid Covid-19 tests carried out in England has fallen to its lowest level in five weeks. That's despite all members of the public being eligible to take two rapid tests a week, for free. The latest Test and Trace figures show just under 4.9 million of the lateral flow device tests were carried out in the week to 19 May, which is down 4% from the previous week. It is the fourth week in a row the number has decreased. The swab tests give results in 30 minutes or less, without samples having to be sent to a lab for processing. Some are carried out in places such as schools and care homes but many are done at home, with people then expected to report their results. The number of rapid tests peaked at just over 7.6 million in the week to 17 March, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school. The latest figures also show 974,412 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests - which do need to be sent to a lab - were conducted in the week to 19 May. It is the second highest weekly total since the end of March. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Stefan LÃ¶fven warned that 'the message today is not that the pandemic is over' Swedenâs Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has announced his country will begin easing its Covid-19 restrictions from next week, as part of a five-phase plan. The Nordic nation has never had a lockdown, but it did introduce a number of legally-binding rules to slow the spread of the virus. The first phase comes in on 1 June and will include allowing bars and restaurants to stay open until 10.30pm (two hours later than the current closing time). A maximum number of four people per table will remain in place. Sports arenas will also be able to host socially-distanced events for up to 500 people. This is a major shift, since public events such as sports matches, film screenings and theatre performances have been limited to a maximum of just eight people since the end of 2020, and were capped to 50 people early in the pandemic. Subsequent phases will see numbers gradually increased for both indoor and outdoor events, with the goal of limiting all restrictions for indoor gatherings by September. Sweden was badly hit by the third wave of the coronavirus, but the shifting approach reflects a downward trend in daily cases since mid-April. LÃ¶fven told a news conference that he wanted to offer âa warm thank youâ to Swedes who had made sacrifices. But he said âthe message today is not that the pandemic is overâ and warned that the easing of restrictions could be reversed if the spread of infection went back in the wrong direction. Today's press conference with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, has just come to an end. Here are some of the main points covered:  Jen Williams, of the Manchester Evening News, says local health leaders in Greater Manchester implemented a testing regime before discharging care home residents in March and asks why it took a month to become national policy. She also asks about whether the surge vaccination support in Bolton could be rolled out to other areas of Greater Manchester which are now seeing rising Covid cases. Matt Hancock says ""unfortunately we didn't have the testing capacity to put that policy in place across the whole country"". On Bolton, he says there are ""some early signs"" that the increase in rates is starting to ""cap out"". Dr Jenny Harries says the spread tends to have focal points, such as a school, community centre or faith building and says it is important local understanding is brought into the picture so that surge testing can be put in place in those areas. The Times' Steven Swinford asks if Hancock has spoken to the prime minister since Dominic Cummings accused him of lying and asks if the PM has confidence in his health secretary. He also asks if the roadmap is in doubt, given the spread of the Indian variant. ""The prime minister and I talk all the time,"" Hancock replies. He says they are focused on getting the country out of the pandemic On the second question, Dr Harries says ""the pure data looks quite worrying"" with Indian variant cases doubling in a week. However she adds that this could be due to authorities ""actively detecting"" cases, rather than the variant spreading. Pippa Crerar, of the Daily Mirror, quotes the families of people who died in care homes and asks why Matt Hancock signed off the discharge plan without the proper testing system in place. The health secretary says that the government was dealing with an ""unprecedented situation"" and says it worked ""Incredibly hard to put in place what is needed to fight a pandemic"". ""Of course my heart goes out to all those who have lost loved ones but all I can say is we worked to do everything we could in difficult circumstances,"" he says. He says that the policy has developed and improved as the testing capacity has improved, along with understanding about asymptomatic transmission. Dr Jenny Harries says that looking at the evidence the discharge from hospital ""was actually a very tiny proportional cause"" of cases. She says testing of staff and residents has had a huge impact. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks the health secretary if it is correct that he said in March 2020 hospital-to-care home testing would take place but that didn't turn out to be true because the testing capacity wasn't in place. ""My recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for people going from hospitals into care homes,"" Hancock replies. ""I then went away to build the testing capacity and then delivered on the commitment I made. He says testing ""wasn't possible"" at first because the capacity wasn't there. ""I'm very proud that we built that testing capacity,"" he adds. Asked again whether he told the prime minister that everyone going from hospital to care home would be tested Matt Hancock says that he committed to getting the policy in place but ""it took time to build the testing"". He says that when there was not much testing it had to be prioritised according to clinical need. ""What we had to do was build the testing capacity because there simply wasn't the testing capacity in place at the start of the pandemic,"" he says. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if, following Dominic Cummings' evidence yesterday, Hancock can say he did protect care homes. ""We worked as hard as we could to protect people who live in care homes,"" replies Hancock. He says that in order to test people leaving hospitals and going into care homes, the government had to first build testing capacity. He says setting the 100,000 tests a day target was ""very effective"" at building that capacity, and enabled the government to introduce the policy of testing people going into care homes. Harries adds that the data is complex but their research shows that people going from hospitals to care homes was not ""the majority route of entry"" and that cases were most likely to come through community transmission, such as carers. Pete from Derby asks why the government is allowing lockdown easing to continue when there are new variants spreading. Matt Hancock says the government is working as fast as it can to get people to take up the vaccine and says that ""thankfully"" the vaccines appear to be ""effectively the same"" after two doses against the variant first identified in India as against the Kent variant. Dr Jenny Harries says that we are seeing very high vaccine effectiveness against the Indian variant for both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - although slightly lower than against the Kent variant. But she says ""we do need to be really, really vigilant"", adding that testing people coming into the country is very important. We now turn to questions from the public. Janet from Liverpool says the EU is relaxing rules for fully vaccinated visitors, dispensing with test requirements, and asks if the UK will do the same for visitors. Hancock replies that ""not all adults have been offered the jab"" yet. ""We do want to make sure there is a route to safe international travel in the future,"" he says adding ""that is what the global travel taskforce has been working on."" However he says at the moment ""it is the red, amber and green approach that guides us."" But Dr Jenny Harries says we are not seeing a sharp increase in people being admitted to hospital with Covid. She says when it comes to deaths there is a significant decrease and they have ""predominantly been older people who have not been vaccinated"". She finishes by urging people to get their jabs, saying the second dose is important. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says there has been a ""sustained and sharp decline"" in cases from the middle of January but more recent data shows a ""suggestion"" of an upward rise. Dr Harries says this could be partly due to surge testing actively finding more positive cases - but also says we do know in most cases the new variant is taking the place of the Kent variant - which is something ""we need to watch carefully"". The health secretary now turns to work on producing anti-virals which could suppress further outbreaks. He explains that anti-virals have not yet been approved but the government aims to have two available later this year. He says Eddie Gray, who has previously worked for drugs giant GSK, will chair an anti-viral taskforce. Hancock offers praise to drugs firm AstraZeneca, describing the Oxford vaccine as ""Britain's gift to the world"". He says 450 million doses have now been deployed across the globe. He adds that half a million people have signed up to take part in future clinical trials. And he says the UK government is funding an expansion of an Oxford study which will be the first in the world to look at whether different vaccines can be mixed without reducing effectiveness.

"Simon Woolley, who was knighted in the Queenâs Birthday Honours in June 2019 and is now a life peer, says companies with more than 250 staff should be forced to disclose their pay data ""There's a strong sense that black people are being paid less."" Simon Woolley, a former senior government adviser on race disparity until last year, says it should now be mandatory for companies to disclose their ethnicity pay gap. Unlike gender pay gap reporting, it is not a legal requirement to publish pay-related data based on ethnicity or race. ""It is not the silver bullet,"" Lord Woolley says. ""But your company will be more vibrant if people are being paid what they're worth."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC on Thursday the government took equality ""extremely seriously"", but he wouldn't be drawn on whether ethnicity pay reporting should be a legal requirement. ""We're very focused on equal opportunities for everybody right up and down this country... We want to take people's talents and ingenuity fairly and represent opportunities to everybody,"" he said. Calls for firms to improve diversity and equality in the workplace gathered pace in 2020 - a seismic year. Following the deaths of black Americans George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, the subsequent series of protests calling for an end to racial discrimination prompted a public outpouring of support from the corporate world. Company bosses pledge to recruit more black staff Top 10 tips for diversifying your workplace Companies large and small, around the world, scrambled to make pledges to tackle racism and improve diversity and inclusion. But a year on, what progress have they made? BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme contacted 28 UK-based businesses that were the first to sign up to a pledge to tackle racism in their workplaces. The leaders of those organisations had signed a letter printed in The Sunday Times on 21 June 2020, promising their support to the cause. Sandra Kerr says research shows black employees feel workplace barriers still exist Some of the measures included creating more diverse workforces by setting targets for black talent in recruitment and more diverse shortlists of candidates. Of the 28 companies the BBC approached, 23 responded. A spokesperson for one firm told the BBC they were unable to comment because they were still collecting the relevant information, while three of the businesses did not respond. Accountancy giant KPMG was among those companies to sign the pledge. John McCalla Leacy, a partner and board member, tells the BBC: ""I think, at a personal level, we all saw those awful images come in from the US - and we're a partnership. ""There was just a huge outpouring to do what we could, both individually and corporately. That's what inspired me and my fellow partners to sign this letter."" KPMG quickly published a Black Lives Matter action plan containing five key areas to focus on. Mr McCalla Leacy, who is of black West Indian/Jamaican heritage, says the aim was to create an environment ""where people can talk and learn about challenges that people face, and talk and engage in a constructive way"". George Floyd's death was the catalyst for a summer of protests around the world The pledge KPMG and others signed up to now has more than 80 companies involved, and is being co-ordinated by Involve People, a charity promoting diversity and inclusivity in the workplace. Its chief executive and co-founder, Suki Sandhu, says: ""The aim of the open letter was to effectively hold the companies accountable for driving race and black inclusion in business. ""We're not going to let this be virtue-signalling or something for [businesses] to tick a box. The whole point of them signing is to take the actions in the letter."" Almost every firm that shared their progress with the BBC said they had started conversations or ""listening sessions"", with the company seeking input from colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds to hear their concerns and see what action could be taken as a result. The outsourcing firm Capita said their listening sessions had been attended by more than 2,500 people. Other prominent proponents include Tesco and Marks & Spencer. Many of the 23 businesses said they now deliver training to raise awareness of anti-racism and promote inclusion while the term ""unconscious bias"" was explicitly mentioned by six of the 23 companies. Meanwhile, nine of those 23 firms have committed to publish an ethnicity pay gap report each year. Two of the reports the BBC has seen show a lack of ethnic minority talent in senior roles. Sandra Kerr, race director at Business in the Community, a charity that works with companies to make a social impact, tells the BBC: ""One of the things I wrote last August was a black voices report - and we found real disparities in black employees feeling like they aren't listened to and are unable to get their ideas to the bosses."" Wake Up to Money spoke to a black employee, David (not his real name), who's been working in the rail industry for more than a decade. ""It's a struggle to go any further [in the industry] in terms of career progression. I have applied  for many jobs before, senior roles and I have been knocked back. I've never been given the feedback even though I've requested it."" Several times he has applied for positions unsuccessfully, only for the firm to go and recruit externally. ""Sometimes I feel like your face has got to fit or you've got to know somebody. It's not about your skill set. It's not about what you know, it's about who you know."" Ms Kerr says firms need to ""involve black staff in recruitment processes and idea generation"" to help them climb up the career ladder. Like Lord Woolley she supports mandatory ethnicity pay reporting, adding that leadership is needed from government. A government spokesperson said: ""The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities published its independent report earlier this year, which included recommendations on ethnicity pay reporting. ""We are considering the Commission's findings on this matter alongside feedback to our consultation on this issue and other work, and will respond to the Commission's report in due course."" Suki Sandhu, co-founder and chief executive of Involve People, says improving diversity should not be a ""tick box exercise"" Some measures aimed at making workplaces more diverse and inclusive have been criticised in the past. The government's Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report quoted research from Harvard University, which said that mandatory diversity and inclusion measures have not always been successful, while the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that training on unconscious bias can have limited effect and the potential to back-fire. But the death of George Floyd really has changed the way the corporate world views diversity, KPMG's John McCalla Leacy argues. ""In the time of the pandemic, whereby we're all stuck in lockdown and watching our TVs and phones, you couldn't have missed not only the tragic murder of George Floyd, but the events afterwards. ""There was an outpouring of grief that we've seen among our clients and corporate friends. ""Businesses are making bold claims and want to drive lasting change - and the business community is really supportive of each other so that we can all progress forwards.""

These are some of the stories we have been looking at today:  Remember you can find out more about the number of coronavirus cases in your areahere.    Reality Check Most of the questions from
journalists to Health Secretary Matt Hancock at the Downing Street press conference focused on a claim about care
homes made by Dominic Cummings yesterday. ""We were told categorically
in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We
only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened,"" Cummings said,
adding that it was Hancock who had made that claim. But Hancock said that the
testing capacity was not available at the time. âMy

people going from hospital into care homes when we could do it,â he said. âI then went

The daughter of a man who died with Covid-19 says if he had been tested when he was ready to be discharged from hospital, he would ""probably still be alive today"". Bernard Kirton died on 7 April last year. His daughter Fiona is a member of he Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which is calling for an urgent inquiry into the governmentâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but spoke to the BBC in a personal capacity. She said her father was fit for discharge after going into hospital following a fall - but the care home they found for him would only accept him if he had a Covid test. The hospital refused to do this, she said, as he had no symptoms, later telling her this was a Public Health England decision. Two weeks after this, another care home was found - but four hours later, he tested positive for coronavirus. ""It wasn't just something that was missed,"" she said. ""He caught it in the ward in a time period when he didn't need to be there, because the hospital wouldn't test him. ""That care home that insisted on testing did not have any cases throughout the pandemic. Had he been tested...he would probably still be alive today."" She said she had been ""relieved"" to hear Dominic Cummings speak yesterday on care homes and testing as he confirmed what she had suspected. She added: ""I can only thank Dominic Cummings, who I didnât have a very high opinion of, for exposing what has gone on.""

in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We
only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened,"" Cummings said,
adding that it was Hancock who had made that claim. But Hancock said that the
testing capacity was not available at the time. âMy
recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for
people going from hospital into care homes when we could do it,â he said. âI then went
away and built the testing capacityâ¦ and then delivered on the commitment that
I made.â You can read more about Cummings' claims here. The daughter of a man who died with Covid-19 says if he had been tested when he was ready to be discharged from hospital, he would ""probably still be alive today"". Bernard Kirton died on 7 April last year. His daughter Fiona is a member of he Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which is calling for an urgent inquiry into the governmentâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but spoke to the BBC in a personal capacity. She said her father was fit for discharge after going into hospital following a fall - but the care home they found for him would only accept him if he had a Covid test. The hospital refused to do this, she said, as he had no symptoms, later telling her this was a Public Health England decision. Two weeks after this, another care home was found - but four hours later, he tested positive for coronavirus. ""It wasn't just something that was missed,"" she said. ""He caught it in the ward in a time period when he didn't need to be there, because the hospital wouldn't test him. ""That care home that insisted on testing did not have any cases throughout the pandemic. Had he been tested...he would probably still be alive today."" She said she had been ""relieved"" to hear Dominic Cummings speak yesterday on care homes and testing as he confirmed what she had suspected. She added: ""I can only thank Dominic Cummings, who I didnât have a very high opinion of, for exposing what has gone on."" This video can not be played When he found out his son had leukaemia Jason Josephson says he just wanted to rush in to the hospital to hug his child and wife. But he had to stay sitting in the car park of their local hospital in Carmarthen - he wasn't allowed to go inside because of Covid rules. ""It crushed me,"" he says. ""I couldn't imagine how my wife was feeling. ""I just wanted to get into the hospital and put my arms around both of them but I was informed that I was not allowed. I couldn't think of a worse pain."" Now 19 months old, Carson needs regular treatment at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff. The rule is still that only one parent can go with him for appointments, so Jason has to continue to wait for hours for news of his son's condition. Each health board is allowed discretion to agree to visits under the Welsh government guidance, but Cardiff and Vale health board says it makes allowances ""as appropriate"". Packs of tests have been handed out in public The number of rapid Covid-19 tests carried out in England has fallen to its lowest level in five weeks. That's despite all members of the public being eligible to take two rapid tests a week, for free. The latest Test and Trace figures show just under 4.9 million of the lateral flow device tests were carried out in the week to 19 May, which is down 4% from the previous week. It is the fourth week in a row the number has decreased. The swab tests give results in 30 minutes or less, without samples having to be sent to a lab for processing. Some are carried out in places such as schools and care homes but many are done at home, with people then expected to report their results. The number of rapid tests peaked at just over 7.6 million in the week to 17 March, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school. The latest figures also show 974,412 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests - which do need to be sent to a lab - were conducted in the week to 19 May. It is the second highest weekly total since the end of March. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Stefan LÃ¶fven warned that 'the message today is not that the pandemic is over' Swedenâs Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has announced his country will begin easing its Covid-19 restrictions from next week, as part of a five-phase plan. The Nordic nation has never had a lockdown, but it did introduce a number of legally-binding rules to slow the spread of the virus. The first phase comes in on 1 June and will include allowing bars and restaurants to stay open until 10.30pm (two hours later than the current closing time). A maximum number of four people per table will remain in place. Sports arenas will also be able to host socially-distanced events for up to 500 people. This is a major shift, since public events such as sports matches, film screenings and theatre performances have been limited to a maximum of just eight people since the end of 2020, and were capped to 50 people early in the pandemic. Subsequent phases will see numbers gradually increased for both indoor and outdoor events, with the goal of limiting all restrictions for indoor gatherings by September. Sweden was badly hit by the third wave of the coronavirus, but the shifting approach reflects a downward trend in daily cases since mid-April. LÃ¶fven told a news conference that he wanted to offer âa warm thank youâ to Swedes who had made sacrifices. But he said âthe message today is not that the pandemic is overâ and warned that the easing of restrictions could be reversed if the spread of infection went back in the wrong direction. Today's press conference with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, has just come to an end. Here are some of the main points covered:  Jen Williams, of the Manchester Evening News, says local health leaders in Greater Manchester implemented a testing regime before discharging care home residents in March and asks why it took a month to become national policy. She also asks about whether the surge vaccination support in Bolton could be rolled out to other areas of Greater Manchester which are now seeing rising Covid cases. Matt Hancock says ""unfortunately we didn't have the testing capacity to put that policy in place across the whole country"". On Bolton, he says there are ""some early signs"" that the increase in rates is starting to ""cap out"". Dr Jenny Harries says the spread tends to have focal points, such as a school, community centre or faith building and says it is important local understanding is brought into the picture so that surge testing can be put in place in those areas. The Times' Steven Swinford asks if Hancock has spoken to the prime minister since Dominic Cummings accused him of lying and asks if the PM has confidence in his health secretary. He also asks if the roadmap is in doubt, given the spread of the Indian variant. ""The prime minister and I talk all the time,"" Hancock replies. He says they are focused on getting the country out of the pandemic On the second question, Dr Harries says ""the pure data looks quite worrying"" with Indian variant cases doubling in a week. However she adds that this could be due to authorities ""actively detecting"" cases, rather than the variant spreading. Pippa Crerar, of the Daily Mirror, quotes the families of people who died in care homes and asks why Matt Hancock signed off the discharge plan without the proper testing system in place. The health secretary says that the government was dealing with an ""unprecedented situation"" and says it worked ""Incredibly hard to put in place what is needed to fight a pandemic"". ""Of course my heart goes out to all those who have lost loved ones but all I can say is we worked to do everything we could in difficult circumstances,"" he says. He says that the policy has developed and improved as the testing capacity has improved, along with understanding about asymptomatic transmission. Dr Jenny Harries says that looking at the evidence the discharge from hospital ""was actually a very tiny proportional cause"" of cases. She says testing of staff and residents has had a huge impact. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks the health secretary if it is correct that he said in March 2020 hospital-to-care home testing would take place but that didn't turn out to be true because the testing capacity wasn't in place. ""My recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for people going from hospitals into care homes,"" Hancock replies. ""I then went away to build the testing capacity and then delivered on the commitment I made. He says testing ""wasn't possible"" at first because the capacity wasn't there. ""I'm very proud that we built that testing capacity,"" he adds. Asked again whether he told the prime minister that everyone going from hospital to care home would be tested Matt Hancock says that he committed to getting the policy in place but ""it took time to build the testing"". He says that when there was not much testing it had to be prioritised according to clinical need. ""What we had to do was build the testing capacity because there simply wasn't the testing capacity in place at the start of the pandemic,"" he says. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if, following Dominic Cummings' evidence yesterday, Hancock can say he did protect care homes. ""We worked as hard as we could to protect people who live in care homes,"" replies Hancock. He says that in order to test people leaving hospitals and going into care homes, the government had to first build testing capacity. He says setting the 100,000 tests a day target was ""very effective"" at building that capacity, and enabled the government to introduce the policy of testing people going into care homes. Harries adds that the data is complex but their research shows that people going from hospitals to care homes was not ""the majority route of entry"" and that cases were most likely to come through community transmission, such as carers. Pete from Derby asks why the government is allowing lockdown easing to continue when there are new variants spreading. Matt Hancock says the government is working as fast as it can to get people to take up the vaccine and says that ""thankfully"" the vaccines appear to be ""effectively the same"" after two doses against the variant first identified in India as against the Kent variant. Dr Jenny Harries says that we are seeing very high vaccine effectiveness against the Indian variant for both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - although slightly lower than against the Kent variant. But she says ""we do need to be really, really vigilant"", adding that testing people coming into the country is very important. We now turn to questions from the public. Janet from Liverpool says the EU is relaxing rules for fully vaccinated visitors, dispensing with test requirements, and asks if the UK will do the same for visitors. Hancock replies that ""not all adults have been offered the jab"" yet. ""We do want to make sure there is a route to safe international travel in the future,"" he says adding ""that is what the global travel taskforce has been working on."" However he says at the moment ""it is the red, amber and green approach that guides us."" But Dr Jenny Harries says we are not seeing a sharp increase in people being admitted to hospital with Covid. She says when it comes to deaths there is a significant decrease and they have ""predominantly been older people who have not been vaccinated"". She finishes by urging people to get their jabs, saying the second dose is important. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says there has been a ""sustained and sharp decline"" in cases from the middle of January but more recent data shows a ""suggestion"" of an upward rise. Dr Harries says this could be partly due to surge testing actively finding more positive cases - but also says we do know in most cases the new variant is taking the place of the Kent variant - which is something ""we need to watch carefully"". The health secretary now turns to work on producing anti-virals which could suppress further outbreaks. He explains that anti-virals have not yet been approved but the government aims to have two available later this year. He says Eddie Gray, who has previously worked for drugs giant GSK, will chair an anti-viral taskforce. Hancock offers praise to drugs firm AstraZeneca, describing the Oxford vaccine as ""Britain's gift to the world"". He says 450 million doses have now been deployed across the globe. He adds that half a million people have signed up to take part in future clinical trials. And he says the UK government is funding an expansion of an Oxford study which will be the first in the world to look at whether different vaccines can be mixed without reducing effectiveness.

If he returns therefore the signs will be positive. Mark Simon StoneBBC Sport After the chaos since his exit, many Tottenham fans would welcome the return of Pochettino with open arms. But it may be wise for those supporters not to celebrate too soon. Firstly, PSG's stance of planning ahead with the man they only appointed in January doesn't inspire much confidence. Would Pochettino be publicly prepared to say he wanted out of the French capital, if, indeed, that is his wish? The problem for Tottenham is that after so much negativity around the ownership, an inability to secure Pochettino for a second time will look like failure and increase the pressure still further. With the Kane situation unresolved, Levy needs to bring some kind of stability to the situation, whether that includes his popular former manager or not. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Never mind Zidane, can someone please start whipping up some speculation about Antonio Conte for Old Trafford.

"Simon Woolley, who was knighted in the Queenâs Birthday Honours in June 2019 and is now a life peer, says companies with more than 250 staff should be forced to disclose their pay data ""There's a strong sense that black people are being paid less."" Simon Woolley, a former senior government adviser on race disparity until last year, says it should now be mandatory for companies to disclose their ethnicity pay gap. Unlike gender pay gap reporting, it is not a legal requirement to publish pay-related data based on ethnicity or race. ""It is not the silver bullet,"" Lord Woolley says. ""But your company will be more vibrant if people are being paid what they're worth."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC on Thursday the government took equality ""extremely seriously"", but he wouldn't be drawn on whether ethnicity pay reporting should be a legal requirement. ""We're very focused on equal opportunities for everybody right up and down this country... We want to take people's talents and ingenuity fairly and represent opportunities to everybody,"" he said. Calls for firms to improve diversity and equality in the workplace gathered pace in 2020 - a seismic year. Following the deaths of black Americans George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, the subsequent series of protests calling for an end to racial discrimination prompted a public outpouring of support from the corporate world. Company bosses pledge to recruit more black staff Top 10 tips for diversifying your workplace Companies large and small, around the world, scrambled to make pledges to tackle racism and improve diversity and inclusion. But a year on, what progress have they made? BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up to Money programme contacted 28 UK-based businesses that were the first to sign up to a pledge to tackle racism in their workplaces. The leaders of those organisations had signed a letter printed in The Sunday Times on 21 June 2020, promising their support to the cause. Sandra Kerr says research shows black employees feel workplace barriers still exist Some of the measures included creating more diverse workforces by setting targets for black talent in recruitment and more diverse shortlists of candidates. Of the 28 companies the BBC approached, 23 responded. A spokesperson for one firm told the BBC they were unable to comment because they were still collecting the relevant information, while three of the businesses did not respond. Accountancy giant KPMG was among those companies to sign the pledge. John McCalla Leacy, a partner and board member, tells the BBC: ""I think, at a personal level, we all saw those awful images come in from the US - and we're a partnership. ""There was just a huge outpouring to do what we could, both individually and corporately. That's what inspired me and my fellow partners to sign this letter."" KPMG quickly published a Black Lives Matter action plan containing five key areas to focus on. Mr McCalla Leacy, who is of black West Indian/Jamaican heritage, says the aim was to create an environment ""where people can talk and learn about challenges that people face, and talk and engage in a constructive way"". George Floyd's death was the catalyst for a summer of protests around the world The pledge KPMG and others signed up to now has more than 80 companies involved, and is being co-ordinated by Involve People, a charity promoting diversity and inclusivity in the workplace. Its chief executive and co-founder, Suki Sandhu, says: ""The aim of the open letter was to effectively hold the companies accountable for driving race and black inclusion in business. ""We're not going to let this be virtue-signalling or something for [businesses] to tick a box. The whole point of them signing is to take the actions in the letter."" Almost every firm that shared their progress with the BBC said they had started conversations or ""listening sessions"", with the company seeking input from colleagues from ethnic minority backgrounds to hear their concerns and see what action could be taken as a result. The outsourcing firm Capita said their listening sessions had been attended by more than 2,500 people. Other prominent proponents include Tesco and Marks & Spencer. Many of the 23 businesses said they now deliver training to raise awareness of anti-racism and promote inclusion while the term ""unconscious bias"" was explicitly mentioned by six of the 23 companies. Meanwhile, nine of those 23 firms have committed to publish an ethnicity pay gap report each year. Two of the reports the BBC has seen show a lack of ethnic minority talent in senior roles. Sandra Kerr, race director at Business in the Community, a charity that works with companies to make a social impact, tells the BBC: ""One of the things I wrote last August was a black voices report - and we found real disparities in black employees feeling like they aren't listened to and are unable to get their ideas to the bosses."" Wake Up to Money spoke to a black employee, David (not his real name), who's been working in the rail industry for more than a decade. ""It's a struggle to go any further [in the industry] in terms of career progression. I have applied  for many jobs before, senior roles and I have been knocked back. I've never been given the feedback even though I've requested it."" Several times he has applied for positions unsuccessfully, only for the firm to go and recruit externally. ""Sometimes I feel like your face has got to fit or you've got to know somebody. It's not about your skill set. It's not about what you know, it's about who you know."" Ms Kerr says firms need to ""involve black staff in recruitment processes and idea generation"" to help them climb up the career ladder. Like Lord Woolley she supports mandatory ethnicity pay reporting, adding that leadership is needed from government. A government spokesperson said: ""The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities published its independent report earlier this year, which included recommendations on ethnicity pay reporting. ""We are considering the Commission's findings on this matter alongside feedback to our consultation on this issue and other work, and will respond to the Commission's report in due course."" Suki Sandhu, co-founder and chief executive of Involve People, says improving diversity should not be a ""tick box exercise"" Some measures aimed at making workplaces more diverse and inclusive have been criticised in the past. The government's Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities report quoted research from Harvard University, which said that mandatory diversity and inclusion measures have not always been successful, while the Equality and Human Rights Commission found that training on unconscious bias can have limited effect and the potential to back-fire. But the death of George Floyd really has changed the way the corporate world views diversity, KPMG's John McCalla Leacy argues. ""In the time of the pandemic, whereby we're all stuck in lockdown and watching our TVs and phones, you couldn't have missed not only the tragic murder of George Floyd, but the events afterwards. ""There was an outpouring of grief that we've seen among our clients and corporate friends. ""Businesses are making bold claims and want to drive lasting change - and the business community is really supportive of each other so that we can all progress forwards.""

"Abortion was decriminalised in Northern Ireland in 2019 after Westminster acted during the absence of devolution Delays in implementing Northern Ireland's abortion laws have been a ""deeply troubling exercise in finger-pointing"", a court has heard. Abortion became legal in 2020, following a vote by MPs during the collapse of devolution. Stormont has since been under pressure to establish a permanent, central abortion service, but this has not happened yet. It is being challenged in a judicial review at the High Court in Belfast. The NI Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) is taking the case against the Northern Ireland Executive, the Department of Health and the Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. Representing the NIHRC, David Blundell QC said there had been an ""abdication of legal responsibility"" by all three parties. He told Mr Justice Colton that the main factor in taking the case was the protection of women's human rights. Mr Blundell said without a fully-funded and staffed model, Northern Ireland health trusts have only been able to operate a ""skeleton service"" for early medical abortions - up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. Women seeking a termination beyond that gestation have still been required, in some circumstances, to travel to England during the coronavirus pandemic, the court was told. The judicial review has been brought by the NI Human Rights Commission against Stormont and Westminster ""Much was known about the truly terrible impact on such women, but has not led to any service being provided,"" said Mr Blundell. He also said the Northern Ireland secretary had a ""clear statutory obligation"" in law to ensure full abortion services were commissioned by Stormont ""expeditiously"", and that this had not happened. In March, Mr Lewistook powers that would allow him to direct Stormont to set up servicesbut he has not done so yet. The government has said itwanted ""concrete progress"" from the executive by this summer. Mr Blundell said the NIHRC is calling for the laws to be implemented fully by September, but that the Department of Health has suggested that it could take eight to 12 months to establish services. ""In practice, women in Northern Ireland do not have access to abortion services to which they're entitled by law - it's been 14 months without them,"" he added. Timeline: Abortion in Northern Ireland The court was also told the Northern Ireland Executive had ""totally failed to engage"" with the Department of Health in relation to the commissioning of services. Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann has maintained that he cannot set it up without support from the Stormont Executive,as the matter is controversial and cross-cutting- the responsibility of more than one department. The court heard that evidence from the department suggested the First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party opposes abortion, had ""made clear"" that proposals were not going to be passed by the executive. Robin Swann maintains he cannot set up full abortion services without executive consent Mr Blundell said the executive's position was a ""driving factor"" in contributing to the delays, along with financial challenges raised by the health minister with Westminster. The case is scheduled to last for two days. It is expected to hear from representatives for the secretary of state, as well as lawyers for the Department of Health and the Stormont Executive. Reserved judgement is expected to be delivered in the next few months. Meanwhile, in a separate development, BBC News NI understands that a paper from Mr Swann on the commissioning of abortion services was blocked from executive discussion last week. One short-term option suggested exploring if Irish health authorities could provide Northern Ireland women with early medical abortion access. It is believed Mr Swann had proposed whether it would be possible for Northern Ireland to quickly commission a limited early medical abortion service. That would allow women in the early stages of a pregnancy - up to 10 weeks - to take abortion pills at home following a consultation with a doctor. The service, known as telemedicine, hasbeen in place in other parts of the UK and the Republic of Irelandsince the start of the coronavirus pandemic. However, BBC News NI understands that Mr Swann's paper did not make it onto the executive's agenda to be considered by all ministers. Any paper can be blocked from discussion, if it does not have support of both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The DUP is staunchly opposed to abortion. Sinn FÃ©in has previously called for abortion services to be commissioned promptly.

"British subscription site OnlyFans is failing to prevent underage users from selling and appearing in explicit videos, a BBC investigation has found. Under-18s have used fake identification to set up accounts, and police say a 14-year-old used a grandmother's passport. The UK's most senior police officer for child protection also says children are being ""exploited"" on the platform. OnlyFans says its age verification systems go over and above regulatory requirements. The platform has more than a million ""creators"" who share video clips, photos and messages directly with subscribers for a monthly fee. In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments. Warning: Story contains adult themes and language There is a range of content on the site but it is best known for pornography, and requires users to be over 18. OnlyFans was a big winner during the pandemic, exploding in popularity as much of the world was housebound. The social media platform has grown nearly 10-fold since 2019, and now has more than 120 million users. Some creators have become millionaires from their accounts, yet for most it has been a lifeline or a second income during the pandemic. But BBC News has investigated concerns that under-18s are selling explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for individuals to post or share indecent images of children. Have you had an experience on OnlyFans? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external As part of our investigation, we found that one 17-year-old from a suburb in the south-east of England had sold videos of herself masturbating and playing with sex toys, while an under-18 participated in graphic videos hosted on an adult account in Nevada, US, in breach of the company's terms and conditions. We were also able to set up an account for an underage creator, by using a 26-year-old's identification, showing how the site's age-verification process could be cheated. OnlyFans says it has now shut down the accounts. But BBC News has also heard from child protection experts across the UK and US, spoken to dozens of police forces and schools, and obtained anonymised extracts from Childline counsellor notes, about underage experiences on OnlyFans. The notes included one girl who told counsellors she had accessed the site when she was just 13. These sources told BBC News about a number of serious cases: Schools have shared anonymous reports of pupils using the site, including a 16-year-old who boasted to her careers adviser about the amount of money she made on the site, and showed off her ""exuberant"" spending on Instagram. Underage creators and users of the site include victims of prior sexual abuse and those with mental health issues and suicidal thoughts, according to Childline counsellor notes. UK police forces say children have complained about their images being uploaded to the site without consent, and one 17-year-old reported being blackmailed. Missing children are appearing in OnlyFans videos, according to a US watchdog, which also says it has received reports of child sexual exploitation. ""It is increasingly clear that OnlyFans is being used by children,"" says chief constable Simon Bailey, the UK's child protection lead. ""The company is not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited."" In a statement, OnlyFans says it could not respond specifically to the anonymous reports we were told about without the account details. It says its efforts to stop children accessing its site limits the likelihood of them being exposed to blackmail or exploitation, and if it is notified about these behaviours it takes swift action and disables accounts. Leah, 17, was able to set up an account using a fake driving licence and sell explicit videos. She told her mum Caitlyn about being on OnlyFans, on the way to Tesco's near their home in south-east England in January. That week Leah's bank account had been frozen after she received a payment of more than Â£5,000 from selling explicit videos on the site, Caitlyn says. Caitlyn says she was as shocked as ""any parent"" would be. ""I don't understand why people are paying so much money for this,"" she told the BBC. Leah had ""big issues"" growing up and missed a lot of education, Caitlyn says. Naked photographs of her were once shared around school without her consent. She told her mum she originally intended to only post pictures of her feet after making money selling them on Snapchat. But this soon escalated to explicit videos of her masturbating and playing with sex toys. In tweets advertising her OnlyFans account - some of which include teaser videos - people call her ""beautiful"" and ""sexy"", and ask if she would meet up. ""Post a pussy shot and I'll subscribe,"" is another typical response. Caitlyn says she doesn't approve of her daughter using the site, but can see why people go on it, given how much money can be made. Leah used most of the money to buy presents for her boyfriend, including more than Â£1,000 on designer clothes. They have since broken up. In a statement, OnlyFans said that Leah's ability to access the site was an ""oversight"", and her fake driving licence did not trigger a red flag. It said her account was approved during a transition ""from one effective ID and age verification system to a new exceptionally effective"" one. Leah's age was directly reported to OnlyFans by an anonymous social media account in late January. The company says this led to a moderator reviewing the account and double-checking her ID. As it appeared legitimate, no further action was taken. Caitlyn says it was stated ""everywhere"" on other online accounts that her daughter was 17. There is no obligation for a website to investigate, but OnlyFans told the BBC it checks social media when verifying accounts. Leah stopped posting on OnlyFans, but her account remained active on the site four months later, with more than 50 archived pictures and videos. She had logged on as recently as late April. Have you had an experience on OnlyFans? Please share your story by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external After being contacted by BBC News, OnlyFans shut down her page. It says it has also refunded all active subscriptions to her account. But images from her account have already been leaked all across the internet. Leah's now anxious about leaving the house for fear of being recognised, her mum says. Her plans to go to college have been delayed. ""She won't go out at all, really,"" Caitlyn says. ""She doesn't want to be seen."" BBC News also heard of other cases of underage children gaining access to OnlyFans. Hertfordshire Police told us that a 14-year-old girl had managed to use her grandmother's passport and bank details to sell explicit images. They say she then redirected money from that account to her own. OnlyFans says the account was ""fraudulent"" and involved the help of others. The site says it is assisting police and has since updated its age-verification system to ""further reduce the chance"" of this happening again. But BBC News tested the site's ""new exceptionally effective"" system in April. While a fake ID did not work, we were able to set up an OnlyFans account for a 17-year-old by using her 26-year-old sister's passport. The girl never had access to the account. The site requires applicants to pose next to an ID card and then submit a photograph holding it up to their face. But the age verification system failed to distinguish between them at any stage of the process, despite the age gap. After setting up an account, creators must provide bank details to receive payment through OnlyFans. However, this does not prevent them posting images and videos. BBC News has found that creators can share content and then arrange payments through alternative providers, in violation of company guidelines. One of the most popular is Cash App, which allows users to transfer money by mobile phone. We found scores of accounts advertising this. We were then able to send a direct message to a subscriber and request payment through Cash App, using a common alternative spelling (Ca$happ). OnlyFans says its list of prohibited words on the site already includes a number of variations of ""Cash App"". It says this list has now been expanded. OnlyFans requires creators making ""co-authored"" material to have documentation showing that all participants are over 18 years old. All contributors must also be registered creators on the site. BBC News has discovered that under-18s are also appearing in explicit videos on accounts run by adults in violation of OnlyFans' guidelines. Aaron was 17 when he started making videos on the site with his girlfriend in Nevada, US. According to his friend Jordan, Aaron didn't have his own account, but instead ""got sucked into"" appearing in explicit videos posted by his girlfriend, Cody, who was a year older than him. Aaron soon started bragging about the amount of money he was making. ""He was actually very proud of doing it,"" Jordan says. The content included sex filmed in one of their bedrooms. They shared $5,000 between them from a single video, his friends say. ""[He] was elated that they were making such an amazing amount of money for just having sex on camera for other people to watch,"" says a woman who has known Aaron for many years. She says he had a tough childhood and was ""very vulnerable to exploitation"". Cody had previously showered him with gifts on his 16th birthday, and admitted to earning the money by selling nudes online ""to some old guy"", she added. Jordan says Aaron had encouraged him to make videos on OnlyFans, even though he was also underage. ""He used to say: 'Bro, you can do it, we make so much money a week, it's easy, you don't have to work ever.'"" BBC News was told the account was reported to police in the US in October 2020 but had not been removed until we contacted OnlyFans about the case this month. In its response, OnlyFans says all active subscriptions would now be refunded. It said it is now liaising with the police, but had not previously been contacted about the account. Aaron is now 18 and has broken up with Cody. His friends say he now plans to begin his own OnlyFans account. As a part of the investigation, we also spoke to schools, police forces and child protection experts who told us they are hearing from under 18-year-olds whose experiences on the site have had serious consequences. One school in London says it became aware of the site after a 16-year-old pupil openly boasted to her careers adviser about how much money she was making from it, asking why she should listen to their advice. The girl later revealed to staff that she had been posting ""very sexualised, pornographic"" images, says the school's head of safeguarding, who also told us about a 12 year-old girl who said she had used the site to contact adult creators and asked to meet up. The deputy head asked to be anonymous to protect the identities of the children. He said the 16-year-old girl had used Instagram to show-off her ""exuberant"" spending and build a large number of followers. Childline counsellors have come across a number of cases in which under-18s, some of whom are vulnerable, reference their use of OnlyFans. It shared anonymised extracts from counsellor notes with BBC News. Children using the site who contacted the service reported being victims of prior sexual abuse, while others presented ""mental health issues including anger, low self-esteem, self-harm and suicide ideation"". One girl told a counsellor she had been on OnlyFans since she was 13. If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. ""I don't wanna talk about the types of pictures I post on there and I know it's not appropriate for kids my age to be doing this, but it's an easy way to make money,"" she said according to the notes, which have identifying details removed. ""Some of the girls have thousands of followers on Instagram and they must be raking it in,"" she added. ""I wanna be just like them."" While most of Childline's cases referred to girls, counsellors also heard from boys who said they subscribed to the site, including one who said it had affected his opinions of sex. Another, who was 16, said he had lost sleep and was ""worried to the point of throwing up"" about someone discovering he had bought nudes on the site. Because the reports were provided to the BBC without any identifying details of the children or OnlyFans accounts in question, we were unable to provide the platform with account names. It said it could not comment on the cases without those details. It also said it manually reviews every application to stop under-age access, and has increased staffing numbers in compliance, in line with the growth of the site. The UK's national lead for child protection policing Chief Constable Simon Bailey, says it is ""increasingly clear"" that OnlyFans is being used by children. While it is illegal to post or share explicit images of someone under the age of 18, Mr Bailey says the police are extremely reluctant to criminalise children for such offences. He says he is more concerned about the risks children are exposing themselves to by appearing on the site. ""The company are not doing enough to put in place the safeguards that prevent children exploiting the opportunity to generate money, but also for children to be exploited,"" Mr Bailey says. BBC News asked police forces about complaints they had received involving children appearing on the site. One 17-year-old girl in South Wales complained to police that she was blackmailed into continuing to post nudes on OnlyFans, or face photographs from the site being shared with her family. Three children also complained to police that their images had been uploaded to the site without consent, including a 17-year-old in Surrey who said her face had been edited onto someone else's body. OnlyFans says it cannot respond to these cases without being provided with account details, which the police were unable to pass on to us. It says it has a number of systems in place to prevent children from accessing the site and continues to look for new ways to enhance them. But there are also concerns about the welfare of vulnerable young people outside UK. Missing children are increasingly being linked to OnlyFans videos, says the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), known as a global clearing house for reports of child sexual exploitation. ""In 2019 there were around a dozen children known to be missing being linked with content on OnlyFans,"" says its vice president, Staca Shehan. ""Last year the number of those cases nearly tripled."" While much of the content on OnlyFans featuring children involves teenagers uploading their own content, NCMEC says it is also finding evidence of child sexual exploitation and trafficking. In January, a couple from Florida who were in their 20s were charged with human trafficking after allegedly selling a topless photograph of a 16-year-old girl on OnlyFans. OnlyFans says it works with online exploitation agencies like NCMEC to raise any potential issues with the relevant authorities. Stories about OnlyFans have become a fixture in the press. Tabloids are fascinated by the fortunes made on the site, and the intrigue of nurses and teachers signing up. Elsewhere, broadsheets have marvelled at the platform's business model and impact on the digital landscape. The Financial Times recently called it ""the hottest social media platform in the world"". The newspaper reported that OnlyFans' revenue grew by 553% in the year to November 2020, and users spent Â£1.7bn on the site. Men's lifestyle magazine GQ says ""innovations like OnlyFans have undoubtedly changed Internet culture and, by extension, social behaviour forever"". Andy Burrows, the NSPCC's head of policy for child safety online, sees its impact differently. He says the site blurs the lines between influencer culture and sexualised behaviour on social media for young people, and presents a ""toxic cocktail of risks"". ""OnlyFans underlines why it's so important that we see regulation so that it's no longer a choice for platforms about whether and how they protect children using their services,"" he says. Two years ago, the UK government published a proposal to tackle the dangers posed by online content. The Online Safety Bill, announced in May, would see companies fined Â£18m or 10% of their global turnover if they fail to keep children safe on their platforms. But there are concerns about how long it will take for the law to come into effect and whether the deterrent is sufficient for wealthy tech companies. The NSPCC says there is no accountability placed on senior managers, unlike the regulation of financial services where directors of companies can be criminally liable. In a statement in response to our investigation, the government was highly critical of OnlyFans. The website has ""failed to properly protect children and this is completely unacceptable"", a spokesperson said. ""Our new laws will make sure this no longer happens."" We asked the department for culture, media and sport what specifically in the draft online safety bill would stop such underage use of OnlyFans and similar websites in the future. It said all companies hosting user-generated content would need to put measures in place to prevent underage users seeing inappropriate content. ""The question is whether or not this bill will have sufficient teeth and power,"" says John Carr, secretary of the Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety. ""That is still far from clear."" He believes there are still no guarantees that legislation will require OnlyFans to do more than it currently does and says it's ""a bit rich"" of the government to blame companies themselves. ""In a sense, the real culprit here is the government for not having acted sooner and that's why the prospect of three, four years further delay is [itself] completely unacceptable,"" he added. OnlyFans declined our request for an interview. In a statement it said: ""We use a combination of state-of-the-art technology together with human monitoring and review to prevent children under the age of 18 from sharing content on OnlyFans. ""This is something that we take very seriously. We constantly review our systems to ensure they are as robust as possible."" It added that its systems continue to evolve as new technology becomes available to ""help us to reduce incidences of under-18-year-olds becoming OnlyFans users"". The pandemic has transformed many people's online lives in ways they might never have imagined. But the consequences of children sharing explicit images - especially when the content could be leaked - may continue to haunt them for a long time to come. All names of children and adults associated with them have been changed to protect their identities. Additional reporting by Chris Bell.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says up to 50-75% of UK coronavirus cases are now of the Indian variant Dr Jenny Harries, of the UK Health Security Agency, says cases have risen but with no sharp rise in people going to hospital Hancock is asked if he told the prime minister everyone going from hospital to care home would be tested He says he committed to getting the policy in place but ""it took time to build the testing"" The government worked ""incredibly hard to put in place what is needed to fight a pandemic"", he says He earlier told MPs the ""unsubstantiated allegations"" from Dominic Cummings that he lied during the pandemic ""are not true"" An expanded study will look at whether different vaccines can be mixed without reducing effectiveness, Hancock says Prime Minister Boris Johnson says there is ""nothing in the data"" to stop the final stage of lifting lockdown in England on 21 June Swedenâs government says it is lifting some of the country's Covid-19 restrictions Edited by James Clarke and Rob Corp Thank you for joining us for today's coronavirus live page. Today's coverage has been written by: Doug Faulkner, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Lauren Turner, Kate Whannel and Sinead WIlson. It was edited by James Clarke and Rob Corp. We'll be back tomorrow for more updates from the UK and around the world. We are bringing our coronavirus live page to a close shortly. These are some of the stories we have been looking at today:  Remember you can find out more about the number of coronavirus cases in your areahere.    Reality Check Most of the questions from
journalists to Health Secretary Matt Hancock at the Downing Street press conference focused on a claim about care
homes made by Dominic Cummings yesterday. ""We were told categorically
in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We
only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened,"" Cummings said,
adding that it was Hancock who had made that claim. But Hancock said that the
testing capacity was not available at the time. âMy
recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for
people going from hospital into care homes when we could do it,â he said. âI then went
away and built the testing capacityâ¦ and then delivered on the commitment that
I made.â You can read more about Cummings' claims here. The daughter of a man who died with Covid-19 says if he had been tested when he was ready to be discharged from hospital, he would ""probably still be alive today"". Bernard Kirton died on 7 April last year. His daughter Fiona is a member of he Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which is calling for an urgent inquiry into the governmentâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but spoke to the BBC in a personal capacity. She said her father was fit for discharge after going into hospital following a fall - but the care home they found for him would only accept him if he had a Covid test. The hospital refused to do this, she said, as he had no symptoms, later telling her this was a Public Health England decision. Two weeks after this, another care home was found - but four hours later, he tested positive for coronavirus. ""It wasn't just something that was missed,"" she said. ""He caught it in the ward in a time period when he didn't need to be there, because the hospital wouldn't test him. ""That care home that insisted on testing did not have any cases throughout the pandemic. Had he been tested...he would probably still be alive today."" She said she had been ""relieved"" to hear Dominic Cummings speak yesterday on care homes and testing as he confirmed what she had suspected. She added: ""I can only thank Dominic Cummings, who I didnât have a very high opinion of, for exposing what has gone on."" This video can not be played When he found out his son had leukaemia Jason Josephson says he just wanted to rush in to the hospital to hug his child and wife. But he had to stay sitting in the car park of their local hospital in Carmarthen - he wasn't allowed to go inside because of Covid rules. ""It crushed me,"" he says. ""I couldn't imagine how my wife was feeling. ""I just wanted to get into the hospital and put my arms around both of them but I was informed that I was not allowed. I couldn't think of a worse pain."" Now 19 months old, Carson needs regular treatment at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff. The rule is still that only one parent can go with him for appointments, so Jason has to continue to wait for hours for news of his son's condition. Each health board is allowed discretion to agree to visits under the Welsh government guidance, but Cardiff and Vale health board says it makes allowances ""as appropriate"". Packs of tests have been handed out in public The number of rapid Covid-19 tests carried out in England has fallen to its lowest level in five weeks. That's despite all members of the public being eligible to take two rapid tests a week, for free. The latest Test and Trace figures show just under 4.9 million of the lateral flow device tests were carried out in the week to 19 May, which is down 4% from the previous week. It is the fourth week in a row the number has decreased. The swab tests give results in 30 minutes or less, without samples having to be sent to a lab for processing. Some are carried out in places such as schools and care homes but many are done at home, with people then expected to report their results. The number of rapid tests peaked at just over 7.6 million in the week to 17 March, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school. The latest figures also show 974,412 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests - which do need to be sent to a lab - were conducted in the week to 19 May. It is the second highest weekly total since the end of March. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Stefan LÃ¶fven warned that 'the message today is not that the pandemic is over' Swedenâs Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has announced his country will begin easing its Covid-19 restrictions from next week, as part of a five-phase plan. The Nordic nation has never had a lockdown, but it did introduce a number of legally-binding rules to slow the spread of the virus. The first phase comes in on 1 June and will include allowing bars and restaurants to stay open until 10.30pm (two hours later than the current closing time). A maximum number of four people per table will remain in place. Sports arenas will also be able to host socially-distanced events for up to 500 people. This is a major shift, since public events such as sports matches, film screenings and theatre performances have been limited to a maximum of just eight people since the end of 2020, and were capped to 50 people early in the pandemic. Subsequent phases will see numbers gradually increased for both indoor and outdoor events, with the goal of limiting all restrictions for indoor gatherings by September. Sweden was badly hit by the third wave of the coronavirus, but the shifting approach reflects a downward trend in daily cases since mid-April. LÃ¶fven told a news conference that he wanted to offer âa warm thank youâ to Swedes who had made sacrifices. But he said âthe message today is not that the pandemic is overâ and warned that the easing of restrictions could be reversed if the spread of infection went back in the wrong direction. Today's press conference with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, has just come to an end. Here are some of the main points covered:  Jen Williams, of the Manchester Evening News, says local health leaders in Greater Manchester implemented a testing regime before discharging care home residents in March and asks why it took a month to become national policy. She also asks about whether the surge vaccination support in Bolton could be rolled out to other areas of Greater Manchester which are now seeing rising Covid cases. Matt Hancock says ""unfortunately we didn't have the testing capacity to put that policy in place across the whole country"". On Bolton, he says there are ""some early signs"" that the increase in rates is starting to ""cap out"". Dr Jenny Harries says the spread tends to have focal points, such as a school, community centre or faith building and says it is important local understanding is brought into the picture so that surge testing can be put in place in those areas. The Times' Steven Swinford asks if Hancock has spoken to the prime minister since Dominic Cummings accused him of lying and asks if the PM has confidence in his health secretary. He also asks if the roadmap is in doubt, given the spread of the Indian variant. ""The prime minister and I talk all the time,"" Hancock replies. He says they are focused on getting the country out of the pandemic On the second question, Dr Harries says ""the pure data looks quite worrying"" with Indian variant cases doubling in a week. However she adds that this could be due to authorities ""actively detecting"" cases, rather than the variant spreading. Pippa Crerar, of the Daily Mirror, quotes the families of people who died in care homes and asks why Matt Hancock signed off the discharge plan without the proper testing system in place. The health secretary says that the government was dealing with an ""unprecedented situation"" and says it worked ""Incredibly hard to put in place what is needed to fight a pandemic"". ""Of course my heart goes out to all those who have lost loved ones but all I can say is we worked to do everything we could in difficult circumstances,"" he says. He says that the policy has developed and improved as the testing capacity has improved, along with understanding about asymptomatic transmission. Dr Jenny Harries says that looking at the evidence the discharge from hospital ""was actually a very tiny proportional cause"" of cases. She says testing of staff and residents has had a huge impact. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks the health secretary if it is correct that he said in March 2020 hospital-to-care home testing would take place but that didn't turn out to be true because the testing capacity wasn't in place. ""My recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for people going from hospitals into care homes,"" Hancock replies. ""I then went away to build the testing capacity and then delivered on the commitment I made. He says testing ""wasn't possible"" at first because the capacity wasn't there. ""I'm very proud that we built that testing capacity,"" he adds. Asked again whether he told the prime minister that everyone going from hospital to care home would be tested Matt Hancock says that he committed to getting the policy in place but ""it took time to build the testing"". He says that when there was not much testing it had to be prioritised according to clinical need. ""What we had to do was build the testing capacity because there simply wasn't the testing capacity in place at the start of the pandemic,"" he says. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if, following Dominic Cummings' evidence yesterday, Hancock can say he did protect care homes. ""We worked as hard as we could to protect people who live in care homes,"" replies Hancock. He says that in order to test people leaving hospitals and going into care homes, the government had to first build testing capacity. He says setting the 100,000 tests a day target was ""very effective"" at building that capacity, and enabled the government to introduce the policy of testing people going into care homes. Harries adds that the data is complex but their research shows that people going from hospitals to care homes was not ""the majority route of entry"" and that cases were most likely to come through community transmission, such as carers. Pete from Derby asks why the government is allowing lockdown easing to continue when there are new variants spreading. Matt Hancock says the government is working as fast as it can to get people to take up the vaccine and says that ""thankfully"" the vaccines appear to be ""effectively the same"" after two doses against the variant first identified in India as against the Kent variant. Dr Jenny Harries says that we are seeing very high vaccine effectiveness against the Indian variant for both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - although slightly lower than against the Kent variant. But she says ""we do need to be really, really vigilant"", adding that testing people coming into the country is very important. We now turn to questions from the public. Janet from Liverpool says the EU is relaxing rules for fully vaccinated visitors, dispensing with test requirements, and asks if the UK will do the same for visitors. Hancock replies that ""not all adults have been offered the jab"" yet. ""We do want to make sure there is a route to safe international travel in the future,"" he says adding ""that is what the global travel taskforce has been working on."" However he says at the moment ""it is the red, amber and green approach that guides us."" But Dr Jenny Harries says we are not seeing a sharp increase in people being admitted to hospital with Covid. She says when it comes to deaths there is a significant decrease and they have ""predominantly been older people who have not been vaccinated"". She finishes by urging people to get their jabs, saying the second dose is important. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says there has been a ""sustained and sharp decline"" in cases from the middle of January but more recent data shows a ""suggestion"" of an upward rise. Dr Harries says this could be partly due to surge testing actively finding more positive cases - but also says we do know in most cases the new variant is taking the place of the Kent variant - which is something ""we need to watch carefully"". The health secretary now turns to work on producing anti-virals which could suppress further outbreaks. He explains that anti-virals have not yet been approved but the government aims to have two available later this year. He says Eddie Gray, who has previously worked for drugs giant GSK, will chair an anti-viral taskforce. Hancock offers praise to drugs firm AstraZeneca, describing the Oxford vaccine as ""Britain's gift to the world"". He says 450 million doses have now been deployed across the globe. He adds that half a million people have signed up to take part in future clinical trials.

Today's coverage has been written by: Doug Faulkner, Alexandra Fouche, Francesca Gillett, Lauren Turner, Kate Whannel and Sinead WIlson. It was edited by James Clarke and Rob Corp. We'll be back tomorrow for more updates from the UK and around the world. We are bringing our coronavirus live page to a close shortly. These are some of the stories we have been looking at today:  Remember you can find out more about the number of coronavirus cases in your areahere.    Reality Check Most of the questions from
journalists to Health Secretary Matt Hancock at the Downing Street press conference focused on a claim about care
homes made by Dominic Cummings yesterday. ""We were told categorically
in March that people would be tested before they went back to care homes. We
only subsequently found out that that hadn't happened,"" Cummings said,
adding that it was Hancock who had made that claim. But Hancock said that the
testing capacity was not available at the time. âMy
recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for
people going from hospital into care homes when we could do it,â he said. âI then went
away and built the testing capacityâ¦ and then delivered on the commitment that
I made.â You can read more about Cummings' claims here. The daughter of a man who died with Covid-19 says if he had been tested when he was ready to be discharged from hospital, he would ""probably still be alive today"". Bernard Kirton died on 7 April last year. His daughter Fiona is a member of he Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which is calling for an urgent inquiry into the governmentâs handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but spoke to the BBC in a personal capacity. She said her father was fit for discharge after going into hospital following a fall - but the care home they found for him would only accept him if he had a Covid test. The hospital refused to do this, she said, as he had no symptoms, later telling her this was a Public Health England decision. Two weeks after this, another care home was found - but four hours later, he tested positive for coronavirus. ""It wasn't just something that was missed,"" she said. ""He caught it in the ward in a time period when he didn't need to be there, because the hospital wouldn't test him. ""That care home that insisted on testing did not have any cases throughout the pandemic. Had he been tested...he would probably still be alive today."" She said she had been ""relieved"" to hear Dominic Cummings speak yesterday on care homes and testing as he confirmed what she had suspected. She added: ""I can only thank Dominic Cummings, who I didnât have a very high opinion of, for exposing what has gone on."" This video can not be played When he found out his son had leukaemia Jason Josephson says he just wanted to rush in to the hospital to hug his child and wife. But he had to stay sitting in the car park of their local hospital in Carmarthen - he wasn't allowed to go inside because of Covid rules. ""It crushed me,"" he says. ""I couldn't imagine how my wife was feeling. ""I just wanted to get into the hospital and put my arms around both of them but I was informed that I was not allowed. I couldn't think of a worse pain."" Now 19 months old, Carson needs regular treatment at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff. The rule is still that only one parent can go with him for appointments, so Jason has to continue to wait for hours for news of his son's condition. Each health board is allowed discretion to agree to visits under the Welsh government guidance, but Cardiff and Vale health board says it makes allowances ""as appropriate"". Packs of tests have been handed out in public The number of rapid Covid-19 tests carried out in England has fallen to its lowest level in five weeks. That's despite all members of the public being eligible to take two rapid tests a week, for free. The latest Test and Trace figures show just under 4.9 million of the lateral flow device tests were carried out in the week to 19 May, which is down 4% from the previous week. It is the fourth week in a row the number has decreased. The swab tests give results in 30 minutes or less, without samples having to be sent to a lab for processing. Some are carried out in places such as schools and care homes but many are done at home, with people then expected to report their results. The number of rapid tests peaked at just over 7.6 million in the week to 17 March, which coincided with the return of secondary students to school. The latest figures also show 974,412 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests - which do need to be sent to a lab - were conducted in the week to 19 May. It is the second highest weekly total since the end of March. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Stefan LÃ¶fven warned that 'the message today is not that the pandemic is over' Swedenâs Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven has announced his country will begin easing its Covid-19 restrictions from next week, as part of a five-phase plan. The Nordic nation has never had a lockdown, but it did introduce a number of legally-binding rules to slow the spread of the virus. The first phase comes in on 1 June and will include allowing bars and restaurants to stay open until 10.30pm (two hours later than the current closing time). A maximum number of four people per table will remain in place. Sports arenas will also be able to host socially-distanced events for up to 500 people. This is a major shift, since public events such as sports matches, film screenings and theatre performances have been limited to a maximum of just eight people since the end of 2020, and were capped to 50 people early in the pandemic. Subsequent phases will see numbers gradually increased for both indoor and outdoor events, with the goal of limiting all restrictions for indoor gatherings by September. Sweden was badly hit by the third wave of the coronavirus, but the shifting approach reflects a downward trend in daily cases since mid-April. LÃ¶fven told a news conference that he wanted to offer âa warm thank youâ to Swedes who had made sacrifices. But he said âthe message today is not that the pandemic is overâ and warned that the easing of restrictions could be reversed if the spread of infection went back in the wrong direction. Today's press conference with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, has just come to an end. Here are some of the main points covered:  Jen Williams, of the Manchester Evening News, says local health leaders in Greater Manchester implemented a testing regime before discharging care home residents in March and asks why it took a month to become national policy. She also asks about whether the surge vaccination support in Bolton could be rolled out to other areas of Greater Manchester which are now seeing rising Covid cases. Matt Hancock says ""unfortunately we didn't have the testing capacity to put that policy in place across the whole country"". On Bolton, he says there are ""some early signs"" that the increase in rates is starting to ""cap out"". Dr Jenny Harries says the spread tends to have focal points, such as a school, community centre or faith building and says it is important local understanding is brought into the picture so that surge testing can be put in place in those areas. The Times' Steven Swinford asks if Hancock has spoken to the prime minister since Dominic Cummings accused him of lying and asks if the PM has confidence in his health secretary. He also asks if the roadmap is in doubt, given the spread of the Indian variant. ""The prime minister and I talk all the time,"" Hancock replies. He says they are focused on getting the country out of the pandemic On the second question, Dr Harries says ""the pure data looks quite worrying"" with Indian variant cases doubling in a week. However she adds that this could be due to authorities ""actively detecting"" cases, rather than the variant spreading. Pippa Crerar, of the Daily Mirror, quotes the families of people who died in care homes and asks why Matt Hancock signed off the discharge plan without the proper testing system in place. The health secretary says that the government was dealing with an ""unprecedented situation"" and says it worked ""Incredibly hard to put in place what is needed to fight a pandemic"". ""Of course my heart goes out to all those who have lost loved ones but all I can say is we worked to do everything we could in difficult circumstances,"" he says. He says that the policy has developed and improved as the testing capacity has improved, along with understanding about asymptomatic transmission. Dr Jenny Harries says that looking at the evidence the discharge from hospital ""was actually a very tiny proportional cause"" of cases. She says testing of staff and residents has had a huge impact. Sky News' Beth Rigby asks the health secretary if it is correct that he said in March 2020 hospital-to-care home testing would take place but that didn't turn out to be true because the testing capacity wasn't in place. ""My recollection of events is that I committed to delivering that testing for people going from hospitals into care homes,"" Hancock replies. ""I then went away to build the testing capacity and then delivered on the commitment I made. He says testing ""wasn't possible"" at first because the capacity wasn't there. ""I'm very proud that we built that testing capacity,"" he adds. Asked again whether he told the prime minister that everyone going from hospital to care home would be tested Matt Hancock says that he committed to getting the policy in place but ""it took time to build the testing"". He says that when there was not much testing it had to be prioritised according to clinical need. ""What we had to do was build the testing capacity because there simply wasn't the testing capacity in place at the start of the pandemic,"" he says. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks if, following Dominic Cummings' evidence yesterday, Hancock can say he did protect care homes. ""We worked as hard as we could to protect people who live in care homes,"" replies Hancock. He says that in order to test people leaving hospitals and going into care homes, the government had to first build testing capacity. He says setting the 100,000 tests a day target was ""very effective"" at building that capacity, and enabled the government to introduce the policy of testing people going into care homes. Harries adds that the data is complex but their research shows that people going from hospitals to care homes was not ""the majority route of entry"" and that cases were most likely to come through community transmission, such as carers. Pete from Derby asks why the government is allowing lockdown easing to continue when there are new variants spreading. Matt Hancock says the government is working as fast as it can to get people to take up the vaccine and says that ""thankfully"" the vaccines appear to be ""effectively the same"" after two doses against the variant first identified in India as against the Kent variant. Dr Jenny Harries says that we are seeing very high vaccine effectiveness against the Indian variant for both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - although slightly lower than against the Kent variant. But she says ""we do need to be really, really vigilant"", adding that testing people coming into the country is very important. We now turn to questions from the public. Janet from Liverpool says the EU is relaxing rules for fully vaccinated visitors, dispensing with test requirements, and asks if the UK will do the same for visitors. Hancock replies that ""not all adults have been offered the jab"" yet. ""We do want to make sure there is a route to safe international travel in the future,"" he says adding ""that is what the global travel taskforce has been working on."" However he says at the moment ""it is the red, amber and green approach that guides us."" But Dr Jenny Harries says we are not seeing a sharp increase in people being admitted to hospital with Covid. She says when it comes to deaths there is a significant decrease and they have ""predominantly been older people who have not been vaccinated"". She finishes by urging people to get their jabs, saying the second dose is important. Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, says there has been a ""sustained and sharp decline"" in cases from the middle of January but more recent data shows a ""suggestion"" of an upward rise. Dr Harries says this could be partly due to surge testing actively finding more positive cases - but also says we do know in most cases the new variant is taking the place of the Kent variant - which is something ""we need to watch carefully"". The health secretary now turns to work on producing anti-virals which could suppress further outbreaks. He explains that anti-virals have not yet been approved but the government aims to have two available later this year. He says Eddie Gray, who has previously worked for drugs giant GSK, will chair an anti-viral taskforce. Hancock offers praise to drugs firm AstraZeneca, describing the Oxford vaccine as ""Britain's gift to the world"". He says 450 million doses have now been deployed across the globe. He adds that half a million people have signed up to take part in future clinical trials. And he says the UK government is funding an expansion of an Oxford study which will be the first in the world to look at whether different vaccines can be mixed without reducing effectiveness.

"Prof Heymans has led research trying to unlock the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter An astrophysicist from Edinburgh University is the first woman to be named Astronomer Royal for Scotland. Prof Catherine Heymans was recommended to the Queen for the role by an international panel, convened by the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Prof Heymans said she wanted to use the almost 200-year-old title to encourage people to develop passion for science. She also wants to promote Scotland internationally as a world-leading centre for science, she said. Prof Heymans said: ""I don't think anyone forgets the first time they saw the rings of Saturn through a telescope, but too many people never have the chance. ""As Astronomer Royal for Scotland, I want to change that. ""My hope is that once that spark and connection with the universe is made, children will carry that excitement home with them and develop a life-long passion for astronomy or, even better, science as a whole. As the 11th Astronomer Royal, Prof Heymans's main focus will be on sharing her enthusiasm for astronomy with Scots from all walks of life. One of her first targets is to install telescopes at all of Scotland's remote outdoor learning centres, which are visited by most of the country's school pupils. Prof Heymans says she wants to use her role to share her love of science and astronomy with young people Prof Heymans is a world-leading expert on the physics of the so-called dark universe. Her research seeks to shed light on the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter - entities that together account for more than 95% of the universe. As well as working as a professor of astrophysics at the University of Edinburgh she is also director of the German Centre for Cosmological Lensing at Ruhr-University Bochum. Created in 1834, the position of Astronomer Royal for Scotland was originally held by the director of the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh. Since 1995 it has been awarded as an honorary title. The previous holder, John Brown, died in 2019. Prof Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, said: ""The Astronomer Royal for Scotland has always been a distinguished and respected astronomer, and Professor Heymans is exactly that. ""She will also always be distinguished as the first female to hold the position.""

"The firm behind HS2 was ""dishonest and misleading"" in its handling of a compensation claim from a member of the public who had to sell their home to make way for the line, a report claims. HS2 also ""failed to properly engage"" with the complainant leading to a breakdown in trust, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman said. HS2 has previously been accused of poor communication with communities. The rail firm said it accepted the findings but had changed its practices. ""This report focuses on historic issues relating to an individual property case from 2017,"" a spokesman said. ""In the four years since this review commenced there have been significant changes to HS2 Ltd, our responsiveness, and the complaints handling approach."" Compulsory land purchases have been necessary to make way for High Speed Two, which will link London with the West Midlands from 2026. But campaign groups have long complained that the operating company does not communicate well enough with those affected, or provide compensation fast enough. In its second investigation of the problem, the Ombudsman said HS2 failed to follow its own processes when negotiating compensation claims for their family home with the complainant. The rail firm also failed to respond ""fully and promptly"" to questions the complainant had, sometimes giving false information, which caused ""severe worry"". ""HS2's repeated maladministration had a devastating impact on the complainant and their family,"" said Rob Behrens, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. ""It is unacceptable that communication problems remain at HS2... [It] must properly engage with those affected by the new line, be open and transparent and follow the proper process to make sure this never happens again."" Next phase of HS2 rail network gets green light HS2 project work begins with pledge of 22,000 jobs A 2015 report by the Ombudsman found HS2 failed to engage appropriately with a community near Lichfield when consulting about the proposals for the route which now runs through their village. At the time it called on HS2 to become more customer focused, open and accountable when dealing with complaints. The Country Land and Business Association, which represents 28,000 landowners, land managers and rural businesses in England and Wales, said an independent body was needed to handle HS2 complaints.

"The firm behind HS2 was ""dishonest and misleading"" in its handling of a compensation claim from a member of the public who had to sell their home to make way for the line, a report claims. HS2 also ""failed to properly engage"" with the complainant leading to a breakdown in trust, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman said. HS2 has previously been accused of poor communication with communities. The rail firm said it accepted the findings but had changed its practices. ""This report focuses on historic issues relating to an individual property case from 2017,"" a spokesman said. ""In the four years since this review commenced there have been significant changes to HS2 Ltd, our responsiveness, and the complaints handling approach."" Compulsory land purchases have been necessary to make way for High Speed Two, which will link London with the West Midlands from 2026. But campaign groups have long complained that the operating company does not communicate well enough with those affected, or provide compensation fast enough. In its second investigation of the problem, the Ombudsman said HS2 failed to follow its own processes when negotiating compensation claims for their family home with the complainant. The rail firm also failed to respond ""fully and promptly"" to questions the complainant had, sometimes giving false information, which caused ""severe worry"". ""HS2's repeated maladministration had a devastating impact on the complainant and their family,"" said Rob Behrens, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. ""It is unacceptable that communication problems remain at HS2... [It] must properly engage with those affected by the new line, be open and transparent and follow the proper process to make sure this never happens again.""
