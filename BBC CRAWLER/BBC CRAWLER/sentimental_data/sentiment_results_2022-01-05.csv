"Troops could be seen in Almaty on Thursday morning Security forces in the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan say they have killed dozens of anti-government rioters in the main city, Almaty. They moved in after protesters tried to take control of police stations in the city, a police spokeswoman said. Twelve members of the security forces have been killed and 353 injured in the unrest, sparked by a doubling in the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Russia is sending in troops at the request of the Kazakh president. They will be deployed to help ""stabilise"" the country, which is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) along with Russia, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. The CSTO confirmed Russian paratroopers were being dispatched as peacekeepers, with advance units already deployed. Protests began on Sunday when the government lifted its price cap on LPG, which many people use to fuel their cars, but the unrest has since spread to include political grievances. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe, dwarfing in land mass the other former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Why does it matter?It has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. A mainly Muslim republic with a large Russian minority, it has largely escaped the civil strife seen in other parts of Central Asia. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots have rocked the government, resulting in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters. Why have there been riots and deaths in Kazakhstan? BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Rare protests in a country that bans dissent Getting a clear picture of what is happening is proving difficult amid what monitoring groups describe as a ""nation-scale internet blackout"", and there are reports that security forces sided with protesters in some places. Almaty police spokeswoman Saltanat Azirbek called on people in the city to stay at home temporarily as a ""counter-terrorist"" operation continued in three administrative buildings on Thursday. Dozens of attackers were ""eliminated"" after they tried to storm police buildings in the city, she said, adding that weapons had been stolen by rioters. About 1,000 people have reportedly been injured in the unrest, with 400 being treated in hospital and 62 in intensive care. Protesters also targeted the mayor's office in Almaty and Kazakhstan's main airport, while water cannon were used against protesters in the western city of Aktobe. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has imposed a nationwide state of emergency that includes a curfew and a ban on mass gatherings. He also fired his powerful predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who held a national security role since stepping down as president, and the entire government also resigned. President Tokayev accused foreign-trained ""terrorist gangs"" of being behind the trouble and announced he had sought help from the CSTO, an alliance of former Soviet states dominated by Russia. The CSTO's current chairman, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, said the alliance would send peacekeeping forces ""for a limited period of time"". Video released by Russian media showed a small number of Russian soldiers boarding a military transport plane. According to the alliance, the peacekeeping force will be deployed to help protect state and military installations in Kazakhstan. The CSTO was set up nearly 30 years ago, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, as an alliance to counter external military threats. In 2010, Russia rejected a request from Kyrgyzstan for the CSTO to send in peacekeepers when ethnic violence erupted there, saying it was an internal matter. Some parts of Kazakhstan like the Mangistau region, where the protests started, rely on LPG (butane and propane) for refuelling as many as 90% of vehicles, Reuters news agency reports. Despite being a major oil nation, Kazakhstan had regularly faced LPG shortages because producers got a better price exporting. When the government removed its price cap on 1 January, prices reportedly rose from 50 ($0.11; Â£0.08) to 120 tenge per litre. The government has since announced it is restoring the 50-tenge cap in Mangistau. byAbdujalil Abdurasulov,BBC News, Almaty The bustling square of Almaty has turned into a conflict zone, complete with burned down buildings and vehicles. Many people are scared to go outside, especially at night because clashes are continuing. The sounds of shooting and explosions remind people how dangerous it can be to leave their homes. Local vigilante groups block the entrances to their villages near Almaty to prevent looting. Checkpoints and makeshift barriers block the entrance to the city, so people are using narrow streets to get in and out of Almaty. There are big queues at petrol stations. Residents are struggling to buy food because shopping malls, supermarkets, cafes and restaurants are all closed, only small shops are still open. And the internet shutdown continues, so people cannot withdraw money or top up their phones. This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in Almaty, the country's biggest city.

"Covid testing rules are to be eased for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. While Covid levels are high, people can be confident that rapid tests are highly accurate, the UK Health Security Agency said. The change will come into force in England next week and across the rest of the UK within days. It will be reviewed when coronavirus levels in the population drop below 1%. Around 4% of people are currently infected with coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics. Under the new guidance, anyone in England who receives a positive lateral flow device (LFD) test result should report their result ongov.uk,externaland must self-isolate immediately, but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. After reporting a positive LFD test result, they will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace so that their contacts can be traced. Anyone who tests positive will be able to leave self-isolation seven days after the date of their initial positive test if they receive two negative lateral flow test results, 24 hours apart, on days six and seven. from todayin Northern Ireland,external from Thursday inScotlandandWales from Tuesday 11 January in England At present anyone with a positive lateral flow test who has no symptoms needs a PCR test - carried out in a lab - to confirm their result. This can take days to arrive and health officials are worried people may not be isolating during this time. The change will also improve access to PCR tests for people with symptoms and for healthcare, transport and other key workers following problems over test supplies. There are some exemptions to the new rule. People who receive Test and Trace financial support, those taking part in Covid research studies and around one million people in England eligible for new NHS treatments for Covid will all be asked to take a follow-up PCR. What are the Covid self-isolation rules? How do I know I have Omicron? When can I have a booster? Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of UKHSA, said: ""While cases of Covid continue to rise, this tried-and-tested approach means that LFDs can be used confidently to indicate Covid-19 infection without the need for PCR confirmation. She added: ""I'm really grateful to the public and all of our critical workers who continue to test regularly and self-isolate when necessary, along with other practical and important public health behaviours, as this is the most effective way of stopping the spread of the virus and keeping our friends, families and communities safe."" Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said this was ""a sensible approach"" as long as positive results were reported and the lateral flow kits ""are in good supply"". He added: ""Lateral flow tests can detect around 95% of people who are at their most infectious."" Anyone who develops one of the three main Covid-19 symptoms - a new cough, a high temperature or a loss of taste or smell - should stay at home, self isolate and take a PCR test. But some scientists questioned why people with symptoms couldn't also rely on a lateral flow test result alone. Lateral flow tests are very good at detecting people who are infectious at the moment because the prevalence of the virus is high and there are lots of cases to be spotted. Analysis shows that if you tested 1,000 people right now, you'd get 41 testing positive and almost all of them would be correct - but last summer, when there were fewer cases around - you'd get three positives but only two would be true. That's when a PCR would be important to confirm the result. The latest Covid figures showed 218,724 new cases were recorded in the UK on Tuesday. That number included previously unreported cases from Wales and Northern Ireland from over the new year period. A number of hospitals havedeclared critical incidentsamid staff shortages due to Covid. This video can not be played Dr Mike Tildesley: ""Hopefully we won't be losing the levels of information that enables us to identify variants"" Separately, pre-departure Covid tests for those entering Englandwill be scrapped from Fridayafter the travel industry called for restriction on travellers to be removed because the virus is circulating so widely. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the cabinet has agreed that England should stick with Plan B for a further three weeks - with a review before the regulations expire on 26 January. He says people in England should continue working from home wherever they can, wear face coverings on public transport, and also in most public indoor places. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the NHS was ""struggling to stay afloat"" and referred to a number of hospital trusts declaring critical incidents due to staff shortages and high Covid cases across the country. She called on Mr Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The decision to drop follow-up tests for people who test positive in England on rapid tests will not make much difference to our ability to track the epidemic or variants. It's true that if people decide not to report their positive lateral flow test, we will miss some cases. But the testing system already misses cases if people decide not to get tested or to quietly pocket their rapid test result. That's why we rely on other data: hospital admissions or surveys that swab people at random. They'll keep on working as they always have. And we will still have plenty of PCR samples to sequence and spot variants: tens of thousands of positive cases every day. Last Wednesday, for example, in England, about 50,000 people reported testing positive on a lateral flow test. And nearly 150,000 more people tested positive on a PCR without a previous lateral flow. The guidance is still that you must get a PCR test if you have symptoms and, as long as that's the case, there will be plenty of data. Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), said lateral flow tests were very accurate - but it was crucial people recorded their positive results. He also said as some PCRs are sent away for sequencing, he hoped there would be no loss of information that helps the UK identify new variants.

"New restrictions were introduced in response to Covid-19's Omicron variant Pubs and restaurants fear the ""giant festive flop"" of Christmas trading will result in closures and job losses. UK Hospitality Cymru said without extra money and lighter Covid restrictions businesses would be left in ""peril"". It followsWales' quieter New Yearafter limits of six in pubs and nightclub closures were imposed as part oftougher Covid measures. The Welsh government said its emergency financial support package would be available from 10 January. A spokesman added they would continue to consider whether additional emergency business support funding was needed. Welsh hospitality hit 'far worse' than in England Scientists advised post-Christmas lockdown Pubs and restaurants fear 'crippling' Covid rules David Chapman, director of UK Hospitality Cymru, said: ""We haven't got the revenue to be able to see our businesses through properly to the end of these restrictions."" Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford did not set an end date for the restrictions when they wereannounced before Christmas, but said he wanted them in place for the shortest possible time. Public Health Wales reported 21,279 new Covid cases and 10 new deaths in a 48-hour period leading up to Tuesday morning. It brings the total number of cases in Wales to 689,750. The case rate quadrupled in the last two weeks of December from 523 on 14 December to 2,133 to on December. Some pubs remained closed on New Year's Eve Mr Chapman said retaining staff on current government support was ""unsustainable"", especially when closed nightclubs were ""expected to keep a full staff roster for as long as two months, with a grant that doesn't even amount to a busy night's takings"". Hospitality rules vary between Wales and the other UK nations, with people living in England not required to limit groups in pubs and still allowed to visit nightclubs. Although English hospitality reported a shortfall, Mr Chapman said revenue in Wales was at least 25% lower than across the boarder at present. He said the trade body was not calling for furlough to return, but stressed ""if financial support isn't swiftly forthcoming, grave commercial impacts are inevitable, which will hugely damage communities across Wales"". ""While we appreciate there are serious health implications for omicron, we appreciate there are serious health and economic implications that are involved with our industry not having sufficient support. ""This is the danger period... the next three or four weeks is crunch time."" Ellen Morris said her business was still recovering from debt mounted during previous lockdowns Ellen Morris, owner of The Plas Coch and The Ship pubs in Bala, Gwynedd, said she had to triple staff to be ready for table service when the new restrictions came in, but ""everybody went over the border to England"". ""You can't compete with that, it's killing hospitality,"" she said. ""We can't carry on like this, there'll end up being no hospitality trade in Wales."" Ms Morris toldBBC Radio Walesshe was ""desperate"", and although there is help, the Welsh government's funding package will ""not touch the sides"". Welsh NHS under 'strain' due to Omicron absences Covid staff shortages will continue into New Year ""I'm definitely going to go under, we're already in debt from the previous lockdown. We're paying that back now with no business. ""We'll need a lot more... everybody's different."" She said letting people travel across the border for festive celebrations was ""stupid"", adding ""it's time they [Welsh government] relooked at stuff in different ways"". ""The end conclusion: There were no customers there,"" says Ms Morris, owner of The Plas Coch The Welsh government said it appreciated Alert Level Two measures in place ""may have an impact on businesses"" being able to trade. ""Our Â£120m package of emergency financial support, covers impacted businesses for the period from 13 December 2021 to 14 February 2022. ""Businesses eligible for non-domestic rates-based payments need to register with their local authority from 10 January and will start receiving payments quickly afterwards. ""The application window for the Economic Resilience Fund will open in the week of 17 January with payments starting to reach businesses within days."" It added the situation was being reviewed weekly and the Welsh government ""will continue to consider whether additional emergency business support funding is needed"".

"The rules on testing are to be eased for people travelling to England, the government has announced, following calls from the travel industry. From 04:00 GMT on Friday, fully vaccinated travellers coming to England will no longer have to take a test before they travel. And from Sunday, rather than taking a PCR test on day two of arrival, they can take a cheaper lateral flow. The rules for self-isolating on arrival will also change. The shake-up was confirmed by Boris Johnson earlier, following calls from travel firms who said the measures were not effective now that Omicron was spreading widely. Under the current rules in force until Friday, all fully-vaccinated travellers over the age of 12 must show proof of a negative test lateral flow or PCR test taken in the two days before coming to the UK. Fully vaccinated people must also pay for a PCR test within two days of arrival and self-isolate while waiting for the result. People who aren't fully vaccinated must currently take PCR tests on both day two and day eight after arriving, and self-isolate for 10 days. But under the new rules: From 04:00 GMT on Friday 7 January, people who are fully vaccinated and those aged under-18 will no longer need to take a test two days before travelling to England from countries outside the UK and the Common Travel Area. On arrival, they will have to take a PCR test but they will no longer have to self-isolate while awaiting the result From 04:00 GMT on Sunday 9 January they will only have to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on day two. But this test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests are not allowed Unvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and self-isolate for 10 days Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pre-departure test ""discourages many from travelling for fear of being trapped overseas and incurring significant extra expense"". The announcement comes after airlines said passenger testing was making no real impact, with data last week suggesting one in 25 people in England had the virus. They also said compulsory testing had held back the sector's recovery. Mr Johnson met his cabinet earlier and alongside changes to travel tests, the governmenthas said it will ease Covid testing rulesfor people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. On Tuesday,Mr Johnson said he hoped the country could ""ride out"" the current wave, although he acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed. That rule change will come into force on 11 January and apply to England only for now. Following the announcement for England, Health Minister for the Welsh government Eluned Morgan said: ""I have today reluctantly agreed to remove the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and under 18s to take a pre departure test (PDT) and a day 2 PCR test when arriving in the UK."" Currently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK. They then have to take another test - which this time must be a PCR test - within the first two days after their arrival in the UK. But at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 - and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid. But UK cases have now risen sharply and Omicron is the dominant variant - so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to ""keep out Omicron"". Read more. John Wyndham, who is currently planning a third trip to the US for February, said that scrapping pre-departure tests will make him feel unsafe on flights. ""I'm frustrated because pre-departure was the most important as an effective control and also the cheapest test,"" he told the BBC. Mr Wyndham runs a start-up company that is organising marching bands across the world to participate in London Band Week. He went to the US in December along with three colleagues, who paid Â£212 each for PCR testing. However, he said that the eliminating pre-departure testing will only save him around Â£30 per person and wasn't worth the added worry about new variants. ""It's bonkers that we could now sit on the plane with someone who has it,"" he said, adding that it would ""worsen what has already been the most stressful travelling of my life"". David Hughes will save around Â£800 However, holidaymaker David Hughes welcomed the scrapping of PCR tests before returning to the UK. Currently on holiday in Dubai, the rule change will save his family of 4 around Â£400 and another removing the Day 2 PCR will also save the family another Â£400. ""Having returned from a country where there were strict entry requirements and we were tested on arrival I would be very confident that we'll be returning to the UK Covid free,"" he told the BBC. Cancellation fees and no longer having to test before returning would mean significantly less hassle and stress, Mr Hughes added. In response, Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive of ABTA - The Travel Association, said the two announcements were ""potentially very positive"" for the travel sector, but that damage had ""already been done"". ""We now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,"" he added. Steve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2 and tour operator Jet2 Holidays, also said the timing of the announcement will make a ""huge difference"". Numbers of customers on their website, he said, were already increasing ""exponentially"" after the rule change. Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, agreed that the announcement meant customer demand would be boosted in a ""critical booking window"" for the industry. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren also welcomed the news, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"", as customers could now book and travel with ""confidence"". The trade body Airlines UK has argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry. UK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Will Omicron stall airlines' recovery in 2022? Ahead of the test changes, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) sent the government research it commissioned, which it claimed shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron. It said that passenger numbers at MAG's airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced. Tim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC's Today programme the research showed there was a ""basis for taking out all tests"" related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK. ""We are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn't be doing it and we should take those measures out,"" he added. Separately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: ""With so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it's likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday."" A recent report by aviation analytics firm Ciriumfound that the Covid pandemic triggered a 71% drop in international flights in and out of the UK in 2021. How are travel rules being relaxed?

"Ghislaine Maxwell is seen during the trial in a court sketch Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell say she deserves a new trial after a juror told media that he used his own experience of being sexually abused to persuade other jurors who doubted witnesses. Prosecutors also asked the judge to open an inquiry into the statements. Maxwell was found guilty last week of grooming underage girls to be abused by Jeffrey Epstein. The juror said he told fellow jurors that, like some of Epstein's victims, he had been abused as a child. The man, who asked to be identified by his first and middle name, Scotty David, told reporters that he shared his experiences with jurors after some had questioned the recollections from two of Maxwell's accusers. ""I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the colour of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video,"" he said he told the jury, according to The Independent. ""But I can't remember all the details, there are some things that run together."" ""When I shared that, they were able to sort of come around on, they were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse,"" Scotty David said, referring to other jurors, according to the Reuters news agency. He also said that he ""flew through"" the juror questionnaire used before trial to ascertain whether prospective jurors could judge Maxwell fairly, and did not recall being asked about his experiences with sexual abuse. He added that he would have answered honestly. In a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan, who presided over Maxwell's trial, the lawyer for the British socialite said there were ""incontrovertible grounds"" for a new trial to serve the interest of justice. The letter was filed shortly after prosecutors said the reports ""merit attention by the Court"". Neama Rahmani, a lawyer and legal commentator who co-founded West Coast Trial Lawyers, told the BBC that if Scotty David ""lied on his prospective juror questionnaire and denied being the victim of sexual abuse, that would be both perjury and potential grounds for a mistrial"". ""This is why prosecutors cringe when jurors talk to the media after a guilty verdict: because jurors may say something that may overturn the conviction,"" he said. PROFILE:The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall ANALYSIS:The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down SURVIVOR INTERVIEW:'I just can't explain to you the fear' Maxwell, 60, was convicted on five of the six counts she faced, including the most serious charge - that of sex-trafficking a minor. Her lawyers have already said they will appeal against the verdict. A long-time associate of convicted child sex offender Epstein, Maxwell has been in jail since July 2020 when she was charged with involvement in the financier's abuse of teenage girls. Some of the victims were as young as 14. Epstein killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. A date for her sentencing has not yet been set.

"This video can not be played Watch Rhian Graham outside Bristol Crown Court after the four were acquitted Four people accused of illegally removing a statue of Edward Colston have been cleared of criminal damage. Sage Willoughby, Rhian Graham, Milo Ponsford and Jake Skuse were charged after a monument to the 17th Century slave trader was pulled down and thrown into Bristol's harbourside last June. It happened during a Black Lives Matter protest in the city. Loud cheers erupted in the public gallery of Bristol Crown Court as the verdicts were returned. The defendants, who are all from Bristol apart from Mr Ponsford, 26, who is based in Hampshire, laughed and hugged supporters who were waiting outside after they were released. The four defendants celebrated outside court after being found not guilty Sage Willoughby took the knee as he left court following his acquittal Mr Willoughby, 22, was seen taking the knee - a symbolic gesture of the BLM movement - outside court. Three of the four defendants also wore T-shirts designed by Banksy which featured a stencil of thetoppled statue's plinth. Speaking outside court after being acquitted, Ms Graham said: ""We just want to say thank you to so many people because we have never been alone in this journey. ""We have been so supported and we are such a small part of this. ""There were so many people that day. So many people reverberating across the world in response to it [the statue's toppling]."" Mr Willoughby denied they were trying to edit history, but said others were ""whitewashing history"" by calling Colston a ""virtuous man"". ""We didn't change history, we rectified it,"" he said. ""This is a victory for Bristol, this is a victory for racial equality and it's a victory for anybody who wants to be on the right side of history."" byCharlotte Callen, home affairs correspondent People supported the defendants throughout the trial The public gallery erupted into screams and cheers of joy as the four defendants - who have been named the Colston Four - were cleared of wrongdoing. Outside, supporters gathered with banners and Rhian Graham tearfully thanked them. The thanks also extended to street artist Banksy whose T-shirt sale raised funds for them. While there were many supporters outside the court delighted the four were acquitted, others were not so impressed. One came up to supporters of the Colston Four and said the result was ""disgusting"". This is something that has divided opinion in Bristol and beyond, and the verdict will lead to more debate about which statues should remain standing across the UK. Raj Chada, who represented Mr Skuse, said the ""defendants should never have been prosecuted"". He added: ""It is shameful that Bristol City Council did not take down the statue of slaver Edward Colston that had caused such offence to people in Bristol and equally shameful that they then supported the prosecution of these defendants."" Colston's statue was thrown in Bristol's harbour Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, for Ms Graham, 30, said the case ""demonstrates the fundamental importance of trial by jury"". ""In this case, they determined that a conviction for the removal of this statue - that glorified a slave trader involved in the enslavement of over 84,000 black men, women and children as a 'most virtuous and wise' man - would not be proportionate."" During a highly publicised trial, the court heard the statue was ripped down before being thrown into the harbour during a wave of protests triggered by the murder of African-American George Floyd by a white police officer. The four defendants, together with ""others unknown"", were accused of damaging the Colston statue and plinth of a value unknown without lawful excuse. The statue was stamped on after it was pulled down During the trial, Mr Skuse, 33, said he took part in rolling the statue to the docks to stage a symbolic ""sentencing"" of the slave trader. Mr Willoughby argued the statue was an ""insult"". Appearing in the dock, he said: ""Imagine having a Hitler statue in front of a Holocaust survivor - I believe they are similar. ""Having a statue of someone of that calibre in the middle of the city I believe is an insult, and I will continue to believe that whatever the outcome of this.""

"Ghislaine Maxwell is seen during the trial in a court sketch Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell say she deserves a new trial after a juror told media that he used his own experience of being sexually abused to persuade other jurors who doubted witnesses. Prosecutors also asked the judge to open an inquiry into the statements. Maxwell was found guilty last week of grooming underage girls to be abused by Jeffrey Epstein. The juror said he told fellow jurors that, like some of Epstein's victims, he had been abused as a child. The man, who asked to be identified by his first and middle name, Scotty David, told reporters that he shared his experiences with jurors after some had questioned the recollections from two of Maxwell's accusers. ""I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the colour of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video,"" he said he told the jury, according to The Independent. ""But I can't remember all the details, there are some things that run together."" ""When I shared that, they were able to sort of come around on, they were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse,"" Scotty David said, referring to other jurors, according to the Reuters news agency. He also said that he ""flew through"" the juror questionnaire used before trial to ascertain whether prospective jurors could judge Maxwell fairly, and did not recall being asked about his experiences with sexual abuse. He added that he would have answered honestly. In a letter to US District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan, who presided over Maxwell's trial, the lawyer for the British socialite said there were ""incontrovertible grounds"" for a new trial to serve the interest of justice. The letter was filed shortly after prosecutors said the reports ""merit attention by the Court"". Neama Rahmani, a lawyer and legal commentator who co-founded West Coast Trial Lawyers, told the BBC that if Scotty David ""lied on his prospective juror questionnaire and denied being the victim of sexual abuse, that would be both perjury and potential grounds for a mistrial"". ""This is why prosecutors cringe when jurors talk to the media after a guilty verdict: because jurors may say something that may overturn the conviction,"" he said. PROFILE:The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall ANALYSIS:The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down SURVIVOR INTERVIEW:'I just can't explain to you the fear' Maxwell, 60, was convicted on five of the six counts she faced, including the most serious charge - that of sex-trafficking a minor. Her lawyers have already said they will appeal against the verdict. A long-time associate of convicted child sex offender Epstein, Maxwell has been in jail since July 2020 when she was charged with involvement in the financier's abuse of teenage girls. Some of the victims were as young as 14. Epstein killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. A date for her sentencing has not yet been set.

"The GMB accused the council of ""playing Russian roulette with the safety of Carmarthenshire residents"" Council gritters began the first of 12 days of industrial action on Wednesday over pay and conditions. Further action is planned by staff in Carmarthenshire on Thursday, 6 January; from January 17 to 21 and from January 24 to 28. The GMB union accused the council of ""playing Russian roulette with the safety of Carmarthenshire residents"". The authority said arrangements were in place to ensure travellers remained safe. Gritting roads: Does it harm the environment? Snow in Wales: Remembering 1981's white Christmas Climate change: Will Wales see more sun and less snow? The GMB said the action was over members not being stood down from work in the expected manner after being put on call. GMB organiser Peter Hill said: ""Our members are also Carmarthenshire residents and we're advising our families and friends to avoid the roads over the next 48 hours as many will not be gritted."" Unison said the council had been ""chipping away at the agreement by not standing down workers"" and that responsibility for the dispute lay ""squarely with the council"". It accused the council of ""spending significant amounts of taxpayer money maintaining an inferior winter gritting service"". ""Councillors should get involved and give commitments to stick with an agreement their senior management signed,"" a spokesman said. Carmarthenshire council said contingency plans were in place to help drivers stay safe The council's environment member, Hazel Evans, said the council made an agreement with the trade unions in 2020 to cover winter maintenance duties which ""provided them with a remuneration package which is one of the highest in Wales"". Ms Evans said the council had adhered to the agreement's terms and conditions. ""An increased offer was put to the trade unions to help secure the winter maintenance service,"" she said. ""The offer is considered very reasonable and at the level of what the council can afford. ""Unfortunately, trade union colleagues have chosen not to present this offer to their members but have decided to ballot and implement a period of industrial action at this difficult time."" It said its offer remained on the table. ""In the interim the council will implement its contingency plan to undertake gritting on a reduced resilient network,"" Ms Evans said. The Unite union declined to comment as only as only a small number of its members were involved.

"Wales fans were there to celebrate along with try-scorer Ryan Elias as the hosts beat Australia in Cardiff in November 2021 The Welsh Rugby Union is considering playing home Six Nations games in England because of Covid crowd restrictions in Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford imposedrestrictions on sporting events in Wales,effectively meaning professional games are behind closed doors. There is no date set for when measures could be eased, with the next review scheduled for 7 January. Wales are due to host Scotland in Cardiff on 12 February. Faletau expected to be fit for start of Six Nations Sturgeon hopes Scotland's Six Nations matches can 'go ahead to crowds' Wayne Pivac's side are also scheduled to meet France on 11 March and Italy eight days later at the Principality Stadium, meaning Wales could face the prospect of playing over half the competition on home soil with no fans. This video can not be played Welsh Government would be âdisappointedâ if Wales games switched to England As things stand, sporting events in England have no restrictions, so Wales' visit to Twickenham on 26 February will be played before a full house of 82,000, provided spectators can prove full vaccination status or show a negative lateral flow test. Wales launch the defence of their Six Nations title against Ireland in Dublin on 5 February, with current restrictions of 5,000 fans there. Scotland also has restrictions on spectator numbers of 500, France has a limit of 5,000 fans and Italy has a Covid pass system in place after tightening restrictions in December. The WRU lost Â£13.5m in matchday revenue during the 2021 Six Nations after home games against England and Ireland were played behind closed doors. The WRU's preference is to play home fixtures this year in front of full crowds in Cardiff and the union hopes restrictions will be lifted in time. There are major logistical issues in relocating matches including tickets already sold for the games, availability of stadiums and public health concerns, with the prospect of thousands of Welsh fans travelling to England and back. The WRU has also stressed throughout the pandemic it will abide by and support Welsh government's policy on public health. The governing body will also rely on future financial assistance from the Welsh government. This is the second time the WRU has considered moving games to England after exploring the possibility for the Autumn Nations Cup in November 2020, when the Principality Stadium was used as a field hospital. On that occasion Wales ended up playing their matches at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli with no spectators. Wembley Stadium will not be able to host any Welsh Six Nations games this year because of preparations for England international football games in March. Other venues with the capacity required would be West Ham's London Stadium, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium or the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, which WRU officials visited in late 2020. That venue would prove troublesome this time around because two of the three weekends clash with Tottenham home matches in the Premier League. England's home ground Twickenham would also be another option. Six Nations organisers are monitoring the situation with meetings this week which they hope will offer more clarity on the situation in each of the countries. Health Minister Eluned Morgan says the Welsh Government would be disappointed if matches were staged outside of Wales and warned of financial consequences for the WRU. ""There would be a Welsh government understanding we would have to step in to support them financially if they did have to postpone those matches or cancel them in some way,"" said Ms Morgan. ""If they decide to go to England that would be more difficult for us to come up with that financial support."" Under Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Welsh government, only 50 spectators are permitted to view outdoor events. The guidelines are reviewed weekly and Mr Drakeford has so far refused to give public assurances fans will be allowed to return in time for the Six Nations as case numbers for the Omicron variant continue to surge. Wales wing Louis Rees-Zammit, who plays for English club Gloucester, says fans must be allowed to watch the games, even if it means matches being moved. Allow Twitter content?

Andrew Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, says lifting crowd restrictions should be considered. ""Many people in Wales will tell you that the current restrictions do not make sense,"" he said. ""I am cautiously optimistic the initial fear over Omicron is not coming to pass and the Labour government needs to have a long hard think about if these restrictions are completely necessary on Friday [7 January]. ""It would be another blow to the Welsh economy if more of the Welsh pound is spent in London and not Cardiff."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""As a result of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, Wales is currently at alert level two. The cabinet is reviewing the situation on a weekly basis.""

"This video can not be played Angela Rayner claims working families are ""picking up the tab"" for the prime minister's incompetence over rising prices. Labour has stepped up its call for the 5% VAT rate on energy bills to be scrapped, demanding ""serious solutions"" for the rising cost of living. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said working families were ""picking up the tab"" for Boris Johnson's ""incompetence"" over the issue. But the PM insisted the government was providing a number of schemes to help. A spike in wholesale gas prices has led to soaring energy bills in the UK. A total of 27 energy companies have also gone bust as the energy price cap - limiting how much consumers can be charged - saw some businesses forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for. But there are fears an expected rise in the cap, due in April, could see households hit with even higher bills. How can the government solve the energy crisis? Tory MPs and peers urge PM to act on energy bills Why are gas prices so high? There is growing unrest on the Conservative benches about the rising cost of living, with a group of 20 Conservative MPs and peers - including five ex-ministers - writing to Mr Johnson last week to urge him to cut VAT on energy bills. They also called for him to go further by suspending environmental levies, which fund renewable energy schemes. The Financial Times reported on Wednesday,externalthat Leader of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg also spoke out during a cabinet meeting about the incoming tax rise to cover NHS and social care, calling instead for savings to be made in government spending. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats reiterated their own plan to support people with rising costs, calling for a so-called ""Robin Hood"" tax on oil and gas firm profits. The party's leader, Sir Ed Davey, said the one-off levy would raise around Â£5bn from companies making record profits from the wholesale energy price rise, which could be passed on to those in need. Labour has been calling for the government to slash the 5% VAT rate on energy bills to zero since October, with shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves calling it a ""simple"" and ""immediate"" measure to help people deal with costs over the winter. Andwriting in the Sun back in 2016,external, Mr Johnson himself advocated scrapping VAT on energy bills, saying it would be a benefit of Brexit. Backers of the plan said VAT receipts had come in more than Â£3bn higher than forecast because of rising prices, giving the government extra funds to cover the cost. But a Treasury source has told the BBC that rising bills overall mean consumers are spending less elsewhere on products with higher VAT, so the overall income to the government has remained flat. Standing in for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who has tested positive for Covid - at PMQs, Ms Rayner said ""working people across the country are facing rising bills and ballooning prices"", due to a mixture of inflation, rising energy costs and an incoming tax rise to pay for the NHS and social care. She added: ""The prime minister has made political choices that have led us into this place."" The deputy leader claimed the government had ""failed to invest in long term energy security"" and ""let the energy market run out of control"", adding: ""Can't the prime minister see what is happening? ""Yet again working families are picking up tab for his incompetence."" And having quoted his article in the Sun promising the VAT cut, Ms Rayner said ""any decent government would find a way to help British families"" and asking him to ""finally stand up to his chancellor"" to secure the move. The PM responded that Angela Rayner had ""much more energy"" than Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, as he responded to her questions But Mr Johnson said a number of government initiatives - including the warm homes discount, winter fuel payments and cold weather payments - were supporting people, especially those on low incomes. He also accused Labour of ""bare-faced cheek"" for calling for the VAT cut, as the party campaigned to stay in the EU - when it would not have been an option. ""Everybody knows full well it would be absolutely impossible if they were to do what Labour would do and go back into the EU [and] remain aligned with the EU single market,"" said the PM. ""That is the objective of the Labour Party. They can't be trusted on Brexit and they can't be trusted with the economy."" At Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said - twice - that theWarm Home Discount Scheme,externalwas ""worth Â£140 a week"". That's wrong - it's worth Â£140 for the whole of the winter. It's a one-off discount on the electricity bills between October and March of people on low incomes. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: ""In October, the prime minister said that fears about inflation were unfounded."" Mr Johnson replied: ""Of course, I said no such thing"". But in October,he told Sky News,external: ""People have been worrying about inflation for a very long timeâ¦ those fears have been unfounded."" And at PMQs, he said that ""everybody on the living wage has seen another Â£1,000 in their income"". The living wage is going up in April from Â£8.91 an hour to Â£9.50, which will be Â£1,000 for somebody working full-time. Clearly, people working fewer hours will receive less. Also, these are figures before taxes and benefits are taken into account. Income tax, National Insurance and the loss of Universal Credit as earnings increase all mean that even a full-time worker is likely to end up with significantly less than Â£1,000. The SNP's leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, also attacked the prime minister over the rising cost of living, saying: ""We've had the year of Tory sleaze, but now we've got the year of Tory squeeze for family budgets"". He quoted research from the Resolution Foundation, saying on average families will be Â£1,200 worse off from April ""as a result of Tory cuts, tax hikes and soaring energy bills"". Mr Blackford asked the PM to ""commit to an emergency financial package"" to help the worst off. But Mr Johnson said the government was ""helping families up and down the country"", pointing to changes to the Universal Credit taper and increases to the living wage. He added: ""You've now got more people in work than there were before the pandemic began. ""That is because of the balanced and proportionate approach that we've been taking."" Abolishing VAT of 5% on energy bills would be quick and easy, but is considered a blunt instrument, as it would provide support to well-off customers who don't need it. And for those that do need it, 5% of a possible Â£700 price rise is pretty small. The government could temporarily suspend the additional levies on bills that fund green policies. But that would be a tricky sell in some quarters, after the UK hosted a major global climate summit, and these levies are designed to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuels. One other option is to extend and expand the Warm Homes Discount. Currently, customers in receipt of certain benefits can apply for a one-off payment of Â£140. And another option - suggested by the industry - would be to subsidise the energy companies themselves, by establishing a fund or facility which would allow them to draw down government cash when wholesale prices were very high and then pay it back when prices dipped again.

"Vodafone is delaying the reintroduction of roaming charges in Europe by three weeks. The phone network had planned to bring in post-Brexit roaming fees on 6 January, matching other networks that plan to do so in 2022. But it said more time was needed for testing, and the change will now come in at the end of January. EE has also delayed resuming its roaming charges, which were planned for January, until March. Before the UK left the EU, users were able to use their calls, texts, and data allowance in their mobile plans in any EU country. But the EU trade deal of December 2020 gave mobile operators the option of reintroducing charges. The Three network has also said it will bring in roaming charges between the UK and Europe, though their change is planned for May 2022. That means that of the largest mobile networks, only O2 has not announced any plans for the reintroduction of roaming fees. Mobile roaming charges: What you need to know Three to bring in Europe roaming charges Explaining the reason for delaying its planned changes, Vodafone said it was not ready to bring in the new system. ""We have pushed back the introduction of roaming charges to the end of January, giving time for further testing to ensure the best possible experience for customers purchasing our Â£1 per day bundles. Until then, customers will continue to be able to roam without charges."" The Â£1 a day charge is Vodafone's best price, and only applies when bought in an eight or 15-day bundle. The usual planned price is Â£2 per day in fees, matching EE and Three's planned pricing. EE said the shift in its plans was caused by unspecified technical delays. ""Making big changes to billing systems in mobile phone networks is always risky,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight and founder of the Mobile Phone Museum. ""The backlash and negative publicity for any network operator that does not get it right would be immense if a customer ended up with an eye-watering roaming bill. ""My guess is that rather than rushing out a change, the operators are delaying the introduction to be absolutely sure everything is working. ""Given the current Covid situation it's not like lots of people are travelling, so the operators are not going to be massively exposed on unexpected roaming costs.""

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish coronavirus self-isolation period cut from 10 days to seven. People who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests. The move brings Scotland into line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Household contacts of people with the virus will be allowed to take tests rather than going into quarantine, so long as they have had a booster shot. The changes took effect from midnight. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that no other changes will be made to Scotland's pandemic restrictions for at least another week. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid plans A further 16,103 cases were reported on Tuesday, and the first minister said there had been ""rapid and very widespread transmission"" of the Omicron variant of the virus over the festive period. Official surveys suggested that in the week to 23 December, one in every 40 people in Scotland had Covid - and within a week, this had risen to one in every 20. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the virus was ""more widespread now than at any point in the pandemic so far"", something which has had ""extremely serious implications"" for the NHS and other key services. The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased by 80% over the past week, from 679 to 1,223 - although the number of people in intensive care has been broadly stable, with 42 recorded yesterday. Self-isolation rules are being changed in a bid to ease staff shortages in key sectors, with Ms Sturgeon saying ministers had considered the issue very carefully. People who test positive for the virus will be allowed to exit quarantine after seven days as long as they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests, one on day six of isolation and another 24 hours later. Meanwhile close contacts of positive cases will no longer need to self-isolate as long as they are fully vaccinated - which means two doses and a booster - and take a lateral flow test daily for a week. And people who have no symptoms but record a positive lateral flow test result will no longer have to go for a PCR test,mirroring changes made in England. Wednesday is the first day we've been able to get a clear picture of just how fast Covid infections have spread over the Christmas and new year period. Public Health Scotland publishesdaily case counts by the date of the PCR test,externaland from these figures we can see that 21,397 people tested positive on 29 December - the highest daily total of the pandemic so far. On New Year's Eve, the average number of cases being confirmed a day almost hit 15,000. Two weeks previously this average stood at just over 5,000, which is one of the sharpest rises in case numbers we've seen in Scotland. The dominance of the Omicron variant is now almost total, likely accounting for more than 91% of cases in Scotland, less than six weeks after it was first detected here. The number of people in hospital with Covid has also been going up over the last three weeks, rising from 494 on 18 December to 1,223 on Wednesday. However, the number of patients always lags behind changes in infection levels, so the full impact of the current high case levels will only be felt in the next week or so. Ms Sturgeon said the changes ""strike an appropriate balance"" between breaking chains of transmission and reducing the disruption of self-isolation to the economy and critical services. Opposition parties had been calling for changes to the isolation rules for weeks. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the government's initial reluctance to follow the rest of the UK was ""not sustainable"" from the outset and had seen Scotland ""left as an outlier"". He also called on the government to show what had changed in the clinical advice it had received. Ms Sturgeon said she would publish as much data as possible, but said the decision had involved the ""application of judgement"" by ministers. She said: ""Last week I did not think it was the case that the benefits of changing self-isolation would outweigh the risks. ""The higher transmission now and the bigger burden of self-isolation on the economy has changed that judgement."" Ms Sturgeon defended her decision not to change the isolation rules sooner Business groups welcomed the changes, along with further detail of financial support for the worst-affected sectors. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move ""should have a positive impact on businesses ability to operate and allow employees to return to work safely, while also safeguarding public health"". The Scottish Retail Consortium said staffing levels were ""manageable for the time being"", adding that Wednesday's changes ""should help ease the level of staff absences in retail and its wider supply chain"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also backed the changes, saying ""they will be a relief to public services and businesses who were feeling the impact of restrictions"". Scotland's other Covid restrictions are to remain in place for at least another week, with ministers to review the situation again on 11 January. Ms Sturgeon said she expected that restrictions on large gatherings and the requirement for physical distancing and table service in hospitality venues will remain in force until 17 January at the earliest. People in Scotland have been urged to reduce their social contacts as much as possible, with guidance not to meet up in groups of more than three households. Ms Sturgeon also said Scotland would need to find ways of adapting its response to the ongoing challenge of the virus, warning that Omicron is ""unlikely to be the last new variant we encounter"". She said the government would not be ""giving up on trying to control Covid entirely"", but would be ""seeking ways of doing so that are more proportionate, more sustainable and less restrictive"".

"Vodafone is delaying the reintroduction of roaming charges in Europe by three weeks. The phone network had planned to bring in post-Brexit roaming fees on 6 January, matching other networks that plan to do so in 2022. But it said more time was needed for testing, and the change will now come in at the end of January. EE has also delayed resuming its roaming charges, which were planned for January, until March. Before the UK left the EU, users were able to use their calls, texts, and data allowance in their mobile plans in any EU country. But the EU trade deal of December 2020 gave mobile operators the option of reintroducing charges. The Three network has also said it will bring in roaming charges between the UK and Europe, though their change is planned for May 2022. That means that of the largest mobile networks, only O2 has not announced any plans for the reintroduction of roaming fees. Mobile roaming charges: What you need to know Three to bring in Europe roaming charges Explaining the reason for delaying its planned changes, Vodafone said it was not ready to bring in the new system. ""We have pushed back the introduction of roaming charges to the end of January, giving time for further testing to ensure the best possible experience for customers purchasing our Â£1 per day bundles. Until then, customers will continue to be able to roam without charges."" The Â£1 a day charge is Vodafone's best price, and only applies when bought in an eight or 15-day bundle. The usual planned price is Â£2 per day in fees, matching EE and Three's planned pricing. EE said the shift in its plans was caused by unspecified technical delays. ""Making big changes to billing systems in mobile phone networks is always risky,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight and founder of the Mobile Phone Museum. ""The backlash and negative publicity for any network operator that does not get it right would be immense if a customer ended up with an eye-watering roaming bill. ""My guess is that rather than rushing out a change, the operators are delaying the introduction to be absolutely sure everything is working. ""Given the current Covid situation it's not like lots of people are travelling, so the operators are not going to be massively exposed on unexpected roaming costs.""

It is Chelsea who take a 2-0 lead into the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg at Tottenham next week. You can read Emlyn Begley's report on the action at Stamford Bridge here. Until next time... FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur More from Antonio Conte:âThere
is a lot of jobs to do, in this moment, it is very difficult to understand
which part you take to improve because there is a lot of situations to improve.
We need time, and patience. Everyone has to have patience, because Tottenham in
the last years the level has dropped a lot and now we have to fight to win
every game. âI started my experience with
Tottenham and every game we have fought, and now we struggle to win the game,
it wasnât a game you could say it was easy. âWe have to be humble, to understand
the situation at the moment and continue to work to improve our players, then
we will see. It is not simple to say go in the transfer market, in January it wonât
be easy and now the most important thing is to be focused and work to improve. âThe results in the league
were good, we reached the semi-final in Carabao Cup and for Tottenham at this
moment that is a good target. âI am always very honest with
my players, we have to clap the performance of Chelsea. I like to tell the truth
and with a good lie you donât go anywhere. They showed to be a really good
team, much better than us. âWe have to try to change
this situation, slowly, slowly. It is impossible to change the situation in one
or two transfer markets. âThere is a lot of jobs to do
in Tottenham and we need a lot of time. It is important for patience and I have
to have for me also to have patience.â FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham boss Antonio Conte,
speaking to Sky Sports:âIt was a difficult game, difficult from the start,
Chelsea showed to be much better than us. âThe first half, we struggled
a lot from the start but we know that we are talking about one of the best teams
in Europe, in the world, last season they won the Champions League. If you
compare the two teams there is not a comparison. We are talking about a team ready
to win - today we have seen the difference between the two teams. âIt is not easy to play at
Stamford Bridge, the way they were very concentrated, they won the ball every
time and then we conceded also a goal we were unlucky. When you start the game
and after a few minutes they score, for sure the game becomes very difficult. âBut, I know the situation,
it is very clear in this moment there is an important gap. We have to try to
fight to stay in the league in a good position, but if we think we are close, I
think we are not in the right way.â FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea More from Thomas Tuchel, on Romelu Lukaku:""Good, absolutely happy, I was pretty sure he was not affected. Even the last days he seemed relaxed, fine with the situation and mentally moved on. ""Romelu can handle pressure and adversity, it was a good performance, he contrinbued a lot to our defensive set up and had chances."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Thomas Tuchel also says Kai Havertz broke his finger in the first half, but played on until the interval. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, speaking to Sky Sports:âIt
seems like a deserved win, an excellent result because it reflects the game, we
could have scored more but it is hard to score against Tottenham. ""We did create a lot,
some huge chances, it could hve been possible to score more, the up side is
everybody knows it is going to be a tough match, it is not decided yet. âIt was impressive, it is
easy to say fresh legs but if you have not played a lot it is sometimes unfair to
put them in a big match like this and demand to see fresh legs. ""We never lost the foucs, never
lost the commitment. The guys who did not play in the past few weeks were
strong. âWe played 4-4-2 when we had
the ball, because there was no one left to play with a back five. We took some minutes on the training pitch to talk through the princioples, I found the team very
focused to do it right. ""We had some moments in
defending where we created a back five, the team was very focused, very open minded."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Andy Wright:Just half time with 90 minutes to go.

FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham have never won away against Chelsea in the League Cup, drawing one and losing four of their visits to Stamford Bridge in the competition. Chelsea have only lost one of their last 16 home games in the League Cup (W12 D3), losing 2-1 to Man Utd in October 2019. The Blues scored inside the first five minutes in a match against Spurs for the first time since April 2017, when Willian netted in the FA Cup. Twelve of Kai Havertz's 14 goals for Chelsea in all competitions have been scored in London, with each of his last four coming at Stamford Bridge. Havertz has scored five goals in just three League Cup appearances, just one goal fewer than he's scored in 42 Premier League games (six). Ruben Loftus-Cheek made his 100th appearance for Chelsea in all competitions, having made his debut for the Blues back in December 2014 vs Sporting CP. Indeed, 58 of his 100 appearances for the club have come as a substitute. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Karen CarneyFormer Chelsea midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Chelsea controlled everything tonight. They were back to their usual Chelsea self. It was a really good performance. Thomas Tuchel will be happy right now with the clean sheet and win but tomorrow when he reflects on it he'll think 'we've still left them in the tie'. It should have been done and dusted. With how poor Spurs were, they should have really gone for them. They should have put the whole semi-final to bed. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea Chelsea's Hakim Ziyech,
speaking to Sky Sports:âIt was a good performance for the team - strong first
half, second half was a little bit up and down but overall a good performance. âThe second half they had
chances as well, we had bigger chances, but 2-0, we can be happy with that. âWe put pressure on them, donât
give them the space and time, I think we did good the first half especially. âWe had four at the back,
normally we have five, so that gave us more opportunities up front â they didnât
know whether to follow the midfielders or step out. âWe forgot to finish the
game, a lot of chances, hopefully we get the job done there.â FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea have only lost one of their last 36 home games in all competitions against Tottenham, winning 23 times in the process, drawing 12. Pretty dominant at the Bridge. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Clinton MorrisonFormer Crystal Palace striker on BBC Radio 5 Live Spurs aren't out of it but it was comfortable for Chelsea. They were in second gear. It didn't look like a semi-final for Spurs. It looked like they were going through the motions. They're still in it if they can get the first goal next week. It was a flat performance. Who really thinks this is a big cup competition to win? Harry Kane was chasing things down but I didn't see many others. You want to get to a final and lift some silverware. If Chelsea wanted to go to that next level, they could have. There was a lot left in the tank. 2-0 flattered Spurs. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Dax Fullbrook:iâm pinning my hopes on Chelsea neeeding to postpone the second leg. they are told to forfeit. 3-0 Spurs. we go through 3-2.

All 3 in the form of their lives which 2 do you pick?! Henri Harvey-Smith:How is Hojbjerg still on the pitch? Howler todayâ¦Winksy and Skippy in the middle was surely a no brainier? FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham A confident, controlled performance from Chelsea, who could have been out of sight after this semi-final first leg. Tottenham, in fairness, improved after what was a calamitous first half. Antonio Conte will be pleased they at least created a couple of chances after the break. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea take a two-goal advantage to north London. Tottenham will be thankful they are just about still in this tie. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chance for Romelu Lukaku! It's a neat flick from Timo Werner to pick him out and Lukaku can only first straight at Hugo Lloris. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Harvey Vale, the 18-year-old, gets a touch and wins a throw. Chelsea work it around the Spurs box and out to Christian Pulisic, who slings a cross far too high and away from any of his team-mates. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Four minutes added on. Chelsea look happy to keep hold of the ball for the moment. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Cesar Azpilicueta is now down and having treatment. He didn't want to leave his team in the lurch while Spurs had the ball, but will have to go off here. Youngster Harvey Vale is coming on. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Cesar Azpilicueta is holding his right hamstring and Chelsea want Spurs to put the ball out. They don't, with the Spaniard still on his feet, and Bryan Gil shows some great footwork to get in down the left.

"Troops could be seen in Almaty on Thursday morning Security forces in the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan say they have killed dozens of anti-government rioters in the main city, Almaty. They moved in after protesters tried to take control of police stations in the city, a police spokeswoman said. Twelve members of the security forces have been killed and 353 injured in the unrest, sparked by a doubling in the cost of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Russia is sending in troops at the request of the Kazakh president. They will be deployed to help ""stabilise"" the country, which is a member of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) along with Russia, Belarus, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia. The CSTO confirmed Russian paratroopers were being dispatched as peacekeepers, with advance units already deployed. Protests began on Sunday when the government lifted its price cap on LPG, which many people use to fuel their cars, but the unrest has since spread to include political grievances. Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe, dwarfing in land mass the other former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Why does it matter?It has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. A mainly Muslim republic with a large Russian minority, it has largely escaped the civil strife seen in other parts of Central Asia. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots have rocked the government, resulting in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters. Why have there been riots and deaths in Kazakhstan? BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Rare protests in a country that bans dissent Getting a clear picture of what is happening is proving difficult amid what monitoring groups describe as a ""nation-scale internet blackout"", and there are reports that security forces sided with protesters in some places. Almaty police spokeswoman Saltanat Azirbek called on people in the city to stay at home temporarily as a ""counter-terrorist"" operation continued in three administrative buildings on Thursday. Dozens of attackers were ""eliminated"" after they tried to storm police buildings in the city, she said, adding that weapons had been stolen by rioters. About 1,000 people have reportedly been injured in the unrest, with 400 being treated in hospital and 62 in intensive care. Protesters also targeted the mayor's office in Almaty and Kazakhstan's main airport, while water cannon were used against protesters in the western city of Aktobe. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has imposed a nationwide state of emergency that includes a curfew and a ban on mass gatherings. He also fired his powerful predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who held a national security role since stepping down as president, and the entire government also resigned. President Tokayev accused foreign-trained ""terrorist gangs"" of being behind the trouble and announced he had sought help from the CSTO, an alliance of former Soviet states dominated by Russia. The CSTO's current chairman, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, said the alliance would send peacekeeping forces ""for a limited period of time"". Video released by Russian media showed a small number of Russian soldiers boarding a military transport plane. According to the alliance, the peacekeeping force will be deployed to help protect state and military installations in Kazakhstan. The CSTO was set up nearly 30 years ago, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union, as an alliance to counter external military threats. In 2010, Russia rejected a request from Kyrgyzstan for the CSTO to send in peacekeepers when ethnic violence erupted there, saying it was an internal matter. Some parts of Kazakhstan like the Mangistau region, where the protests started, rely on LPG (butane and propane) for refuelling as many as 90% of vehicles, Reuters news agency reports. Despite being a major oil nation, Kazakhstan had regularly faced LPG shortages because producers got a better price exporting. When the government removed its price cap on 1 January, prices reportedly rose from 50 ($0.11; Â£0.08) to 120 tenge per litre. The government has since announced it is restoring the 50-tenge cap in Mangistau. byAbdujalil Abdurasulov,BBC News, Almaty The bustling square of Almaty has turned into a conflict zone, complete with burned down buildings and vehicles. Many people are scared to go outside, especially at night because clashes are continuing. The sounds of shooting and explosions remind people how dangerous it can be to leave their homes. Local vigilante groups block the entrances to their villages near Almaty to prevent looting. Checkpoints and makeshift barriers block the entrance to the city, so people are using narrow streets to get in and out of Almaty. There are big queues at petrol stations. Residents are struggling to buy food because shopping malls, supermarkets, cafes and restaurants are all closed, only small shops are still open. And the internet shutdown continues, so people cannot withdraw money or top up their phones. This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in Almaty, the country's biggest city.

"This video can not be played Australian PM Scott Morrison: ""There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic"" World number one tennis player Novak Djokovic's entry to Australia has been delayed over an issue with his visa. The player arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, where authorities noticed that his team had made a mistake on his application. Djokovic is due to play in the Australian Open, after being exempted from vaccination rules. But his team had not requested a visa that permits medical exemptions for being unvaccinated. All players and staff at the tournament must be vaccinated or have an exemption granted by an expert independent panel. The tennis star has been quizzed for hours about his visa status and exemption evidence in a room in Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport and is still awaiting a decision. He has not spoken about his vaccination status, but last year he said he was ""opposed to vaccination"". The country's border force had sought clarification from the Victorian state government about his visa application,the Melbourne-based Age newspaper reports,external. But state government Minister Jaala Pulford tweeted that his application would not be supported.Visa approvals were a matter for the federal government, she added.,external Meanwhile, Djokovic's father, Srdjan Djokovic saidhis son was being held in a room guarded by police,external. ""I have no idea what's going on, they're holding my son captive for five hours. ""This is not just a fight for Novak, but a fight for the whole world. If they don't let him go in half an hour, we will gather on the street""he said in a statement released to the media,external. Djokovic's coach and fellow Grand Slam champion Goran Ivanisevic posted a photo of himself on Instagram from a room in Melbourne, along with the caption: ""Not the most usual trip Down Under.""

Earlier, Australia's prime minister said Djokovic would be refused entry to the country unless he provided evidence that he could not be vaccinated for medical reasons. Scott Morrison said the tennis player ""could be on the next plane home"" if the proof was insufficient. The tournament's organisers say the defending champion has not been given special treatment, but the decision has infuriated many Australians. The country is seeing tens of thousands of Covid-19 cases for the first time after enduring some of the world's strictest restrictions. Mr Morrison said the Serbian player would be required to present evidence upon arrival that he has a genuine medical exemption from vaccination. The Australian Open begins on 17 January in Melbourne. ""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else,"" the prime minister told reporters. ""There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever."" The comments seemed to represent a change in his position, after he said on Tuesday that Victoria's state government had provided the player with an exemption to enter the country and that officials would act ""in accordance with that decision"". This video can not be played Australians give their views on Novak Djokovic's exemption More than 90% of Australia's over-16 population is fully vaccinated, but some people still cannot travel interstate or globally because of current measures. Many Australians had previously accused the government ofallowing the rich and famous to do as they pleasewhile ordinary people remained separated from sick and dying loved ones. ""I think it's a disgrace,"" Melbourne resident Christine Wharton told ABC. ""We've all done the right thing, we've all gone out and got our jabs and our boosters and we have someone that has come from overseas and all of a sudden he's been exempt and can play."" Novak Djokovic has been granted permission to defend his Australian Open title The decision raised eyebrows with some other tennis players too. ""I just think it's very interesting. That's all I'm going to say,"" Australian Alex de Minaur said. Britain's Jamie Murray added: ""I think if it was me that wasn't vaccinated I wouldn't be getting an exemption. You know, but well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete."" The tournament's chief executive, Craig Tiley, said 26 athletes had applied for medical exemptions. ""A handful"" had been granted, he said, under guidelines set by federal regulators. ""We made it extra difficult for anyone applying for an application to ensure it was the right process and to make sure the medical experts deal with it independently,"" he told Channel 9. Novak Djokovic's announcement has made him an enemy to some and a hero to others. Whilst the tennis champion has never openly confirmed whether he has been vaccinated, what we do know is that he has previously tested positive for the virus and discussed his opposition to vaccines. During a Facebook live in April 2020 he explained how he ""wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine"" should that be necessary to travel or compete in tournaments. These comments were widely shared and praised in Facebook groups and Telegram channels promoting outlandish conspiracies that the vaccines are part of a sinister plot to control and harm the world's population. CONTEXT:The lives upended by Australia's sealed border FEATURE:Crisis causes fury in Aboriginal communities And previous comments like this have added fuel to the fire when it comes to the latest row over why he has been granted an exemption to travel. In Telegram channels promoting Covid-19 conspiracies, the exemption has given rise to incorrect theories that the vaccine is experimental. It has also led to outspoken vaccine sceptics, such as US tennis player Tennys Sandgren, to come out in support of Djokovic. Applications for medical exemptions are being assessed anonymously by two separate panels, with inflammatory cardiac illness or another acute condition listed as valid reasons. But it is also possible Djokovic has recently tested positive for the virus, which would allow him to defer taking the vaccine. A spokeswoman for the event told the BBC they could not comment on the reasons behind the player's exemption.

"The GMB accused the council of ""playing Russian roulette with the safety of Carmarthenshire residents"" Council gritters began the first of 12 days of industrial action on Wednesday over pay and conditions. Further action is planned by staff in Carmarthenshire on Thursday, 6 January; from January 17 to 21 and from January 24 to 28. The GMB union accused the council of ""playing Russian roulette with the safety of Carmarthenshire residents"". The authority said arrangements were in place to ensure travellers remained safe. Gritting roads: Does it harm the environment? Snow in Wales: Remembering 1981's white Christmas Climate change: Will Wales see more sun and less snow? The GMB said the action was over members not being stood down from work in the expected manner after being put on call. GMB organiser Peter Hill said: ""Our members are also Carmarthenshire residents and we're advising our families and friends to avoid the roads over the next 48 hours as many will not be gritted."" Unison said the council had been ""chipping away at the agreement by not standing down workers"" and that responsibility for the dispute lay ""squarely with the council"". It accused the council of ""spending significant amounts of taxpayer money maintaining an inferior winter gritting service"". ""Councillors should get involved and give commitments to stick with an agreement their senior management signed,"" a spokesman said. Carmarthenshire council said contingency plans were in place to help drivers stay safe The council's environment member, Hazel Evans, said the council made an agreement with the trade unions in 2020 to cover winter maintenance duties which ""provided them with a remuneration package which is one of the highest in Wales"". Ms Evans said the council had adhered to the agreement's terms and conditions. ""An increased offer was put to the trade unions to help secure the winter maintenance service,"" she said. ""The offer is considered very reasonable and at the level of what the council can afford. ""Unfortunately, trade union colleagues have chosen not to present this offer to their members but have decided to ballot and implement a period of industrial action at this difficult time."" It said its offer remained on the table. ""In the interim the council will implement its contingency plan to undertake gritting on a reduced resilient network,"" Ms Evans said. The Unite union declined to comment as only as only a small number of its members were involved.

It is Chelsea who take a 2-0 lead into the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg at Tottenham next week. You can read Emlyn Begley's report on the action at Stamford Bridge here. Until next time... FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur More from Antonio Conte:âThere
is a lot of jobs to do, in this moment, it is very difficult to understand
which part you take to improve because there is a lot of situations to improve.
We need time, and patience. Everyone has to have patience, because Tottenham in
the last years the level has dropped a lot and now we have to fight to win
every game. âI started my experience with
Tottenham and every game we have fought, and now we struggle to win the game,
it wasnât a game you could say it was easy. âWe have to be humble, to understand
the situation at the moment and continue to work to improve our players, then
we will see. It is not simple to say go in the transfer market, in January it wonât
be easy and now the most important thing is to be focused and work to improve. âThe results in the league
were good, we reached the semi-final in Carabao Cup and for Tottenham at this
moment that is a good target. âI am always very honest with
my players, we have to clap the performance of Chelsea. I like to tell the truth
and with a good lie you donât go anywhere. They showed to be a really good
team, much better than us. âWe have to try to change
this situation, slowly, slowly. It is impossible to change the situation in one
or two transfer markets. âThere is a lot of jobs to do
in Tottenham and we need a lot of time. It is important for patience and I have
to have for me also to have patience.â FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham Hotspur Tottenham boss Antonio Conte,
speaking to Sky Sports:âIt was a difficult game, difficult from the start,
Chelsea showed to be much better than us. âThe first half, we struggled
a lot from the start but we know that we are talking about one of the best teams
in Europe, in the world, last season they won the Champions League. If you
compare the two teams there is not a comparison. We are talking about a team ready
to win - today we have seen the difference between the two teams. âIt is not easy to play at
Stamford Bridge, the way they were very concentrated, they won the ball every
time and then we conceded also a goal we were unlucky. When you start the game
and after a few minutes they score, for sure the game becomes very difficult. âBut, I know the situation,
it is very clear in this moment there is an important gap. We have to try to
fight to stay in the league in a good position, but if we think we are close, I
think we are not in the right way.â FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea More from Thomas Tuchel, on Romelu Lukaku:""Good, absolutely happy, I was pretty sure he was not affected. Even the last days he seemed relaxed, fine with the situation and mentally moved on. ""Romelu can handle pressure and adversity, it was a good performance, he contrinbued a lot to our defensive set up and had chances."" FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Thomas Tuchel also says Kai Havertz broke his finger in the first half, but played on until the interval. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel, speaking to Sky Sports:âIt
seems like a deserved win, an excellent result because it reflects the game, we
could have scored more but it is hard to score against Tottenham. ""We did create a lot,
some huge chances, it could hve been possible to score more, the up side is
everybody knows it is going to be a tough match, it is not decided yet. âIt was impressive, it is
easy to say fresh legs but if you have not played a lot it is sometimes unfair to
put them in a big match like this and demand to see fresh legs. ""We never lost the foucs, never
lost the commitment. The guys who did not play in the past few weeks were
strong. âWe played 4-4-2 when we had
the ball, because there was no one left to play with a back five. We took some minutes on the training pitch to talk through the princioples, I found the team very
focused to do it right. ""We had some moments in
defending where we created a back five, the team was very focused, very open minded."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Andy Wright:Just half time with 90 minutes to go.

FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Tottenham have never won away against Chelsea in the League Cup, drawing one and losing four of their visits to Stamford Bridge in the competition. Chelsea have only lost one of their last 16 home games in the League Cup (W12 D3), losing 2-1 to Man Utd in October 2019. The Blues scored inside the first five minutes in a match against Spurs for the first time since April 2017, when Willian netted in the FA Cup. Twelve of Kai Havertz's 14 goals for Chelsea in all competitions have been scored in London, with each of his last four coming at Stamford Bridge. Havertz has scored five goals in just three League Cup appearances, just one goal fewer than he's scored in 42 Premier League games (six). Ruben Loftus-Cheek made his 100th appearance for Chelsea in all competitions, having made his debut for the Blues back in December 2014 vs Sporting CP. Indeed, 58 of his 100 appearances for the club have come as a substitute. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Karen CarneyFormer Chelsea midfielder on BBC Radio 5 Live Chelsea controlled everything tonight. They were back to their usual Chelsea self. It was a really good performance. Thomas Tuchel will be happy right now with the clean sheet and win but tomorrow when he reflects on it he'll think 'we've still left them in the tie'. It should have been done and dusted. With how poor Spurs were, they should have really gone for them. They should have put the whole semi-final to bed. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea Chelsea's Hakim Ziyech,
speaking to Sky Sports:âIt was a good performance for the team - strong first
half, second half was a little bit up and down but overall a good performance. âThe second half they had
chances as well, we had bigger chances, but 2-0, we can be happy with that. âWe put pressure on them, donât
give them the space and time, I think we did good the first half especially. âWe had four at the back,
normally we have five, so that gave us more opportunities up front â they didnât
know whether to follow the midfielders or step out. âWe forgot to finish the
game, a lot of chances, hopefully we get the job done there.â FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea have only lost one of their last 36 home games in all competitions against Tottenham, winning 23 times in the process, drawing 12. Pretty dominant at the Bridge. FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Clinton MorrisonFormer Crystal Palace striker on BBC Radio 5 Live Spurs aren't out of it but it was comfortable for Chelsea. They were in second gear. It didn't look like a semi-final for Spurs. It looked like they were going through the motions. They're still in it if they can get the first goal next week. It was a flat performance. Who really thinks this is a big cup competition to win? Harry Kane was chasing things down but I didn't see many others. You want to get to a final and lift some silverware. If Chelsea wanted to go to that next level, they could have. There was a lot left in the tank. 2-0 flattered Spurs. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Dax Fullbrook:iâm pinning my hopes on Chelsea neeeding to postpone the second leg. they are told to forfeit. 3-0 Spurs. we go through 3-2.

FT: Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham A confident, controlled performance from Chelsea, who could have been out of sight after this semi-final first leg. Tottenham, in fairness, improved after what was a calamitous first half. Antonio Conte will be pleased they at least created a couple of chances after the break. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chelsea take a two-goal advantage to north London. Tottenham will be thankful they are just about still in this tie. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Chance for Romelu Lukaku! It's a neat flick from Timo Werner to pick him out and Lukaku can only first straight at Hugo Lloris. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Harvey Vale, the 18-year-old, gets a touch and wins a throw. Chelsea work it around the Spurs box and out to Christian Pulisic, who slings a cross far too high and away from any of his team-mates. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Four minutes added on. Chelsea look happy to keep hold of the ball for the moment. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Cesar Azpilicueta is now down and having treatment. He didn't want to leave his team in the lurch while Spurs had the ball, but will have to go off here. Youngster Harvey Vale is coming on. Chelsea 2-0 Tottenham Cesar Azpilicueta is holding his right hamstring and Chelsea want Spurs to put the ball out. They don't, with the Spaniard still on his feet, and Bryan Gil shows some great footwork to get in down the left.

"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in Almaty, the country's biggest city. Internet access has been cut in Kazakhstan amid mass protests sparked by rising fuel prices. Anti-government protesters in the main city, Almaty, stormed the mayor's office on Wednesday. Part of the building appeared to be on fire. Protests have also erupted in several other cities, with security forces using tear gas and stun grenades. The president has promised a tough response, calling the protests a ""black period"" in the country's history. ""As president, I am obliged to protect the safety and peace of our citizens, to worry about the integrity of Kazakhstan,"" Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a TV address. He called the protesters ""plotters"" who were ""financially motivated"". Internet services in the country have been disrupted since Tuesday. By Wednesday, internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported that Kazakhstan was ""in the midst of a nation-scale internet blackout"". It came as thousands of people took to the streets, despite a state of emergency in the capital Nur-Sultan, in Almaty, and in the western province of Mangistau. In Almaty, protesters gathered at the mayor's office before eventually storming it. Videos on social media showed a plume of smoke rising from the building, while gunfire could also be heard. The city's police chief, Kanat Taimerdenov, said ""extremists and radicals"" had attacked 500 civilians and ransacked hundreds of businesses. Water cannon was used against protesters in the western city of Aktobe. There are reports that security forces have sided with protesters in some places. Police fired stun grenades at protesters on Wednesday BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Rare protests in a country that bans dissent The demonstrations started in the west of Kazakhstan on Sunday, before spreading across the country. They began when the government lifted the price cap on liquefied petroleum gas, which many people use to power their cars. Its price quickly doubled in a matter of days. On Tuesday, the president dismissed the government and said lower fuel prices would be restored, but the announcement has not brought an end to the protests. Dissent and protests are uncommon in Kazakhstan, which declared independence in 1991 amid the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the town of Zhanaozen, in Mangistau province, was the scene of deadly unrest in 2011. At least 14 oil workers were killed in a police crackdown on a protest over pay and working conditions. The town has also been one of the main centres of the latest unrest. By Olga Ivshina, BBC Russian The speed at which the protests turned violent took many by surprise, both in Kazakhstan and in the wider region, and hinted that they are not only about an increase in fuel prices. This is a traditionally stable Central Asian state, which is often described as authoritarian. Until 2019 it was run by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose rule was marked by elements of a personality cult, with his statues erected across the country and a capital renamed after him. Yet when he left, it was amid anti-government protests which he sought to limit by stepping down and putting a close ally in his place. Most elections in Kazakhstan are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote and there is no effective political opposition. The analysts I spoke to say that the Kazakh government clearly underestimated how angry the population was, and that these protests were not surprising in a country with no electoral democracy - people need to take to the streets to be heard. And their grievances are almost certainly about a far wider set of issues than the price of fuel.

"People who test positive for Covid in Scotland can end self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests. The move, which takes effect from midnight, brings Scotland into line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Household contacts of people with the virus will be allowed to take lateral flow tests rather than self-isolating, as long as they have had their booster. Asymptomatic people who return a positive lateral flow test will no longer have to confirm their result with a PCR. The first minister says the changes are ""not completely without risk"" but strike ""an appropriate balance"". Nicola Sturgeon says existing Covid rules, such as restrictions on large events, will stay in place and will probably remain until 17 January. A further 16,103 positive cases have been reported in Scotland, with five further deaths. There are 1,223 people in hospital with Covid, with 42 in intensive care.

Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden says the restrictions on large gatherings, which are currently in place until 17 January, are ""perilously close"" to the Six Nations rugby tournament. He asks if fans can book tickets and whether the hospitality industry can prepare for the tournament. The first minister says everything has to be monitored on a ""closer-time basis"" and adds: ""It is really difficult, particularly at this phase of the virus, to be certain about the future."" But Ms Sturgeon goes on to say that she hopes the restrictions will not be in place beyond 17 January and that the matches will go ahead in front of supporters. Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, believes the changes should have a ""positive impact"". She says: ""Greater alignment and an enhanced four-nations approach towards testing is a positive step in the right direction and many businesses who were struggling due to staff shortages will now be able to open their doors again.â Dr Cameron also calls for a ""clear end date"" for the current working from home requirements. Business representatives have welcomed the changes to Scotland's self-isolation rules David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, says companies continue
to report increased but manageable staff absence levels. He adds: ""The decision to follow Wales and England and shorten
Scotlandâs self-isolation period is welcome and should help ease the level of
staff absences in retail and its wider supply chain.â Matthew Fell, CBI chief policy director for Scotland, says the level of absences through
self-isolation is ""starting to bite"" across the economy. Reducing the number of isolation days from 10 to seven with tests on the final days to ensure safety is a pragmatic choice that can help keep the Scottish economy moving."" Matthew Fell, CBI chief policy director for Scotland The SNP's Neil Gray asks the FM to outline what support is available to private nurseries and to clarify the guidance for
testing children under the age of five. He says some nurseries ""appear to require proof of a negative PCR test for
attendance"". Ms Sturgeon says her government will continue to support all early years settings and that today's changes to self-isolation rules will help with staffing problems. She says children under five are required to get a test where they have Covid
symptoms. However, if they are only close contacts of someone who tests positive, then testing is encouraged but not required. Oliver Mundell from the Conservatives asks what resources are being made available to keep schools open. In particular, he asks about additional non-classroom committed teachers and electronic devices for every pupil. He says
what has happened in schools ""makes a mockery"" of the first minister's promise to make education a priority. The FM says there are now 2,000 more teachers than before the pandemic and that her government has ""done what weâve said
we would"" do in terms of electronic devices - ""starting with those in most deprived
circumstances"". She adds that guidance was issued before Christmas on other things schools could do to minimise disruption - such as minimising contact and time
restrictions on visitors. The FM says the Scottish negotiating committee for teachers also agreed
on contingency plans such as combining classes and temporarily relocating teachers. Deputy First Minister John Swinney has been criticised over comparisons between Scotland and England Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says Deputy First Minister John Swinney yesterday cited data from the Office for National Statistics to highlight ""how much better we are doing in Scotland"" due to the restrictions. But Ms Baillie says the data used covered the period up to 23 December - when the rules were largely the same in Scotland and England and before the new restrictions took effect. She asks if the first minister would agree that it is essential ministers do not ""spin statistics"" and weaken public confidence. Ms Sturgeon says the figures cited by Mr Swinney were the most up-to-date data available at that time. She adds that she would urge ""significant caution"" about the seven-day rolling average of cases in any part of the UK up to 3 January due to factors such as the festive period and testing availability. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton asks the first minister if she agrees that transparency of data is important - referring to how the government has yet to publish an analysis of hospitalisations. He also claims that testing in Scotland is ""significantly down"" on last year with less than 50,000 PCR tests done per day. The FM argues she is not trying to hide any data and that Public Health Scotland are working to make sure the information is reliable. She says she does not accept that testing is down, saying that the UK government labs do 50,000 tests in Scotland per day plus NHS Scotland has a capacity of 32,000 per day. The labs in Scotland are currently suffering from staff absences due to Covid, Ms Sturgen adds, which has contributed to a ""fluctuation"" in the number of tests done per day. Mr Sarwar highlights issues around PCR capacity and the supply of lateral flow tests. The first minister says with high community transmission there will be ""periodically"" pressure on the testing system. She says work is under way on a four nations basis to resolve and flex capacity as far as possible. Ms Sturgeon adds there is no issue with lateral flow tests in Scotland at the moment and PCR test turnarounds have ""become much shorter again"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar welcomes the changes to the self-isolation rules and the support for businesses who have been hit hard by the pandemic. He then asks the first minister to share the data that the Scottish government is basing its Covid decisions on. Ms Sturgeon says she has not seen the full Scottish data yet on Omicron but adds she has been assured Public Health Scotland will publish the first results of its analysis on Friday. Mr Ross repeatedly calls on the first minister to publish the clinical advice she received this week and last to demonstrate the reason behind the change on self-isolation rules. He also criticises the deputy first minister John Swinney for making what he says were ""petty political points"" with out-of-date statistics comparing Scotland's Covid rates with England's. Ms Sturgeon says she will continue to publish as much data and evidence as possible ""providing there is a confidence in the robustness of that data"". She agrees with Mr Ross that virus rates are ""not a competition"" but says statistics regularly change. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross asks the first minister why it took so long for Scotland to change its self-isolation rules when other parts of the UK had already done so. Ms Sturgeon says she makes no apology for considering the matter ""very carefully"" and says the clinical advice she received was the risk of releasing people from isolation early would ""outweigh the benefits"". While she says she thinks the change is proportionate at this stage, it is still not without risk. ""None of
these things are straightforward"", the FM says, adding that she will always be ""accountable and open to scrutiny"". Turning to education, the first minister says all secondary school pupils are being asked to take a lateral flow test on the night before or morning of the first day back. Thereafter, they are advised to test twice a week and in advance of mixing socially with people from other households. University and college students are asked to test before travelling to term-time accommodation and thereafter twice a week and before socialising with other households. Our priority is to keep schools open and to minimise further disruption to education but, with community transmission high, I know the next few weeks will be challenging for pupils, staff and parents. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Ms Sturgeon says she will allocate a further Â£55m fund to address the toll of the pandemic on businesses. She says up to Â£28m will go to taxi
and private hire drivers and operators, Â£19m will go to beauticians and hairdressers, Â£5m will go to sport and a further Â£3m will go to tourism. The FM says work is taking place to make sure funds get into bank accounts as quickly as possible. Ms Sturgeon outlines the new advice on testing, which she says has been ""carefully considered"". People who have symptoms should still book a PCR test. However from tomorrow, if you do not have symptoms and get a positive result using a lateral flow test, you do not have to book a PCR test. Instead, Ms Sturgeon says, people should immediately isolate and report their results online so that contact tracing can begin. The risk of getting a false positive on a lateral flow test is very low - about three in 10,000, she says. These changes are significant and they are not completely without risk. However at this stage of the pandemic they do strike an appropriate balance between the continued importance of self-isolation in breaking chains of transmission and reducing the disruption self-isolation causes in the economy and other critical services. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister  The first minister confirms two changes to the self-isolation rules will take effect from midnight.   The requirement for ""fully vaccinated"" household contacts to self-isolate will be replaced by taking lateral flow tests every day for seven days. The self-isolation period for Covid cases is to be cut from 10 days to seven, if people record two negative tests and have no symptoms. This change has already been made in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first minister says the changes will take effect from midnight. The first minister says the surge in cases driven by Omicron is continuing in Scotland and there has been an 87% increase in new cases in the last week. Tomorrow's figures will almost certainly see us pass more than one million cases since the outset of the pandemic."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

"Concerns have been raised about NHS staff being left exhausted Some non-urgent surgery is being halted at Greater Manchester hospitals as the ""rising impact"" of Covid-19 and staffing shortages continues to affect NHS trusts. More than 20 English NHS trusts have declared critical incidents, according to Downing Street. Two trusts in Bristoldeclared the highest level of alert earlier. Health bosses in Greater Manchester said about 15% of their workforce were either ill with Covid or isolating. Health minister Gillian Keegan said the government knew ""this was going to be one of the most pressurised winters"" for the NHS and that extra investment had been given to help the service cope. She said declaring critical incidents was part of ""our NHS contingency and resilience plans"" that are ""tried and tested"" and in place every winter. Omicron stats are huge, but look beyond them Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Pre-departure travel tests to be scrapped Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership said the decision affecting 17 hospitals was ""a temporary measure"" and that cancer care, cardiac and vascular surgery and transplantation would not be affected. But it said Covid admissions were also rising sharply, with more than one in five patients in some of the region's hospitals testing positive. They said the ""challenges may get worse"" in the next fortnight. Fiona Noden, chief executive of Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, said the suspension of surgery had been ""a very difficult decision"" which was taken to ensure ""we can keep people safe, maintain infection control, deploy staff where they are needed most [and] keep looking after people who need urgent and emergency care"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said social care was also hit hard by staff absences with around half of care homes in the region are unable to accept new residents. He said there were about 650 people in hospital beds who are medically fit to be discharged but a shortage of care homes to take them.

This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board. Comparative data from two years ago is shown where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Bed occupancy data in Wales only goes back to April 2020. If you can't see the lookup, click here Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said a critical incident was ""an indication of very serious pressure"" at a trust which may ""not be able to provide"" a range of priority services. Other NHS trusts that have announced critical incidents since Christmas across England include: Norfolk and Waveney's care systemhas been placed on the highest state of alertand the county's biggest hospital said its number of patients with Covid had almost doubled since Friday The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which serves patients in Lancashire and south Cumbria, saidsome non-urgent operations and procedures had been suspended Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust's chief operating officer said there was ""very high demand"" for services and ""long waits"" in emergency and urgency care departments In Wiltshire,the Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust declared a critical incidentafter experiencing ""sustained high levels of demand"" and concerns over the ""availability of beds"" United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust's medical director said on Monday there were ""significant staffing pressures"" due to Covid-related absences,though essential services were still operating A critical incident was also declared at Plymouth's Derriford hospitalwith 99 positive cases there and at its three community hospitals Meanwhile, the number of hospital staff off sick across the North East and north Cumbria has increased 135% due to Covid since 24 December Elsewhere, North East Ambulance Service has asked people with suspected strokes or heart attacksto get a lift to hospital because of staff shortages. Patients were waiting on average for an hour to be seen and medical director Dr Mathew Beattie said there had been an 80% increase in Covid-related absences over the last six days. Ms Keegan asked NHS England to review the situation and said people could ""rely on getting to hospital if you are in an emergency like a heart attack"". The NHS is always under pressure at this time of year. In previous winters critical incidents have been declared and non-urgent surgery cancelled. Compromised care is nothing new. That's not to say the health service isn't facing a unique set of pressures this year. Admissions for Covid are already twice what would normally be seen for all types of respiratory infections. Staff absences are also double what they traditionally would be. And on both measures the situation is getting worse. What will be crucial is how much worse things get. The hope is infections will peak soon - and pressure on hospitals quickly afterwards. Much though depends on whether there is more spread among older age groups, who are at most risk of serious illness. Ministers are banking on the boosters limiting this. It will be at least a week maybe two before we have the answer. Meanwhile,Covid testing rules are to be eased for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. The UK Health Security Agency said the rule change will apply from 11 January and apply to England only for now. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: ""In many parts of the health service, we are currently in a state of crisis. ""Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. ""Community and social care services, which were already massively overstretched, are at breaking point. In many areas, ambulance services are unable to meet their target response times."" On Tuesday,Boris Johnson said he hoped England could ""ride out"" the current wavewithout further restrictions but acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel ""temporarily overwhelmed"".

Thelatest UK data is here- and a snapshot is below. Thanks for reading.  It's been a busy afternoon of Covid announcements in the UK. In case you missed them, here's a quick round-up of the key points: As we've been reporting, major changes to the travel rules for England have been announced. From Friday, travellers will no longer need a pre-arrival test. And from Sunday, arrivals will not need to isolate until they get a negative PCR test. Instead, they must take a lateral flow test within two days, without the automatic need to isolate. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says there will be a ""a full review of travel measures by the end of January to ensure a stable system is in place for 2022"".  Allow Twitter content?

And now more from the US: more children than ever before are being admitted to hospital with Covid-19
amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC statistics show that an average of 672 children were admitted
to hospital each day during the week that ended on Sunday, 2 January. This is more than
twice the daily figure between 20 and 26 December, when an average of 313 people
under 17 were admitted each day. Since August, more than 80,000 children have been
hospitalised with Covid-19. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that
the number of Covid-19 cases among young people had reached unprecedented
levels. More than 325,000 new cases were recorded among children during
the week ending 30 December â a 64% increase over the 199,000 new cases
recorded the week prior. An average of 672 children is being hospitalised with Covid-19 each day in the US. US airlines cancelled more than 1,400 flights on Wednesday, with
thousands more delayed amid pandemic-related staffing shortages, statistics show. According to airline data provider FlightAware, a total of
1,429 flights inside, into or out of the US were cancelled as of 15:00 GMT on
Wednesday, while 1,183 flights experienced delays. On Tuesday, a total of 1,562 flights were cancelled, with
over 6,600 delayed flights recorded. Since Christmas Eve on 24 December, over 20,000 flights have
been cancelled, leaving passengers scrambling for alternatives during one of
the busiest travel periods of the year. Faced with pandemic-related staffing shortages, a number of
US airlines have agreed to pay crew extra to pick up additional trips during
the holiday period. On 31 December,
United Airlines announced it would offer pilots triple pay throughout January
amid the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Tennis player Novak Djokovic's entry to Australia has been delayed after a dispute over a visa application. As we've been reporting, the world number one landed in Melbourne this afternoon amid a backlash at the decision to grant him a medical exemption from the requirement of having had a Covid vaccine. That decision allows him to play at the Australian Open later this month. But Djokovic is apparently unable to get through passport control because a member of his team applied for a sub-class of visa which does not allow medical exemptions for being unvaccinated. The Victorian state government has refused to support his application. According toAustralian media reports,external, Djokovic was being questioned by border force officials at the airport until at least 01:15 at night. We don't yet know if he's been let through.

Angela Rayner - who stood in for Sir Keir Starmer during PMQs, as he has tested for positive for Covid - says ""of course it's right"" for the government to keep Plan B measures in England. This video can not be played Covid: Labour's Angela Rayner responds to PM's Plan B statement Time for some reaction now to the announcement that pre-departure Covid tests to enter England from overseas will be scrapped from 04:00 on Friday - with travellers set to be able to take a lateral flow test on day two after arriving instead. Self-isolation until they receive a negative result in England is also ending. A spokesperson for London's Heathrow airport said the move provided a ""much needed boost to passengers desperate to see loved ones and to businesses that need to reconnect with global markets"". Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, welcomed the decision, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"" for passengers. But he urged ministers to ""take the final step towards restriction-free travel"" by removing the last Covid test requirement for vaccinated passengers so travelling does not become ""a preserve of the rich"". Travellers currently must pay for private tests rather than using free NHS tests. We've got more detail on the changes to coronavirus travel testing in England from the transport secretary. Grant Shapps hastweeted,externalthat fully vaccinated passengers and under 18s will no longer need to take a pre-departure test before returning to England if arriving after 04:00 GMT onFriday. He says the same groups arriving in England will now only need to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test if they arrive after 04:00 GMT onSunday. The need to self-isolate before getting a negative result is also ending. He says now Omicron is the dominant variant and is widespread in the UK, these measures are no longer proportionate. By removing them the government is supporting the safe reopening of international travel, he says. This video can not be played Covid self-isolation period will be cut to seven days in Scotland And if you missed it earlier, here's Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon updating the Scottish Parliament on rule changes - including a change to self-isolation requirements for both Covid cases and their contacts. Read more about the changes in Scotlandhere.  This video can not be played Covid: PM confirms Plan B will stay as England experiences 'fastest growth' in cases Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In recent days, confidence has been increasing in government
that the current restrictions in England are enough. They will now continue for the next three weeks. That means
working from home, face coverings indoors and, although the PM didnât mention
it, Covid certification for large events. The PM said that ministers would remove measures when they
are not necessary - and we have a couple of changes today. Firstly, if you travel abroad you wonât need to do a test
before travelling back to the UK. And then when you do return, you wonât need to isolate and pay for an
expensive PCR test. Instead, by the end of your second day back, youâll have to
do a lateral flow (although if thatâs positive, a PCR will then be needed). Ultimately, Boris Johnson is confident that the current
strategy is working, even though there are fewer restrictions in England than
the rest of the UK. Back now to the debate in PMQs - Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner is responding to the prime minister's Covid statement. Citing the PM's previous comment that the nation must ""ride out"" the Omicron wave, she says the NHS is ""not surfing"" and is instead ""struggling to stay afloat"". She refers toa number of hospital trusts declaring critical incidents in recent days due to staff shortages and high Covid casesacross the country. Critical incidents are declared when health bosses are concerned they may not be able to provide priority services. She calls on Boris Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The UK has recorded 194,747 new daily coronavirus cases and a further 334 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,the government's dashboard shows.,external A message on the dashboard says today's death figures include a backlog of hospital deaths reported overnight by NHS England covering the period 1 - 4 January. The PM confirms that pre-departure travel Covid tests to enter England from overseas will be scrapped from 04:00 on Friday. He also says he is lifting the requirement to self-isolate on arrival in England until receiving a negative PCR test result. Instead people can take a lateral flow test on day two - and if it's positive a further PCR test will be needed to identify any new variants, plus isolation as normal. The prime minister says the UK has the biggest testing programme in Europe - registering twice as many tests as France, and four times as many as Germany. Last month, 300m lateral flow tests were handed out, he says, which enabled people to spend Christmas with loved ones safely. But due to the ""sheer size"" of the Omicron wave, the government must take steps to ensure testing capacity ""reaches those who need it most"". He reiterates the announcement earlier that people in England will no longer have to confirm the result of a positive lateral flow test with a PCR test if they don't have symptoms. He says from Tuesday, people should just record the result of the lateral flow test on the government website and begin isolating. Boris Johnson says cabinet earlier agreed that England should stick with Plan B for a further three weeks - with a review before the regulations expire on 26 January. He says people in England should continue working from home wherever they can, wear face coverings on public transport, and also in most public indoor places. He says people should take a Covid test before going to high-risk settings or meeting the elderly or vulnerable. He says these measures are taking the edge off the Omicron wave - and to those asking if the government should go further, he says lockdowns are not cost-free.  Updates to follow... As Prime Minister's Questions wraps up, Boris Johnson will make a separate statement to MPs on the Covid response in England. The prime minister held a cabinet meeting this morning - and he has just confirmed in the Commons that England will stick with the so-called ""Plan B"" rules. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Some hopeful news buried in
the staggering growth of Omicron infections. There's a hint that growth in
London, the leading edge of the Omicron wave, may have been slightly slower
over the Christmas break. Having doubled in the week
before Christmas, infections grew by less - roughly from 7.5% to 9% - in
the week up to 31 December. We have to hope this slowdown
continues once everyone returns to work in the coming week. The growth this week
was driven by infections in the north of the country: the North West has almost
caught up with London and infections more than doubled in the North East and in
Yorkshire and the Humber. The unfortunate news is that
infections are doubling each week in the over 70s, growing faster than any
other age group. They still have a
much lower rate of infection than anyone else, but this is the group where the
boosters will be doing the most work to prevent infection turning into serious
illness.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Shoppers opted to pick up food for festive feasts in-store rather than online in 2021, research suggests. In-store visits to supermarkets hit their highest level since March 2020 as consumer confidence returned, according to market research firm Kantar. Online sales, however, fell in December by 3.7% against 2020 and accounted for 12.2% of sales. Overall, spending on groceries hit Â£11.7bn over the four weeks to 26 December as people splurged on treats. That marks a 0.2% decrease from the record-breaking figures in 2020, when strict coronavirus restrictions were in place. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: ""People seized the chance to enjoy Christmas with friends and family after last year's muted festivities."" Although formal rules restricting festivities weren't in place this last Christmas, shopping data suggests some opted to stock up and celebrate at home again, rather than in a pub or a restaurant, Mr McKevitt said. Christmas dinner costs rise as inflation bites Why is the cost of living going up? The most popular shopping day took place on 23 December. ""Shoppers clearly trusted that supermarket shelves would remain well stocked and they didn't feel the need to rush out much earlier to get their favourite festive treats,"" he added. Total UK grocery sales reached Â£31.7bn over the 12-week period, down 3% versus 2020 but up 8% against pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. Spending on Christmas dinner items was broadly flat, while people spent more on festive goodies, the new figures show. Sales of mince pies, for example, hit Â£62m - up 7% on 2020. About Â£61m was spent on Christmas chocolates, marking a  jump of 21%. The research also suggests some consumers were slightly nervous about over-indulging, with an 8% rise in the sale of indigestion remedies. And while the healthier sprout saw sales dented, chilled and frozen vegetarian options increased in popularity. Supermarkets' premium own-brand ranges also fared better than usual as shoppers splashed out. Asda's Extra Special and Iceland's Luxury ranges saw the fastest growth. But Kantar pointed out that rising costs have also added to customers' bills. It said that grocery price inflation, which tracks how quickly the cost of food items increases over time, reached 3.5% in December, adding nearly Â£15 to shoppers' average monthly grocery bill. The official UK figures showedthat inflation hit a 10-year high as the cost of energy, fuel and clothing jumped. It came after food and drink industry figures warned that the soaring cost of raw materials and ingredients was havinga ""terrifying"" impact on consumer prices.

"The rules on testing are to be eased for people travelling to England, the government has announced, following calls from the travel industry. From 04:00 GMT on Friday, fully vaccinated travellers coming to England will no longer have to take a test before they travel. And from Sunday, rather than taking a PCR test on day two of arrival, they can take a cheaper lateral flow. The rules for self-isolating on arrival will also change. The shake-up was confirmed by Boris Johnson earlier, following calls from travel firms who said the measures were not effective now that Omicron was spreading widely. Under the current rules in force until Friday, all fully-vaccinated travellers over the age of 12 must show proof of a negative test lateral flow or PCR test taken in the two days before coming to the UK. Fully vaccinated people must also pay for a PCR test within two days of arrival and self-isolate while waiting for the result. People who aren't fully vaccinated must currently take PCR tests on both day two and day eight after arriving, and self-isolate for 10 days. But under the new rules: From 04:00 GMT on Friday 7 January, people who are fully vaccinated and those aged under-18 will no longer need to take a test two days before travelling to England from countries outside the UK and the Common Travel Area. On arrival, they will have to take a PCR test but they will no longer have to self-isolate while awaiting the result From 04:00 GMT on Sunday 9 January they will only have to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on day two. But this test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests are not allowed Unvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and self-isolate for 10 days Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pre-departure test ""discourages many from travelling for fear of being trapped overseas and incurring significant extra expense"". The announcement comes after airlines said passenger testing was making no real impact, with data last week suggesting one in 25 people in England had the virus. They also said compulsory testing had held back the sector's recovery. Mr Johnson met his cabinet earlier and alongside changes to travel tests, the governmenthas said it will ease Covid testing rulesfor people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. On Tuesday,Mr Johnson said he hoped the country could ""ride out"" the current wave, although he acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed. That rule change will come into force on 11 January and apply to England only for now. Following the announcement for England, Health Minister for the Welsh government Eluned Morgan said: ""I have today reluctantly agreed to remove the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and under 18s to take a pre departure test (PDT) and a day 2 PCR test when arriving in the UK."" Currently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK. They then have to take another test - which this time must be a PCR test - within the first two days after their arrival in the UK. But at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 - and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid. But UK cases have now risen sharply and Omicron is the dominant variant - so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to ""keep out Omicron"". Read more. John Wyndham, who is currently planning a third trip to the US for February, said that scrapping pre-departure tests will make him feel unsafe on flights. ""I'm frustrated because pre-departure was the most important as an effective control and also the cheapest test,"" he told the BBC. Mr Wyndham runs a start-up company that is organising marching bands across the world to participate in London Band Week. He went to the US in December along with three colleagues, who paid Â£212 each for PCR testing. However, he said that the eliminating pre-departure testing will only save him around Â£30 per person and wasn't worth the added worry about new variants. ""It's bonkers that we could now sit on the plane with someone who has it,"" he said, adding that it would ""worsen what has already been the most stressful travelling of my life"". David Hughes will save around Â£800 However, holidaymaker David Hughes welcomed the scrapping of PCR tests before returning to the UK. Currently on holiday in Dubai, the rule change will save his family of 4 around Â£400 and another removing the Day 2 PCR will also save the family another Â£400. ""Having returned from a country where there were strict entry requirements and we were tested on arrival I would be very confident that we'll be returning to the UK Covid free,"" he told the BBC. Cancellation fees and no longer having to test before returning would mean significantly less hassle and stress, Mr Hughes added. In response, Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive of ABTA - The Travel Association, said the two announcements were ""potentially very positive"" for the travel sector, but that damage had ""already been done"". ""We now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,"" he added. Steve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2 and tour operator Jet2 Holidays, also said the timing of the announcement will make a ""huge difference"". Numbers of customers on their website, he said, were already increasing ""exponentially"" after the rule change. Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, agreed that the announcement meant customer demand would be boosted in a ""critical booking window"" for the industry. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren also welcomed the news, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"", as customers could now book and travel with ""confidence"". The trade body Airlines UK has argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry. UK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Will Omicron stall airlines' recovery in 2022? Ahead of the test changes, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) sent the government research it commissioned, which it claimed shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron. It said that passenger numbers at MAG's airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced. Tim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC's Today programme the research showed there was a ""basis for taking out all tests"" related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK. ""We are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn't be doing it and we should take those measures out,"" he added. Separately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: ""With so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it's likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday.""

But this test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests are not allowed Unvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and self-isolate for 10 days Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pre-departure test ""discourages many from travelling for fear of being trapped overseas and incurring significant extra expense"". The announcement comes after airlines said passenger testing was making no real impact, with data last week suggesting one in 25 people in England had the virus. They also said compulsory testing had held back the sector's recovery. Mr Johnson met his cabinet earlier and alongside changes to travel tests, the governmenthas said it will ease Covid testing rulesfor people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. On Tuesday,Mr Johnson said he hoped the country could ""ride out"" the current wave, although he acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed. That rule change will come into force on 11 January and apply to England only for now. Following the announcement for England, Health Minister for the Welsh government Eluned Morgan said: ""I have today reluctantly agreed to remove the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and under 18s to take a pre departure test (PDT) and a day 2 PCR test when arriving in the UK."" Currently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK. They then have to take another test - which this time must be a PCR test - within the first two days after their arrival in the UK. But at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 - and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid. But UK cases have now risen sharply and Omicron is the dominant variant - so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to ""keep out Omicron"". Read more. John Wyndham, who is currently planning a third trip to the US for February, said that scrapping pre-departure tests will make him feel unsafe on flights. ""I'm frustrated because pre-departure was the most important as an effective control and also the cheapest test,"" he told the BBC. Mr Wyndham runs a start-up company that is organising marching bands across the world to participate in London Band Week. He went to the US in December along with three colleagues, who paid Â£212 each for PCR testing. However, he said that the eliminating pre-departure testing will only save him around Â£30 per person and wasn't worth the added worry about new variants. ""It's bonkers that we could now sit on the plane with someone who has it,"" he said, adding that it would ""worsen what has already been the most stressful travelling of my life"". David Hughes will save around Â£800 However, holidaymaker David Hughes welcomed the scrapping of PCR tests before returning to the UK. Currently on holiday in Dubai, the rule change will save his family of 4 around Â£400 and another removing the Day 2 PCR will also save the family another Â£400. ""Having returned from a country where there were strict entry requirements and we were tested on arrival I would be very confident that we'll be returning to the UK Covid free,"" he told the BBC. Cancellation fees and no longer having to test before returning would mean significantly less hassle and stress, Mr Hughes added. In response, Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive of ABTA - The Travel Association, said the two announcements were ""potentially very positive"" for the travel sector, but that damage had ""already been done"". ""We now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,"" he added. Steve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2 and tour operator Jet2 Holidays, also said the timing of the announcement will make a ""huge difference"". Numbers of customers on their website, he said, were already increasing ""exponentially"" after the rule change. Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, agreed that the announcement meant customer demand would be boosted in a ""critical booking window"" for the industry. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren also welcomed the news, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"", as customers could now book and travel with ""confidence"". The trade body Airlines UK has argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry. UK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Will Omicron stall airlines' recovery in 2022? Ahead of the test changes, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) sent the government research it commissioned, which it claimed shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron. It said that passenger numbers at MAG's airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced. Tim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC's Today programme the research showed there was a ""basis for taking out all tests"" related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK. ""We are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn't be doing it and we should take those measures out,"" he added. Separately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter told Reuters: ""With so many people in the short-term being forced to isolate at home, it's likely many people will be spending the next few weeks browsing travel blogs for inspiration, given there is so much desperation for a holiday.""

Thelatest UK data is here- and a snapshot is below. Thanks for reading.  It's been a busy afternoon of Covid announcements in the UK. In case you missed them, here's a quick round-up of the key points: As we've been reporting, major changes to the travel rules for England have been announced. From Friday, travellers will no longer need a pre-arrival test. And from Sunday, arrivals will not need to isolate until they get a negative PCR test. Instead, they must take a lateral flow test within two days, without the automatic need to isolate. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says there will be a ""a full review of travel measures by the end of January to ensure a stable system is in place for 2022"".  Allow Twitter content?

And now more from the US: more children than ever before are being admitted to hospital with Covid-19
amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC statistics show that an average of 672 children were admitted
to hospital each day during the week that ended on Sunday, 2 January. This is more than
twice the daily figure between 20 and 26 December, when an average of 313 people
under 17 were admitted each day. Since August, more than 80,000 children have been
hospitalised with Covid-19. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that
the number of Covid-19 cases among young people had reached unprecedented
levels. More than 325,000 new cases were recorded among children during
the week ending 30 December â a 64% increase over the 199,000 new cases
recorded the week prior. An average of 672 children is being hospitalised with Covid-19 each day in the US. US airlines cancelled more than 1,400 flights on Wednesday, with
thousands more delayed amid pandemic-related staffing shortages, statistics show. According to airline data provider FlightAware, a total of
1,429 flights inside, into or out of the US were cancelled as of 15:00 GMT on
Wednesday, while 1,183 flights experienced delays. On Tuesday, a total of 1,562 flights were cancelled, with
over 6,600 delayed flights recorded. Since Christmas Eve on 24 December, over 20,000 flights have
been cancelled, leaving passengers scrambling for alternatives during one of
the busiest travel periods of the year. Faced with pandemic-related staffing shortages, a number of
US airlines have agreed to pay crew extra to pick up additional trips during
the holiday period. On 31 December,
United Airlines announced it would offer pilots triple pay throughout January
amid the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Tennis player Novak Djokovic's entry to Australia has been delayed after a dispute over a visa application. As we've been reporting, the world number one landed in Melbourne this afternoon amid a backlash at the decision to grant him a medical exemption from the requirement of having had a Covid vaccine. That decision allows him to play at the Australian Open later this month. But Djokovic is apparently unable to get through passport control because a member of his team applied for a sub-class of visa which does not allow medical exemptions for being unvaccinated. The Victorian state government has refused to support his application. According toAustralian media reports,external, Djokovic was being questioned by border force officials at the airport until at least 01:15 at night. We don't yet know if he's been let through.

Angela Rayner - who stood in for Sir Keir Starmer during PMQs, as he has tested for positive for Covid - says ""of course it's right"" for the government to keep Plan B measures in England. This video can not be played Covid: Labour's Angela Rayner responds to PM's Plan B statement Time for some reaction now to the announcement that pre-departure Covid tests to enter England from overseas will be scrapped from 04:00 on Friday - with travellers set to be able to take a lateral flow test on day two after arriving instead. Self-isolation until they receive a negative result in England is also ending. A spokesperson for London's Heathrow airport said the move provided a ""much needed boost to passengers desperate to see loved ones and to businesses that need to reconnect with global markets"". Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, welcomed the decision, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"" for passengers. But he urged ministers to ""take the final step towards restriction-free travel"" by removing the last Covid test requirement for vaccinated passengers so travelling does not become ""a preserve of the rich"". Travellers currently must pay for private tests rather than using free NHS tests. We've got more detail on the changes to coronavirus travel testing in England from the transport secretary. Grant Shapps hastweeted,externalthat fully vaccinated passengers and under 18s will no longer need to take a pre-departure test before returning to England if arriving after 04:00 GMT onFriday. He says the same groups arriving in England will now only need to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test if they arrive after 04:00 GMT onSunday. The need to self-isolate before getting a negative result is also ending. He says now Omicron is the dominant variant and is widespread in the UK, these measures are no longer proportionate. By removing them the government is supporting the safe reopening of international travel, he says. This video can not be played Covid self-isolation period will be cut to seven days in Scotland And if you missed it earlier, here's Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon updating the Scottish Parliament on rule changes - including a change to self-isolation requirements for both Covid cases and their contacts. Read more about the changes in Scotlandhere.  This video can not be played Covid: PM confirms Plan B will stay as England experiences 'fastest growth' in cases Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In recent days, confidence has been increasing in government
that the current restrictions in England are enough. They will now continue for the next three weeks. That means
working from home, face coverings indoors and, although the PM didnât mention
it, Covid certification for large events. The PM said that ministers would remove measures when they
are not necessary - and we have a couple of changes today. Firstly, if you travel abroad you wonât need to do a test
before travelling back to the UK. And then when you do return, you wonât need to isolate and pay for an
expensive PCR test. Instead, by the end of your second day back, youâll have to
do a lateral flow (although if thatâs positive, a PCR will then be needed). Ultimately, Boris Johnson is confident that the current
strategy is working, even though there are fewer restrictions in England than
the rest of the UK. Back now to the debate in PMQs - Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner is responding to the prime minister's Covid statement. Citing the PM's previous comment that the nation must ""ride out"" the Omicron wave, she says the NHS is ""not surfing"" and is instead ""struggling to stay afloat"". She refers toa number of hospital trusts declaring critical incidents in recent days due to staff shortages and high Covid casesacross the country. Critical incidents are declared when health bosses are concerned they may not be able to provide priority services. She calls on Boris Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The UK has recorded 194,747 new daily coronavirus cases and a further 334 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,the government's dashboard shows.,external A message on the dashboard says today's death figures include a backlog of hospital deaths reported overnight by NHS England covering the period 1 - 4 January. The PM confirms that pre-departure travel Covid tests to enter England from overseas will be scrapped from 04:00 on Friday. He also says he is lifting the requirement to self-isolate on arrival in England until receiving a negative PCR test result. Instead people can take a lateral flow test on day two - and if it's positive a further PCR test will be needed to identify any new variants, plus isolation as normal. The prime minister says the UK has the biggest testing programme in Europe - registering twice as many tests as France, and four times as many as Germany. Last month, 300m lateral flow tests were handed out, he says, which enabled people to spend Christmas with loved ones safely. But due to the ""sheer size"" of the Omicron wave, the government must take steps to ensure testing capacity ""reaches those who need it most"". He reiterates the announcement earlier that people in England will no longer have to confirm the result of a positive lateral flow test with a PCR test if they don't have symptoms. He says from Tuesday, people should just record the result of the lateral flow test on the government website and begin isolating. Boris Johnson says cabinet earlier agreed that England should stick with Plan B for a further three weeks - with a review before the regulations expire on 26 January. He says people in England should continue working from home wherever they can, wear face coverings on public transport, and also in most public indoor places. He says people should take a Covid test before going to high-risk settings or meeting the elderly or vulnerable. He says these measures are taking the edge off the Omicron wave - and to those asking if the government should go further, he says lockdowns are not cost-free.  Updates to follow... As Prime Minister's Questions wraps up, Boris Johnson will make a separate statement to MPs on the Covid response in England. The prime minister held a cabinet meeting this morning - and he has just confirmed in the Commons that England will stick with the so-called ""Plan B"" rules. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Some hopeful news buried in
the staggering growth of Omicron infections. There's a hint that growth in
London, the leading edge of the Omicron wave, may have been slightly slower
over the Christmas break. Having doubled in the week
before Christmas, infections grew by less - roughly from 7.5% to 9% - in
the week up to 31 December. We have to hope this slowdown
continues once everyone returns to work in the coming week. The growth this week
was driven by infections in the north of the country: the North West has almost
caught up with London and infections more than doubled in the North East and in
Yorkshire and the Humber. The unfortunate news is that
infections are doubling each week in the over 70s, growing faster than any
other age group. They still have a
much lower rate of infection than anyone else, but this is the group where the
boosters will be doing the most work to prevent infection turning into serious
illness.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999999
"Covid testing rules are to be eased for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. While Covid levels are high, people can be confident that rapid tests are highly accurate, the UK Health Security Agency said. The change will come into force in England next week and across the rest of the UK within days. It will be reviewed when coronavirus levels in the population drop below 1%. Around 4% of people are currently infected with coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics. Under the new guidance, anyone in England who receives a positive lateral flow device (LFD) test result should report their result ongov.uk,externaland must self-isolate immediately, but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. After reporting a positive LFD test result, they will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace so that their contacts can be traced. Anyone who tests positive will be able to leave self-isolation seven days after the date of their initial positive test if they receive two negative lateral flow test results, 24 hours apart, on days six and seven. from todayin Northern Ireland,external from Thursday inScotlandandWales from Tuesday 11 January in England At present anyone with a positive lateral flow test who has no symptoms needs a PCR test - carried out in a lab - to confirm their result. This can take days to arrive and health officials are worried people may not be isolating during this time. The change will also improve access to PCR tests for people with symptoms and for healthcare, transport and other key workers following problems over test supplies. There are some exemptions to the new rule. People who receive Test and Trace financial support, those taking part in Covid research studies and around one million people in England eligible for new NHS treatments for Covid will all be asked to take a follow-up PCR. What are the Covid self-isolation rules? How do I know I have Omicron? When can I have a booster? Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of UKHSA, said: ""While cases of Covid continue to rise, this tried-and-tested approach means that LFDs can be used confidently to indicate Covid-19 infection without the need for PCR confirmation. She added: ""I'm really grateful to the public and all of our critical workers who continue to test regularly and self-isolate when necessary, along with other practical and important public health behaviours, as this is the most effective way of stopping the spread of the virus and keeping our friends, families and communities safe."" Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said this was ""a sensible approach"" as long as positive results were reported and the lateral flow kits ""are in good supply"". He added: ""Lateral flow tests can detect around 95% of people who are at their most infectious."" Anyone who develops one of the three main Covid-19 symptoms - a new cough, a high temperature or a loss of taste or smell - should stay at home, self isolate and take a PCR test. But some scientists questioned why people with symptoms couldn't also rely on a lateral flow test result alone. Lateral flow tests are very good at detecting people who are infectious at the moment because the prevalence of the virus is high and there are lots of cases to be spotted. Analysis shows that if you tested 1,000 people right now, you'd get 41 testing positive and almost all of them would be correct - but last summer, when there were fewer cases around - you'd get three positives but only two would be true. That's when a PCR would be important to confirm the result. The latest Covid figures showed 218,724 new cases were recorded in the UK on Tuesday. That number included previously unreported cases from Wales and Northern Ireland from over the new year period. A number of hospitals havedeclared critical incidentsamid staff shortages due to Covid. This video can not be played Dr Mike Tildesley: ""Hopefully we won't be losing the levels of information that enables us to identify variants"" Separately, pre-departure Covid tests for those entering Englandwill be scrapped from Fridayafter the travel industry called for restriction on travellers to be removed because the virus is circulating so widely. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the cabinet has agreed that England should stick with Plan B for a further three weeks - with a review before the regulations expire on 26 January. He says people in England should continue working from home wherever they can, wear face coverings on public transport, and also in most public indoor places. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the NHS was ""struggling to stay afloat"" and referred to a number of hospital trusts declaring critical incidents due to staff shortages and high Covid cases across the country. She called on Mr Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The decision to drop follow-up tests for people who test positive in England on rapid tests will not make much difference to our ability to track the epidemic or variants. It's true that if people decide not to report their positive lateral flow test, we will miss some cases. But the testing system already misses cases if people decide not to get tested or to quietly pocket their rapid test result. That's why we rely on other data: hospital admissions or surveys that swab people at random. They'll keep on working as they always have. And we will still have plenty of PCR samples to sequence and spot variants: tens of thousands of positive cases every day. Last Wednesday, for example, in England, about 50,000 people reported testing positive on a lateral flow test. And nearly 150,000 more people tested positive on a PCR without a previous lateral flow. The guidance is still that you must get a PCR test if you have symptoms and, as long as that's the case, there will be plenty of data. Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), said lateral flow tests were very accurate - but it was crucial people recorded their positive results. He also said as some PCRs are sent away for sequencing, he hoped there would be no loss of information that helps the UK identify new variants.

"This video can not be played Australian PM Scott Morrison: ""There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic"" World number one tennis player Novak Djokovic's entry to Australia has been delayed over an issue with his visa. The player arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, where authorities noticed that his team had made a mistake on his application. Djokovic is due to play in the Australian Open, after being exempted from vaccination rules. But his team had not requested a visa that permits medical exemptions for being unvaccinated. All players and staff at the tournament must be vaccinated or have an exemption granted by an expert independent panel. The tennis star has been quizzed for hours about his visa status and exemption evidence in a room in Melbourne's Tullamarine Airport and is still awaiting a decision. He has not spoken about his vaccination status, but last year he said he was ""opposed to vaccination"". The country's border force had sought clarification from the Victorian state government about his visa application,the Melbourne-based Age newspaper reports,external. But state government Minister Jaala Pulford tweeted that his application would not be supported.Visa approvals were a matter for the federal government, she added.,external Meanwhile, Djokovic's father, Srdjan Djokovic saidhis son was being held in a room guarded by police,external. ""I have no idea what's going on, they're holding my son captive for five hours. ""This is not just a fight for Novak, but a fight for the whole world. If they don't let him go in half an hour, we will gather on the street""he said in a statement released to the media,external. Djokovic's coach and fellow Grand Slam champion Goran Ivanisevic posted a photo of himself on Instagram from a room in Melbourne, along with the caption: ""Not the most usual trip Down Under.""

Earlier, Australia's prime minister said Djokovic would be refused entry to the country unless he provided evidence that he could not be vaccinated for medical reasons. Scott Morrison said the tennis player ""could be on the next plane home"" if the proof was insufficient. The tournament's organisers say the defending champion has not been given special treatment, but the decision has infuriated many Australians. The country is seeing tens of thousands of Covid-19 cases for the first time after enduring some of the world's strictest restrictions. Mr Morrison said the Serbian player would be required to present evidence upon arrival that he has a genuine medical exemption from vaccination. The Australian Open begins on 17 January in Melbourne. ""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else,"" the prime minister told reporters. ""There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever."" The comments seemed to represent a change in his position, after he said on Tuesday that Victoria's state government had provided the player with an exemption to enter the country and that officials would act ""in accordance with that decision"". This video can not be played Australians give their views on Novak Djokovic's exemption More than 90% of Australia's over-16 population is fully vaccinated, but some people still cannot travel interstate or globally because of current measures. Many Australians had previously accused the government ofallowing the rich and famous to do as they pleasewhile ordinary people remained separated from sick and dying loved ones. ""I think it's a disgrace,"" Melbourne resident Christine Wharton told ABC. ""We've all done the right thing, we've all gone out and got our jabs and our boosters and we have someone that has come from overseas and all of a sudden he's been exempt and can play."" Novak Djokovic has been granted permission to defend his Australian Open title The decision raised eyebrows with some other tennis players too. ""I just think it's very interesting. That's all I'm going to say,"" Australian Alex de Minaur said. Britain's Jamie Murray added: ""I think if it was me that wasn't vaccinated I wouldn't be getting an exemption. You know, but well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete."" The tournament's chief executive, Craig Tiley, said 26 athletes had applied for medical exemptions. ""A handful"" had been granted, he said, under guidelines set by federal regulators. ""We made it extra difficult for anyone applying for an application to ensure it was the right process and to make sure the medical experts deal with it independently,"" he told Channel 9. Novak Djokovic's announcement has made him an enemy to some and a hero to others. Whilst the tennis champion has never openly confirmed whether he has been vaccinated, what we do know is that he has previously tested positive for the virus and discussed his opposition to vaccines. During a Facebook live in April 2020 he explained how he ""wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine"" should that be necessary to travel or compete in tournaments. These comments were widely shared and praised in Facebook groups and Telegram channels promoting outlandish conspiracies that the vaccines are part of a sinister plot to control and harm the world's population. CONTEXT:The lives upended by Australia's sealed border FEATURE:Crisis causes fury in Aboriginal communities And previous comments like this have added fuel to the fire when it comes to the latest row over why he has been granted an exemption to travel. In Telegram channels promoting Covid-19 conspiracies, the exemption has given rise to incorrect theories that the vaccine is experimental. It has also led to outspoken vaccine sceptics, such as US tennis player Tennys Sandgren, to come out in support of Djokovic. Applications for medical exemptions are being assessed anonymously by two separate panels, with inflammatory cardiac illness or another acute condition listed as valid reasons. But it is also possible Djokovic has recently tested positive for the virus, which would allow him to defer taking the vaccine. A spokeswoman for the event told the BBC they could not comment on the reasons behind the player's exemption.

"One-year-old Maggie was left at a rescue centre as a ""fake stray"" A dog shelter is braced for a Â£30,000 monthly veterinary bill because of an ""explosion"" in unscrupulous breeders. Pontyclun-based Hope Rescue is expecting a traditional spike in unwanted animals post-Christmas. Such ""fake strays"" can have complex medical problems because of irresponsible sellers uninterested in animal welfare. The problem has been made worse by millions of people buying pandemic pets they no longer want. Hope Rescue staff said an ""explosion in backyard breeders"" helped create ""a perfect storm"". Most ""fake strays"" arriving at the Welsh charity's door now had medical problems, staff said. Dog mutilation: Breeders cropping ears to follow social media trend Dog rescue: More than 200 taken from unlicensed breeder Stolen dogs: Owner turns pet detective after spotting pup Dogs are known as fake strays when their owners pretend their pets are stray, in order for rescue centres to take them. In one morning the centre took in an American bulldog abandoned on Bwlch mountain, near Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and two puppies dumped in a bin in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan. The former had spinal problems, the latter skin trouble. Hope Rescue's Sara Rosser said January was always their busiest time The charity's Sara Rosser said January was always their busiest month. ""More people get into financial difficulty and then struggle to pay their vets bills,"" she said. She added: ""This year that's just going to be compounded even further by the issues we are already facing with dogs post-pandemic."" More than three million UK homes have bought pets since the pandemic began, according to the Pet Food Manufacturers Association. Ms Rosser said: ""Our vet bills at the moment are averaging around Â£20,000 a month, the majority of fake strays coming into us are coming in with medical problems, and that bill does add up."" The Pontyclun centre has been running at capacity since last summer, with more than 130 dogs in their kennels. Usually it has about 80. Meg Williams said demand for dogs went up in the pandemic Ms Rosser said: ""I can see us reaching Â£30,000 a month next year, the number of dogs requiring referrals, specialist treatment, these aren't just simple medical problems."" The canine charity's Meg Williams said: ""There was such a demand for dogs during Covid, that created a lot more people breeding who had not bred before, and don't necessarily understand the welfare issues.""

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish coronavirus self-isolation period cut from 10 days to seven. People who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests. The move brings Scotland into line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Household contacts of people with the virus will be allowed to take tests rather than going into quarantine, so long as they have had a booster shot. The changes took effect from midnight. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that no other changes will be made to Scotland's pandemic restrictions for at least another week. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid plans A further 16,103 cases were reported on Tuesday, and the first minister said there had been ""rapid and very widespread transmission"" of the Omicron variant of the virus over the festive period. Official surveys suggested that in the week to 23 December, one in every 40 people in Scotland had Covid - and within a week, this had risen to one in every 20. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the virus was ""more widespread now than at any point in the pandemic so far"", something which has had ""extremely serious implications"" for the NHS and other key services. The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased by 80% over the past week, from 679 to 1,223 - although the number of people in intensive care has been broadly stable, with 42 recorded yesterday. Self-isolation rules are being changed in a bid to ease staff shortages in key sectors, with Ms Sturgeon saying ministers had considered the issue very carefully. People who test positive for the virus will be allowed to exit quarantine after seven days as long as they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests, one on day six of isolation and another 24 hours later. Meanwhile close contacts of positive cases will no longer need to self-isolate as long as they are fully vaccinated - which means two doses and a booster - and take a lateral flow test daily for a week. And people who have no symptoms but record a positive lateral flow test result will no longer have to go for a PCR test,mirroring changes made in England. Wednesday is the first day we've been able to get a clear picture of just how fast Covid infections have spread over the Christmas and new year period. Public Health Scotland publishesdaily case counts by the date of the PCR test,externaland from these figures we can see that 21,397 people tested positive on 29 December - the highest daily total of the pandemic so far. On New Year's Eve, the average number of cases being confirmed a day almost hit 15,000. Two weeks previously this average stood at just over 5,000, which is one of the sharpest rises in case numbers we've seen in Scotland. The dominance of the Omicron variant is now almost total, likely accounting for more than 91% of cases in Scotland, less than six weeks after it was first detected here. The number of people in hospital with Covid has also been going up over the last three weeks, rising from 494 on 18 December to 1,223 on Wednesday. However, the number of patients always lags behind changes in infection levels, so the full impact of the current high case levels will only be felt in the next week or so. Ms Sturgeon said the changes ""strike an appropriate balance"" between breaking chains of transmission and reducing the disruption of self-isolation to the economy and critical services. Opposition parties had been calling for changes to the isolation rules for weeks. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the government's initial reluctance to follow the rest of the UK was ""not sustainable"" from the outset and had seen Scotland ""left as an outlier"". He also called on the government to show what had changed in the clinical advice it had received. Ms Sturgeon said she would publish as much data as possible, but said the decision had involved the ""application of judgement"" by ministers. She said: ""Last week I did not think it was the case that the benefits of changing self-isolation would outweigh the risks. ""The higher transmission now and the bigger burden of self-isolation on the economy has changed that judgement."" Ms Sturgeon defended her decision not to change the isolation rules sooner Business groups welcomed the changes, along with further detail of financial support for the worst-affected sectors. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move ""should have a positive impact on businesses ability to operate and allow employees to return to work safely, while also safeguarding public health"". The Scottish Retail Consortium said staffing levels were ""manageable for the time being"", adding that Wednesday's changes ""should help ease the level of staff absences in retail and its wider supply chain"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also backed the changes, saying ""they will be a relief to public services and businesses who were feeling the impact of restrictions"". Scotland's other Covid restrictions are to remain in place for at least another week, with ministers to review the situation again on 11 January. Ms Sturgeon said she expected that restrictions on large gatherings and the requirement for physical distancing and table service in hospitality venues will remain in force until 17 January at the earliest. People in Scotland have been urged to reduce their social contacts as much as possible, with guidance not to meet up in groups of more than three households. Ms Sturgeon also said Scotland would need to find ways of adapting its response to the ongoing challenge of the virus, warning that Omicron is ""unlikely to be the last new variant we encounter"". She said the government would not be ""giving up on trying to control Covid entirely"", but would be ""seeking ways of doing so that are more proportionate, more sustainable and less restrictive"".

"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in Almaty, the country's biggest city. Internet access has been cut in Kazakhstan amid mass protests sparked by rising fuel prices. Anti-government protesters in the main city, Almaty, stormed the mayor's office on Wednesday. Part of the building appeared to be on fire. Protests have also erupted in several other cities, with security forces using tear gas and stun grenades. The president has promised a tough response, calling the protests a ""black period"" in the country's history. ""As president, I am obliged to protect the safety and peace of our citizens, to worry about the integrity of Kazakhstan,"" Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a TV address. He called the protesters ""plotters"" who were ""financially motivated"". Internet services in the country have been disrupted since Tuesday. By Wednesday, internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported that Kazakhstan was ""in the midst of a nation-scale internet blackout"". It came as thousands of people took to the streets, despite a state of emergency in the capital Nur-Sultan, in Almaty, and in the western province of Mangistau. In Almaty, protesters gathered at the mayor's office before eventually storming it. Videos on social media showed a plume of smoke rising from the building, while gunfire could also be heard. The city's police chief, Kanat Taimerdenov, said ""extremists and radicals"" had attacked 500 civilians and ransacked hundreds of businesses. Water cannon was used against protesters in the western city of Aktobe. There are reports that security forces have sided with protesters in some places. Police fired stun grenades at protesters on Wednesday BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Rare protests in a country that bans dissent The demonstrations started in the west of Kazakhstan on Sunday, before spreading across the country. They began when the government lifted the price cap on liquefied petroleum gas, which many people use to power their cars. Its price quickly doubled in a matter of days. On Tuesday, the president dismissed the government and said lower fuel prices would be restored, but the announcement has not brought an end to the protests. Dissent and protests are uncommon in Kazakhstan, which declared independence in 1991 amid the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the town of Zhanaozen, in Mangistau province, was the scene of deadly unrest in 2011. At least 14 oil workers were killed in a police crackdown on a protest over pay and working conditions. The town has also been one of the main centres of the latest unrest. By Olga Ivshina, BBC Russian The speed at which the protests turned violent took many by surprise, both in Kazakhstan and in the wider region, and hinted that they are not only about an increase in fuel prices. This is a traditionally stable Central Asian state, which is often described as authoritarian. Until 2019 it was run by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose rule was marked by elements of a personality cult, with his statues erected across the country and a capital renamed after him. Yet when he left, it was amid anti-government protests which he sought to limit by stepping down and putting a close ally in his place. Most elections in Kazakhstan are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote and there is no effective political opposition. The analysts I spoke to say that the Kazakh government clearly underestimated how angry the population was, and that these protests were not surprising in a country with no electoral democracy - people need to take to the streets to be heard. And their grievances are almost certainly about a far wider set of issues than the price of fuel.

In case you missed them, here's a quick round-up of the key points: As we've been reporting, major changes to the travel rules for England have been announced. From Friday, travellers will no longer need a pre-arrival test. And from Sunday, arrivals will not need to isolate until they get a negative PCR test. Instead, they must take a lateral flow test within two days, without the automatic need to isolate. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says there will be a ""a full review of travel measures by the end of January to ensure a stable system is in place for 2022"".  Allow Twitter content?

And now more from the US: more children than ever before are being admitted to hospital with Covid-19
amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC statistics show that an average of 672 children were admitted
to hospital each day during the week that ended on Sunday, 2 January. This is more than
twice the daily figure between 20 and 26 December, when an average of 313 people
under 17 were admitted each day. Since August, more than 80,000 children have been
hospitalised with Covid-19. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that
the number of Covid-19 cases among young people had reached unprecedented
levels. More than 325,000 new cases were recorded among children during
the week ending 30 December â a 64% increase over the 199,000 new cases
recorded the week prior. An average of 672 children is being hospitalised with Covid-19 each day in the US. US airlines cancelled more than 1,400 flights on Wednesday, with
thousands more delayed amid pandemic-related staffing shortages, statistics show. According to airline data provider FlightAware, a total of
1,429 flights inside, into or out of the US were cancelled as of 15:00 GMT on
Wednesday, while 1,183 flights experienced delays. On Tuesday, a total of 1,562 flights were cancelled, with
over 6,600 delayed flights recorded. Since Christmas Eve on 24 December, over 20,000 flights have
been cancelled, leaving passengers scrambling for alternatives during one of
the busiest travel periods of the year. Faced with pandemic-related staffing shortages, a number of
US airlines have agreed to pay crew extra to pick up additional trips during
the holiday period. On 31 December,
United Airlines announced it would offer pilots triple pay throughout January
amid the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Tennis player Novak Djokovic's entry to Australia has been delayed after a dispute over a visa application. As we've been reporting, the world number one landed in Melbourne this afternoon amid a backlash at the decision to grant him a medical exemption from the requirement of having had a Covid vaccine. That decision allows him to play at the Australian Open later this month. But Djokovic is apparently unable to get through passport control because a member of his team applied for a sub-class of visa which does not allow medical exemptions for being unvaccinated. The Victorian state government has refused to support his application. According toAustralian media reports,external, Djokovic was being questioned by border force officials at the airport until at least 01:15 at night. We don't yet know if he's been let through.

Angela Rayner - who stood in for Sir Keir Starmer during PMQs, as he has tested for positive for Covid - says ""of course it's right"" for the government to keep Plan B measures in England. This video can not be played Covid: Labour's Angela Rayner responds to PM's Plan B statement Time for some reaction now to the announcement that pre-departure Covid tests to enter England from overseas will be scrapped from 04:00 on Friday - with travellers set to be able to take a lateral flow test on day two after arriving instead. Self-isolation until they receive a negative result in England is also ending. A spokesperson for London's Heathrow airport said the move provided a ""much needed boost to passengers desperate to see loved ones and to businesses that need to reconnect with global markets"". Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, welcomed the decision, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"" for passengers. But he urged ministers to ""take the final step towards restriction-free travel"" by removing the last Covid test requirement for vaccinated passengers so travelling does not become ""a preserve of the rich"". Travellers currently must pay for private tests rather than using free NHS tests. We've got more detail on the changes to coronavirus travel testing in England from the transport secretary. Grant Shapps hastweeted,externalthat fully vaccinated passengers and under 18s will no longer need to take a pre-departure test before returning to England if arriving after 04:00 GMT onFriday. He says the same groups arriving in England will now only need to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test if they arrive after 04:00 GMT onSunday. The need to self-isolate before getting a negative result is also ending. He says now Omicron is the dominant variant and is widespread in the UK, these measures are no longer proportionate. By removing them the government is supporting the safe reopening of international travel, he says. This video can not be played Covid self-isolation period will be cut to seven days in Scotland And if you missed it earlier, here's Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon updating the Scottish Parliament on rule changes - including a change to self-isolation requirements for both Covid cases and their contacts. Read more about the changes in Scotlandhere.  This video can not be played Covid: PM confirms Plan B will stay as England experiences 'fastest growth' in cases Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In recent days, confidence has been increasing in government
that the current restrictions in England are enough. They will now continue for the next three weeks. That means
working from home, face coverings indoors and, although the PM didnât mention
it, Covid certification for large events. The PM said that ministers would remove measures when they
are not necessary - and we have a couple of changes today. Firstly, if you travel abroad you wonât need to do a test
before travelling back to the UK. And then when you do return, you wonât need to isolate and pay for an
expensive PCR test. Instead, by the end of your second day back, youâll have to
do a lateral flow (although if thatâs positive, a PCR will then be needed). Ultimately, Boris Johnson is confident that the current
strategy is working, even though there are fewer restrictions in England than
the rest of the UK. Back now to the debate in PMQs - Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner is responding to the prime minister's Covid statement. Citing the PM's previous comment that the nation must ""ride out"" the Omicron wave, she says the NHS is ""not surfing"" and is instead ""struggling to stay afloat"". She refers toa number of hospital trusts declaring critical incidents in recent days due to staff shortages and high Covid casesacross the country. Critical incidents are declared when health bosses are concerned they may not be able to provide priority services. She calls on Boris Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The UK has recorded 194,747 new daily coronavirus cases and a further 334 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,the government's dashboard shows.,external A message on the dashboard says today's death figures include a backlog of hospital deaths reported overnight by NHS England covering the period 1 - 4 January. The PM confirms that pre-departure travel Covid tests to enter England from overseas will be scrapped from 04:00 on Friday. He also says he is lifting the requirement to self-isolate on arrival in England until receiving a negative PCR test result. Instead people can take a lateral flow test on day two - and if it's positive a further PCR test will be needed to identify any new variants, plus isolation as normal. The prime minister says the UK has the biggest testing programme in Europe - registering twice as many tests as France, and four times as many as Germany. Last month, 300m lateral flow tests were handed out, he says, which enabled people to spend Christmas with loved ones safely. But due to the ""sheer size"" of the Omicron wave, the government must take steps to ensure testing capacity ""reaches those who need it most"". He reiterates the announcement earlier that people in England will no longer have to confirm the result of a positive lateral flow test with a PCR test if they don't have symptoms. He says from Tuesday, people should just record the result of the lateral flow test on the government website and begin isolating. Boris Johnson says cabinet earlier agreed that England should stick with Plan B for a further three weeks - with a review before the regulations expire on 26 January. He says people in England should continue working from home wherever they can, wear face coverings on public transport, and also in most public indoor places. He says people should take a Covid test before going to high-risk settings or meeting the elderly or vulnerable. He says these measures are taking the edge off the Omicron wave - and to those asking if the government should go further, he says lockdowns are not cost-free.  Updates to follow... As Prime Minister's Questions wraps up, Boris Johnson will make a separate statement to MPs on the Covid response in England. The prime minister held a cabinet meeting this morning - and he has just confirmed in the Commons that England will stick with the so-called ""Plan B"" rules. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Some hopeful news buried in
the staggering growth of Omicron infections. There's a hint that growth in
London, the leading edge of the Omicron wave, may have been slightly slower
over the Christmas break. Having doubled in the week
before Christmas, infections grew by less - roughly from 7.5% to 9% - in
the week up to 31 December. We have to hope this slowdown
continues once everyone returns to work in the coming week. The growth this week
was driven by infections in the north of the country: the North West has almost
caught up with London and infections more than doubled in the North East and in
Yorkshire and the Humber. The unfortunate news is that
infections are doubling each week in the over 70s, growing faster than any
other age group. They still have a
much lower rate of infection than anyone else, but this is the group where the
boosters will be doing the most work to prevent infection turning into serious
illness.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,6.3732986e-12
"Covid testing rules are to be eased for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. While Covid levels are high, people can be confident that rapid tests are highly accurate, the UK Health Security Agency said. The change will come into force in England next week and across the rest of the UK within days. It will be reviewed when coronavirus levels in the population drop below 1%. Around 4% of people are currently infected with coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics. Under the new guidance, anyone in England who receives a positive lateral flow device (LFD) test result should report their result ongov.uk,externaland must self-isolate immediately, but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. After reporting a positive LFD test result, they will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace so that their contacts can be traced. Anyone who tests positive will be able to leave self-isolation seven days after the date of their initial positive test if they receive two negative lateral flow test results, 24 hours apart, on days six and seven. from todayin Northern Ireland,external from Thursday inScotlandandWales from Tuesday 11 January in England At present anyone with a positive lateral flow test who has no symptoms needs a PCR test - carried out in a lab - to confirm their result. This can take days to arrive and health officials are worried people may not be isolating during this time. The change will also improve access to PCR tests for people with symptoms and for healthcare, transport and other key workers following problems over test supplies. There are some exemptions to the new rule. People who receive Test and Trace financial support, those taking part in Covid research studies and around one million people in England eligible for new NHS treatments for Covid will all be asked to take a follow-up PCR. What are the Covid self-isolation rules? How do I know I have Omicron? When can I have a booster? Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of UKHSA, said: ""While cases of Covid continue to rise, this tried-and-tested approach means that LFDs can be used confidently to indicate Covid-19 infection without the need for PCR confirmation. She added: ""I'm really grateful to the public and all of our critical workers who continue to test regularly and self-isolate when necessary, along with other practical and important public health behaviours, as this is the most effective way of stopping the spread of the virus and keeping our friends, families and communities safe."" Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said this was ""a sensible approach"" as long as positive results were reported and the lateral flow kits ""are in good supply"". He added: ""Lateral flow tests can detect around 95% of people who are at their most infectious."" Anyone who develops one of the three main Covid-19 symptoms - a new cough, a high temperature or a loss of taste or smell - should stay at home, self isolate and take a PCR test. But some scientists questioned why people with symptoms couldn't also rely on a lateral flow test result alone. Lateral flow tests are very good at detecting people who are infectious at the moment because the prevalence of the virus is high and there are lots of cases to be spotted. Analysis shows that if you tested 1,000 people right now, you'd get 41 testing positive and almost all of them would be correct - but last summer, when there were fewer cases around - you'd get three positives but only two would be true. That's when a PCR would be important to confirm the result. The latest Covid figures showed 218,724 new cases were recorded in the UK on Tuesday. That number included previously unreported cases from Wales and Northern Ireland from over the new year period. A number of hospitals havedeclared critical incidentsamid staff shortages due to Covid. This video can not be played Dr Mike Tildesley: ""Hopefully we won't be losing the levels of information that enables us to identify variants"" Separately, pre-departure Covid tests for those entering Englandwill be scrapped from Fridayafter the travel industry called for restriction on travellers to be removed because the virus is circulating so widely. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the cabinet has agreed that England should stick with Plan B for a further three weeks - with a review before the regulations expire on 26 January. He says people in England should continue working from home wherever they can, wear face coverings on public transport, and also in most public indoor places. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the NHS was ""struggling to stay afloat"" and referred to a number of hospital trusts declaring critical incidents due to staff shortages and high Covid cases across the country. She called on Mr Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The decision to drop follow-up tests for people who test positive in England on rapid tests will not make much difference to our ability to track the epidemic or variants. It's true that if people decide not to report their positive lateral flow test, we will miss some cases. But the testing system already misses cases if people decide not to get tested or to quietly pocket their rapid test result. That's why we rely on other data: hospital admissions or surveys that swab people at random. They'll keep on working as they always have. And we will still have plenty of PCR samples to sequence and spot variants: tens of thousands of positive cases every day. Last Wednesday, for example, in England, about 50,000 people reported testing positive on a lateral flow test. And nearly 150,000 more people tested positive on a PCR without a previous lateral flow. The guidance is still that you must get a PCR test if you have symptoms and, as long as that's the case, there will be plenty of data. Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), said lateral flow tests were very accurate - but it was crucial people recorded their positive results. He also said as some PCRs are sent away for sequencing, he hoped there would be no loss of information that helps the UK identify new variants.

"Those who receive a positive lateral flow test should assume that they have Covid-19, the Department of Health said People in Northern Ireland who get a positive lateral flow test no longer need a PCR test to confirm that result. The Department of Health has said those who receive a positive lateral flow test should assume that they have Covid-19 and self-isolate immediately. It comes amid business closures and health service pressures due to staff absences caused by self-isolation. Pharmacists have warned the demand for lateral flow tests in Northern Ireland is outstripping supply. Northern Ireland has reported 12% of its total number of positive Covid-19 cases since in the start of the pandemic in just the last seven days. The rate of transmission, driven by the Omicron surge, has been described asbeing at an ""extraordinary level""by Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser Prof Ian Young. On Wednesday, the Department of Health reportedthree more Covid-19-related deaths and a further 7,133 cases of coronavirus. The Department of Health's decision to change Covid testing rules followsthe same move announced for Englandearlier on Wednesday. Thecurrent isolation period lasts seven days, with a negative lateral flow test needed on day six and seven. The Department of Health said: The removal of confirmatory PCR testing was a temporary measure in response to the very high prevalence of Covid in Northern Ireland A positive lateral flow test was a ""positive indicator of current Covid-19 infection"" and should be reportedon the gov.uk website,externalso close contacts can be informed through contact tracing After receiving a positive result, people should continue to isolate until they get two negative lateral flow tests taken 24 hours apart, or they have completed 10 full days of isolation - whichever is earlier Fully-vaccinated people identified as close contacts are now advised to take daily lateral flow tests for 10 days following their exposure. But those tests have also been hard to come by for many because of the demand caused byrising Omicron cases. The Department of Health said that there was no shortage of tests available centrally, with one million lateral flow tests being delivered to Northern Ireland in the past 48 hours. That includes of number of new types of rapid lateral flow tests. But the chairman of Community Pharmacy NI said there were problems getting supplies out from the central store to pharmacies. ""The supply is dealt with through one of our wholesalers, but they're having to focus on the supply of medicine first and foremost,"" said Peter Rice. ""It means each pharmacy only gets one box of lateral flow tests per day and in some cases that box is used up within the first hour or so of getting it."" Pharmacies have been experiencing shortages of lateral flow tests Mr Rice said pharmacies were under pressure due to staff shortages and an increased workload, and urged the public only to come forward if they needed test kids - and not to hoard them. Some pharmacies have had to cut their opening hours because of the number of staff self-isolating. ""We've never had a situation like this before where we've had more than one pharmacist off at a time,"" said Liam Bradley, who owns 12 pharmacy branches across Northern Ireland. At the end of last month new Covid-19 testing measures were put in place There had been massive demand for lateral flow tests, he said, adding that and that a ""huge number"" released on Monday had already gone. Dr Frances O'Hagan, deputy chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, said the situation had improved after problems over the Christmas holidays. ""There are adequate supplies of lateral flows and they are getting out to the chemists now after the holiday period and should be available quite readily,"" she told Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. The health service is also under acute pressure because of staff not being able to work. On 4 January, the Belfast Trust - Northern Ireland's biggest health trust - had about 14% of its total workforce absent, partly as a result of Covid. This video can not be played Covid 19: Ambulance service chief speaks of pressures on services The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) said about a quarter of its staff were currently unable to work due to Covid-related absences and other reasons. Chief executive Michael Bloomfield said the pressures were the worst they had been during the pandemic. He warned increased response times, even for the most serious calls, meant people were being advised to get to hospital by other means, if possible. Dr Siobhan Quinn, who works in emergency medicine in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, said there were a significant number of doctors and nurses off sick, leaving vacancies on all rotas. ICU nurse Amanda Smyth said nurses were ""already exhausted and demoralised because they've had to deal with so much since the beginning of the pandemic"". Despite seven of Northern Ireland's hospitals being over capacity on Wednesday, the chairman of the British Medical Association in NI said Omicron did not seem to be as bad as the Delta variant in terms of admissions to hospital. ""The biggest crisis we will have over the coming months is staff shortages,"" said Dr Tom Black. Meanwhile, in the Republic of Ireland, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he did not expect major changes to coronavirus restrictions this week. He was speaking following a meeting of the Irish cabinet and ahead of a meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Thursday. The cabinet has agreed to travel rules that mean vaccinated passengers will no longer be required to have a negative Covid-19 test when arriving in Ireland. Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to show a negative PCR test taken 72 hours before arrival. by Clodagh Rice, BBC News NI business correspondent Some businesses in Northern Ireland have been forced to close because of staff absences due to positive Covid cases and staff self-isolating. At Bethany Fruit Market in east Belfast, customers lined the street the day before Christmas Eve, but then one member of staff tested positive and the shop had to shut. Owner Phillip Coulter said he was devastated. ""We work with fresh produce that could go off very quickly so we would've been in a good bit of trouble if we weren't able to open,"" he said. ""All of our staff were out as it's quite a small shop, with one positive Covid test which was a bit of a nightmare."" The impact was also felt by the restaurants and bars that the market stock, and the farmers who supply their produce. With some help from friends, family and farmers, they were able to adapt and open a click-and-collect service. Many businesses have had to adapt to click-and-collect services in order to continue to trade through the Omicron surge Mr Coulter said: ""We managed to get four people to come in here on Christmas Eve and we set up tables outside the shop and people could pre-order online."" The staffing issues come as Translink announced a reduced timetable from 10 January, as part of a contingency plan for increasing levels of staff absence and in response to reduced passenger numbers. The revised timetables would prioritise school and peak time services safely, said Translink's director of service operations, Ian Campbell. RULES:What are the restrictions in Northern Ireland?

"People who test positive for Covid in Scotland can end self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests. The move, which takes effect from midnight, brings Scotland into line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Household contacts of people with the virus will be allowed to take lateral flow tests rather than self-isolating, as long as they have had their booster. Asymptomatic people who return a positive lateral flow test will no longer have to confirm their result with a PCR. The first minister says the changes are ""not completely without risk"" but strike ""an appropriate balance"". Nicola Sturgeon says existing Covid rules, such as restrictions on large events, will stay in place and will probably remain until 17 January. A further 16,103 positive cases have been reported in Scotland, with five further deaths. There are 1,223 people in hospital with Covid, with 42 in intensive care.

Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden says the restrictions on large gatherings, which are currently in place until 17 January, are ""perilously close"" to the Six Nations rugby tournament. He asks if fans can book tickets and whether the hospitality industry can prepare for the tournament. The first minister says everything has to be monitored on a ""closer-time basis"" and adds: ""It is really difficult, particularly at this phase of the virus, to be certain about the future."" But Ms Sturgeon goes on to say that she hopes the restrictions will not be in place beyond 17 January and that the matches will go ahead in front of supporters. Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, believes the changes should have a ""positive impact"". She says: ""Greater alignment and an enhanced four-nations approach towards testing is a positive step in the right direction and many businesses who were struggling due to staff shortages will now be able to open their doors again.â Dr Cameron also calls for a ""clear end date"" for the current working from home requirements. Business representatives have welcomed the changes to Scotland's self-isolation rules David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, says companies continue
to report increased but manageable staff absence levels. He adds: ""The decision to follow Wales and England and shorten
Scotlandâs self-isolation period is welcome and should help ease the level of
staff absences in retail and its wider supply chain.â Matthew Fell, CBI chief policy director for Scotland, says the level of absences through
self-isolation is ""starting to bite"" across the economy. Reducing the number of isolation days from 10 to seven with tests on the final days to ensure safety is a pragmatic choice that can help keep the Scottish economy moving."" Matthew Fell, CBI chief policy director for Scotland The SNP's Neil Gray asks the FM to outline what support is available to private nurseries and to clarify the guidance for
testing children under the age of five. He says some nurseries ""appear to require proof of a negative PCR test for
attendance"". Ms Sturgeon says her government will continue to support all early years settings and that today's changes to self-isolation rules will help with staffing problems. She says children under five are required to get a test where they have Covid
symptoms. However, if they are only close contacts of someone who tests positive, then testing is encouraged but not required. Oliver Mundell from the Conservatives asks what resources are being made available to keep schools open. In particular, he asks about additional non-classroom committed teachers and electronic devices for every pupil. He says
what has happened in schools ""makes a mockery"" of the first minister's promise to make education a priority. The FM says there are now 2,000 more teachers than before the pandemic and that her government has ""done what weâve said
we would"" do in terms of electronic devices - ""starting with those in most deprived
circumstances"". She adds that guidance was issued before Christmas on other things schools could do to minimise disruption - such as minimising contact and time
restrictions on visitors. The FM says the Scottish negotiating committee for teachers also agreed
on contingency plans such as combining classes and temporarily relocating teachers. Deputy First Minister John Swinney has been criticised over comparisons between Scotland and England Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says Deputy First Minister John Swinney yesterday cited data from the Office for National Statistics to highlight ""how much better we are doing in Scotland"" due to the restrictions. But Ms Baillie says the data used covered the period up to 23 December - when the rules were largely the same in Scotland and England and before the new restrictions took effect. She asks if the first minister would agree that it is essential ministers do not ""spin statistics"" and weaken public confidence. Ms Sturgeon says the figures cited by Mr Swinney were the most up-to-date data available at that time. She adds that she would urge ""significant caution"" about the seven-day rolling average of cases in any part of the UK up to 3 January due to factors such as the festive period and testing availability. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton asks the first minister if she agrees that transparency of data is important - referring to how the government has yet to publish an analysis of hospitalisations. He also claims that testing in Scotland is ""significantly down"" on last year with less than 50,000 PCR tests done per day. The FM argues she is not trying to hide any data and that Public Health Scotland are working to make sure the information is reliable. She says she does not accept that testing is down, saying that the UK government labs do 50,000 tests in Scotland per day plus NHS Scotland has a capacity of 32,000 per day. The labs in Scotland are currently suffering from staff absences due to Covid, Ms Sturgen adds, which has contributed to a ""fluctuation"" in the number of tests done per day. Mr Sarwar highlights issues around PCR capacity and the supply of lateral flow tests. The first minister says with high community transmission there will be ""periodically"" pressure on the testing system. She says work is under way on a four nations basis to resolve and flex capacity as far as possible. Ms Sturgeon adds there is no issue with lateral flow tests in Scotland at the moment and PCR test turnarounds have ""become much shorter again"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar welcomes the changes to the self-isolation rules and the support for businesses who have been hit hard by the pandemic. He then asks the first minister to share the data that the Scottish government is basing its Covid decisions on. Ms Sturgeon says she has not seen the full Scottish data yet on Omicron but adds she has been assured Public Health Scotland will publish the first results of its analysis on Friday. Mr Ross repeatedly calls on the first minister to publish the clinical advice she received this week and last to demonstrate the reason behind the change on self-isolation rules. He also criticises the deputy first minister John Swinney for making what he says were ""petty political points"" with out-of-date statistics comparing Scotland's Covid rates with England's. Ms Sturgeon says she will continue to publish as much data and evidence as possible ""providing there is a confidence in the robustness of that data"". She agrees with Mr Ross that virus rates are ""not a competition"" but says statistics regularly change. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross asks the first minister why it took so long for Scotland to change its self-isolation rules when other parts of the UK had already done so. Ms Sturgeon says she makes no apology for considering the matter ""very carefully"" and says the clinical advice she received was the risk of releasing people from isolation early would ""outweigh the benefits"". While she says she thinks the change is proportionate at this stage, it is still not without risk. ""None of
these things are straightforward"", the FM says, adding that she will always be ""accountable and open to scrutiny"". Turning to education, the first minister says all secondary school pupils are being asked to take a lateral flow test on the night before or morning of the first day back. Thereafter, they are advised to test twice a week and in advance of mixing socially with people from other households. University and college students are asked to test before travelling to term-time accommodation and thereafter twice a week and before socialising with other households. Our priority is to keep schools open and to minimise further disruption to education but, with community transmission high, I know the next few weeks will be challenging for pupils, staff and parents. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Ms Sturgeon says she will allocate a further Â£55m fund to address the toll of the pandemic on businesses. She says up to Â£28m will go to taxi
and private hire drivers and operators, Â£19m will go to beauticians and hairdressers, Â£5m will go to sport and a further Â£3m will go to tourism. The FM says work is taking place to make sure funds get into bank accounts as quickly as possible. Ms Sturgeon outlines the new advice on testing, which she says has been ""carefully considered"". People who have symptoms should still book a PCR test. However from tomorrow, if you do not have symptoms and get a positive result using a lateral flow test, you do not have to book a PCR test. Instead, Ms Sturgeon says, people should immediately isolate and report their results online so that contact tracing can begin. The risk of getting a false positive on a lateral flow test is very low - about three in 10,000, she says. These changes are significant and they are not completely without risk. However at this stage of the pandemic they do strike an appropriate balance between the continued importance of self-isolation in breaking chains of transmission and reducing the disruption self-isolation causes in the economy and other critical services. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister  The first minister confirms two changes to the self-isolation rules will take effect from midnight.   The requirement for ""fully vaccinated"" household contacts to self-isolate will be replaced by taking lateral flow tests every day for seven days. The self-isolation period for Covid cases is to be cut from 10 days to seven, if people record two negative tests and have no symptoms. This change has already been made in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first minister says the changes will take effect from midnight. The first minister says the surge in cases driven by Omicron is continuing in Scotland and there has been an 87% increase in new cases in the last week. Tomorrow's figures will almost certainly see us pass more than one million cases since the outset of the pandemic."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish coronavirus self-isolation period cut from 10 days to seven. People who test positive for Covid in Scotland will be allowed to exit self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests. The move brings Scotland into line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Household contacts of people with the virus will be allowed to take tests rather than going into quarantine, so long as they have had a booster shot. The changes took effect from midnight. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs that no other changes will be made to Scotland's pandemic restrictions for at least another week. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid plans A further 16,103 cases were reported on Tuesday, and the first minister said there had been ""rapid and very widespread transmission"" of the Omicron variant of the virus over the festive period. Official surveys suggested that in the week to 23 December, one in every 40 people in Scotland had Covid - and within a week, this had risen to one in every 20. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the virus was ""more widespread now than at any point in the pandemic so far"", something which has had ""extremely serious implications"" for the NHS and other key services. The number of people in hospital with the virus has increased by 80% over the past week, from 679 to 1,223 - although the number of people in intensive care has been broadly stable, with 42 recorded yesterday. Self-isolation rules are being changed in a bid to ease staff shortages in key sectors, with Ms Sturgeon saying ministers had considered the issue very carefully. People who test positive for the virus will be allowed to exit quarantine after seven days as long as they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests, one on day six of isolation and another 24 hours later. Meanwhile close contacts of positive cases will no longer need to self-isolate as long as they are fully vaccinated - which means two doses and a booster - and take a lateral flow test daily for a week. And people who have no symptoms but record a positive lateral flow test result will no longer have to go for a PCR test,mirroring changes made in England. Wednesday is the first day we've been able to get a clear picture of just how fast Covid infections have spread over the Christmas and new year period. Public Health Scotland publishesdaily case counts by the date of the PCR test,externaland from these figures we can see that 21,397 people tested positive on 29 December - the highest daily total of the pandemic so far. On New Year's Eve, the average number of cases being confirmed a day almost hit 15,000. Two weeks previously this average stood at just over 5,000, which is one of the sharpest rises in case numbers we've seen in Scotland. The dominance of the Omicron variant is now almost total, likely accounting for more than 91% of cases in Scotland, less than six weeks after it was first detected here. The number of people in hospital with Covid has also been going up over the last three weeks, rising from 494 on 18 December to 1,223 on Wednesday. However, the number of patients always lags behind changes in infection levels, so the full impact of the current high case levels will only be felt in the next week or so. Ms Sturgeon said the changes ""strike an appropriate balance"" between breaking chains of transmission and reducing the disruption of self-isolation to the economy and critical services. Opposition parties had been calling for changes to the isolation rules for weeks. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the government's initial reluctance to follow the rest of the UK was ""not sustainable"" from the outset and had seen Scotland ""left as an outlier"". He also called on the government to show what had changed in the clinical advice it had received. Ms Sturgeon said she would publish as much data as possible, but said the decision had involved the ""application of judgement"" by ministers. She said: ""Last week I did not think it was the case that the benefits of changing self-isolation would outweigh the risks. ""The higher transmission now and the bigger burden of self-isolation on the economy has changed that judgement."" Ms Sturgeon defended her decision not to change the isolation rules sooner Business groups welcomed the changes, along with further detail of financial support for the worst-affected sectors. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move ""should have a positive impact on businesses ability to operate and allow employees to return to work safely, while also safeguarding public health"". The Scottish Retail Consortium said staffing levels were ""manageable for the time being"", adding that Wednesday's changes ""should help ease the level of staff absences in retail and its wider supply chain"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also backed the changes, saying ""they will be a relief to public services and businesses who were feeling the impact of restrictions"". Scotland's other Covid restrictions are to remain in place for at least another week, with ministers to review the situation again on 11 January. Ms Sturgeon said she expected that restrictions on large gatherings and the requirement for physical distancing and table service in hospitality venues will remain in force until 17 January at the earliest. People in Scotland have been urged to reduce their social contacts as much as possible, with guidance not to meet up in groups of more than three households. Ms Sturgeon also said Scotland would need to find ways of adapting its response to the ongoing challenge of the virus, warning that Omicron is ""unlikely to be the last new variant we encounter"". She said the government would not be ""giving up on trying to control Covid entirely"", but would be ""seeking ways of doing so that are more proportionate, more sustainable and less restrictive"".

"This video can not be played Australians give their views on Novak Djokovic's exemption Australians have reacted angrily to news that tennis player Novak Djokovic will play in the Australian Open, after being exempted from vaccination rules. All players and staff at the tournament must be vaccinated or have an exemption granted by an expert independent panel. Djokovic has not spoken about his vaccination status, but last year said he was ""opposed to vaccination"". Prime Minister Scott Morrison said if the player's evidence was insufficient he would be on the ""next plane home"". Organisers say the defending champion has not been given special treatment, but the decision has infuriated many Australians. The country is seeing tens of thousands of Covid-19 cases for the first time after enduring some of the world's strictest restrictions. Over 90% of Australia's over-16 population is fully vaccinated, but some people still cannot travel interstate or globally because of current measures. Amid the controversy, Mr Morrison said the Serbian player would be required to present evidence upon arrival that he has a genuine medical exemption from vaccination. The Australian Open begins on 17 January in Melbourne. ""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else,"" the prime minister told reporters. ""There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever."" The comments seemed to represent a change in his position, after he said on Tuesday that the Victoria state government had provided the player with an exemption to enter the country and that officials would act ""in accordance with that decision"". Many Australians had previously accused the government ofallowing the rich and famous to do as they pleasewhile ordinary people remained separated from sick and dying loved ones. ""I think it's a disgrace,"" Melbourne resident Christine Wharton told ABC. ""We've all done the right thing, we've all gone out and got our jabs and our boosters and we have someone that has come from overseas and all of a sudden he's been exempt and can play."" A&E doctor Stephen Parnis tweeted: ""I don't care how good a tennis player he is. If he's refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn't be allowed in."" Novak Djokovic has been granted permission to defend his Australian Open title The decision raised eyebrows with some other tennis players too. ""I just think it's very interesting. That's all I'm going to say,"" Australian Alex de Minaur said. Britain's Jamie Murray added: ""I think if it was me that wasn't vaccinated I wouldn't be getting an exemption. You know, but well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete."" Australian former player Rod Laver said the reason for the exemption should be made public, saying the situation ""might get ugly"". ""Yes, you're a great player and you've performed and won so many tournaments, so it can't be physical,"" he said. ""So what is the problem?"" The tournament's chief executive, Craig Tiley, said 26 athletes had applied for medical exemptions. ""A handful"" had been granted, he said, under guidelines set by federal regulators. ""We made it extra difficult for anyone applying for an application to ensure it was the right process and to make sure the medical experts deal with it independently,"" he told Channel 9. Novak Djokovic's announcement has made him an enemy to some and a hero to others. Whilst the tennis champion has never openly confirmed whether he has been vaccinated, what we do know is that he has previously tested positive for the virus and discussed his opposition to vaccines. During a Facebook live in April 2020 he explained how he ""wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine"" should that be necessary to travel or compete in tournaments. These comments were widely shared and praised in Facebook groups and Telegram channels promoting outlandish conspiracies that the vaccines are part of a sinister plot to control and harm the world's population. And previous comments like this have added fuel to the fire when it comes to the latest row over why he has been granted an exemption to travel. In Telegram channels promoting Covid-19 conspiracies, the exemption has given rise to incorrect theories that the vaccine is experimental. It has also led to outspoken vaccine sceptics, such as US tennis player Tennys Sandgren, to come out in support of Djokovic. And it is not just Djokovic who has been accused of fuelling disinformation on social media. His wife has promoted false claims that 5G technology is somehow linked to Covid-19 on her own Instagram feed - posts labelled as false by the social media site. Applications for medical exemptions are being assessed anonymously by two separate panels, with inflammatory cardiac illness or another acute condition listed as valid reasons. But it is also possible Djokovic has recently tested positive for the virus, which would allow him to defer taking the vaccine. A spokeswoman for the event told the BBC they could not comment on the reasons behind the player's exemption.

"People who test positive for Covid in Scotland can end self-isolation after seven days if they have no fever and record two negative lateral flow tests. The move, which takes effect from midnight, brings Scotland into line with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Household contacts of people with the virus will be allowed to take lateral flow tests rather than self-isolating, as long as they have had their booster. Asymptomatic people who return a positive lateral flow test will no longer have to confirm their result with a PCR. The first minister says the changes are ""not completely without risk"" but strike ""an appropriate balance"". Nicola Sturgeon says existing Covid rules, such as restrictions on large events, will stay in place and will probably remain until 17 January. A further 16,103 positive cases have been reported in Scotland, with five further deaths. There are 1,223 people in hospital with Covid, with 42 in intensive care.

Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden says the restrictions on large gatherings, which are currently in place until 17 January, are ""perilously close"" to the Six Nations rugby tournament. He asks if fans can book tickets and whether the hospitality industry can prepare for the tournament. The first minister says everything has to be monitored on a ""closer-time basis"" and adds: ""It is really difficult, particularly at this phase of the virus, to be certain about the future."" But Ms Sturgeon goes on to say that she hopes the restrictions will not be in place beyond 17 January and that the matches will go ahead in front of supporters. Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, believes the changes should have a ""positive impact"". She says: ""Greater alignment and an enhanced four-nations approach towards testing is a positive step in the right direction and many businesses who were struggling due to staff shortages will now be able to open their doors again.â Dr Cameron also calls for a ""clear end date"" for the current working from home requirements. Business representatives have welcomed the changes to Scotland's self-isolation rules David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, says companies continue
to report increased but manageable staff absence levels. He adds: ""The decision to follow Wales and England and shorten
Scotlandâs self-isolation period is welcome and should help ease the level of
staff absences in retail and its wider supply chain.â Matthew Fell, CBI chief policy director for Scotland, says the level of absences through
self-isolation is ""starting to bite"" across the economy. Reducing the number of isolation days from 10 to seven with tests on the final days to ensure safety is a pragmatic choice that can help keep the Scottish economy moving."" Matthew Fell, CBI chief policy director for Scotland The SNP's Neil Gray asks the FM to outline what support is available to private nurseries and to clarify the guidance for
testing children under the age of five. He says some nurseries ""appear to require proof of a negative PCR test for
attendance"". Ms Sturgeon says her government will continue to support all early years settings and that today's changes to self-isolation rules will help with staffing problems. She says children under five are required to get a test where they have Covid
symptoms. However, if they are only close contacts of someone who tests positive, then testing is encouraged but not required. Oliver Mundell from the Conservatives asks what resources are being made available to keep schools open. In particular, he asks about additional non-classroom committed teachers and electronic devices for every pupil. He says
what has happened in schools ""makes a mockery"" of the first minister's promise to make education a priority. The FM says there are now 2,000 more teachers than before the pandemic and that her government has ""done what weâve said
we would"" do in terms of electronic devices - ""starting with those in most deprived
circumstances"". She adds that guidance was issued before Christmas on other things schools could do to minimise disruption - such as minimising contact and time
restrictions on visitors. The FM says the Scottish negotiating committee for teachers also agreed
on contingency plans such as combining classes and temporarily relocating teachers. Deputy First Minister John Swinney has been criticised over comparisons between Scotland and England Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says Deputy First Minister John Swinney yesterday cited data from the Office for National Statistics to highlight ""how much better we are doing in Scotland"" due to the restrictions. But Ms Baillie says the data used covered the period up to 23 December - when the rules were largely the same in Scotland and England and before the new restrictions took effect. She asks if the first minister would agree that it is essential ministers do not ""spin statistics"" and weaken public confidence. Ms Sturgeon says the figures cited by Mr Swinney were the most up-to-date data available at that time. She adds that she would urge ""significant caution"" about the seven-day rolling average of cases in any part of the UK up to 3 January due to factors such as the festive period and testing availability. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton asks the first minister if she agrees that transparency of data is important - referring to how the government has yet to publish an analysis of hospitalisations. He also claims that testing in Scotland is ""significantly down"" on last year with less than 50,000 PCR tests done per day. The FM argues she is not trying to hide any data and that Public Health Scotland are working to make sure the information is reliable. She says she does not accept that testing is down, saying that the UK government labs do 50,000 tests in Scotland per day plus NHS Scotland has a capacity of 32,000 per day. The labs in Scotland are currently suffering from staff absences due to Covid, Ms Sturgen adds, which has contributed to a ""fluctuation"" in the number of tests done per day. Mr Sarwar highlights issues around PCR capacity and the supply of lateral flow tests. The first minister says with high community transmission there will be ""periodically"" pressure on the testing system. She says work is under way on a four nations basis to resolve and flex capacity as far as possible. Ms Sturgeon adds there is no issue with lateral flow tests in Scotland at the moment and PCR test turnarounds have ""become much shorter again"". Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar welcomes the changes to the self-isolation rules and the support for businesses who have been hit hard by the pandemic. He then asks the first minister to share the data that the Scottish government is basing its Covid decisions on. Ms Sturgeon says she has not seen the full Scottish data yet on Omicron but adds she has been assured Public Health Scotland will publish the first results of its analysis on Friday. Mr Ross repeatedly calls on the first minister to publish the clinical advice she received this week and last to demonstrate the reason behind the change on self-isolation rules. He also criticises the deputy first minister John Swinney for making what he says were ""petty political points"" with out-of-date statistics comparing Scotland's Covid rates with England's. Ms Sturgeon says she will continue to publish as much data and evidence as possible ""providing there is a confidence in the robustness of that data"". She agrees with Mr Ross that virus rates are ""not a competition"" but says statistics regularly change. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross asks the first minister why it took so long for Scotland to change its self-isolation rules when other parts of the UK had already done so. Ms Sturgeon says she makes no apology for considering the matter ""very carefully"" and says the clinical advice she received was the risk of releasing people from isolation early would ""outweigh the benefits"". While she says she thinks the change is proportionate at this stage, it is still not without risk. ""None of
these things are straightforward"", the FM says, adding that she will always be ""accountable and open to scrutiny"". Turning to education, the first minister says all secondary school pupils are being asked to take a lateral flow test on the night before or morning of the first day back. Thereafter, they are advised to test twice a week and in advance of mixing socially with people from other households. University and college students are asked to test before travelling to term-time accommodation and thereafter twice a week and before socialising with other households. Our priority is to keep schools open and to minimise further disruption to education but, with community transmission high, I know the next few weeks will be challenging for pupils, staff and parents. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Ms Sturgeon says she will allocate a further Â£55m fund to address the toll of the pandemic on businesses. She says up to Â£28m will go to taxi
and private hire drivers and operators, Â£19m will go to beauticians and hairdressers, Â£5m will go to sport and a further Â£3m will go to tourism. The FM says work is taking place to make sure funds get into bank accounts as quickly as possible. Ms Sturgeon outlines the new advice on testing, which she says has been ""carefully considered"". People who have symptoms should still book a PCR test. However from tomorrow, if you do not have symptoms and get a positive result using a lateral flow test, you do not have to book a PCR test. Instead, Ms Sturgeon says, people should immediately isolate and report their results online so that contact tracing can begin. The risk of getting a false positive on a lateral flow test is very low - about three in 10,000, she says. These changes are significant and they are not completely without risk. However at this stage of the pandemic they do strike an appropriate balance between the continued importance of self-isolation in breaking chains of transmission and reducing the disruption self-isolation causes in the economy and other critical services. Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister  The first minister confirms two changes to the self-isolation rules will take effect from midnight.   The requirement for ""fully vaccinated"" household contacts to self-isolate will be replaced by taking lateral flow tests every day for seven days. The self-isolation period for Covid cases is to be cut from 10 days to seven, if people record two negative tests and have no symptoms. This change has already been made in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first minister says the changes will take effect from midnight. The first minister says the surge in cases driven by Omicron is continuing in Scotland and there has been an 87% increase in new cases in the last week. Tomorrow's figures will almost certainly see us pass more than one million cases since the outset of the pandemic."" Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister Â© 2025 BBC.

"Concerns have been raised about NHS staff being left exhausted Some non-urgent surgery is being halted at Greater Manchester hospitals as the ""rising impact"" of Covid-19 and staffing shortages continues to affect NHS trusts. More than 20 English NHS trusts have declared critical incidents, according to Downing Street. Two trusts in Bristoldeclared the highest level of alert earlier. Health bosses in Greater Manchester said about 15% of their workforce were either ill with Covid or isolating. Health minister Gillian Keegan said the government knew ""this was going to be one of the most pressurised winters"" for the NHS and that extra investment had been given to help the service cope. She said declaring critical incidents was part of ""our NHS contingency and resilience plans"" that are ""tried and tested"" and in place every winter. Omicron stats are huge, but look beyond them Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Pre-departure travel tests to be scrapped Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership said the decision affecting 17 hospitals was ""a temporary measure"" and that cancer care, cardiac and vascular surgery and transplantation would not be affected. But it said Covid admissions were also rising sharply, with more than one in five patients in some of the region's hospitals testing positive. They said the ""challenges may get worse"" in the next fortnight. Fiona Noden, chief executive of Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, said the suspension of surgery had been ""a very difficult decision"" which was taken to ensure ""we can keep people safe, maintain infection control, deploy staff where they are needed most [and] keep looking after people who need urgent and emergency care"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said social care was also hit hard by staff absences with around half of care homes in the region are unable to accept new residents. He said there were about 650 people in hospital beds who are medically fit to be discharged but a shortage of care homes to take them.

If you can't see the lookup, click here Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said a critical incident was ""an indication of very serious pressure"" at a trust which may ""not be able to provide"" a range of priority services. Other NHS trusts that have announced critical incidents since Christmas across England include: Norfolk and Waveney's care systemhas been placed on the highest state of alertand the county's biggest hospital said its number of patients with Covid had almost doubled since Friday The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which serves patients in Lancashire and south Cumbria, saidsome non-urgent operations and procedures had been suspended Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust's chief operating officer said there was ""very high demand"" for services and ""long waits"" in emergency and urgency care departments In Wiltshire,the Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust declared a critical incidentafter experiencing ""sustained high levels of demand"" and concerns over the ""availability of beds"" United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust's medical director said on Monday there were ""significant staffing pressures"" due to Covid-related absences,though essential services were still operating A critical incident was also declared at Plymouth's Derriford hospitalwith 99 positive cases there and at its three community hospitals Meanwhile, the number of hospital staff off sick across the North East and north Cumbria has increased 135% due to Covid since 24 December Elsewhere, North East Ambulance Service has asked people with suspected strokes or heart attacksto get a lift to hospital because of staff shortages. Patients were waiting on average for an hour to be seen and medical director Dr Mathew Beattie said there had been an 80% increase in Covid-related absences over the last six days. Ms Keegan asked NHS England to review the situation and said people could ""rely on getting to hospital if you are in an emergency like a heart attack"". The NHS is always under pressure at this time of year. In previous winters critical incidents have been declared and non-urgent surgery cancelled. Compromised care is nothing new. That's not to say the health service isn't facing a unique set of pressures this year. Admissions for Covid are already twice what would normally be seen for all types of respiratory infections. Staff absences are also double what they traditionally would be. And on both measures the situation is getting worse. What will be crucial is how much worse things get. The hope is infections will peak soon - and pressure on hospitals quickly afterwards. Much though depends on whether there is more spread among older age groups, who are at most risk of serious illness. Ministers are banking on the boosters limiting this. It will be at least a week maybe two before we have the answer. Meanwhile,Covid testing rules are to be eased for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. The UK Health Security Agency said the rule change will apply from 11 January and apply to England only for now. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: ""In many parts of the health service, we are currently in a state of crisis. ""Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. ""Community and social care services, which were already massively overstretched, are at breaking point. In many areas, ambulance services are unable to meet their target response times."" On Tuesday,Boris Johnson said he hoped England could ""ride out"" the current wavewithout further restrictions but acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel ""temporarily overwhelmed"".

"Children under 12 can receive the vaccine in several European countries A mother has driven her nine-year-old daughter hundreds of miles to Italy so she can be vaccinated against Covid-19. Unlike some European countries, the vaccine is currently only available to under-12s in the UK if they are classed as clinically vulnerable. But Alice Colombo headed to Milan from Maidstone, Kent, so her daughter, who has Italian citizenship, could be jabbed regardless. She said she did it to protect ""the most precious thing in the world"". The UK government said further advice regarding vaccination for five to 11-year-olds would be issued in due course following consideration of additional data, but that the majority of children in that age group were at very low risk of becoming seriously ill due to the coronavirus. How can I book my Covid jab? Why are 12-15s now being double-jabbed? Ms Colombo said: ""I'd rather risk a vaccine we know a fair amount about than take pot luck with a virus about which we know very little."" She added she was particularly concerned about the effects of long Covid. She said: ""Why would I not give protection to the most precious thing in the world to me, my daughter, rather than run the risk of her turning round to me in five, 10, 15 years' time, saying 'Mum, I've got heart problems, I've got brain problems, I've got lung problems, why didn't you do all you could at the time to protect me'?"" Ms Colombo said the pair made the journey to Italy in a 13-hour road trip to minimise the risk of mixing with others in planes and airports. Adding she would like to see the UK roll out vaccinations for under-12s, she explained: ""I feel incredibly, incredibly sorry for all those other parents who share my opinion and would like to get their children vaccinated.""

"Covid cases in Scotland have reached record levels in Scotland over the past week The first minister is due to address Holyrood later as Covid case numbers in Scotland continue to rise sharply. A further 17,259 cases were reported on Tuesdayfollowing a record high of 20,217 positive tests on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon said last week she hoped to be able to give an update on changes to the self-isolation period. The Scottish government has been urged to cut it from 10 days to seven with negative tests,as has been done in other parts of the UK. More than 16,000 new Covid cases are currently being reported a day on average - up from an average of about 6,000 over Christmas - as the highly infectious Omicron variant sweeps across the country. The percentage of positive cases has also hit record highs, with 35.3% of tests reported on Tuesday found to be positive. ScotRail has been forced to introduce a slimmed-down timetable for much of January after staffing levels were hit by Covid, and CalMac has had to reduce some ferry services. Sporting bodies ask for fan clarity ScotRail services reduced due to Covid shortages 'Congestion' warning over Covid testing system Ferry cancellations blamed on Covid and weather Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross is among those who have called for the self-isolation period to be cut to seven days, if two negative tests are returned in the final two days, and for household contacts to be allowed to leave isolation if they test negative. ""Scotland has the strictest self-isolation rules anywhere in the United Kingdom,"" Mr Ross said. ""We understand the need for caution, but Nicola Sturgeon's dithering and delaying is continuing to have a major impact on frontline services and the wider economy, due to the sheer numbers having to isolate."" Changes to self-isolation rules have been made by Wales and Northern Ireland in the past week. Mr Ross's comments were echoed by Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie. Ms Baillie, who is also the party's health spokeswoman, said: ""The SNP must use this update to confirm whether they will change self-isolation requirements in line with the latest evidence, to stop staff absences piling yet more pressure on businesses and services this winter."" Deputy First Minister John Swinney said on Tuesday the government was still ""actively considering"" the move, adding that ""further details"" would be shared in the Scottish Parliament's virtual session on Wednesday. He added: ""We are obviously looking at the clinical advice that is crucial in the handling of this because... we do not in any way, shape or form serve anybody's interest if we ignore the clinical dimension of this issue, and the risk of transmissibility of allowing individuals to return to the workplace if they're still carrying the virus."" Public health expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, of the University of Edinburgh, has warned it is ""almost inevitable"" that Omicron cases will rise still further when pupils return to school, given the transmissibility of the new variant. Dr Tait-Burkard told BBC Scotland cases were likely to increase, even with mitigating measures. ""It's almost without a doubt that, when schools return, our numbers will increase further,"" she said. ""The virus is very, very prominent in the population at the moment. ""The week before last, one in 40 people in Scotland had the virus, and that means as soon as schools return, with such a high transmissibility of Omicron, the numbers will rise further, that is almost inevitable.""

"Covid testing rules are to be eased for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. While Covid levels are high, people can be confident that rapid tests are highly accurate, the UK Health Security Agency said. The change will come into force in England next week and across the rest of the UK within days. It will be reviewed when coronavirus levels in the population drop below 1%. Around 4% of people are currently infected with coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics. Under the new guidance, anyone in England who receives a positive lateral flow device (LFD) test result should report their result ongov.uk,externaland must self-isolate immediately, but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. After reporting a positive LFD test result, they will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace so that their contacts can be traced. Anyone who tests positive will be able to leave self-isolation seven days after the date of their initial positive test if they receive two negative lateral flow test results, 24 hours apart, on days six and seven. from todayin Northern Ireland,external from Thursday inScotlandandWales from Tuesday 11 January in England At present anyone with a positive lateral flow test who has no symptoms needs a PCR test - carried out in a lab - to confirm their result. This can take days to arrive and health officials are worried people may not be isolating during this time. The change will also improve access to PCR tests for people with symptoms and for healthcare, transport and other key workers following problems over test supplies. There are some exemptions to the new rule. People who receive Test and Trace financial support, those taking part in Covid research studies and around one million people in England eligible for new NHS treatments for Covid will all be asked to take a follow-up PCR. What are the Covid self-isolation rules? How do I know I have Omicron? When can I have a booster? Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of UKHSA, said: ""While cases of Covid continue to rise, this tried-and-tested approach means that LFDs can be used confidently to indicate Covid-19 infection without the need for PCR confirmation. She added: ""I'm really grateful to the public and all of our critical workers who continue to test regularly and self-isolate when necessary, along with other practical and important public health behaviours, as this is the most effective way of stopping the spread of the virus and keeping our friends, families and communities safe."" Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said this was ""a sensible approach"" as long as positive results were reported and the lateral flow kits ""are in good supply"". He added: ""Lateral flow tests can detect around 95% of people who are at their most infectious."" Anyone who develops one of the three main Covid-19 symptoms - a new cough, a high temperature or a loss of taste or smell - should stay at home, self isolate and take a PCR test. But some scientists questioned why people with symptoms couldn't also rely on a lateral flow test result alone. Lateral flow tests are very good at detecting people who are infectious at the moment because the prevalence of the virus is high and there are lots of cases to be spotted. Analysis shows that if you tested 1,000 people right now, you'd get 41 testing positive and almost all of them would be correct - but last summer, when there were fewer cases around - you'd get three positives but only two would be true. That's when a PCR would be important to confirm the result. The latest Covid figures showed 218,724 new cases were recorded in the UK on Tuesday. That number included previously unreported cases from Wales and Northern Ireland from over the new year period. A number of hospitals havedeclared critical incidentsamid staff shortages due to Covid. This video can not be played Dr Mike Tildesley: ""Hopefully we won't be losing the levels of information that enables us to identify variants"" Separately, pre-departure Covid tests for those entering Englandwill be scrapped from Fridayafter the travel industry called for restriction on travellers to be removed because the virus is circulating so widely. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says the cabinet has agreed that England should stick with Plan B for a further three weeks - with a review before the regulations expire on 26 January. He says people in England should continue working from home wherever they can, wear face coverings on public transport, and also in most public indoor places. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the NHS was ""struggling to stay afloat"" and referred to a number of hospital trusts declaring critical incidents due to staff shortages and high Covid cases across the country. She called on Mr Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The decision to drop follow-up tests for people who test positive in England on rapid tests will not make much difference to our ability to track the epidemic or variants. It's true that if people decide not to report their positive lateral flow test, we will miss some cases. But the testing system already misses cases if people decide not to get tested or to quietly pocket their rapid test result. That's why we rely on other data: hospital admissions or surveys that swab people at random. They'll keep on working as they always have. And we will still have plenty of PCR samples to sequence and spot variants: tens of thousands of positive cases every day. Last Wednesday, for example, in England, about 50,000 people reported testing positive on a lateral flow test. And nearly 150,000 more people tested positive on a PCR without a previous lateral flow. The guidance is still that you must get a PCR test if you have symptoms and, as long as that's the case, there will be plenty of data. Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), said lateral flow tests were very accurate - but it was crucial people recorded their positive results. He also said as some PCRs are sent away for sequencing, he hoped there would be no loss of information that helps the UK identify new variants.

"Covid cases in Scotland have reached record levels in Scotland over the past week The first minister is due to address Holyrood later as Covid case numbers in Scotland continue to rise sharply. A further 17,259 cases were reported on Tuesdayfollowing a record high of 20,217 positive tests on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon said last week she hoped to be able to give an update on changes to the self-isolation period. The Scottish government has been urged to cut it from 10 days to seven with negative tests,as has been done in other parts of the UK. More than 16,000 new Covid cases are currently being reported a day on average - up from an average of about 6,000 over Christmas - as the highly infectious Omicron variant sweeps across the country. The percentage of positive cases has also hit record highs, with 35.3% of tests reported on Tuesday found to be positive. ScotRail has been forced to introduce a slimmed-down timetable for much of January after staffing levels were hit by Covid, and CalMac has had to reduce some ferry services. Sporting bodies ask for fan clarity ScotRail services reduced due to Covid shortages 'Congestion' warning over Covid testing system Ferry cancellations blamed on Covid and weather Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross is among those who have called for the self-isolation period to be cut to seven days, if two negative tests are returned in the final two days, and for household contacts to be allowed to leave isolation if they test negative. ""Scotland has the strictest self-isolation rules anywhere in the United Kingdom,"" Mr Ross said. ""We understand the need for caution, but Nicola Sturgeon's dithering and delaying is continuing to have a major impact on frontline services and the wider economy, due to the sheer numbers having to isolate."" Changes to self-isolation rules have been made by Wales and Northern Ireland in the past week. Mr Ross's comments were echoed by Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie. Ms Baillie, who is also the party's health spokeswoman, said: ""The SNP must use this update to confirm whether they will change self-isolation requirements in line with the latest evidence, to stop staff absences piling yet more pressure on businesses and services this winter."" Deputy First Minister John Swinney said on Tuesday the government was still ""actively considering"" the move, adding that ""further details"" would be shared in the Scottish Parliament's virtual session on Wednesday. He added: ""We are obviously looking at the clinical advice that is crucial in the handling of this because... we do not in any way, shape or form serve anybody's interest if we ignore the clinical dimension of this issue, and the risk of transmissibility of allowing individuals to return to the workplace if they're still carrying the virus."" Public health expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, of the University of Edinburgh, has warned it is ""almost inevitable"" that Omicron cases will rise still further when pupils return to school, given the transmissibility of the new variant. Dr Tait-Burkard told BBC Scotland cases were likely to increase, even with mitigating measures. ""It's almost without a doubt that, when schools return, our numbers will increase further,"" she said. ""The virus is very, very prominent in the population at the moment. ""The week before last, one in 40 people in Scotland had the virus, and that means as soon as schools return, with such a high transmissibility of Omicron, the numbers will rise further, that is almost inevitable.""

"Children under 12 can receive the vaccine in several European countries A mother has driven her nine-year-old daughter hundreds of miles to Italy so she can be vaccinated against Covid-19. Unlike some European countries, the vaccine is currently only available to under-12s in the UK if they are classed as clinically vulnerable. But Alice Colombo headed to Milan from Maidstone, Kent, so her daughter, who has Italian citizenship, could be jabbed regardless. She said she did it to protect ""the most precious thing in the world"". The UK government said further advice regarding vaccination for five to 11-year-olds would be issued in due course following consideration of additional data, but that the majority of children in that age group were at very low risk of becoming seriously ill due to the coronavirus. How can I book my Covid jab? Why are 12-15s now being double-jabbed? Ms Colombo said: ""I'd rather risk a vaccine we know a fair amount about than take pot luck with a virus about which we know very little."" She added she was particularly concerned about the effects of long Covid. She said: ""Why would I not give protection to the most precious thing in the world to me, my daughter, rather than run the risk of her turning round to me in five, 10, 15 years' time, saying 'Mum, I've got heart problems, I've got brain problems, I've got lung problems, why didn't you do all you could at the time to protect me'?"" Ms Colombo said the pair made the journey to Italy in a 13-hour road trip to minimise the risk of mixing with others in planes and airports. Adding she would like to see the UK roll out vaccinations for under-12s, she explained: ""I feel incredibly, incredibly sorry for all those other parents who share my opinion and would like to get their children vaccinated.""

You can read about thechanges to England's travel rules here,thechanges to PCR tests across the UK here, and the changesto self-isolation rules for cases and contacts in Scotland here. Thelatest UK data is here- and a snapshot is below. Thanks for reading.  It's been a busy afternoon of Covid announcements in the UK. In case you missed them, here's a quick round-up of the key points: As we've been reporting, major changes to the travel rules for England have been announced. From Friday, travellers will no longer need a pre-arrival test. And from Sunday, arrivals will not need to isolate until they get a negative PCR test. Instead, they must take a lateral flow test within two days, without the automatic need to isolate. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says there will be a ""a full review of travel measures by the end of January to ensure a stable system is in place for 2022"".  Allow Twitter content?

And now more from the US: more children than ever before are being admitted to hospital with Covid-19
amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC statistics show that an average of 672 children were admitted
to hospital each day during the week that ended on Sunday, 2 January. This is more than
twice the daily figure between 20 and 26 December, when an average of 313 people
under 17 were admitted each day. Since August, more than 80,000 children have been
hospitalised with Covid-19. On Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics warned that
the number of Covid-19 cases among young people had reached unprecedented
levels. More than 325,000 new cases were recorded among children during
the week ending 30 December â a 64% increase over the 199,000 new cases
recorded the week prior. An average of 672 children is being hospitalised with Covid-19 each day in the US. US airlines cancelled more than 1,400 flights on Wednesday, with
thousands more delayed amid pandemic-related staffing shortages, statistics show. According to airline data provider FlightAware, a total of
1,429 flights inside, into or out of the US were cancelled as of 15:00 GMT on
Wednesday, while 1,183 flights experienced delays. On Tuesday, a total of 1,562 flights were cancelled, with
over 6,600 delayed flights recorded. Since Christmas Eve on 24 December, over 20,000 flights have
been cancelled, leaving passengers scrambling for alternatives during one of
the busiest travel periods of the year. Faced with pandemic-related staffing shortages, a number of
US airlines have agreed to pay crew extra to pick up additional trips during
the holiday period. On 31 December,
United Airlines announced it would offer pilots triple pay throughout January
amid the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Tennis player Novak Djokovic's entry to Australia has been delayed after a dispute over a visa application. As we've been reporting, the world number one landed in Melbourne this afternoon amid a backlash at the decision to grant him a medical exemption from the requirement of having had a Covid vaccine. That decision allows him to play at the Australian Open later this month. But Djokovic is apparently unable to get through passport control because a member of his team applied for a sub-class of visa which does not allow medical exemptions for being unvaccinated. The Victorian state government has refused to support his application. According toAustralian media reports,external, Djokovic was being questioned by border force officials at the airport until at least 01:15 at night. We don't yet know if he's been let through.

Angela Rayner - who stood in for Sir Keir Starmer during PMQs, as he has tested for positive for Covid - says ""of course it's right"" for the government to keep Plan B measures in England. This video can not be played Covid: Labour's Angela Rayner responds to PM's Plan B statement Time for some reaction now to the announcement that pre-departure Covid tests to enter England from overseas will be scrapped from 04:00 on Friday - with travellers set to be able to take a lateral flow test on day two after arriving instead. Self-isolation until they receive a negative result in England is also ending. A spokesperson for London's Heathrow airport said the move provided a ""much needed boost to passengers desperate to see loved ones and to businesses that need to reconnect with global markets"". Johan Lundgren, chief executive of easyJet, welcomed the decision, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"" for passengers. But he urged ministers to ""take the final step towards restriction-free travel"" by removing the last Covid test requirement for vaccinated passengers so travelling does not become ""a preserve of the rich"". Travellers currently must pay for private tests rather than using free NHS tests. We've got more detail on the changes to coronavirus travel testing in England from the transport secretary. Grant Shapps hastweeted,externalthat fully vaccinated passengers and under 18s will no longer need to take a pre-departure test before returning to England if arriving after 04:00 GMT onFriday. He says the same groups arriving in England will now only need to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test if they arrive after 04:00 GMT onSunday. The need to self-isolate before getting a negative result is also ending. He says now Omicron is the dominant variant and is widespread in the UK, these measures are no longer proportionate. By removing them the government is supporting the safe reopening of international travel, he says. This video can not be played Covid self-isolation period will be cut to seven days in Scotland And if you missed it earlier, here's Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon updating the Scottish Parliament on rule changes - including a change to self-isolation requirements for both Covid cases and their contacts. Read more about the changes in Scotlandhere.  This video can not be played Covid: PM confirms Plan B will stay as England experiences 'fastest growth' in cases Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent In recent days, confidence has been increasing in government
that the current restrictions in England are enough. They will now continue for the next three weeks. That means
working from home, face coverings indoors and, although the PM didnât mention
it, Covid certification for large events. The PM said that ministers would remove measures when they
are not necessary - and we have a couple of changes today. Firstly, if you travel abroad you wonât need to do a test
before travelling back to the UK. And then when you do return, you wonât need to isolate and pay for an
expensive PCR test. Instead, by the end of your second day back, youâll have to
do a lateral flow (although if thatâs positive, a PCR will then be needed). Ultimately, Boris Johnson is confident that the current
strategy is working, even though there are fewer restrictions in England than
the rest of the UK. Back now to the debate in PMQs - Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner is responding to the prime minister's Covid statement. Citing the PM's previous comment that the nation must ""ride out"" the Omicron wave, she says the NHS is ""not surfing"" and is instead ""struggling to stay afloat"". She refers toa number of hospital trusts declaring critical incidents in recent days due to staff shortages and high Covid casesacross the country. Critical incidents are declared when health bosses are concerned they may not be able to provide priority services. She calls on Boris Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The UK has recorded 194,747 new daily coronavirus cases and a further 334 deaths within 28 days of a positive test,the government's dashboard shows.,external A message on the dashboard says today's death figures include a backlog of hospital deaths reported overnight by NHS England covering the period 1 - 4 January. The PM confirms that pre-departure travel Covid tests to enter England from overseas will be scrapped from 04:00 on Friday. He also says he is lifting the requirement to self-isolate on arrival in England until receiving a negative PCR test result. Instead people can take a lateral flow test on day two - and if it's positive a further PCR test will be needed to identify any new variants, plus isolation as normal. The prime minister says the UK has the biggest testing programme in Europe - registering twice as many tests as France, and four times as many as Germany. Last month, 300m lateral flow tests were handed out, he says, which enabled people to spend Christmas with loved ones safely. But due to the ""sheer size"" of the Omicron wave, the government must take steps to ensure testing capacity ""reaches those who need it most"". He reiterates the announcement earlier that people in England will no longer have to confirm the result of a positive lateral flow test with a PCR test if they don't have symptoms. He says from Tuesday, people should just record the result of the lateral flow test on the government website and begin isolating. Boris Johnson says cabinet earlier agreed that England should stick with Plan B for a further three weeks - with a review before the regulations expire on 26 January. He says people in England should continue working from home wherever they can, wear face coverings on public transport, and also in most public indoor places. He says people should take a Covid test before going to high-risk settings or meeting the elderly or vulnerable. He says these measures are taking the edge off the Omicron wave - and to those asking if the government should go further, he says lockdowns are not cost-free.  Updates to follow... As Prime Minister's Questions wraps up, Boris Johnson will make a separate statement to MPs on the Covid response in England. The prime minister held a cabinet meeting this morning - and he has just confirmed in the Commons that England will stick with the so-called ""Plan B"" rules. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Some hopeful news buried in
the staggering growth of Omicron infections. There's a hint that growth in
London, the leading edge of the Omicron wave, may have been slightly slower
over the Christmas break. Having doubled in the week
before Christmas, infections grew by less - roughly from 7.5% to 9% - in
the week up to 31 December. We have to hope this slowdown
continues once everyone returns to work in the coming week. The growth this week
was driven by infections in the north of the country: the North West has almost
caught up with London and infections more than doubled in the North East and in
Yorkshire and the Humber. The unfortunate news is that
infections are doubling each week in the over 70s, growing faster than any
other age group. They still have a
much lower rate of infection than anyone else, but this is the group where the
boosters will be doing the most work to prevent infection turning into serious
illness.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.09601431
"Covid testing rules are to be eased for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. While Covid levels are high, people can be confident that rapid tests are highly accurate, the UK Health Security Agency said. The change will come into force in England next week and across the rest of the UK within days. It will be reviewed when coronavirus levels in the population drop below 1%. Around 4% of people are currently infected with coronavirus, according to the Office for National Statistics. Under the new guidance, anyone in England who receives a positive lateral flow device (LFD) test result should report their result ongov.uk,externaland must self-isolate immediately, but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. After reporting a positive LFD test result, they will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace so that their contacts can be traced. Anyone who tests positive will be able to leave self-isolation seven days after the date of their initial positive test if they receive two negative lateral flow test results, 24 hours apart, on days six and seven. from todayin Northern Ireland,external from Thursday inScotlandandWales from Tuesday 11 January in England At present anyone with a positive lateral flow test who has no symptoms needs a PCR test - carried out in a lab - to confirm their result. This can take days to arrive and health officials are worried people may not be isolating during this time. The change will also improve access to PCR tests for people with symptoms and for healthcare, transport and other key workers following problems over test supplies. There are some exemptions to the new rule. People who receive Test and Trace financial support, those taking part in Covid research studies and around one million people in England eligible for new NHS treatments for Covid will all be asked to take a follow-up PCR. What are the Covid self-isolation rules? How do I know I have Omicron? When can I have a booster? Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of UKHSA, said: ""While cases of Covid continue to rise, this tried-and-tested approach means that LFDs can be used confidently to indicate Covid-19 infection without the need for PCR confirmation. She added: ""I'm really grateful to the public and all of our critical workers who continue to test regularly and self-isolate when necessary, along with other practical and important public health behaviours, as this is the most effective way of stopping the spread of the virus and keeping our friends, families and communities safe."" Prof Lawrence Young, virologist at the University of Warwick, said this was ""a sensible approach"" as long as positive results were reported and the lateral flow kits ""are in good supply"". He added: ""Lateral flow tests can detect around 95% of people who are at their most infectious."" Anyone who develops one of the three main Covid-19 symptoms - a new cough, a high temperature or a loss of taste or smell - should stay at home, self isolate and take a PCR test. But some scientists questioned why people with symptoms couldn't also rely on a lateral flow test result alone. Lateral flow tests are very good at detecting people who are infectious at the moment because the prevalence of the virus is high and there are lots of cases to be spotted. Analysis shows that if you tested 1,000 people right now, you'd get 41 testing positive and almost all of them would be correct - but last summer, when there were fewer cases around - you'd get three positives but only two would be true. That's when a PCR would be important to confirm the result. The latest Covid figures showed 218,724 new cases were recorded in the UK on Tuesday. That number included previously unreported cases from Wales and Northern Ireland from over the new year period. A number of hospitals havedeclared critical incidentsamid staff shortages due to Covid. This video can not be played Dr Mike Tildesley: ""Hopefully we won't be losing the levels of information that enables us to identify variants"" Separately, pre-departure Covid tests for those entering Englandwill be scrapped from Fridayafter the travel industry called for restriction on travellers to be removed because the virus is circulating so widely.

She called on Mr Johnson to ""be frank with people"" and give an ""honest assessment"" of the state of the health service. The decision to drop follow-up tests for people who test positive in England on rapid tests will not make much difference to our ability to track the epidemic or variants. It's true that if people decide not to report their positive lateral flow test, we will miss some cases. But the testing system already misses cases if people decide not to get tested or to quietly pocket their rapid test result. That's why we rely on other data: hospital admissions or surveys that swab people at random. They'll keep on working as they always have. And we will still have plenty of PCR samples to sequence and spot variants: tens of thousands of positive cases every day. Last Wednesday, for example, in England, about 50,000 people reported testing positive on a lateral flow test. And nearly 150,000 more people tested positive on a PCR without a previous lateral flow. The guidance is still that you must get a PCR test if you have symptoms and, as long as that's the case, there will be plenty of data. Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), said lateral flow tests were very accurate - but it was crucial people recorded their positive results.

"The rules on testing are to be eased for people travelling to England, the government has announced, following calls from the travel industry. From 04:00 GMT on Friday, fully vaccinated travellers coming to England will no longer have to take a test before they travel. And from Sunday, rather than taking a PCR test on day two of arrival, they can take a cheaper lateral flow. The rules for self-isolating on arrival will also change. The shake-up was confirmed by Boris Johnson earlier, following calls from travel firms who said the measures were not effective now that Omicron was spreading widely. Under the current rules in force until Friday, all fully-vaccinated travellers over the age of 12 must show proof of a negative test lateral flow or PCR test taken in the two days before coming to the UK. Fully vaccinated people must also pay for a PCR test within two days of arrival and self-isolate while waiting for the result. People who aren't fully vaccinated must currently take PCR tests on both day two and day eight after arriving, and self-isolate for 10 days. But under the new rules: From 04:00 GMT on Friday 7 January, people who are fully vaccinated and those aged under-18 will no longer need to take a test two days before travelling to England from countries outside the UK and the Common Travel Area. On arrival, they will have to take a PCR test but they will no longer have to self-isolate while awaiting the result From 04:00 GMT on Sunday 9 January they will only have to take a lateral flow test instead of a PCR test on day two. But this test must be bought from a private test provider - free NHS tests are not allowed Unvaccinated passengers will need to continue to take a pre-departure test, PCR tests on day two and day eight, and self-isolate for 10 days Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pre-departure test ""discourages many from travelling for fear of being trapped overseas and incurring significant extra expense"". The announcement comes after airlines said passenger testing was making no real impact, with data last week suggesting one in 25 people in England had the virus. They also said compulsory testing had held back the sector's recovery. Mr Johnson met his cabinet earlier and alongside changes to travel tests, the governmenthas said it will ease Covid testing rulesfor people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. On Tuesday,Mr Johnson said he hoped the country could ""ride out"" the current wave, although he acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel temporarily overwhelmed. That rule change will come into force on 11 January and apply to England only for now. Following the announcement for England, Health Minister for the Welsh government Eluned Morgan said: ""I have today reluctantly agreed to remove the requirements for fully vaccinated travellers and under 18s to take a pre departure test (PDT) and a day 2 PCR test when arriving in the UK."" Currently, all travellers to the UK aged 12 and over have to show proof of a negative test, which can be a PCR or a lateral flow test, and must be taken up to two days before departure for the UK. They then have to take another test - which this time must be a PCR test - within the first two days after their arrival in the UK. But at the time that rule was brought in a month ago, the number of new cases reported in the UK each day was running between 40,000 and 50,000 - and was only rising relatively slowly because it was almost entirely made up of the Delta variant of Covid. But UK cases have now risen sharply and Omicron is the dominant variant - so airlines can argue that there is no longer any hope of relying on testing to ""keep out Omicron"". Read more. John Wyndham, who is currently planning a third trip to the US for February, said that scrapping pre-departure tests will make him feel unsafe on flights. ""I'm frustrated because pre-departure was the most important as an effective control and also the cheapest test,"" he told the BBC. Mr Wyndham runs a start-up company that is organising marching bands across the world to participate in London Band Week. He went to the US in December along with three colleagues, who paid Â£212 each for PCR testing. However, he said that the eliminating pre-departure testing will only save him around Â£30 per person and wasn't worth the added worry about new variants. ""It's bonkers that we could now sit on the plane with someone who has it,"" he said, adding that it would ""worsen what has already been the most stressful travelling of my life"". David Hughes will save around Â£800 However, holidaymaker David Hughes welcomed the scrapping of PCR tests before returning to the UK. Currently on holiday in Dubai, the rule change will save his family of 4 around Â£400 and another removing the Day 2 PCR will also save the family another Â£400. ""Having returned from a country where there were strict entry requirements and we were tested on arrival I would be very confident that we'll be returning to the UK Covid free,"" he told the BBC. Cancellation fees and no longer having to test before returning would mean significantly less hassle and stress, Mr Hughes added. In response, Mark Tanzer, Chief Executive of ABTA - The Travel Association, said the two announcements were ""potentially very positive"" for the travel sector, but that damage had ""already been done"". ""We now hope to see confidence return as we enter what is usually the peak booking season for summer holidays,"" he added. Steve Heapy, boss of the airline Jet2 and tour operator Jet2 Holidays, also said the timing of the announcement will make a ""huge difference"". Numbers of customers on their website, he said, were already increasing ""exponentially"" after the rule change. Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, agreed that the announcement meant customer demand would be boosted in a ""critical booking window"" for the industry. EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren also welcomed the news, saying it would make travel ""much simpler and easier"", as customers could now book and travel with ""confidence"". The trade body Airlines UK has argued that continuing the current measures would be financially disastrous for the industry. UK air travel sees huge slump in 2021 due to Covid Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Will Omicron stall airlines' recovery in 2022? Ahead of the test changes, Manchester Airports Group (MAG) sent the government research it commissioned, which it claimed shows that pre-departure testing has had little or no impact on the spread of Omicron. It said that passenger numbers at MAG's airports fell by more than 30% after Omicron measures were introduced. Tim Hawkins, chief of staff at MAG, told the BBC's Today programme the research showed there was a ""basis for taking out all tests"" related to international travel, due to the high number of Covid cases in the UK. ""We are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn't be doing it and we should take those measures out,"" he added. Separately, European airline and tour operator stocks rose on Tuesday amid a rise in investor confidence in the sector.

"Concerns have been raised about NHS staff being left exhausted Some non-urgent surgery is being halted at Greater Manchester hospitals as the ""rising impact"" of Covid-19 and staffing shortages continues to affect NHS trusts. More than 20 English NHS trusts have declared critical incidents, according to Downing Street. Two trusts in Bristoldeclared the highest level of alert earlier. Health bosses in Greater Manchester said about 15% of their workforce were either ill with Covid or isolating. Health minister Gillian Keegan said the government knew ""this was going to be one of the most pressurised winters"" for the NHS and that extra investment had been given to help the service cope. She said declaring critical incidents was part of ""our NHS contingency and resilience plans"" that are ""tried and tested"" and in place every winter. Omicron stats are huge, but look beyond them Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Pre-departure travel tests to be scrapped Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership said the decision affecting 17 hospitals was ""a temporary measure"" and that cancer care, cardiac and vascular surgery and transplantation would not be affected. But it said Covid admissions were also rising sharply, with more than one in five patients in some of the region's hospitals testing positive. They said the ""challenges may get worse"" in the next fortnight. Fiona Noden, chief executive of Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, said the suspension of surgery had been ""a very difficult decision"" which was taken to ensure ""we can keep people safe, maintain infection control, deploy staff where they are needed most [and] keep looking after people who need urgent and emergency care"". Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said social care was also hit hard by staff absences with around half of care homes in the region are unable to accept new residents. He said there were about 650 people in hospital beds who are medically fit to be discharged but a shortage of care homes to take them.

As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival.

This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed.

If you can't see the lookup, click here Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said a critical incident was ""an indication of very serious pressure"" at a trust which may ""not be able to provide"" a range of priority services. Other NHS trusts that have announced critical incidents since Christmas across England include: Norfolk and Waveney's care systemhas been placed on the highest state of alertand the county's biggest hospital said its number of patients with Covid had almost doubled since Friday The University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which serves patients in Lancashire and south Cumbria, saidsome non-urgent operations and procedures had been suspended Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust's chief operating officer said there was ""very high demand"" for services and ""long waits"" in emergency and urgency care departments In Wiltshire,the Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust declared a critical incidentafter experiencing ""sustained high levels of demand"" and concerns over the ""availability of beds"" United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust's medical director said on Monday there were ""significant staffing pressures"" due to Covid-related absences,though essential services were still operating A critical incident was also declared at Plymouth's Derriford hospitalwith 99 positive cases there and at its three community hospitals Meanwhile, the number of hospital staff off sick across the North East and north Cumbria has increased 135% due to Covid since 24 December Elsewhere, North East Ambulance Service has asked people with suspected strokes or heart attacksto get a lift to hospital because of staff shortages. Patients were waiting on average for an hour to be seen and medical director Dr Mathew Beattie said there had been an 80% increase in Covid-related absences over the last six days. Ms Keegan asked NHS England to review the situation and said people could ""rely on getting to hospital if you are in an emergency like a heart attack"". The NHS is always under pressure at this time of year. In previous winters critical incidents have been declared and non-urgent surgery cancelled. Compromised care is nothing new. That's not to say the health service isn't facing a unique set of pressures this year. Admissions for Covid are already twice what would normally be seen for all types of respiratory infections. Staff absences are also double what they traditionally would be. And on both measures the situation is getting worse. What will be crucial is how much worse things get. The hope is infections will peak soon - and pressure on hospitals quickly afterwards. Much though depends on whether there is more spread among older age groups, who are at most risk of serious illness. Ministers are banking on the boosters limiting this. It will be at least a week maybe two before we have the answer. Meanwhile,Covid testing rules are to be eased for people without symptoms, who will no longer need to confirm a positive lateral flow test with a PCR. The UK Health Security Agency said the rule change will apply from 11 January and apply to England only for now. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: ""In many parts of the health service, we are currently in a state of crisis. ""Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. ""Community and social care services, which were already massively overstretched, are at breaking point. In many areas, ambulance services are unable to meet their target response times."" On Tuesday,Boris Johnson said he hoped England could ""ride out"" the current wavewithout further restrictions but acknowledged parts of the NHS would feel ""temporarily overwhelmed"".

"Nearly a third of new daily infections have been reported from Delhi and Mumbai India is bracing for a third wave of coronavirus as its largest cities - the capital Delhi and financial hub Mumbai - see a surge in cases. India reported 58,097 cases on Wednesday, a six-fold rise in a week that experts say is fuelled by the Omicron variant. Nearly a third of those infections came from Delhi and Mumbai. Both cities have brought back curfews and other restrictions to halt the spread of the virus. Dr NK Arora, head of India's vaccine task force, told NDTV on Monday that the third wave of the pandemic had already begun in the country, adding that the ""whole wave seems to be driven by a new variant... Omicron"". The country has reported more than 2,000 Omicron cases - Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is leading the tally (653), followed by Delhi (464). Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain has said that 81% of Covid samples in the city tested positive for Omicron. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) - one of India's major hospitals - in Delhi has cancelled winter leave for doctors, according to reports. The rising infections are a sombre reminder of the devastating second wave India faced in April and May - daily averages of about 400,000 cases at the peak of the crisis. A policeman patrols the promenade at Mumbai's Marine Drive to limit public gatherings Delhi was among the hardest hit cities as hospitals across the country ran out of beds and life-saving oxygen, leaving patients gasping for breath. Crematoriums were overwhelmed, forcing people to hold mass burials in open spaces. Caseloads did drop eventually - for many months the national tally remained well under 10,000 cases a day. Now as cases rise again, state governments are re-imposing restrictions. Omicron: India aims to avoid 'pandemic roulette' Preliminary data suggests that fewer people infected with Omicron need hospital treatment when compared with other variants. But experts advise caution as a surge in cases could put hospitals under strain. On Tuesday, authorities in Delhi imposed a weekend curfew, with all non-essential activity banned between Friday night and Monday morning.  The capital last week closed gyms and cinemas, as well as imposing an overnight curfew in an effort to stem the spread. Delhi imposed a night curfew last week The weekend curfew decision was announced hours after the city's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tested positive, saying he was isolating with mild symptoms. Mr Kejriwal has been attending massive election rallies in other states, even as cases continue to rise in his city. On Monday, he attended an event in Uttarakhand where many, including those sharing the stage with him, were seen without a mask. Several other politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have held similar rallies in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in the past few weeks in which thousands - many without masks - have participated with little regard to social distancing. The three states, along with Goa and Manipur, go to the polls in February and March. Thousands of people have been attending rallies held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders Ahead of India's second wave too, political parties flouted Covid guidelines in states such as West Bengal where elections were due. The mega rallies were blamed for helping the virus spread. But the Election Commission indicated last week that this year's polls may not be postponed even amid the rise in cases. Meanwhile, authorities in Mumbai said they will consider imposing a lockdown if daily cases cross the 20,000 mark. The city recorded 10,860 new cases on Tuesday, a 34.37% jump from the previous day. Cases are also rising in Goa, a tourist haven, where authorities have imposed a night curfew - it reported 592 new infections on Monday. Goa saw massive gatherings and parties over Christmas and New Year's Eve, which experts say has contributed to the spike in infections. India's government is yet to announce booster doses, although Mr Modi has said precaution doses will be given from 10 January to frontline workers and those above the age of 60 with comorbidities. About 63% of India's eligible adults have been fully vaccinated and more than 90% have received at least one jab since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January 2021.

"Scrapping plans to upgrade the Warrior armoured vehicle wasted Â£595m, the report says Labour has accused the Ministry of Defence of ""wasting"" Â£13bn of taxpayers' money since 2010. The party used independently-collated data to identify 67 cases of ""waste"" - which it defines as when costs could have been reasonably avoided or reduced by better management. These include cancelled contracts and programmes that went over budget. The MoD said it had to take ""tough decisions"" to ensure the country was fully equipped to face threats. But Labour said its audit of the department's finances showed ministers were ""failing British troops and British taxpayers"". The MoD has an annual budget of more than Â£40bn a year - with nearly half that money spent on equipment. It manages a fifth of all the government's major projects. However, so far none of its 36 major projects is rated green - defined as the project being on time and within the original budget. Major design flaws in Army's new armoured vehicles MoD 'wasting billions on equipment' Labour's report examined all MoD spending since 2010, covering the years of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coaltion and then the Cameron, May and Johnson-led governments. It said that the ""wasted"" Â£13bn included Â£4.8bn was from cancelled contracts and Â£5.6bn of overspending on existing projects. Many of the examples over the years have already been highlighted by the National Audit Office and the Commons Public Accounts Committee. The report gives several examples of projects which have already gone significantly over budget, including: an extra Â£1bn on building a new nuclear warhead manufacturing facility at Burghfield near Reading, which is already 76 months behind schedule building seven Astute Class attack submarines, which is costing Â£1bn more than originally planned the RAF's fleet of new Protector drones is already Â£325m over budget and 28 months late Cancelled projects have also cost the MoD millions of pounds. They include the loss of Â£595m after it scrapped plans to upgrade the Warrior armoured vehicle. Some Â£4m was lost on a new IT system which was abandoned. According to the MoD ""the project was paused while other options were investigated and it was ultimately decided not to pursue the project further due to the rapid pace and change in technology"". Plans to build seven Astute Class attack submarines have gone over budget The MoD has also scrapped or sold off some equipment earlier than originally planned. Hundreds of armoured vehicles, purchased for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, have been disposed of. MoD accounts valued the ""write-off"" at Â£213m. The MoD has been fined Â£32.6m by the Treasury for breaching its own accounting rules. The Department of Health is the only other government department to have been fined. Labour suggested the money lost could have paid for more tanks, aircraft and warships - and avoided some of the cuts announced in the recent Integrated Defence Review. Shadow defence secretary John Healey warned that ""without a revolution"" in the way the MoD controls costs there is a ""serious risk that extra funding for defence will be swallowed by a black hole"" in its finances. He said a Labour government would make reform of the MoD a priority - first by commissioning a National Audit Office investigation into waste and then by making the MoD the first department subject to a new ""Office for Value of Money"". However, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said that, in reality, successive governments of all political persuasions have struggled to control defence spending. And the last Labour government was itself accused by the Conservatives opposition of  creating a Â£40bn ""black hole"" in the MoD's budget, which led to significant defence cuts in 2010. An MoD statement said: ""This government is serious about investing in defence modernisation to ensure the UK armed forces have the relevant capabilities to face today's threats. That means taking tough decisions to replace old equipment and halt programmes that no longer fit requirements. ""The government has provided Â£24bn extra investment, with a fully-funded equipment plan alongside a new Defence and Security Industrial Strategy to maximise the benefits of investments for both the armed forces and UK prosperity.""

"This video can not be played Australians give their views on Novak Djokovic's exemption Australians have reacted angrily to news that tennis player Novak Djokovic will play in the Australian Open, after being exempted from vaccination rules. All players and staff at the tournament must be vaccinated or have an exemption granted by an expert independent panel. Djokovic has not spoken about his vaccination status, but last year said he was ""opposed to vaccination"". Prime Minister Scott Morrison said if the player's evidence was insufficient he would be on the ""next plane home"". Organisers say the defending champion has not been given special treatment, but the decision has infuriated many Australians. The country is seeing tens of thousands of Covid-19 cases for the first time after enduring some of the world's strictest restrictions. Over 90% of Australia's over-16 population is fully vaccinated, but some people still cannot travel interstate or globally because of current measures. Amid the controversy, Mr Morrison said the Serbian player would be required to present evidence upon arrival that he has a genuine medical exemption from vaccination. The Australian Open begins on 17 January in Melbourne. ""If that evidence is insufficient, then he won't be treated any different to anyone else,"" the prime minister told reporters. ""There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever."" The comments seemed to represent a change in his position, after he said on Tuesday that the Victoria state government had provided the player with an exemption to enter the country and that officials would act ""in accordance with that decision"". Many Australians had previously accused the government ofallowing the rich and famous to do as they pleasewhile ordinary people remained separated from sick and dying loved ones. ""I think it's a disgrace,"" Melbourne resident Christine Wharton told ABC. ""We've all done the right thing, we've all gone out and got our jabs and our boosters and we have someone that has come from overseas and all of a sudden he's been exempt and can play."" A&E doctor Stephen Parnis tweeted: ""I don't care how good a tennis player he is. If he's refusing to get vaccinated, he shouldn't be allowed in."" Novak Djokovic has been granted permission to defend his Australian Open title The decision raised eyebrows with some other tennis players too. ""I just think it's very interesting. That's all I'm going to say,"" Australian Alex de Minaur said. Britain's Jamie Murray added: ""I think if it was me that wasn't vaccinated I wouldn't be getting an exemption. You know, but well done to him for getting clear to come to Australia and compete."" Australian former player Rod Laver said the reason for the exemption should be made public, saying the situation ""might get ugly"". ""Yes, you're a great player and you've performed and won so many tournaments, so it can't be physical,"" he said. ""So what is the problem?"" The tournament's chief executive, Craig Tiley, said 26 athletes had applied for medical exemptions. ""A handful"" had been granted, he said, under guidelines set by federal regulators. ""We made it extra difficult for anyone applying for an application to ensure it was the right process and to make sure the medical experts deal with it independently,"" he told Channel 9. Novak Djokovic's announcement has made him an enemy to some and a hero to others. Whilst the tennis champion has never openly confirmed whether he has been vaccinated, what we do know is that he has previously tested positive for the virus and discussed his opposition to vaccines. During a Facebook live in April 2020 he explained how he ""wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine"" should that be necessary to travel or compete in tournaments. These comments were widely shared and praised in Facebook groups and Telegram channels promoting outlandish conspiracies that the vaccines are part of a sinister plot to control and harm the world's population. And previous comments like this have added fuel to the fire when it comes to the latest row over why he has been granted an exemption to travel. In Telegram channels promoting Covid-19 conspiracies, the exemption has given rise to incorrect theories that the vaccine is experimental. It has also led to outspoken vaccine sceptics, such as US tennis player Tennys Sandgren, to come out in support of Djokovic. And it is not just Djokovic who has been accused of fuelling disinformation on social media. His wife has promoted false claims that 5G technology is somehow linked to Covid-19 on her own Instagram feed - posts labelled as false by the social media site. Applications for medical exemptions are being assessed anonymously by two separate panels, with inflammatory cardiac illness or another acute condition listed as valid reasons. But it is also possible Djokovic has recently tested positive for the virus, which would allow him to defer taking the vaccine. A spokeswoman for the event told the BBC they could not comment on the reasons behind the player's exemption. On Tuesday Djokovic said on Instagram: ""I've spent fantastic quality time with my loved ones over the break and today I'm heading down under with an exemption permission. Let's go 2022. I am ready to live and breathe tennis in the next few weeks of competition."" CONTEXT:The lives upended by Australia's sealed border FEATURE:Crisis causes fury in Aboriginal communities Victoria state government minister Jaala Pulford acknowledged the decision was ""frustrating and upsetting"", but also denied that Djokovic had received special treatment. Both she and Mr Tiley urged Djokovic to give more information to the public. ""It'll certainly be helpful if Novak was to explain the conditions in which he's sought an exemption and granted an exemption but ultimately it's up to him,"" Mr Tiley said.

"Nearly a third of new daily infections have been reported from Delhi and Mumbai India is bracing for a third wave of coronavirus as its largest cities - the capital Delhi and financial hub Mumbai - see a surge in cases. India reported 58,097 cases on Wednesday, a six-fold rise in a week that experts say is fuelled by the Omicron variant. Nearly a third of those infections came from Delhi and Mumbai. Both cities have brought back curfews and other restrictions to halt the spread of the virus. Dr NK Arora, head of India's vaccine task force, told NDTV on Monday that the third wave of the pandemic had already begun in the country, adding that the ""whole wave seems to be driven by a new variant... Omicron"". The country has reported more than 2,000 Omicron cases - Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, is leading the tally (653), followed by Delhi (464). Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain has said that 81% of Covid samples in the city tested positive for Omicron. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) - one of India's major hospitals - in Delhi has cancelled winter leave for doctors, according to reports. The rising infections are a sombre reminder of the devastating second wave India faced in April and May - daily averages of about 400,000 cases at the peak of the crisis. A policeman patrols the promenade at Mumbai's Marine Drive to limit public gatherings Delhi was among the hardest hit cities as hospitals across the country ran out of beds and life-saving oxygen, leaving patients gasping for breath. Crematoriums were overwhelmed, forcing people to hold mass burials in open spaces. Caseloads did drop eventually - for many months the national tally remained well under 10,000 cases a day. Now as cases rise again, state governments are re-imposing restrictions. Omicron: India aims to avoid 'pandemic roulette' Preliminary data suggests that fewer people infected with Omicron need hospital treatment when compared with other variants. But experts advise caution as a surge in cases could put hospitals under strain. On Tuesday, authorities in Delhi imposed a weekend curfew, with all non-essential activity banned between Friday night and Monday morning.  The capital last week closed gyms and cinemas, as well as imposing an overnight curfew in an effort to stem the spread. Delhi imposed a night curfew last week The weekend curfew decision was announced hours after the city's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tested positive, saying he was isolating with mild symptoms. Mr Kejriwal has been attending massive election rallies in other states, even as cases continue to rise in his city. On Monday, he attended an event in Uttarakhand where many, including those sharing the stage with him, were seen without a mask. Several other politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have held similar rallies in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in the past few weeks in which thousands - many without masks - have participated with little regard to social distancing. The three states, along with Goa and Manipur, go to the polls in February and March. Thousands of people have been attending rallies held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other leaders Ahead of India's second wave too, political parties flouted Covid guidelines in states such as West Bengal where elections were due. The mega rallies were blamed for helping the virus spread. But the Election Commission indicated last week that this year's polls may not be postponed even amid the rise in cases. Meanwhile, authorities in Mumbai said they will consider imposing a lockdown if daily cases cross the 20,000 mark. The city recorded 10,860 new cases on Tuesday, a 34.37% jump from the previous day. Cases are also rising in Goa, a tourist haven, where authorities have imposed a night curfew - it reported 592 new infections on Monday. Goa saw massive gatherings and parties over Christmas and New Year's Eve, which experts say has contributed to the spike in infections. India's government is yet to announce booster doses, although Mr Modi has said precaution doses will be given from 10 January to frontline workers and those above the age of 60 with comorbidities. About 63% of India's eligible adults have been fully vaccinated and more than 90% have received at least one jab since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January 2021.

"US car giant General Motors has lost its title as America's top car seller for the first time in 90 years. Japan's Toyota claimed the top spot, selling more than 2.3 million vehicles last year, up 10%. GM said its sales, which fell 13%, were hurt by the widespread shortage of semiconductor parts that has been affecting the car industry. The Detroit company had ranked as the number one US car seller since 1931 and vowed it would bounce back. ""I wouldn't rush out if I were (Toyota) and get a 'We're No 1' tattoo,"" spokesman Jim Cain said, according to Reuters. Toyota extends Japan car production stoppages More young drivers choosing to learn on automatic cars Why is there a chip shortage for computers and cars? Overall, analysts expect the number of new cars sold in the US to have increased roughly 2% in 2021 compared to 2020, when buyers were reeling from the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. But purchases remain depressed compared to their pre-pandemic levels, as companies grapple with supply chain woes, problems that have also pushed prices higher for consumers. ""The key constraint for sales continues to be reduced inventory levels as a result of the semiconductor shortage,"" GM chief economist Elaine Buckberg said in a statement discussing the firm's sales and outlook for 2022. GM sold roughly 2.2 million vehicles last year down from 2.5 million in 2020, relying on its profitable pick-up trucks and SUVs to boost its bottom line. Toyota, which saw strong sales of its hybrids and other models, has been less affected than some other car makers by the shortage of chips, thanks to its decision to build up a stockpile after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. But it has also been forced to cut production amid the shortages. But America's top car companies have been ceding ground to international rivals well before the pandemic-related snarls. Ford, General Motors and Chrysler once accounted foras much as 90% of all US car sales,externaland still claimed more than half as recently as 2008. But that has slid lower. Toyota's Camry has been the top-selling passenger car in the US for 20 years, while its Rav4 has ranked as the best-selling SUV for five years.

"Covid cases in Scotland have reached record levels in Scotland over the past week The first minister is due to address Holyrood later as Covid case numbers in Scotland continue to rise sharply. A further 17,259 cases were reported on Tuesdayfollowing a record high of 20,217 positive tests on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon said last week she hoped to be able to give an update on changes to the self-isolation period. The Scottish government has been urged to cut it from 10 days to seven with negative tests,as has been done in other parts of the UK. More than 16,000 new Covid cases are currently being reported a day on average - up from an average of about 6,000 over Christmas - as the highly infectious Omicron variant sweeps across the country. The percentage of positive cases has also hit record highs, with 35.3% of tests reported on Tuesday found to be positive. ScotRail has been forced to introduce a slimmed-down timetable for much of January after staffing levels were hit by Covid, and CalMac has had to reduce some ferry services. Sporting bodies ask for fan clarity ScotRail services reduced due to Covid shortages 'Congestion' warning over Covid testing system Ferry cancellations blamed on Covid and weather Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross is among those who have called for the self-isolation period to be cut to seven days, if two negative tests are returned in the final two days, and for household contacts to be allowed to leave isolation if they test negative. ""Scotland has the strictest self-isolation rules anywhere in the United Kingdom,"" Mr Ross said. ""We understand the need for caution, but Nicola Sturgeon's dithering and delaying is continuing to have a major impact on frontline services and the wider economy, due to the sheer numbers having to isolate."" Changes to self-isolation rules have been made by Wales and Northern Ireland in the past week. Mr Ross's comments were echoed by Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie. Ms Baillie, who is also the party's health spokeswoman, said: ""The SNP must use this update to confirm whether they will change self-isolation requirements in line with the latest evidence, to stop staff absences piling yet more pressure on businesses and services this winter."" Deputy First Minister John Swinney said on Tuesday the government was still ""actively considering"" the move, adding that ""further details"" would be shared in the Scottish Parliament's virtual session on Wednesday. He added: ""We are obviously looking at the clinical advice that is crucial in the handling of this because... we do not in any way, shape or form serve anybody's interest if we ignore the clinical dimension of this issue, and the risk of transmissibility of allowing individuals to return to the workplace if they're still carrying the virus."" Public health expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, of the University of Edinburgh, has warned it is ""almost inevitable"" that Omicron cases will rise still further when pupils return to school, given the transmissibility of the new variant. Dr Tait-Burkard told BBC Scotland cases were likely to increase, even with mitigating measures. ""It's almost without a doubt that, when schools return, our numbers will increase further,"" she said. ""The virus is very, very prominent in the population at the moment. ""The week before last, one in 40 people in Scotland had the virus, and that means as soon as schools return, with such a high transmissibility of Omicron, the numbers will rise further, that is almost inevitable.""

"More than 30 million copies of Nevermind have been sold worldwide A judge in California has dismissed a lawsuit against Nirvana made by Spencer Elden, who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of their album Nevermind. Elden sued the band last year, alleging sexual exploitation, and that the artwork constituted child sexual abuse. Now 30, he said the infamous image had caused him ""extreme and permanent emotional distress"" as well as loss of wages and ""enjoyment of life"". Nirvana filed to dismiss last month, saying Elden's arguments lacked merit. ""Elden's claim that the photograph on the Nevermind album cover is 'child pornography' is, on its face, not serious,"" their lawyers said, noting that anyone who owned a copy of the record would ""on Elden's theory [be] guilty of felony possession of child pornography"". They continued by noting that, until recently, Elden had seemed to enjoy the notoriety of being the ""Nirvana baby"". ""He has re-enacted the photograph in exchange for a fee, many times; he has had the album title... tattooed across his chest; he has appeared on a talk show wearing a self-parodying, nude-colored onesie; he has autographed copies of the album cover for sale on eBay; and he has used the connection to try to pick up women."" Elden has re-created the photo several times The motion was filed by lawyers representing surviving Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic; Kurt Cobain's widow Courtney Love; and Kirk Weddle, the photographer of the cover image. Regardless of the merits of Elden's case, they argued, the statute of limitations on his claims had expired in 2011, meaning he was too late to sue. His lawyers have argued that the statute of limitations does not apply, as long as Nevermind continues to be sold in its current form. ""Child pornography is a forever crime,""Marsh Law told Variety in a statement last year,external. ""Any distribution of or profits earned from any sexually explicit image of a child not only creates longstanding liability but it also breeds lifelong trauma. This is common for all of our clients who are victims of actively traded child pornography, regardless of how long ago the image was created."" Elden's team had until 30 December to respond to Nirvana's motion to dismiss, but missed the deadline. As a result, Judge Fernando M Olguin dismissed the case ""with leave to amend"" - meaning his team have until 13 January to refile the case with appropriate changes. In a statement to AFP on Tuesday, Elden's lawyer Robert Lewis said they would do so ""very soon."" ""We are confident that Spencer will be allowed to move forward with his case,"" Lewis said.

"This video can not be played 'It felt so wrong we were violated this way' Taking photos of breastfeeding mothers in public without their consent is to be made a crime in England and Wales. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the move would stop women being ""pestered, whether it's for self-gratification or for harassment purposes"". Campaigners welcomed the decision, calling it ""a victory for breastfeeding mothers"". The law will form part of the the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill going through Parliament. Mr Raab also confirmed another amendment to the bill to give victims of domestic abuse more time to report crimes to police, and ""plug gaps"" in the law that risks offenders escaping justice. He confirmed the six-month time limit in cases of common assaults involving domestic abuse will be extended, after the BBC revealed almost 13,000 such cases in England and Wales had been dropped in the past five years. 'This is how we fed our babies' Breastfeeding mums 'lacked support' during lockdown Huge rise in domestic abuse cases being dropped Manchester-based designer Julia Cooper began the campaign to make taking pictures of breastfeeding mothers illegal after her own experience in a local park last April. ""I sat down to breastfeed my daughter and I noticed a man on another bench staring at us,"" she told the BBC. ""I stared back to let him know that I had clocked his gaze, but undeterred he got out his digital camera, attached a zoom lens and started photographing us."" Ms Cooper said she was ""completely shocked and devastated"" by the incident, but her troubles continued after Greater Manchester Police told her no crime had been committed and there was nothing they could do. ""I just felt that was so wrong that we had been violated in this way and there was nothing the police could do to help,"" she added. ""I was angry he felt just this right to capture what I was doing. It was disgusting. And I just felt so helpless, so I thought I need to do something about this."" Ms Cooper contacted her local Labour MP Jeff Smith, and his colleague Stella Creasy, who had her own experience of being photographed by a teenager on a train when feeding her child - telling the BBC it was a ""horrible experience"" that made her feel ""so self-conscious"". The pair took the campaign to the Commons and put forward an amendment to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in June, calling for a change in the law. But while Home Office minister Victoria Atkins called taking such photos ""unacceptable, creepy and disgusting behaviour"", she said the government was waiting for a review from the Law Commission on how best to act. Now there has been a change of heart in the Ministry of Justice, with government minister Lord Wolfson putting forward his own an amendment to the bill in the Lords. It will make a new offence of ""recording images of, or otherwise observing, breastfeeding without consent or a reasonable belief as to consent"" and to be found guilty, the perpetrator ""must be acting for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification or of humiliating, alarming or distressing the victim"". Stella Creasy - pictured here with her son in the Commons - was also photographed when breastfeeding her child Ms Cooper said she was ""delighted"" by the move, despite what she described as ""too-ing and fro-ing from government"" on the issue. ""It is a victory for breastfeeding mothers and it will provide the reassurance that we can breastfeed in public without strangers freely photographing and filming us as they wish. ""The law is on their side, the law is going to protect them and I am so pleased."" Ms Creasy also welcomed the change, saying it ""shows the law needs to keep up with the times, with people having phones and being able to take pictures and share them so easily"". But the Labour MP also said it showed the importance of having more mothers in Parliament - another campaign she is leading - to make sure their voices were heard on the issues that affected them. The other amendment being made to the same bill focuses on extending the six-month time limit victims of common assault face in England and Wales when it comes to reporting the crime. The clock currently starts from the date of the incident, and within the next six months, a victim needs to have come forward and the police have to have carried out their work to secure a charge against the alleged perpetrator, or the case will be dropped. But victims of domestic common assault - which includes things like a push, threatening words or being spat at - are sometimes reluctant to report incidents and the cases can be complex. In October last year, the BBC exclusively revealed that 13,000 cases had been dropped in five years because of the time limit being breached, with campaigners calling for the police to be given more time before having to bring charges. At the time, the BBC was told Home Secretary Priti Patel backed increasing the time limit to two years, but nothing official was announced. Now, her cabinet colleague, Mr Raab, has confirmed the starting point for the sixth month time limit will change - from the point of the offence to when the crime is reported to police - and a new overall time limit of two years will be introduced from the date of the offence to bringing a prosecution. This video can not be played Raab: Domestic abuse law change shows we're on victims' side ""The reason is that if you've been the victim of domestic abuse, it takes time to physically recover, to emotionally recover, and then to muster the confidence, the courage to come forward,"" he told the BBC. ""We want to make sure that the perpetrators of abuse cannot evade justice by being timed out."" Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the change, which she had also campaigned for, but insisted she would ""keep up the pressure for more action"" from the government when it came to tackling violence against women and girls. Mr Raab admitted bringing successful prosecutions for domestic abuse and other violent crimes was a ""huge challenge"", but said the government had a ""rigorous and robust"" package in place to support women who'd been subject to abuse or violence, but was ""constantly looking for ways to do better"".

"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in Almaty, the country's biggest city. Internet access has been cut in Kazakhstan amid mass protests sparked by rising fuel prices. Anti-government protesters in the main city, Almaty, stormed the mayor's office on Wednesday. Part of the building appeared to be on fire. Protests have also erupted in several other cities, with security forces using tear gas and stun grenades. The president has promised a tough response, calling the protests a ""black period"" in the country's history. ""As president, I am obliged to protect the safety and peace of our citizens, to worry about the integrity of Kazakhstan,"" Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said in a TV address. He called the protesters ""plotters"" who were ""financially motivated"". Internet services in the country have been disrupted since Tuesday. By Wednesday, internet monitoring group NetBlocks reported that Kazakhstan was ""in the midst of a nation-scale internet blackout"". It came as thousands of people took to the streets, despite a state of emergency in the capital Nur-Sultan, in Almaty, and in the western province of Mangistau. In Almaty, protesters gathered at the mayor's office before eventually storming it. Videos on social media showed a plume of smoke rising from the building, while gunfire could also be heard. The city's police chief, Kanat Taimerdenov, said ""extremists and radicals"" had attacked 500 civilians and ransacked hundreds of businesses. Water cannon was used against protesters in the western city of Aktobe. There are reports that security forces have sided with protesters in some places. Police fired stun grenades at protesters on Wednesday BACKGROUND:Kazakhstan country profile CONTEXT:Rare protests in a country that bans dissent The demonstrations started in the west of Kazakhstan on Sunday, before spreading across the country. They began when the government lifted the price cap on liquefied petroleum gas, which many people use to power their cars. Its price quickly doubled in a matter of days. On Tuesday, the president dismissed the government and said lower fuel prices would be restored, but the announcement has not brought an end to the protests. Dissent and protests are uncommon in Kazakhstan, which declared independence in 1991 amid the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, the town of Zhanaozen, in Mangistau province, was the scene of deadly unrest in 2011. At least 14 oil workers were killed in a police crackdown on a protest over pay and working conditions. The town has also been one of the main centres of the latest unrest. By Olga Ivshina, BBC Russian The speed at which the protests turned violent took many by surprise, both in Kazakhstan and in the wider region, and hinted that they are not only about an increase in fuel prices. This is a traditionally stable Central Asian state, which is often described as authoritarian. Until 2019 it was run by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, whose rule was marked by elements of a personality cult, with his statues erected across the country and a capital renamed after him. Yet when he left, it was amid anti-government protests which he sought to limit by stepping down and putting a close ally in his place. Most elections in Kazakhstan are won by the ruling party with nearly 100% of the vote and there is no effective political opposition. The analysts I spoke to say that the Kazakh government clearly underestimated how angry the population was, and that these protests were not surprising in a country with no electoral democracy - people need to take to the streets to be heard. And their grievances are almost certainly about a far wider set of issues than the price of fuel.
