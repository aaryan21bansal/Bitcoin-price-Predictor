"Robert Gore won awards for his contributions to science Robert W Gore, who invented Gore-Tex technology while working for his father's company in Maryland, US, has died aged 83. Introduced in 1976, the fabric has protected countless walkers, runners and outdoor enthusiasts from wet weather, but is also found in numerous products. A chemical engineer, Robert Gore became CEO of WL Gore & Associates. He died on Thursday after a long illness, the company confirmed. Gore was born in Utah and received bachelor's and advanced degrees from the University of Delaware and the University of Minnesota. He joined WL Gore & Associates, which had been founded in 1958 by his father Bill and his mother Vieve Gore. Why are so few women inventors named on patents? The battle to break plastic's bonds Plastic pollution: Washed clothing's synthetic mountain of 'fluff' In a company lab in 1969 he discovered a new form of polymer, a substance made of large molecules that repeat to form long chains. His father asked him to research a new way to manufacturer plumber's tape. Robert Gore discovered that by yanking a material called PTFE, the polymer stretched by 1,000% to create a microporous structure. Robert Gore discovered that PTFE could be expanded through rapid stretching This material created a fabric with billions of pores smaller than water droplets, forming a waterproof but breathable surface - or Gore-Tex. ""It was truly a pivot point in this company's history,"" Greg Hannon, WL Gore & Associates' chief technology officer,told Delaware Online newspaper last year.,external. Among its varied applications, Gore-Tex is used in medical devices including heart patches, guitar strings, space suits, and vacuum bags. WL Gore & Associates became a billion-dollar company in 1996 during Gore's presidency. ""We plan to leave a legacy to society and to future generations"" including ""infants with surgically reconstructed hearts that live because of our medical products,"" Gore said on the occasion. In 2000 he stepped down as president of WL Gore & Associates. During his career he received several awards for his contributions to science including from the Society of Plastics Engineers. Gore is survived by his wife as well as children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

"Vladimir Putin and Arkady Rotenberg have been friends since childhood One of Vladimir Putin's closest friends may have used Barclays Bank in London to launder money and dodge sanctions, leaked documents suggest. Billionaire Arkady Rotenberg has known the Russian president since childhood. Financial restrictions, orsanctions, were imposed on Mr Rotenberg by the US and the EU in 2014,which means Western banks could face serious consequences for doing business with him. Barclays says it met all its legal and regulatory duties. A leak of confidential files - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"" - reveal how companies believed to be controlled by Mr Rotenberg kept the secret accounts. The documents, known as the FinCEN Files, have been seen by the BBC's Panorama programme. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak In March 2014 the US hit Russia with economic sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in Ukraine. The Treasury Department designated Mr Rotenberg, 68, and his brother Boris, 63, ""members of the Russian leadership's inner circle"". The pair had sparred and trained in the same judo gym as Putin when they were young. The businessman and Russian president attending judo training in Sochi last year In recent years, Arkady Rotenberg's companies built roads, a gas pipeline and a power station through contracts awarded by the Russian state. The US Treasury said the brothers ""provided support to Putin's pet projects"" and ""made billions of dollars in contracts for Gazprom and the Sochi Winter Olympics awarded to them by Putin"". In 2018, the US added Arkady Rotenberg's son Igor to its list of sanctioned individuals. The aim of the sanctions is to cut off named people from the entire Western financial system. Yet the Rotenbergs appear to have continued moving cash through the UK and US. In 2008, Barclays opened an account for a company called Advantage Alliance. The leaked documents show the company moved Â£60m between 2012 and 2016. Many of the transactions occurred after the Rotenberg brothers had been sanctioned. In July this year, an investigation by the US Senate accused the Rotenbergs of using secretive purchases of expensive art to evade sanctions - one of the companies involved in the scheme was Advantage Alliance. US investigators concluded there was strong evidence that Advantage Alliance was owned by Arkady Rotenberg, and that the company had used its Barclays account in London to buy millions of dollars of art for him. A report,externalnoted how ""secrecy, anonymity, and a lack of regulation create an environment ripe for laundering money and evading sanctions"". Auction houses in the US and UK ""failed to ask basic questions"" about the buyers of the art. Despite the sanctions, Arkady appears to have paid $7.5m to acquire the RenÃ© Magritte painting La Poitrine. In 17 June 2014 a company linked to Arkady sent the cash from Moscow to Alliance's Barclays account in London. The following day Barclays sent the cash to the seller in New York. In April 2016, Barclays began an internal investigation of multiple accounts it suspected of being linked to the Rotenbergs. Six months later, the bank closed Advantage's account after becoming concerned that it was being used to move suspect funds. But the leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) show that other Barclays accounts with suspected links to the Rotenbergs remained open until 2017. One such company was Ayrton Development Limited. According to the files, Barclays were suspicious of Ayrton's activities and concluded that ""[Arkady] Rotenberg is the true owner of Ayrton"". Barclays did not comment when asked by Panorama about how many accounts it suspects were owned by the Rotenbergs. A spokesperson for Barclays said: ""We believe that we have complied with all our legal and regulatory obligations including in relation to US sanctions."" ""Given the filing of a SAR is not itself evidence of any actual wrongdoing, we would only terminate a client relationship after careful and objective investigation and analysis of the evidence, balancing potential financial crime suspicions with the risk of 'de-banking' an innocent customer."" The Rotenbergs declined to comment. The FinCen Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money around the world. They also show how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 400 journalists around the world.

"HSBC allowed fraudsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world even after it had learned of their scam, leaked secret files show. Britain's biggest bank moved the money through its US business to HSBC accounts in Hong Kong in 2013 and 2014. Its role in the $80m (Â£62m) fraud is detailed in a leak of documents - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"" - that have been called the FinCEN Files. HSBC says it has always met its legal duties on reporting such activity. The files show the investment scam started soon after the bank was fined $1.9bn (Â£1.4bn) in the US over money laundering. It had promised to clamp down on these sorts of practices. The scam was a Ponzi scheme - a notorious type of investment racket that pays existing stakeholders with money collected from new members. Lawyers for duped investors say the bank should have acted sooner to close the fraudsters' accounts. The documents leak includes a series of other revelations - such as the suggestion one of the biggest banks in the US may have helped a notorious mobster to move more than $1bn. The FinCEN Files are a leak of 2,657 documents, at the heart of which are 2,100 suspicious activity reports, or SARs. SARs are not evidence of wrongdoing - banks send them to the authorities if they suspect customers could be up to no good. By law, they have to know who their clients are - it's not enough to file SARs and keep taking dirty money from clients while expecting enforcers to deal with the problem. If they have evidence of criminal activity, they should stop moving the cash. The leak shows how money was laundered through some of the world's biggest banks and how criminals used anonymous British companies to hide their money. This video can not be played A visit to one of the âdodgiest addresses in the worldâ The SARs were leaked to the Buzzfeed website and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Panorama led the research for the BBC as part of a global probe. The ICIJ led the reporting of the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers leaks - secret files detailing the offshore activities of the wealthy and the famous. Fergus Shiel, from the consortium, said the FinCEN Files are an ""insight into what banks know about the vast flows of dirty money across the globeâ¦ [The] system that is meant to regulate the flows of tainted money is broken"". The leaked SARs had been submitted to the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN between 2000 and 2017 and cover transactions worth about $2 trillion. FinCEN said the leak could impact US national security, risk investigations, and threaten the safety of those who file the reports. But last week it announced proposals to overhaul its anti-money laundering programmes. The UK also unveiled plans to reform its register of company information to clamp down on fraud and money laundering. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak HSBC's shares dive to lowest level since 1995 Ming Xu claimed he was running a global bank The investment scam that HSBC was warned about was called WCM777. It was started by Chinese national Ming Xu. Little is known about how he came to be living in the US, although he claims to have studied for an MA in California. Based in the Los Angeles area, Xu - or ""Dr Phil"" as he styled himself - acted as a pastor at evangelical churches. Xu said he was operating a global investment bank, World Capital Market, that would pay out 100% profit in a 100 days. In reality, he was running the WCM777 Ponzi scheme. Through travelling seminars, Facebook and webinars on YouTube, it raised $80m selling supposed investment opportunities in cloud computing. Some of the Facebook posts used to market the WCM Pozi scheme Thousands of people from the East Asian and Latino communities were taken in. The fraudsters used Christian imagery and targeted poor communities in the US, Colombia and Peru. There were also victims in other countries, including the UK. But the impact were not just financial. The scheme led to the death of investor Reynaldo Pacheco, who was found under water on a wine estate in Napa, California, in April 2014. Police say he had been bludgeoned with rocks. Murder victim Reynaldo Pacheco, who invested in the Ponzi scheme He signed up to the scheme and was expected to recruit other investors. The promise was everyone would get rich. A woman Mr Pacheco, 44, introduced lost about $3,000. That led to the killing by men hired to kidnap him. ""He literally was trying toâ¦ make people's lives better, and he himself was scammed, and conned, and he unfortunately paid for it with his life,"" said Sgt Chris Pacheco (no relation), one of the officers who investigated the killing. Reynaldo, he said, ""was murdered for being a victim in a Ponzi scheme"". By then, regulators in California had already told HSBC it was investigating WCM777. This happened in September 2013. It alsoalerted its residents to the fraud.,external And California, along with Colorado and Massachusetts, took action against WCM for selling unregistered investments. HSBC did spot suspicious transactions going through its systems. But it was not until April 2014, after US financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission filed charges, that the WCM777 accounts at HSBC in Hong Kong were shut. By that time there was nearly nothing left in them. HSBC filed its first SAR about the scam on 29 October 2013 relating to more than $6m sent to the fraudsters' accounts in Hong Kong. Bank officials said there was ""no apparent economic, business, or lawful purpose"" for the transactions - and noted allegations of ""Ponzi scheme activities"". A second SAR in February 2014 identified $15.4m in suspicious transactions, and a ""Potential Ponzi scheme"". A third report in March related to a company associated with WCM777 and nearly $9.2m, and noted the regulatory moves by US states and an investigation ordered by Colombia's president. The WCM777 scheme emerged months after HSBC avoided a US criminal prosecution over money laundering by Mexican drug barons. It did so by agreeing to improve procedures. Analysis by the ICIJ shows that between 2011 and 2017 HSBC identified suspicious transactions moving through accounts in Hong Kong of more than $1.5bn - about $900m linked to overall criminal activity. But the reports failed to include key facts about customers, including the ultimate beneficial owners of accounts and where the money came from. Banks are not allowed to talk about suspicious activity reports. HSBC said: ""Starting in 2012, HSBC embarked on a multi-year journey to overhaul its ability to combat financial crime across more than 60 jurisdictionsâ¦ HSBC is a much safer institution than it was in 2012."" The bank added the US authorities had determined that it ""met all of its obligations under the [agreement struck with US prosecutors]"". Xu was eventually arrested by the Chinese authorities in 2017 and jailed for three years over the scam. Speaking to the ICIJ from China, Xu said HSBC had not contacted him about his business. He denied WCM777 was a Ponzi scheme, saying it was wrongly targeted by the SEC and his aim had been to build a religious community in California on more than 400 acres of land. A Ponzi scheme - named after early 20th Century conman Charles Ponzi - does not generate profits from the cash it raises. Instead investors are paid a return from money coming in from other new investors. More and more investors are needed to cover these payments. Meanwhile, the owners of the scheme move money into their own accounts. A Ponzi scheme will collapse if it cannot find enough new investors. The FinCEN Files also show how multinational bank JP Morgan may have helped a man known as the Russian mafia's boss of bosses to move more than a $1bn through the financial system. Semion Mogilevich has been accused of crimes including gun running, drug trafficking and murder. Banks have measures in place to stop profits from crime going through the financial system but a SAR filed by JP Morgan in 2015 after the account was closed, reveals how its London office may have moved some of the cash. It details how JP Morgan, provided banking services to a secretive offshore company called ABSI Enterprises between 2002 and 2013, even though the firm's ownership was not clear from the bank's records. Over one five-year period, JP Morgan sent and received wire transfers totalling $1.02bn, the bank said. The SAR noted ABSI's parent company ""might be associated with Semion Mogilevich - an individual who was on the FBI's top 10 most wanted list"". In a statement, JP Morgan said: ""We follow all laws and regulations in support of the government's work to combat financial crimes. We devote thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars to this important work.""

"Leaked documents involving about $2tn of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world. They also show how Russian oligarchs have used banks to avoid sanctions that were supposed to stop them getting their money into the West. It's the latest in a string of leaks over the past five years that have exposed secret deals, money laundering and financial crime. The FinCEN files are more than 2,500 documents, most of which were files that banks sent to the US authorities between 2000 and 2017. They raise concerns about what their clients might be doing. These documents are some of the international banking system's most closely guarded secrets. Banks use them to report suspicious behaviour but they are not proof of wrongdoing or crime. They were leaked to Buzzfeed News and shared with a group that brings together investigative journalists from around the world, which distributed them to 108 news organisations in 88 countries, including the BBC's Panorama programme. Hundreds of journalists have been sifting through the dense, technical documentation, uncovering some of the activities that banks would prefer the public not to know about.  2,657documents including 2,121Suspicious Activity Reports FinCEN is the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These are the people at the US Treasury who combat financial crime. Concerns about transactions made in US dollars need to be sent to FinCEN, even if they took place outside the US. Suspicious activity reports, or SARs, are an example of how those concerns are recorded. A bank must fill in one of these reports if it is worried one of its clients might be up to no good. The report is sent to the authorities. If you are planning to profit from a criminal enterprise, one of the most important things to have in place is a way of laundering the money. Laundering money is the process of taking dirty money - the proceeds of crimes such as drug dealing or corruption - and getting it into an account at a respected bank where it will not be linked with the crime. The same process is needed if you are a Russian oligarch whom Western countries have taken sanctions against to stop you getting your money into the West. Banks are supposed to make sure they don't help clients to launder money or move it around in ways that break the rules. By law, they have to know who their clients are - it's not enough to file SARs and keep taking dirty money from clients while expecting the authorities to deal with the problem. If they have evidence of criminal activity they should stop moving the cash. Fergus Shiel from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) said the leaked files were an ""insight into what banks know about the vast flows of dirty money across the globe"". He said the documents also highlighted the extraordinarily large amounts of money involved. The documents in the FinCEN files cover about $2tn of transactions and they are only a tiny proportion of the SARs submitted over the period. HSBC allowed fraudsters to move millionsof dollars of stolen money around the world, even after it learned from US investigators the scheme was a scam. JP Morgan allowed a company to move more than $1bnthrough a London account without knowing who owned it. The bank later discovered the company might be owned by a mobster on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list.

The husband of a woman who has donated Â£1.7m to the UK's governing Conservative Party's wassecretly funded by a Russian oligarchwith close ties to President Putin. TheUK is called a ""higher risk jurisdiction""and compared to Cyprus, by the intelligence division of FinCEN. That's because of the number of UK registered companies that appear in the SARs. Over 3,000 UK companies are named in the FinCEN files - more than any other country.

They highlight a range of potentially suspicious activity involving companies and individuals and also raise questions about why the banks which had noticed this activity did not always act on their concerns. Once a bank has filed a report to the authorities, it is very difficult to prosecute it or its executives, even if it carries on helping with the suspicious activities and collecting the fees.

"Lubov Chernukhin started donating to the Conservative Party in 2012 The husband of one of the Conservative Party's biggest donors was secretly funded by a Russian oligarch with close ties to President Putin. Lubov Chernukhin has given Â£1.7m to the Tories, including paying to spend time with the last three prime ministers. Leaked files show her husband received $8m (Â£6.1m). The money initially came from a politician facing US sanctions due to his closeness to the Kremlin. Her lawyers say the donations are not tainted by Kremlin influence. A leak of banks' ""suspicious activity reports"" - called the FinCEN Files and seen by BBC Panorama - shows Vladimir Chernukhin was sent the money in 2016 from a British Virgin Islands company linked to Suleyman Kerimov.

There has been an increasing focus on donations to political parties from wealthy UK-based Russians in recent years, with July'sparliamentary report by the Intelligence and Security Committee,externalreferring to the possibility they could allow people to ""assist Russian influence operations"". Billionaire Mr Kerimov is a member of the upper chamber of the Russian parliament. He has been under investigation in France over allegations of tax fraud since 2016. In 2018 he was sanctioned by the US authorities, who were targeting those they said ""play a key role in advancing Russia's malign activities"". Mr Chernukhin, 52, is a former deputy minister of finance under Vladimir Putin, who left Russia for London in 2004 after being sacked by the president. The Chernukhins - one of the UK's most prominent Russian-born couples - are now both British citizens and live in London. Vladimir Chernukhin with Vladimir Putin - he was sacked as deputy finance minister in 2004 Mrs Chernukhin's donations to the Conservative Party began in 2012. The majority - more than Â£1.5m - came after the $8m payment linked to Mr Kerimov was made to her husband on 29 April 2016, although it is not clear if any of that cash went to the Tories. Journalist and Russia expert Edward Lucas, who gave evidence to the parliamentary inquiry into Russian influence, told Panorama: ""The Chernukhins, pleasant people that they might beâ¦ are not fit and proper people to make donations to a British political party."" Mr Lucas said he was ""profoundly concerned by the access that, not only Lubov Chernukhin but also other rich Russians have to the heights of the Conservative Party, and to the government"".

In 2014 Mrs Chernukhin paid to play tennis with Prime Minister David Cameron and Boris Johnson (Pictures from 2013 and 2008) As of this year she is the biggest female donor in British history to the Tories. According to Electoral Commission records, she has given about Â£1.7m in total over the past eight years, including Â£335,000 between last January and July. When in 2018, Boris Johnson - then foreign secretary - was asked about the Chernukhins and the Â£160,000 tennis match donation,he told the BBC One's Andrew Marr Show:""If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way that gentlemanâ¦ obtained his wealth... then it's possible for our law enforcement agencies to deprive him of his wealth."" But he added ""all possible checks have been made and... will continue to be made"" on donations. The $8m payment to Mr Chernukhin was made by an offshore company called Definition Services, which was controlled by Mr Kerimov's children. The documents show their funding came from their father and it was Mr Kerimov who had the personal relationship with Mr Chernukhin. As Deutsche Bank was processing the money, it sent questions to officials at another bank involved in the transaction. The $8m payment came from an offshore company linked to Suleyman Kerimov They said it was a ""loan between the two parties aiming to support further immovable property projects of the borrower"" and that Definition was involved in real estate investments. Despite the response, Deutsche Bank filed a suspicious activity report (SAR), noting the link to Mr Kerimov and the payment to Mr Chernukhin. Deutsche said Definition was ""registered and banking out of high risk jurisdictions and the commercial purpose of the transactions and the relationship between the parties could not be determined"". Some of Mr Chernukhin's financial affairs have been made public as part of a long running legal battle with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska over the ownership of a former industrial site in Moscow. Proceedings at the High Court in London revealed he set up a trust for his wife, and another trust for the benefit of the couple together. Vladimir Chernukhin has been involved in a long-running legal battle in London Mrs Chernukhin has been described as a former banker. She is listed as a director of four UK companies. One of them shares the same London correspondence address detailed in a bank document concerning the $8m payment to her husband from Definition Services. Lawyers for the Chernukhins declined to say whether Mr Chernukhin had received the $8m. But they said ""Mrs Chernukhin has never received money deriving from Mr Kerimov or any company related to him"" and her ""donations to the Conservative Party have never been tainted by Kremlin or any other influence"". They added all her donations have been declared in accordance with Electoral Commission rules. Lawyers for Suleyman Kerimov said he denies all the allegations made by Panorama, and had ""no dealings with Ms Chernukhin whatsoever"". A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""There are people in this country of Russian origin who are British citizens and have the democratic right to donate to a political party. Many have been vocal critics of Putin and it is completely wrong and discriminatory to smear them all with the same brush."" The FinCEN Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed ""dirty money"" to be moved around the world. They also expose how US intelligence sees the UK as a ""higher risk jurisdiction"" and show it is awash with Russian cash from unexplained sources. The files were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 400 journalists around the world.

"The financial secrets of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and celebrities has been exposed in another huge leak of financial documents. Dubbed the Pandora Papers it features almost 12 million files from companies providing offshore services in tax havens around the world. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has organised the biggest ever global investigation, spanning 117 countries and involving more than 600 journalists. In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. The files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years. So let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade. In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources. They were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK. A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. Who was named?The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jerseyand thatPrince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. Who leaked the data?The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ.Panoramaled research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries. A confidential settlement was later reachedbetween the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement. Until Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data. SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung's ""brothers"". Despite surnames that sound exactly the same, these two leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation, Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer, are not related The Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externalin 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings. Overwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung called in theICIJ,external, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama. After more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016,with the database of documents going online a month later. Who was named?Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much.The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. Who leaked the data?John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims butMr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary,external. The real identity is still unknown. Five months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of ""prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons"", it said.Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an ""oversight"" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company. This ICIJ investigation,involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries,external,including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015. It focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted. The leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries. The ICIJ said the subsidiary had served ""those close to discredited regimes"" and ""clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations"". HSBC admitted that the ""compliance culture and standards of due diligence"" at the subsidiary at the time were ""lower than they are today"". Who was named?The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from ""arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws"". It also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Leaker in chief HervÃ© Falciani - indicted, held, released Who leaked the data?Actually, we know this one.The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower HervÃ© Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France. Or LuxLeaks for short.Another extensive ICIJ investigation,external, which revealed its findings in November 2014. It centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said. The leak of documents was first exposed in 2012after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. Who was named?Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named. A second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing. Jean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker says he is ""politically responsible for what happened"" Eurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU. Who leaked the data?Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him. (L-R) Edouard Perrin, Raphael Halet and Antoine Deltour The pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint.A first verdictwas later revisited, watering down sentences, withDeltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted. This was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest exposÃ© of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013. Some 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands. BBC Panoramaexposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UKin an undercover investigation based on the files. Who was named?The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions. Who leaked the data?The ICIJ cites ""two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry"" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was ""data obtained"". The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"The Central Bank of the UAE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment The United Arab Emirates' central bank failed to act on warnings about a local firm which was helping Iran to evade sanctions, the BBC has found. Leaked documents show Dubai-based Gunes General Trading processed $142m (Â£110m) in suspicious transactions through the UAE financial system in 2011 and 2012. The activity was flagged by a British bank, but the firm was able to continue using local financial institutions. In 2016, the US said it was involved in a major sanctions-busting scheme. The Central Bank of the UAE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Gunes General Trading has been wound up within the last two years. The BBC has been unable to reach anyone for comment. The documents - known as the FinCEN Files - were leaked to BuzzFeed News, then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and BBC News Arabic. The US first imposed sanctions on Iran during the 1979-1981 Tehran hostage crisis. Since then, successive US administrations have introduced measures intended to compel Iran to change its behaviour, such as limiting its nuclear programme. One of these measures was to cut off Iranian banks from the global banking system used to make payments in dollars in 2012. Reza Zarrab pleaded guilty in the US to fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges US prosecutors alleged that Gunes General Trading was partof a network controlled by Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab,externalthat conducted hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of transactions on behalf of the Iranian government and other Iranian entities that were barred under US sanctions. Gold trader's US legal saga grips Turkey How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? There were no further concerns raised about the company's activities following Zarrab's arrest in the US. In 2017, Zarrab pleaded guilty to fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges. He is yet to be sentenced. This video can not be played This is how a Dubai firm evaded US sanctions on Iran, despite the UAE central bank being warned Banks based in the UAE rely on big US-based banks to monitor and approve their US dollar payments - a service known as ""correspondent banking"". Correspondent banks are required to alert authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, by filinga document known as a suspicious activity report (SAR),external. Among the FinCEN files is an SAR that shows the New York branch of UK-based Standard Chartered Bank contacted the Central Bank of the UAE in 2012 after noticing hundreds of suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading. The reports did not say any of this activity was linked to sanctions evasion by Iran. SARs are a way to alert government regulators and law enforcement to irregular activity that should be investigated, although they are not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing. The central bank told Standard Chartered that ""the case has been passed on to law enforcement authorities"" and that ""accounts were closed in September 2011"". But Standard Chartered flagged that the company was able to ""continue its suspicious activity"" by ""utilizing various accounts that [it] maintains with other banks"". In fact, the central bank failed to stop Gunes General Trading using two other accounts with two UAE state-owned banks - Rakbank, the national bank of the northern emirate Ras al-Khaimah, and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD). Gunes General Trading was based in the emirate of Dubai The FinCEN files show Gunes General Trading was able to process a further $108m of transactions flagged as suspicious until September 2012, the majority of them through Rakbank. Rakbank said that because of confidentiality it does not comment on specific transactions but it complies with anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations and has strict policies in place to monitor this. NBD did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In April 2013, the US Bank of New York Mellon filed a SAR saying that following a US government inquiry into Gunes General Trading, it believed the company was conducting transactions in a manner designed to evade sanctions against Iran. ""Government authorities must both investigate alleged cases of financial crime and protect the integrity of the financial system,"" said Tom Keatinge, director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). ""This case brings into question the extent to which the UAE Central Bank took the second part of this responsibility seriously. Criminal actors thrive as a result of failures to share information, and this appears to be a prime example of such a failing."" The FinCen Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money to be moved around the world.

"A judge has blocked a US government attempt to ban the Chinese messaging and payments app, WeChat. US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler said the ban raised serious questions related to the constitution's first amendment, guaranteeing free speech. The Department of Commerce had announced a bar on WeChat appearing in US app stores from Sunday, effectively shutting it down. The Trump administration has alleged it threatens national security. It says the app could pass user data to the Chinese government. Is the US about to split the internet? What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat Both WeChat and China have strongly denied the claim. Tencent, the conglomerate that owns WeChat, had previously described the US ban as ""unfortunate"". The ruling comes just afterTikTok, which was also named in the Department of Commerce order, reached a deal with US firms Oracle and Walmartto hopefully allow them to keep operating. The case came to court after a group of US WeChat users challengedPresident Donald Trump's executive order,externalthat sought to shut WeChat down in the country. The US Justice Department argued that blocking the executive order would ""frustrate and displace the president's determination of how best to address threats to national security"". However Judge Beeler, sitting in San Francisco, noted that ""while the general evidence about the threat to national security related to China (regarding technology and mobile technology) is considerable, the specific evidence about WeChat is modest"". In a statement, the US Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross saidthe decision to block the app was taken ""to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data"".,external The department said WeChat collected ""vast swathes of data from users, including network activity, location data, and browsing and search histories"". This video can not be played 'We are not happy with China' - US President Donald Trump Friday's statement from the commerce department said the governing Chinese Communist Party ""has demonstrated the means and motives to use these apps to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the US"". Tencent, which owns WeChat, has said that messages on its app are private. WeChat is used by nearly 20 million people in the US - and pretty much exclusively by the Chinese and South East Asian diaspora. It is hard to describe how important it is in people's lives. It is not just an app, for many people WeChat IS their mobile phone. It is like Amazon, Facebook, WhatsApp, Tinder and much more, rolled into one. One Malaysian expat told me she would ""cry"" if the app was blocked. She told me her family had spent time showing her elderly mother how to use WeChat - and worried she would be unable to communicate with her if the ban came into force. Interestingly though, we have not heard much from WeChat's owners - Tencent. Why? Well, Tencent is one of the biggest games companies in the world - and has a huge market in America. If President Trump were to go further and target that section of the business it would really sting. WeChat was set up in 2011. It is a multi-purpose app allowing users to send messages, make mobile payments and use local services. It has been described as an ""app for everything"" in China and has more than one billion monthly users. Like all Chinese social media platforms, WeChat must censor content the government deems illegal. In March,a report said WeChat was censoring key words about the coronavirus outbreakfrom as early as 1 January. But WeChat insists encryption means others cannot ""snoop"" on your messages, and that content such as text, audio and images are not stored on its servers - and are deleted once all intended recipients have read them.

"Holiday camp operator Butlin's has yet to tell 1,000 furloughed workers what their future is when the government's wage subsidy scheme ends next month. A document sent to staff and seen by the BBC suggests employees either take paid holiday if they have any remaining or unpaid leave if not. Butlin's is currently operating at 50% capacity and is heading into the winter months when income falls significantly. It said no decision had been made about workers on the government scheme. The company said: ""Since we reopened Butlin's we've worked hard to bring back as many of our team as possible whilst ensuring we're safe and secure. ""There has been no decision made regarding our team who are still furloughed."" Coronavirus: When will the furlough scheme end? Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' Butlin's - whose workers are known for their distinctive red jackets - has 6,000 employees in total. It is part of the privately-owned Bourne Leisure Group which also operates Haven caravan sites and Warner Leisure Hotels with a total workforce of 15,000. Before the government's Job Retention Scheme was announced, Bourne Leisure warned that 10,000 jobs would be at risk without government help. Bourne Leisure has since secured hundreds of millions of pounds in government support in the form of loans, furlough payments and deferred VAT and business rates since the pandemic struck. Bourne Leisure paid out over Â£60m in 2019 to the three families that own the firm - the Harris, Cook and Allen families - reportedly taking the total paid out in dividends to Â£600m over the last 15 years. A staff member told the BBC ""I can't believe a great British holiday brand, owned by muliti-millionaires wants staff to take unpaid leave after furlough"". It is just one example of the uncertainty facing millions of employees still having a dwindling proportion of their wages paid by the government as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme winds down before its planned withdrawal on 31 October. As the date approaches, businesses will have to consult with staff on how many of them they intend to make redundant. Menzies Aviation which provides services at Luton Airport this week informed 176 workers - half its workforce - that their jobs were at risk when furlough ends. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ruled out extending the furlough scheme However, union sources told the BBC they had been surprised that there had not been more notifications given that companies with over 100 employees, who intend to make over 100 people redundant are obliged to consult with staff 45 days before termination. Unions, business groups and politicians across the political divide have been lobbying the government to find a replacement for the furlough scheme that all acknowledge has saved millions from unemployment. So far the government has ruled out any extension but Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is ""open to creative ideas"". Additional support may yet be forthcoming for regions hit by additional and increasingly widespread lockdown measures. It is thought future schemes will focus more on retraining and creating new jobs rather than returning those still on furlough to the jobs many think they still have but in reality do not.

"This video can not be played Covid-19: Self-isolating fines 'under discussion' in Scotland Large fines penalising those who fail to self isolate are ""under discussion"" in Scotland, according to the Scottish health secretary. Jeane Freeman told Politics Scotland the issue would be ""under discussion"" this weekend, despite showing some resistance to the idea. She said the policy risked ""punishing"" those who faced financial difficulties. The measure will be introduced in England from 28 September with fines of up to Â£10,000. The new legal duty requires people to self-isolate if they test positive for coronavirus, or are traced as a close contact. On Sunday, 245 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Scotland, which amounts to 5.4% of those tested. No new deaths were reported and of the 63 people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19, nine were in intensive care. Hancock: Follow Covid rules or they will get tougher Police Scotland use emergency powers 62,000 times Sturgeon issues warning over tougher Covid rules By comparison, 350 new cases were reported in Scotland on Saturday - the highest daily increase since May. Ms Freeman said there was evidence to show the steep rise in cases had been ""blunted"" following additional measures in some local authorities in the west - but said there was still ""real concern"". When asked whether the Scottish government would consider imposing similar fines in place in England, the health secretary said the issue needed to be examined ""the other way round"". ""I think what you need to do is look at what are the obstacles in somebody's way who wants to self isolate, wants to do the right thing but may have difficulties in doing so. ""One of those will be financial difficulties, so there needs to be an extension to ensure that we can offer financial support before you start talking about punishing people for not doing something that they want to do."" She added that she wanted to avoid ""penalising"" those on ""fragile, zero-hour contracts"" and low wages. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has called on the Scottish government to ""learn lessons"" from the March lockdown and safeguard ""anxious"" workers. He said: ""With furlough due to end next month, Nicola Sturgeon must stop the blame game with the UK government and ensure that Scottish workers have the protections they need with a bespoke scheme that recognises the specific requirements of Scotland's economy."" Ms Freeman said there were already spot fines available to Police Scotland if someone ""knowingly and deliberately"" broke the rules. In August, figures were revealed showing that people living in the most deprived areas were up to12 times more likely to be given finesfor flouting Covid restrictions. Ms Freeman said: ""We will look at all the measures that are there to support people to do what we're asking and any measures we think are necessary to deal with those who willingly and knowingly flout those guidelines."" She added that the Scottish government was waiting to hear whether Boris Johnson would answer its call for a four-nation Cobra meeting to discuss further measures. However she said if this did not go ahead, the Scottish government would ""take decisions at pace that are right for Scotland"". Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross, who has previously taken a stand against Boris Johnson byresigning over the actions of Dominic Cummings, said he wanted to see the Scottish and UK governments work together on issues such as the furlough scheme. He added that several industries were ""still struggling"" and he would be speaking to the chancellor to see what could be done for those industries.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: Follow rules or 'more stringent enforcement' coming Restrictions will get tougher if rules are not followed, Matt Hancock says, as Â£10,000 fines for those who fail to self-isolate are introduced in England. The health secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the country was facing a ""tipping point and we have a choice"". The prime minister is understood to be considering a ban on households mixing, and reducing opening hours for pubs. On Monday there will be a briefing on the latest coronavirus data led by two of the government's leading scientists. In the broadcast, at about 11:00 BST on Monday, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, with Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, is expected to say the trend in the UK ""is heading in the wrong direction"" with the country at a ""critical point in the pandemic"". ""We are looking at the data to see how to manage the spread of the virus ahead of a very challenging winter period,"" Prof Whitty is due to say. Earlier, asked if England could face another national lockdown, Mr Hancock said: ""I don't rule it out, I don't want to see it."" ""If everybody follows the rules then we can avoid further national lockdown,"" he said. In the BBC interview, he also: Said he would call the police on people who refused to self-isolate Denied the government was overreacting given deaths and hospital admissions remain relatively low Said there was still hope a vaccine would get ""over the line"" this year The move under consideration by PM Boris Johnson could take the form of a two-week mini lockdown in England - being referred to as a ""circuit breaker"" - in an aim to stem a recent surge in cases. On Sunday, a further 3,899 new Covid-19 cases and 18 deathswere reported in the UK. Meanwhile,visitors have flocked to Blackpool this weekend, despite police warning against having a ""last blast"" in the resort before tighter restrictions come into force in the rest of Lancashire on Tuesday. Elsewhere, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has saidhe will meet council leaders on Mondayand then recommend any London-specific measures to ministers. He believes the capital city may be just ""two or three days"" behind the hotspots of the north-west and north-east of England. Can a 'circuit break' halt the second Covid wave? New virus rules 'inevitable': The view near No 10 What are the rules for meeting my friends? People in England who refuse an order to self-isolate could be fined up to Â£10,000 from 28 September. The new legal duty requires people to self-isolate if they test positive for coronavirus, or are traced as a close contact. New measures also include a one-off Â£500 support payment for those on lower incomes, and a penalty for employers who punish those told to self-isolate. Fines will initially start at Â£1,000 rising to Â£10,000 for repeat offenders, and for ""the most egregious breaches"". Until now, advice to self-isolate has been guidance only. More than 19,000 fines have been issued in England and Wales for alleged breaches of coronavirus laws, the attorney general said earlier this week, but more than half have not been paid so far. The idea of introducing fines sounds good on paper, given it is believed only one in five people fully self-isolate when they need to. But there is real concern it will have an unintended consequence - and end up discouraging people from having a test in the first place or taking calls from contact tracers. Self-isolation can be costly for some in terms of lost income and job security (even with the offer of Â£500 payments). There is now growing concern among experts - both those advising government and those looking in from the outside - about the path being taken by ministers. First of all, the messaging is confusing. One minute the public is being told to Eat Out to Help Out and to get back into the office, then they are being told to curb their mixing and not to gather in groups of more than six. There is also a growing sense that the public is tiring of the battle to contain the virus with ever more draconian messages. The idea of curbing the spread of the virus to stop the NHS being overwhelmed brought people together in the spring. But what is the aim now the NHS was not overwhelmed? Suppression of a virus that clearly can't be suppressed without a huge cost to society? As Prof Robert Dingwall, a government adviser, put it last week, this virus is here ""forever and a day"" and the public may just be growing comfortable with the idea that people will die - just as they accept that people die of flu ever year. Earlier this week, Boris Johnson told the Sun he had ""never much been in favour of sneak culture, myself"" and people should speak to Covid rule-breakers before reporting them to the police. In contrast, Mr Hancock said he would call the police on his neighbour if they were breaking rules, saying it was ""absolutely necessary"" to break the chains of transmission. Asked whether the government's response was an overreaction given coronavirus death rates were still low, Mr Hancock said the number of hospital admissions was rising and an increase in deaths would follow. He said he was ""very worried"" about the latest data which suggested the UK could be on the same path as Spain and France - where deaths and hospitalisations are increasing - without effective action. ""We have seen in other countries when the case rate shoots up, the next thing that happens is the numbers going into hospital shoot up,"" he said. ""Sadly, we have seen that rise, it is doubling every eight days or so - people going into hospital - then, with a lag, you see the number of people dying sadly rise."" He said it was worth comparing the UK to Spain - where the number of cases have been increasing - and Belgium - which appears to have reversed an upward trend - saying ""one gives the warning, the other gives us hope"". Currently, large swathes of the UK, where cases have spiked, are living under tighter local restrictions. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has warned London could be next. Mr Hancock, who has spoken to the mayor this weekend, told Times Radiohe would not rule out the possibility that Londoners could be told this week to avoid the commuteand get back to working from home. Mr Hancock said he remained hopeful that a vaccine would be ready before the end of the year. ""We have got the cavalry coming over the next few months - the vaccine, the mass testing and the improvements in treatments - but we have got to all follow the rules between now and then to keep people safe,"" he added. My neighbours are breaking the rules - what should I say? Starmer calls for apology over testing 'collapse' New virus rules 'inevitable': The view near No 10 Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he supported the new fines, saying it was important to take action against the few people who were not complying. He also said he would back a future lockdown in order to reinforce the government's message. ""In the end this is not about party politics, this is about getting the nation through this virus,"" he added. The UK government hopes the new fines will be replicatedin Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - which all have powers to set their own coronavirus rules. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Vladimir Putin and Arkady Rotenberg have been friends since childhood One of Vladimir Putin's closest friends may have used Barclays Bank in London to launder money and dodge sanctions, leaked documents suggest. Billionaire Arkady Rotenberg has known the Russian president since childhood. Financial restrictions, orsanctions, were imposed on Mr Rotenberg by the US and the EU in 2014,which means Western banks could face serious consequences for doing business with him. Barclays says it met all its legal and regulatory duties. A leak of confidential files - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"" - reveal how companies believed to be controlled by Mr Rotenberg kept the secret accounts. The documents, known as the FinCEN Files, have been seen by the BBC's Panorama programme. All you need to know about FinCEN documents leak In March 2014 the US hit Russia with economic sanctions following the annexation of Crimea in Ukraine. The Treasury Department designated Mr Rotenberg, 68, and his brother Boris, 63, ""members of the Russian leadership's inner circle"". The pair had sparred and trained in the same judo gym as Putin when they were young. The businessman and Russian president attending judo training in Sochi last year In recent years, Arkady Rotenberg's companies built roads, a gas pipeline and a power station through contracts awarded by the Russian state. The US Treasury said the brothers ""provided support to Putin's pet projects"" and ""made billions of dollars in contracts for Gazprom and the Sochi Winter Olympics awarded to them by Putin"". In 2018, the US added Arkady Rotenberg's son Igor to its list of sanctioned individuals. The aim of the sanctions is to cut off named people from the entire Western financial system. Yet the Rotenbergs appear to have continued moving cash through the UK and US. In 2008, Barclays opened an account for a company called Advantage Alliance. The leaked documents show the company moved Â£60m between 2012 and 2016. Many of the transactions occurred after the Rotenberg brothers had been sanctioned. In July this year, an investigation by the US Senate accused the Rotenbergs of using secretive purchases of expensive art to evade sanctions - one of the companies involved in the scheme was Advantage Alliance. US investigators concluded there was strong evidence that Advantage Alliance was owned by Arkady Rotenberg, and that the company had used its Barclays account in London to buy millions of dollars of art for him. A report,externalnoted how ""secrecy, anonymity, and a lack of regulation create an environment ripe for laundering money and evading sanctions"". Auction houses in the US and UK ""failed to ask basic questions"" about the buyers of the art. Despite the sanctions, Arkady appears to have paid $7.5m to acquire the RenÃ© Magritte painting La Poitrine. In 17 June 2014 a company linked to Arkady sent the cash from Moscow to Alliance's Barclays account in London. The following day Barclays sent the cash to the seller in New York. In April 2016, Barclays began an internal investigation of multiple accounts it suspected of being linked to the Rotenbergs. Six months later, the bank closed Advantage's account after becoming concerned that it was being used to move suspect funds. But the leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs) show that other Barclays accounts with suspected links to the Rotenbergs remained open until 2017. One such company was Ayrton Development Limited. According to the files, Barclays were suspicious of Ayrton's activities and concluded that ""[Arkady] Rotenberg is the true owner of Ayrton"". Barclays did not comment when asked by Panorama about how many accounts it suspects were owned by the Rotenbergs. A spokesperson for Barclays said: ""We believe that we have complied with all our legal and regulatory obligations including in relation to US sanctions."" ""Given the filing of a SAR is not itself evidence of any actual wrongdoing, we would only terminate a client relationship after careful and objective investigation and analysis of the evidence, balancing potential financial crime suspicions with the risk of 'de-banking' an innocent customer."" The Rotenbergs declined to comment. The FinCen Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money around the world. They also show how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and 400 journalists around the world.

"The financial secrets of hundreds of world leaders, politicians and celebrities has been exposed in another huge leak of financial documents. Dubbed the Pandora Papers it features almost 12 million files from companies providing offshore services in tax havens around the world. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) in Washington DC, which has organised the biggest ever global investigation, spanning 117 countries and involving more than 600 journalists. In the UK the investigation has been led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian. The files are the latest in a series of whistleblower-led investigations that have rocked the world of finance in recent years. So let's round up the other major leaks of the past decade. In September 2020 theFinCEN Files exposed the failure of major global banksto stop money laundering and financial crime. They also revealed how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash. The files included more than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs), filed by financial institutions to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Agency, or FinCEN, a part of the US Treasury Department. They also include 17,641 records obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and other sources. They were obtained by BuzzFeed News which shared them with the ICIJ and 400 journalists around the world, including BBC Panorama, which led the investigation in the UK. A huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which revealed the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. Who was named?The documents contained details about investments made bythe Queen's private estate, a tax avoidance schemeused by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boysand showed thatFormula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. They also revealed how Apple protected its low-tax regimeby using the Channel Island of Jerseyand thatPrince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreementswithout disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. Who leaked the data?The BBC does not know the identity of the source. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung and then shared with the ICIJ.Panoramaled research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries. A confidential settlement was later reachedbetween the BBC, the Guardian and Appleby over the reporting of the leaked documents, which Appleby said were taken by hackers. The Guardian and BBC said the reports were in the public interest but did not give more detail about the settlement. Until Pandora this leak was seen as the daddy of them all in data size. If you thought the Wikileaks dump of sensitive diplomatic cables in 2010 was a big deal, this carried 1,500 times more data. SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung's ""brothers"". Despite surnames that sound exactly the same, these two leading lights of the Panama Papers investigation, Frederik Obermaier (L) and Bastian Obermayer, are not related The Panama Papers came about after an anonymous source contacted reporters at German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externalin 2015 and supplied encrypted documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. It sells anonymous offshore companies that help the owners hide their business dealings. Overwhelmed by the scale of the dump, which eventually grew to 2.6 terabytes of data, the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung called in theICIJ,external, which led to the involvement of about 100 other partner news organisations, including the BBC's Panorama. After more than a year of scrutiny, the ICIJ and its partners jointly published the Panama Papers on 3 April 2016,with the database of documents going online a month later. Who was named?Where do we start? A few of the news partners focused on how associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin shuffled cash around the globe. Not that the Russians cared much.The prime ministers of Iceland and Pakistan came to far stickier ends, the former quitting and the latter being thrown out of office by the Supreme Court. Overall the financial dealings of a dozen current and former world leaders, more than 120 politicians and public officials and countless billionaires, celebrities and sports stars were exposed. Who leaked the data?John Doe. Yes, we know. It's not a real name. In US crime series it is mostly used to label anonymous victims butMr (or Ms) Doe's manifesto, released a month after publication, reveals a self-styled revolutionary,external. The real identity is still unknown. Five months after the Panama Papers, the ICIJ published revelations from the Bahamas corporate registry. The 38GB cache revealed the offshore activities of ""prime ministers, ministers, princes and convicted felons"", it said.Former EU competition commissioner Neelie Kroes admitted an ""oversight"" in failing to disclose her interest in an offshore company. This ICIJ investigation,involving hundreds of journalists from 45 countries,external,including BBC Panorama, went public in February 2015. It focused on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse), a subsidiary of the banking giant, and so lifted the lid on dealings in a country where banking secrecy is taken for granted. The leaked files covered accounts up to the year 2007, linked with more than 100,000 individuals and legal entities from more than 200 countries. The ICIJ said the subsidiary had served ""those close to discredited regimes"" and ""clients who had been unfavourably named by the United Nations"". HSBC admitted that the ""compliance culture and standards of due diligence"" at the subsidiary at the time were ""lower than they are today"". Who was named?The ICIJ said HSBC had profited from ""arms dealers, bag men for Third World dictators, traffickers in blood diamonds and other international outlaws"". It also cited those close to the regimes of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, former Tunisian President Ben Ali and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. Leaker in chief HervÃ© Falciani - indicted, held, released Who leaked the data?Actually, we know this one.The ICIJ investigation was based on data originally leaked by the French-Italian software engineer and whistleblower HervÃ© Falciani, though the ICIJ got it later from another source. From 2008 onwards he passed information on HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) to French authorities, who in turn passed them to other relevant governments. Mr Falciani was indicted in Switzerland. He was held in detention in Spain but was later released and now lives in France. Or LuxLeaks for short.Another extensive ICIJ investigation,external, which revealed its findings in November 2014. It centred on how professional services company PricewaterhouseCoopers helped multinational companies gain hundreds of favourable tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The ICIJ said multinationals had saved billions by channelling money through Luxembourg, sometimes at tax rates of less than 1%. One address in Luxembourg was home to more than 1,600 companies, it said. The leak of documents was first exposed in 2012after a joint investigation between Panorama and France2which lifted the lid on the tax agreements of UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline and media company Northern & Shell. Who was named?Pepsi, IKEA, AIG and Deutsche Bank were among those named. A second tranche of leaked documents said the Walt Disney Co and Skype had funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars in profits through Luxembourg subsidiaries. They and the other firms denied any wrongdoing. Jean-Claude Juncker had been PM of Luxembourg when it enacted many of its tax avoidance rules. He had been appointed president of the European Commission just a few days before the leak came out. He said he had not encouraged avoidance. This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker says he is ""politically responsible for what happened"" Eurosceptics went to town and pushed a censure motion against him and his commission. It was rejected. But the EU did investigate, and by 2016 had proposed a yet-to-be realised common tax scheme for the EU. Who leaked the data?Frenchman Antoine Deltour, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers employee, was the main man, saying he had acted in the public interest. Another PwC employee, Raphael Halet, helped him. (L-R) Edouard Perrin, Raphael Halet and Antoine Deltour The pair, along with journalist Edouard Perrin, were all charged in Luxembourg after a PwC complaint.A first verdictwas later revisited, watering down sentences, withDeltour given a six-month suspended jail term which was later quashed. Halet received a small fine and Mr Perrin was acquitted. This was about a tenth of the size of the Panama Papers but was seen as the biggest exposÃ© of international tax fraud ever when the ICIJ and its news partners went public in November 2012 and April 2013. Some 2.5 million files revealed the names of more than 120,000 companies and trusts in hideaways such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cook Islands. BBC Panoramaexposed a flourishing tax evasion industry in the UKin an undercover investigation based on the files. Who was named?The usual suspects. A mix of politicians, government officials and their families, with the Russians notable, but also those in China, Azerbaijan, Canada, Thailand, Mongolia and Pakistan. The Philippines - in the form of the family of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos - get a dishonourable mention. To be fair, the ICIJ does point out that the leaks are not necessarily evidence of illegal actions. Who leaked the data?The ICIJ cites ""two financial service providers, a private bank in Jersey and the Bahamas corporate registry"" as the sources, but says nothing more other than it was ""data obtained"". The Pandora Papers is a leak of almost 12 million documents and files exposing the secret wealth and dealings of world leaders, politicians and billionaires. The data was obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington DC and has led to one of the biggest ever global investigations. More than 600 journalists from 117 countries have looked at the hidden fortunes of some of the most powerful people on the planet. BBC Panorama and the Guardian have led the investigation in the UK.

"The Central Bank of the UAE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment The United Arab Emirates' central bank failed to act on warnings about a local firm which was helping Iran to evade sanctions, the BBC has found. Leaked documents show Dubai-based Gunes General Trading processed $142m (Â£110m) in suspicious transactions through the UAE financial system in 2011 and 2012. The activity was flagged by a British bank, but the firm was able to continue using local financial institutions. In 2016, the US said it was involved in a major sanctions-busting scheme. The Central Bank of the UAE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Gunes General Trading has been wound up within the last two years. The BBC has been unable to reach anyone for comment. The documents - known as the FinCEN Files - were leaked to BuzzFeed News, then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and BBC News Arabic. The US first imposed sanctions on Iran during the 1979-1981 Tehran hostage crisis. Since then, successive US administrations have introduced measures intended to compel Iran to change its behaviour, such as limiting its nuclear programme. One of these measures was to cut off Iranian banks from the global banking system used to make payments in dollars in 2012. Reza Zarrab pleaded guilty in the US to fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges US prosecutors alleged that Gunes General Trading was partof a network controlled by Turkish-Iranian gold trader Reza Zarrab,externalthat conducted hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of transactions on behalf of the Iranian government and other Iranian entities that were barred under US sanctions. Gold trader's US legal saga grips Turkey How renewed US sanctions have hit Iran hard US-Iran sanctions: What do they mean? There were no further concerns raised about the company's activities following Zarrab's arrest in the US. In 2017, Zarrab pleaded guilty to fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges. He is yet to be sentenced. This video can not be played This is how a Dubai firm evaded US sanctions on Iran, despite the UAE central bank being warned Banks based in the UAE rely on big US-based banks to monitor and approve their US dollar payments - a service known as ""correspondent banking"". Correspondent banks are required to alert authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, by filinga document known as a suspicious activity report (SAR),external. Among the FinCEN files is an SAR that shows the New York branch of UK-based Standard Chartered Bank contacted the Central Bank of the UAE in 2012 after noticing hundreds of suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading. The reports did not say any of this activity was linked to sanctions evasion by Iran. SARs are a way to alert government regulators and law enforcement to irregular activity that should be investigated, although they are not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing. The central bank told Standard Chartered that ""the case has been passed on to law enforcement authorities"" and that ""accounts were closed in September 2011"". But Standard Chartered flagged that the company was able to ""continue its suspicious activity"" by ""utilizing various accounts that [it] maintains with other banks"". In fact, the central bank failed to stop Gunes General Trading using two other accounts with two UAE state-owned banks - Rakbank, the national bank of the northern emirate Ras al-Khaimah, and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD). Gunes General Trading was based in the emirate of Dubai The FinCEN files show Gunes General Trading was able to process a further $108m of transactions flagged as suspicious until September 2012, the majority of them through Rakbank. Rakbank said that because of confidentiality it does not comment on specific transactions but it complies with anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations and has strict policies in place to monitor this. NBD did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In April 2013, the US Bank of New York Mellon filed a SAR saying that following a US government inquiry into Gunes General Trading, it believed the company was conducting transactions in a manner designed to evade sanctions against Iran. ""Government authorities must both investigate alleged cases of financial crime and protect the integrity of the financial system,"" said Tom Keatinge, director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi). ""This case brings into question the extent to which the UAE Central Bank took the second part of this responsibility seriously. Criminal actors thrive as a result of failures to share information, and this appears to be a prime example of such a failing."" The FinCen Files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money to be moved around the world. They also show how the UK is often the weak link in the financial system and how London is awash with Russian cash.

"People sit outside restaurants and bars in London's Soho district on Saturday evening Boris Johnson is spending the weekend considering whether to tighten Covid-19 measures in England, after saying the UK was ""now seeing a second wave"". The government is understood to be looking at a ban on households mixing, and reducing opening hours for pubs. At least 13.5 million people, roughly one in five of the UK population, are already facing local restrictions. It came as the PM announcednew fines for those avoiding self-isolation. Former government adviser Prof Neil Ferguson said new measures were needed ""sooner rather than later"". The scientist, whose advice was crucial to the decision to go into lockdown in March, said: ""If we leave it another two to four weeks, we will be back at [infection] levels we were seeing more like mid-March. ""That's clearly going to cause deaths because people will be hospitalised,"" he told the BBC. New virus rules 'inevitable': The view near No 10 Can a 'circuit break' halt the second Covid wave? My neighbours are breaking the rules - what should I say? Mr Johnson only has direct power over restrictions in England. The devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can set their own rules. Widespread growth of the virus has been recorded across the country, with cases doubling every seven to eight days. There were a further 4,422 confirmed UK cases on Saturday and 27 deaths. Friday was the first time the daily total of positive tests had exceeded 4,000 since 8 May. A further350 cases were reported on Saturday in Scotland, the highest daily increase since May,212 new cases in Wales, and222 in Northern Ireland. In Bolton,one returning holidaymaker, who did not self-isolate and instead went on a pub crawl, is being partly blamedfor the town's spike in cases. Meanwhile,governments across Europe have announced new restrictionsto tackle the surge in infections. Speaking on Friday, Mr Johnson said he did not ""want to go into bigger lockdown measures"" but that tighter social distancing rules might be necessary. He added: ""Clearly when you look at what is happening, you have got to wonder whether we need to go further than the rule of six that we brought in on Monday."" The government is understood to beconsidering a short period of tighter rules across England- ""a circuit break"" - which could involve closing hospitality venues. However, schools and workplaces would stay open. This video can not be played Newcastle pub-goers adapt to new coronavirus measures No 10 is also looking at limiting the opening hours of pubs and restaurants across the country, as has alreadyhappened in many areas of north-east England,where pubs had to close at 22:00 BST on Friday. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner called for the government to hold an emergency Cobra meeting, look at the science and improve its communication so ""people can do the right thing"". ""If the government are able to do that, we will back them,"" she told the BBC. She also said it had been ""shocking"" to see how ""monumentally"" the government's test and trace system had failed. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? UK coronavirus cases up by 4,422 on Saturday Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford are also calling for a Cobra meeting. Ms Sturgeon saidthe next few days would be ""critical""to avoid another full-scale lockdown in Scotland. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was extremely concernedby evidence of the accelerating speed with which coronavirus was spreading in the capital. ""We will be considering some of the measures which have already been imposed in other parts of the UK,"" he said. ""I am of the firm view that we should not wait, as happened six months ago, for this virus to again spiral out of control before taking action."" In London on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police said officers had made 32 arrests during an anti-vaccine, anti-lockdown protest in Trafalgar Square. The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the R number - representing the number of people an infected person will pass the virus on to - had risen to between 1.1 and 1.4. Although deaths remain at a very low level, Sage said the rise in the R number ""shows that we are moving to wider spread growth in transmission at a faster rate"". The sharp rise in UK cases over the last two weeks comes amid ongoing problems with the government's test and trace programme, leading to people struggling to access tests. Prof Neil Ferguson said a two-week mini lockdown could help to ""reset"" the virus. ""We have a perfect storm right now, of people - as they've been told to - getting back to normal, schools reopening, a surge in cases and therefore the testing system is under strain,"" he told the BBC. ""Unfortunately we do have to roll the relaxation of measures back a little bit and get contacts down in the population."" Asked if this should mean more restrictions on going abroad, he said the bigger risk was normal everyday interactions, which needed to be ""dialled back a little"". The question is no longer where we are, but where we are heading. Yes, the number of people infected, in hospital with Covid or dying from the disease are all at far lower levels than at the peak. Scientists will quibble about the exact definition of a ""second wave"", but all data points to rising numbers of infections. The government's science advisers say the number is now doubling every week. If those trends continue then infections could go from the estimated 6,000-a-day to more than 100,000 by mid-October. It is that trajectory, which is not written in stone, the government is trying to change. There are questions for politicians, from whether it should do a ""circuit-break"" to improving Test and Trace. But, with evidence suggestingonly one in five people are following the self-isolation rules,externalwhen they get sick, there are also questions for all of us. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) has urged the government to introduce tighter measures in England to avoid another national lockdown, including toughening up the rule of six. It said the rule makes it possible for six households to meet indoors potentially several times in a day and it is suggesting the number of households should be reduced. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? New restrictions for large parts of England's North West, West Yorkshire and the Midlandscome into force on Tuesday. The latest areas to see extra measures put in place include Lancashire (excluding Blackpool), Merseyside and the Cheshire boroughs of Warrington and Halton. Additional restrictions are also being put in place in Wolverhampton, Oadby and Wigston in Leicestershire, and all parts of Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale. In total, nearly 4.7 million people will be affected by the new restrictions, which ban separate households from meeting each other at home or in private gardens.

"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate.

"Holiday camp operator Butlin's has yet to tell 1,000 furloughed workers what their future is when the government's wage subsidy scheme ends next month. A document sent to staff and seen by the BBC suggests employees either take paid holiday if they have any remaining or unpaid leave if not. Butlin's is currently operating at 50% capacity and is heading into the winter months when income falls significantly. It said no decision had been made about workers on the government scheme. The company said: ""Since we reopened Butlin's we've worked hard to bring back as many of our team as possible whilst ensuring we're safe and secure. ""There has been no decision made regarding our team who are still furloughed."" Coronavirus: When will the furlough scheme end? Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' Butlin's - whose workers are known for their distinctive red jackets - has 6,000 employees in total. It is part of the privately-owned Bourne Leisure Group which also operates Haven caravan sites and Warner Leisure Hotels with a total workforce of 15,000. Before the government's Job Retention Scheme was announced, Bourne Leisure warned that 10,000 jobs would be at risk without government help. Bourne Leisure has since secured hundreds of millions of pounds in government support in the form of loans, furlough payments and deferred VAT and business rates since the pandemic struck. Bourne Leisure paid out over Â£60m in 2019 to the three families that own the firm - the Harris, Cook and Allen families - reportedly taking the total paid out in dividends to Â£600m over the last 15 years. A staff member told the BBC ""I can't believe a great British holiday brand, owned by muliti-millionaires wants staff to take unpaid leave after furlough"". It is just one example of the uncertainty facing millions of employees still having a dwindling proportion of their wages paid by the government as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme winds down before its planned withdrawal on 31 October. As the date approaches, businesses will have to consult with staff on how many of them they intend to make redundant. Menzies Aviation which provides services at Luton Airport this week informed 176 workers - half its workforce - that their jobs were at risk when furlough ends. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ruled out extending the furlough scheme However, union sources told the BBC they had been surprised that there had not been more notifications given that companies with over 100 employees, who intend to make over 100 people redundant are obliged to consult with staff 45 days before termination. Unions, business groups and politicians across the political divide have been lobbying the government to find a replacement for the furlough scheme that all acknowledge has saved millions from unemployment. So far the government has ruled out any extension but Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is ""open to creative ideas"". Additional support may yet be forthcoming for regions hit by additional and increasingly widespread lockdown measures. It is thought future schemes will focus more on retraining and creating new jobs rather than returning those still on furlough to the jobs many think they still have but in reality do not.

"Robert Gore won awards for his contributions to science Robert W Gore, who invented Gore-Tex technology while working for his father's company in Maryland, US, has died aged 83. Introduced in 1976, the fabric has protected countless walkers, runners and outdoor enthusiasts from wet weather, but is also found in numerous products. A chemical engineer, Robert Gore became CEO of WL Gore & Associates. He died on Thursday after a long illness, the company confirmed. Gore was born in Utah and received bachelor's and advanced degrees from the University of Delaware and the University of Minnesota. He joined WL Gore & Associates, which had been founded in 1958 by his father Bill and his mother Vieve Gore. Why are so few women inventors named on patents? The battle to break plastic's bonds Plastic pollution: Washed clothing's synthetic mountain of 'fluff' In a company lab in 1969 he discovered a new form of polymer, a substance made of large molecules that repeat to form long chains. His father asked him to research a new way to manufacturer plumber's tape. Robert Gore discovered that by yanking a material called PTFE, the polymer stretched by 1,000% to create a microporous structure. Robert Gore discovered that PTFE could be expanded through rapid stretching This material created a fabric with billions of pores smaller than water droplets, forming a waterproof but breathable surface - or Gore-Tex. ""It was truly a pivot point in this company's history,"" Greg Hannon, WL Gore & Associates' chief technology officer,told Delaware Online newspaper last year.,external. Among its varied applications, Gore-Tex is used in medical devices including heart patches, guitar strings, space suits, and vacuum bags. WL Gore & Associates became a billion-dollar company in 1996 during Gore's presidency. ""We plan to leave a legacy to society and to future generations"" including ""infants with surgically reconstructed hearts that live because of our medical products,"" Gore said on the occasion. In 2000 he stepped down as president of WL Gore & Associates. During his career he received several awards for his contributions to science including from the Society of Plastics Engineers.

"UK ministers say the law will allow them to replace existing EU funding for Wales Talk of UK ministers spending more in Wales is ""delusional"", Labour's shadow Welsh secretary Nia Griffith has said. MPs have been debating a new draft law that wouldgive UK ministers the power to spend on areas otherwise devolved. Ms Griffith said it was ""laughable to see Tory MPs talk about spending"" and raised concerns this would lead to Welsh Government budget cuts in future. But Welsh Secretary Simon Hart insisted these powers would mean ""more money coming into Wales"". Q&A: Could UK government build an M4 relief road? Welsh Tory quits frontbench over PM's union stance The Internal Market Bill would transfer powers from the EU to the UK government to spend on areas such as economic development, infrastructure and sport. The Welsh Government has accused its UK counterpart of ""stealing powers"" from devolved governments. But UK ministers said the law would allow them to replace existing EU funding programmes. This aspect of the bill has divided Welsh MPs in the House of Commons where it has been debated this week. Labour MP Alex Davies-Jones called it a ""weak attempt at ripping up the devolution settlement"", but Conservative MP Stephen Crabb said the UK government using these powers to spend in all parts of the United Kingdom ""certainly isn't a controversial thing, if you're a unionist"". Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake said UK ministers had ""failed to make the most of the powers they already have"" in Wales. Nia Griffith says the move would allow UK ministers to ""interfere"""" in something ""clearly devolved"" Ms Griffith told BBC Politics Wales there were ""a fair few projects, like electrification in Wales, where we just haven't seen the Tories get on and spend the money"" as previously promised. ""If you look at the devolved budget, what has actually happened over the last 10 years is the Tories have cut and cut and cut. ""This is absolutely delusional. It's laughable to see Tory MPs talking about spending when we know that's actually not what they've been doing. ""What this bill would actually allow would be for UK government ministers to interfere in something that is clearly devolved. ""It would allow the UK government to decide if they wanted to spend money on something and then, of course, what they'd turn around and do is say 'we've done that bit of spending, so we're going to take that out of the budget'. ""What would be left for us to choose how to spend in Wales would be considerably less. ""It'll be utter chaos not knowing from one year to the next what money is going to be available. Councils need to plan, people need to know what budgets are."" Simon Hart said Westminster wanted to be ""more precise about targeting areas of the greatest need"" Asked whether Labour would want to have these spending powers if they were in power in Westminster, Ms Griffith said: ""What we'd be talking about is respecting the devolution settlement, discussing with the Welsh Government what would be the best way forward on post-EU funding, how that would be best managed, so we'd come together about how to work it."" Secretary of States for Wales Mr Hart said the new UK government powers would mean more money for Wales. ""I think it's really important that in this process we of course account for local feelings, local need, local areas which need perhaps a little more additional helping hand in terms of investment,"" he said. ""That's where local authorities and local stakeholders come into play. What we shouldn't be doing is saying 'we know best, we're just going to put investment where we think is best' - we need to be guided by local opinion."" Details of what funds will replace EU funding and how they will be allocated have not been announced yet - but Mr Hart said areas of ""greatest need"" would be taken into account. ""We want to be more precise about targeting areas of the greatest need - that's very much a part of what we want to do here. I don't think there will be any danger around that."" At the bill's second reading in Parliament, Labour MPs voted against it. When asked whether Labour would be voting for the bill at itsthird reading,external, Ms Griffith said: ""There are fundamental problems with the bill in that it does break international law and it does roll back on the devolution settlement. ""I don't see much hope of the government accepting the sorts of amendments which would actually change that. We would need substantial change to be able to support the bill.""

Much attention has been focused on the fact that the legislation could override key elements of UK ministers' Brexit deal with Brussels,in breach of international law. In addition, the legislation will give ministers in Whitehall powers to spend money to replace EU funding programmes on areas that would otherwise be devolved to the Welsh Government. The new spending powers include infrastructure, economic development, culture, sport, and support for educational, training and exchange opportunities. A senior UK government cabinet minister insisted the powers would ""drive our economic recovery from Covid-19 and support businesses and communities right across the UK"". Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said: ""These new spending powers will mean that these decisions will now be made in the UK, focus on UK priorities and be accountable to the UK Parliament and people of the UK."" Michael Gove said the powers would ""drive our economic recovery from Covid-19"" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it was ""vital"" that seamless trade continued between the four nations, and that ""investment must continue to flow unhindered"". But the Welsh Government Minister for European Transition Jeremy Miles said the powers would ""sacrifice the future of the union by stealing powers from devolved administrations."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the bill ""provides ammunition to those people who would favour the breakup of the United Kingdom"". ""I'm in favour of a UK Common Market and I'm in favour of a UK-wide state aid regime, but the proposals in the white paper are absolutely not the right way to go about it,"" he told Sky News. Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: ""This bill is the single biggest assault on devolution since its creation."" Speaking to the BBC later on Wednesday, Mr Hart said he found it ""pretty strange"" that Labour Welsh ministers and Plaid Cymru objected to UK government plans to spend money in Wales. ""Seems to me they're more anxious about protecting their little political clique in Cardiff than they are actually doing something about economies we tried to recover from Covid and move on from Brexit,"" he said.

"The cancelled M4 plans have been a bone of contention between UK and Welsh ministers The UK government has published plans for a new law to give it more powers to spend in Wales. Under thedraft legislation,externalpowers currently resting at EU level would be transferred to UK ministers, giving them the ability to spend on economic development and infrastructure, for example. This has sparked a political row, with Welsh ministers accusing their UK counterparts of ""stealing powers"" from them. UK ministers say they are simply using the legislation to replace current EU funding programmes. The move also raises some questions: Does this mean the UK government could build the M4 relief road? UK ministers have long been in favour of building a new road to cut congestion on the motorway south of Newport, and were frustrated whenFirst Minister Mark Drakeford cancelled the scheme last yearbecause of its Â£1.6bn cost and its impact on the environment. It is tempting to believe this bill would give the UK government the ability to send in the bulldozers and build the 14-mile relief road, but it's not that simple. A planning inspector said the case for a relief road was ""compelling"" Yes, UK ministers would be giving themselves infrastructure powers - but they would still also need the support of Welsh Government which controls big road projects to build the motorway. Under the current administration in Cardiff that would be unlikely. It would, however, give them the power to fund it - the same goes for other large infrastructure projects. As most planning in Wales is devolved, it operates nationally through the Welsh Government and locally through councils. How much does the UK government say its wants to spend in Wales? This is still unclear - the UK government has not given a figure. This bill does not set out exactly what UK government funds will replace EU ones - we're told that's coming in the autumn. Previously, Wales had been eligible for Â£375m a year from EU funds. The Conservatives manifesto at the 2019 general election committed them to matching EU funds for each of the four nations ""at a minimum"". Ultimate political authority still resides with the UK Parliament at Westminster Does this mean the Welsh Government can't spend on things such as culture, sport and economic development anymore? No - it still will be able to. But the reason Welsh ministers have accused the UK government of ""stealing powers"" is because the legislation would also give the UK government the power to spend on these areas, which it hasn't been able to since devolution in 1999. The Welsh Government had also managed the EU cash the bill is replacing, in conjunction with the European Union. UK ministers, however, claim they aren't taking any powers away but are just replacing EU programmes. Does that mean the Welsh Government will get less money from the UK government? A spokesperson for No.10 said UK government spending in these areas wouldn't come from Wales' block grant. That's the money the Welsh Government gets from the UK Treasury to spend on devolved areas including health, education and economic development. But the spokesperson said spending powers would be ""discussed"" at the UK government's next spending review. Most of the money Welsh ministers have to spend comes from the UK Treasury Can the Welsh Government stop this going ahead? This proposed law has faced opposition from devolved governments. The UK Parliament is sovereign - which means Westminster can pass laws for all parts of the UK, including if it involves things usually controlled from Cardiff or Edinburgh. But it the UK Parliament will not normally make laws in this way without the consent of the Welsh and Scottish parliaments, and Northern Ireland Assembly. Yet this convention, known as the Sewel convention, isn't legally binding - and the UK government has ignored it occasionally in the past. What happens next? A bill is a draft law. It doesn't become law until it's been voted through the House of Commons with a majority. It will go through a number of debates - and possibly be amended - before it gets to its final stage to become law. However, the current UK government has a large majority in the House of Commons - meaning unless some of their own MPs rebel it is easier for them to pass new laws.

"David Melding has been a Cardiff Bay politician since Welsh devolution in 1999 A long-serving Welsh Conservative politician has quit his party's frontbench in the Senedd. David Melding said recent decisions by Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""done nothing to lessen"" his anxieties about the future of the United Kingdom. He had been the Welsh Conservatives' spokesman on culture and communications, and is due to step down as a Member of the Senedd (MS) in May. Tory Senedd leader Paul Davies said he was sorry to lose Mr Melding. Mr Melding, who has prepresented South Wales Central since the start of devolution in 1999, posted his resignation letter to Mr Davies in a tweet. He said he had ""misgivings for some time about aspects of the UK government's approach to developing a new relationship with the EU and aligning devolved governance with the demands of an internal market in the UK"". New Welsh spending powers set to go to UK PM defends planned Brexit deal changes Concern over positive tests in Merthyr and RCT Mr Melding said Wednesday's publication of theInternal Market Billhad done ""nothing to lessen my anxieties about the dangers facing our 313 year old union, indeed they have been gravely aggravated by the decisions made in the last few days by our prime minister"". The MS had been a spokesman on legal matters within the Tory group. ""It is clearly not feasible for me to continue in my post of shadow counsel general while holding such reservations,"" Mr Melding said. He pledged to support Mr Davies from the backbenches. The UK government has said the Internal Market Bill will ensure businesses in the four nations of the country can trade with each other freely, when the current post-Brexit transition phase ends. It will require the four governments of the UK to recognise standards made elsewhere. But it has been dubbed a threat to the union of the United Kingdom by the Welsh Government, which has claimed the proposals would hamper ministers from setting their own standards for goods. Ministers in Wales are also unhappy with a section of the bill which gives the UK government more powers to spend in Wales, accusing UK ministers of ""stealing powers"". The UK government was criticised after a minister admitted the bill would alsobreach international lawover the Brexit withdrawal deal. In response UK ministers say it will give them the power to ""drive our economic recovery from Covid-19"". Mr Davies said: ""I'm sorry to lose David from my shadow cabinet, he has been a fantastic ambassador for the Welsh Conservatives over 20 years that he has been a member of the Welsh Parliament. ""I'm grateful that he will continue to support me from the backbenches.""

"As climate change becomes a focus of the US election, energy companies stand accused of trying to downplay their contribution to global warming. In June, Minnesota's Attorney General sued ExxonMobil, among others, for launching a ""campaign of deception"" which deliberately tried to undermine the science supporting global warming. So what's behind these claims? And what links them to how the tobacco industry tried to dismiss the harms of smoking decades earlier? To understand what's happening today, we need to go back nearly 40 years. Marty Hoffert leaned closer to his computer screen. He couldn't quite believe what he was seeing. It was 1981, and he was working in an area of science considered niche. ""We were just a group of geeks with some great computers,"" he says now, recalling that moment. But his findings were alarming. ""I created a model that showed the Earth would be warming very significantly. And the warming would introduce climatic changes that would be unprecedented in human history. That blew my mind."" A climate change protester outside the New York State Supreme Court during the ExxonMobil trial in October, 2019 Marty Hoffert was one of the first scientists to create a model which predicted the effects of man-made climate change. And he did so while working for Exxon, one of the world's largest oil companies, which would later merge with another, Mobil. At the time Exxon was spending millions of dollars on ground-breaking research. It wanted to lead the charge as scientists grappled with the emerging understanding that the warming planet could cause the climate to change in ways that could make life pretty difficult for humans. Hoffert shared his predictions with his managers, showing them what might happen if we continued burning fossil fuels in our cars, trucks and planes. Martin Hoffert But he noticed a clash between Exxon's own findings, and public statements made by company bosses, such as the then chief executive Lee Raymond, who said that ""currently, the scientific evidence is inconclusive as to whether human activities are having a significant effect on the global climate"". ""They were saying things that were contradicting their own world-class research groups,"" said Hoffert. Angry, he left Exxon, and went on to become a leading academic in the field. ""What they did was immoral. They spread doubt about the dangers of climate change when their own researchers were confirming how serious a threat it was."" So what changed? The record-breaking hot summer of 1988 was key. Big news in America, it gave extra weight to warnings from Nasa scientist Dr Jim Hansen that ""the greenhouse effect has been detected, and is changing our climate now"". Political leaders took notice. Then UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher acknowledged the great new global threat: ""The environmental challenge which confronts the whole world demands an equivalent response from the whole world."" In 1989, Exxon's strategy chief Duane Levine drew up a confidential presentation for the company's board, one of thousands of documents in the company's archive which were later donated to The University of Texas at Austin. Levine's presentation is an important document, often cited by researchers investigating Exxon's record on climate change science. ""We're starting to hear the inevitable call for action,"" it said, which risked what it called ""irreversible and costly draconian steps"". ""More rational responses will require efforts to extend the science and increase emphasis on costs and political realities."" How they made us doubt everythinginvestigates how some of the world's most powerful interests made us doubt the connection between smoking and cancer, and how the same tactics were used to make us doubt climate change. Listen to the podcast from BBC Radio 4here Kert Davies has scoured through Exxon's archive. He used to work as a research director at the environmental pressure group Greenpeace, where he looked into corporate opposition to climate change. This inspired him to set up The Climate Investigations Centre. He explains why this Exxon presentation mattered: ""They are worried the public will take this on, and enact radical changes in the way we use energy and affect their business, that's the bottom line."" He says this fear can also be seen in another document from the archive that sets out the so-called ""Exxon position"", which was to ""emphasise the uncertainty"" regarding climate change. Researchers argue this was just the start of a decades-long campaign to shape public opinion and to spread doubt about climate change. In June 2020, the General Attorney of Minnesota Keith Ellison sued ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute (API) and Koch Industries for misleading the public over climate change. The lawsuit claims that ""previously unknown internal documents confirm that the defendant well understood the devastating effects that their products would cause to the climate"". It says that despite this knowledge, the industry ""engaged in a public-relations campaign that was not only false, but also highly effective,"" which served to ""deliberately [undermine] the science"" of climate change. The accusations against Exxon and others - which the company has called ""baseless and without merit"" - build on years of painstaking research by people like Kert Davies and Naomi Oreskes, professor of the history of science at Harvard University and co-author of Merchants of Doubt. Naomi Oreskes ""Rather than accept the scientific evidence, they made the decision to fight the facts,"" she said. But this isn't just about Exxon's past actions. In the same year as the Levine presentation, 1989, many energy companies and fossil fuel dependent industries came together to form the Global Climate Coalition, which aggressively lobbied US politicians and media. Then in 1991, the trade body that represents electrical companies in the US, the Edison Electric Institute, created a campaign called the Information Council for the Environment (ICE) which aimed to ""Reposition global warming as theory (not fact)"". Some details of the campaign were leaked to the New York Times. ""They ran advertising campaigns designed to undermine public support, cherry picking the data to say, 'Well if the world is warming up, why is Kentucky getting colder?' They asked rhetorical questions designed to create confusion, to create doubt,"" argued Naomi Oreskes. The ICE campaign identified two groups which would be most susceptible to its messaging. The first was ""older, lesser educated males from larger households who are not typically information seekers"". The second group was ""younger, low-income women,"" who could be targeted with bespoke adverts which would liken those who talked about climate change to a hysterical doom-saying cartoon chicken. The Edison Electric Institute didn't respond to questions about ICE, but told the BBC that its members are ""leading a clean energy transformation, and are united in their commitment to get the energy they provide as clean as they can, as fast as they can"". But back in the 1990 there were many campaigns like this. ""Unless 'climate change' becomes a non-issue,"" says another, leaked to the New York Times in 1997, ""there may be no moment when we can declare victory"". To achieve victory, the industry planned to ""identify, recruit and train a team of five independent scientists to participate in media outreach"". This important tactic assumed the public would be suspicious if oil industry executives dismissed climate change, but might trust the views of seemingly independent scientists. These would be put forward to take part in debates on TV, potentially confusing a general audience who would see opposing scientists in white coats arguing about complex technical details without knowing who to believe. The problem was, sometimes these ""white coats"" weren't truly independent. Some climate sceptic researchers were taking money from the oil industry. Drexel University emeritus professor Bob Brulle studied the funding for the climate change ""counter movement"". He identified 91 institutions which he says either denied or downplayed the risks of climate change, including the Cato Institute and the now-defunct George C Marshall Institute. He found that between 2003 and 2007, ExxonMobil gave $7.2m (Â£5.6m) to such bodies, while between 2008 and 2010, the American Petroleum Institute trade body (API) donated just under $4m (Â£3m). In its 2007 Corporate Citizenship Report, ExxonMobil said it would stop funding such groups in 2008. Of course many researchers would argue such money didn't influence their climate contrarian work. It seems some may have been motivated by something else. Most of the organisations opposing or denying climate change science were right-wing think tanks, who tended to be passionately anti-regulation. These groups made convenient allies for the oil industry, as they would argue against action on climate change on ideological grounds. Jerry Taylor Jerry Taylor spent 23 years with the Cato Institute - one of those right wing think tanks - latterly as vice president. Before he left in 2014, he would regularly appear on TV and radio, insisting that the science of climate change was uncertain and there was no need to act. Now, he realises his arguments were based on a misinterpretation of the science, and he regrets the impact he's had on the debate. ""For 25 years, climate sceptics like me made it a core matter of ideological identity that if you believe in climate change, then you are by definition a socialist. That is what climate sceptics have done."" The BBC asked the Cato Institute about its work on climate change, but it did not respond. This ideological divide has had far-reaching consequences. Polls conducted in May 2020 showed that just 22% of Americans who vote Republican believed climate change is man-made, compared with 72% of Democrats. Unfortunately many of the ""expert scientists"" quoted by journalists to try to offer balance in their coverage of climate change were - like Jerry Taylor - making arguments based on their beliefs rather than relevant research. ""Usually these people have some scientific credentials, but they're not actually experts in climate science,"" says Harvard historian Naomi Oreskes. She began digging into the background of leading climate sceptics, including Fred Seitz, a nuclear physicist and former president of the US National Academy of Sciences. She found he was deeply anti-communist, believing any government intervention in the marketplace ""would put us on the slippery slope to socialism"". She also discovered that he had been active in the debates around smoking in the 1980s. ""That was a Eureka moment. We realised this was not a scientific debate. A person with expertise about climate change would in no way be an expert about oncology or public health or cardiovascular disease, or any of the key issues associated with tobacco. ""The fact that the same people were arguing in both cases was a clue that something fishy was going on. That's what led us to discover this pattern of disinformation that gets systemically used again and again."" Naomi Oreskes spent years going through the tobacco archive at the University of California at San Francisco. It contains more than 14 million documents that were made available thanks to litigation against US tobacco firms. A strikingly familiar story emerged. Decades before the energy industry tried to undermine the case for climate change, tobacco companies had used the same techniques to challenge the emerging links between smoking and lung cancer in the 1950s. Plaza Hotel (Right), Central Park, New York The story began at Christmas 1953. In New York's luxurious Plaza Hotel, the heads of the tobacco companies met to discuss a new threat to their business model. Details of the night's anxious conversations were recorded in a document written by public relations guru John Hill from Hill and Knowlton. Widely read mass-market magazines like Readers Digest and Time Life had begun publishing articles about the association between smoking and lung cancer. And researchers like those who had found that lab mice painted with cigarette tar got cancer were attracting increasing attention. As John Hill wrote in the 1953 document, ""salesmen in the industry are frantically alarmed, and the decline in tobacco stocks on the stock exchange market has caused grave concern"". Hill recommended fighting science with science. ""We do not believe the industry should indulge in any flashy or spectacular ballyhoo. There is no public relations [medicine] known to us at least, which will cure the ills of the industry."" As a later document by tobacco company Brown and Williamson summarised the approach: ""Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the minds of the general public."" Naomi Oreskes says this understanding of the power of doubt is vital. ""They realise they can't win this battle by making a false claim that sooner or later would be exposed. But if they can create doubt, that would be sufficient - because if people are confused about the issue, there's a good chance they'll just keep smoking."" Hill advised setting up the ""Tobacco Industry Research Committee"" to promote ""the existence of weighty scientific views which hold there is no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer"". As in the climate change debate decades later, ""Project Whitecoat"" would pit scientist against scientist. According to Oreskes, the project targeted those who were already doing research into other causes of cancer or lung conditions - such as asbestos - which the tobacco industry could fund. ""The purpose of these programmes was not to advance scientific understanding, it was to create enough confusion that the American people would doubt the existing scientific evidence."" Journalists were one of the tobacco industry's main targets. The Tobacco Industry Research Committee held meetings in its offices in the Empire State Building for major newspaper editors. It even persuaded one of the most famous broadcast journalists of the time, Edward R Murrow, to interview its experts. The eventual edition of Murrow's celebrated television programme ""See It Now"" - broadcast in 1955 -shows Project Whitecoat in action, with tobacco industry funded scientists set against independent researchers. But as would happen later with climate change, it was difficult for the audience at home to form an opinion when opposing scientists contradicted each other. Even Murrow ended up on the fence. ""We have no credentials for reaching conclusions on this subject,"" he said. If doubt was the industry's true product, then it appeared to be a roaring success. For decades, none of the legal challenges launched against the tobacco companies themselves succeeded. This was partly due to the effectiveness of Project Whitecoat, as an internal memo from tobacco firm RJ Reynolds in May 1979 concludes: ""Due to favourable scientific testimony, no plaintiff has ever collected a penny from any tobacco company in lawsuits claiming that smoking causes lung cancer or cardiovascular illness - even though 117 such cases have been brought since 1954."" But pressure on the tobacco companies continued to mount. In 1997, the industry paid $350m (Â£272m) to settle a class action brought by flight attendants who had developed lung cancer and other illnesses which they argued were caused by second-hand cigarette smoke from passengers. This settlement paved the way to a landmark ruling in 2006, when Judge Gladys Kessler found US tobacco companies guilty of fraudulently misrepresenting the health risks associated with smoking. Judge Kessler detailed how the industry ""marketed and sold their lethal products with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success, and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs"". Flight attendant Norma Broin was the lead plaintiff in the passive smoking class action after developing lung cancer, despite being a non-smoker The tobacco companies may have eventually lost their battle to hide the harms of smoking, but the blueprint drawn up by John Hill and his colleagues proved to be very effective. ""What he wrote is the same memo we have seen in multiple industries subsequently,"" says David Michaels, professor of public health at George Washington University, and author of The Triumph of Doubt, which details how the pesticides, plastics and sugar industries have also used these tactics. ""We called it 'the tobacco playbook', because the tobacco industry was so successful. ""They made a product that killed millions of people across the world, and the science has been very strong [about that] for many years, but through this campaign to manufacture uncertainty, they were able to delay first, formal recognition of the terrible impact of tobacco, and then delay regulation and defeat litigation for decades, with obviously terrible consequences."" We asked Hill and Knowlton about its work for the tobacco companies, but it did not respond. In a statement, ExxonMobil told the BBC that ""allegations about the company's climate research are inaccurate and deliberately misleading"". ""For more than 40 years, we have supported development of climate science in partnership with governments and academic institutions. That work continues today in an open and transparent way. ""Deliberately cherry-picked statements attributed to a small number of employees wrongly suggest definitive conclusions were reached decades ago."" ExxonMobil added that it recently won the court case brought by the New York Attorney General which had accused the company of fraudulently accounting for the costs of climate change regulation. But academics like David Michaels fear the use of uncertainty in the past to confuse the public and undermine science has contributed to a dangerous erosion of trust in facts and experts across the globe today, far beyond climate science or the dangers of tobacco. He cites public attitudes to modern issues like the safety of 5G, vaccinations - and coronavirus. ""By cynically manipulating and distorting scientific evidence, the manufacturers of doubt have seeded in much of the public a cynicism about science, making it far more difficult to convince people that science provides useful - in some cases, vitally important - information. ""There is no question that this distrust of science and scientists is making it more difficult to stem the coronavirus pandemic."" It seems the legacy of ""the tobacco playbook"" lives on.

"Alexander III reigned 1249-86 and was from the House of Dunkeld - the same Scottish royal family that included Macbeth, who reigned 1040-57 A Scottish medieval coin turned into jewellery has been declared treasure after being ""lost"" and then found hundreds of miles away in England. The silver coin featuring the head of Alexander III of Scotland dates from 1280-6 and was discovered in Long Stratton, Norfolk in August 2019. The penny was worn as either a pendant or brooch by someone who was religious, coin expert Dr Adrian Marsden said. He added that the coin ""had travelled some way"". Dr Marsden, a numismatist at Norfolk Historic Environment Service, said it ""must have been eventually lost"" in the county until it was rediscovered last year by a metal detectorist in a field. The exact location of the find is not being disclosed. Anglo-Saxon gold pendant found in Norfolk declared treasure Medieval matrix and Tudor ring belonged to 'higher status' people Man finds 14th Century treasure in garage The historian said the item would have been worn as a religious symbol as the side with the cross was the one intended for display, rather than the head side of the coin. ""There is also settings for gems [which were no longer present] which represent the five wounds of Christ, so it is symbolic and adds to the religious dimension,"" he said. Under theTreasure Act 1996,external, finders of potential treasure in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are legally obliged to notify their local coroner An inquest then determines whether the finds constitute treasure The act contains a number of definitions of ""treasure"", including prehistoric objects, coins that contain gold or silver and are at least 300 years old, or more recent valuable objects that have been deliberately hidden If the find is declared treasure, the finder must offer it for sale to a museum at a price set by the British Museum's Treasure Valuation Committee A reward is then offered to the finders and other relevant parties Dr Marsden believed the owner ""would have been relatively well-off"" as the penny was the equivalent of half a day's wage at the time. ""It would have been a bit of a luxury and the owner would have some social status,"" he said. ""The coin was probably equivalent to Â£20 in today's money."" The Norwich Castle Museum hopes to acquire the coin and add it to a collection of similar items. It was declared treasure at an inquest at Norfolk Coroner's Court earlier this month.

"This video can not be played Covid-19: Self-isolating fines 'under discussion' in Scotland Large fines penalising those who fail to self isolate are ""under discussion"" in Scotland, according to the Scottish health secretary. Jeane Freeman told Politics Scotland the issue would be ""under discussion"" this weekend, despite showing some resistance to the idea. She said the policy risked ""punishing"" those who faced financial difficulties. The measure will be introduced in England from 28 September with fines of up to Â£10,000. The new legal duty requires people to self-isolate if they test positive for coronavirus, or are traced as a close contact. On Sunday, 245 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in Scotland, which amounts to 5.4% of those tested. No new deaths were reported and of the 63 people in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-19, nine were in intensive care. Hancock: Follow Covid rules or they will get tougher Police Scotland use emergency powers 62,000 times Sturgeon issues warning over tougher Covid rules By comparison, 350 new cases were reported in Scotland on Saturday - the highest daily increase since May. Ms Freeman said there was evidence to show the steep rise in cases had been ""blunted"" following additional measures in some local authorities in the west - but said there was still ""real concern"". When asked whether the Scottish government would consider imposing similar fines in place in England, the health secretary said the issue needed to be examined ""the other way round"". ""I think what you need to do is look at what are the obstacles in somebody's way who wants to self isolate, wants to do the right thing but may have difficulties in doing so. ""One of those will be financial difficulties, so there needs to be an extension to ensure that we can offer financial support before you start talking about punishing people for not doing something that they want to do."" She added that she wanted to avoid ""penalising"" those on ""fragile, zero-hour contracts"" and low wages. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has called on the Scottish government to ""learn lessons"" from the March lockdown and safeguard ""anxious"" workers. He said: ""With furlough due to end next month, Nicola Sturgeon must stop the blame game with the UK government and ensure that Scottish workers have the protections they need with a bespoke scheme that recognises the specific requirements of Scotland's economy."" Ms Freeman said there were already spot fines available to Police Scotland if someone ""knowingly and deliberately"" broke the rules. In August, figures were revealed showing that people living in the most deprived areas were up to12 times more likely to be given finesfor flouting Covid restrictions. Ms Freeman said: ""We will look at all the measures that are there to support people to do what we're asking and any measures we think are necessary to deal with those who willingly and knowingly flout those guidelines."" She added that the Scottish government was waiting to hear whether Boris Johnson would answer its call for a four-nation Cobra meeting to discuss further measures. However she said if this did not go ahead, the Scottish government would ""take decisions at pace that are right for Scotland"". Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross, who has previously taken a stand against Boris Johnson byresigning over the actions of Dominic Cummings, said he wanted to see the Scottish and UK governments work together on issues such as the furlough scheme. He added that several industries were ""still struggling"" and he would be speaking to the chancellor to see what could be done for those industries.

"President Donald Trump had threatened to ban the app in the US unless a satisfactory deal was struck US President Donald Trump has expressed his approval of a deal that would allow Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok to continue operating in the US. Mr Trump told reporters he had given his ""blessing"" to a partnership between TikTok and US firms Oracle and Walmart. The president had ordered the app to be banned in the US, citing national security concerns. US security officials fear data collected by TikTok's owner may be handed to the Chinese government. TikTok's owner, ByteDance, has denied accusations that it is controlled by or shares data with China's ruling Communist Party. However, the TikTok deal does not affect a ban on the Chinese-owned messaging and payments app WeChat, which will no longer be available in US app stores from Sunday night. Tencent, the conglomerate that owns WeChat, has described the US ban as ""unfortunate"". On Saturday, Mr Trump said the deal would ensure the data of the estimated 100 million Americans who use the app was safe, telling reporters: ""The security will be 100%."" ""I have given the deal my blessing,"" Mr Trump said as he left the White House ahead of an election rally in North Carolina. ""I approve the deal in concept."" Is the US about to split the internet? What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat TikTok and ByteDance both welcomed President Trump's approval of a proposed deal, which would still need to be signed off by the Chinese government. TikTok said the deal would ensure US national security requirements were fully satisfied, while ByteDance said it was working to reach an agreement that was ""in line with US and Chinese law"" as soon as possible. Vanessa Pappas, TikTok interim chief executive, said in a video posted on Saturday that the app was ""here to stay"" in the US. Allow Twitter content?

President Trump's support for the deal comes days after his administration said it would bar people in the US from downloading TikTok through any app store from Sunday. However, the US Commerce Department said it had now delayed this deadline for a week until 27 September in the ""light of recent positive developments"". The row over TikTok comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over a number of issues, including trade disputes, protests in Hong Kong and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The deal would see the establishment of a new company, dubbed TikTok Global. That company would be headquartered in the US, possibly in the state of Texas, with a majority of American directors, a US chief executive and a security expert on the board. Oracle and Walmart are expected to take significant stakes in the company, and ByteDance has agreed to security safeguards on the data of US users. TikTok's data would be stored by Oracle, which would have the right to inspect its source code. This video can not be played What's going on with TikTok? President Trump said the new TikTok company will be ""totally controlled by Oracle and Walmart"". But in a joint statement on Saturday, Oracle and Walmart said they were together investing to acquire 20% of the newly formed TikTok Global business. Of that 20% stake, Oracle will take 12.5%, while Walmart will take 7.5%, reports say. The deal will see TikTok Global become majority-owned by American investors, but Bytedance will retain a share of the US operation. This falls somewhat short of President Trump's demand for an outright sale of TikTok's US arm to an American company. That was the intention of an executive order Mr Trump signed in August. However, Mr Trump did say the deal would provide new jobs and tax revenue for the country. In their statement, Oracle and Walmart said TikTok Global would create more than 25,000 new jobs and pay more than $5bn (Â£3.8bn) in tax in the US. This is not the deal that Donald Trump had envisioned - he had wanted the US arm of the company to be sold. That's not quite what's happening here. This is more like a joint venture between three companies. Oracle's role is particularly important, acting as a ""trusted partner"" safeguarding the data of users. But in the proposed deal TikTok's Chinese owner Bytedance would still own much of the new entity. So what made Trump decide to approve it? Well, he appears now to be satisfied that the security arrangements proposed. But it's more complex than that. The deal also proposes a $5bn education fund - and will reportedly create 25,000 US jobs. This is not a done deal though, the Chinese government still has to approve it - and there's no guarantee that will happen. TikTok is a video-sharing app. Users can post up to a minute of video and have access to a vast database of songs and filters. They use the app to share 15-second videos that often involve lip-synching to songs, comedy routines and unusual editing tricks. The app collects a huge amount of user data - including what videos people watch and comment on, location data, phone model and even how people type. But much of this data collection is similar to other social networks like Facebook. The app is reported to have around 800 million active monthly users worldwide, most of whom are in the US and India. India has already blocked TikTok as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and telecom equipment-maker ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok. Teen's TikTok post about China camps goes viral How much data does TikTok collect?

"Sir Keir Starmer says Labour and the unions must ""stand together"" Sir Keir Starmer has been warned against ""watering down"" the ""radical policies"" he promised during his campaign to become Labour leader. The Fire Brigades Union told the BBC he must not ""cede any ground"" to the Conservatives and fight for ""root-and-branch"" reform of society. General Secretary Matt Wrack added that he had not ""heard Keir make that case"" since becoming Labour leader in April. Sir Keir has urged the party and unions to ""stand together like never before"". Labour's four-day annual conference, the first under his leadership, began on Saturday. Renamed Labour Connected, it is taking place online and will not feature votes, but the party's major figures will still give speeches and take part in discussions. A guide to party conferences in a Covid world Labour aims to build trust with new slogan Young people and home workers 'being scapegoated' In his campaign to become leader,Sir Keir set out 10 pledges.,external Among these was putting a ""Green New Deal at the heart of everything we do"", including a Clean Air Act to tackle pollution at a local level, and demanding ""international action"" on ""climate rights"". Sir Keir also pledged to work ""shoulder-to-shoulder with trade unions to stand up for working people, tackle insecure work and low pay"". He said a Labour government under him would repeal the Conservatives' 2016 Trade Union Act, which makes industrial action more difficult. The FBU wants Sir Keir Starmer to follow through on plans to reverse curbs on industrial action Mr Wrack, whose FBU is one of the more left-leaning of the 12 Labour-affiliated trade unions, said: ""Our present crisis has only made the case for that platform more urgent, but we haven't yet heard Keir make that case in opposition."" He said the Labour leader should promote the Socialist Green New Deal, agreed at last year's party conference. It calls for net-zero carbon emissions by 2030, bringing the energy sector into public ownership and the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in the environment sector, on union-negotiated rates of pay. Mr Wrack said: ""We look forward to seeing Keir making [the Socialist Green New deal] his own. But that can't mean any watering down of the radical policies we fought for. ""We don't want to see Labour cede any ground to the Tories, full stop - not least on the greatest issue of our time."" Mr Wrack called Labour Connected ""a chance for Keir and the shadow cabinet to prove to members that there will be no retreat on the policy pledges he was elected on"". ""Swapping to paper straws isn't going to save our planet,"" the FBU leader said. ""Nothing short of a root-and-branch transformation of our society and economic system will save our planet from the brink of destruction."" He added that rebuilding the economy after the pandemic ""should be seen as an opportunity to tackle the climate crisis as well"". The FBU backed Rebecca Long-Bailey in the Labour leadership contest The FBU split from Labour in 2004 following a dispute with Tony Blair's government over pay. It re-affiliated in 2015 when Jeremy Corbyn became leader. The union backed Rebecca Long-Bailey, another on the left of the party, against Sir Keir in the leadership contest earlier this year. She wassacked from the shadow cabinetin June after she re-tweeted an article Sir Keir said ""contained anti-Semitic conspiracy theories"". In a separate development, Len McCluskey, leader of Unite, the UK's second-biggest union, haspromised to review its financial supportfor Labour. Addressing the TUC Congress earlier this week, Sir Keir continued to promote a unifying message when he said: ""Labour and the trade union movement need to stand together like never before, to show the British people that we've got their back and their future too. ""We'll fight to protect jobs, incomes and working conditions at this time of national crisis, and show that there is a better, fairer society to come. That is our mission."" Last week, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady told the BBC that Sir Keir had made a ""really strong start"" as Labour leader. The party has been contacted for a response to Mr Wrack's comments.

"Holiday camp operator Butlin's has yet to tell 1,000 furloughed workers what their future is when the government's wage subsidy scheme ends next month. A document sent to staff and seen by the BBC suggests employees either take paid holiday if they have any remaining or unpaid leave if not. Butlin's is currently operating at 50% capacity and is heading into the winter months when income falls significantly. It said no decision had been made about workers on the government scheme. The company said: ""Since we reopened Butlin's we've worked hard to bring back as many of our team as possible whilst ensuring we're safe and secure. ""There has been no decision made regarding our team who are still furloughed."" Coronavirus: When will the furlough scheme end? Extend furlough scheme 'or risk second wave of job cuts' Butlin's - whose workers are known for their distinctive red jackets - has 6,000 employees in total. It is part of the privately-owned Bourne Leisure Group which also operates Haven caravan sites and Warner Leisure Hotels with a total workforce of 15,000. Before the government's Job Retention Scheme was announced, Bourne Leisure warned that 10,000 jobs would be at risk without government help. Bourne Leisure has since secured hundreds of millions of pounds in government support in the form of loans, furlough payments and deferred VAT and business rates since the pandemic struck. Bourne Leisure paid out over Â£60m in 2019 to the three families that own the firm - the Harris, Cook and Allen families - reportedly taking the total paid out in dividends to Â£600m over the last 15 years. A staff member told the BBC ""I can't believe a great British holiday brand, owned by muliti-millionaires wants staff to take unpaid leave after furlough"". It is just one example of the uncertainty facing millions of employees still having a dwindling proportion of their wages paid by the government as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme winds down before its planned withdrawal on 31 October. As the date approaches, businesses will have to consult with staff on how many of them they intend to make redundant. Menzies Aviation which provides services at Luton Airport this week informed 176 workers - half its workforce - that their jobs were at risk when furlough ends. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has ruled out extending the furlough scheme However, union sources told the BBC they had been surprised that there had not been more notifications given that companies with over 100 employees, who intend to make over 100 people redundant are obliged to consult with staff 45 days before termination. Unions, business groups and politicians across the political divide have been lobbying the government to find a replacement for the furlough scheme that all acknowledge has saved millions from unemployment. So far the government has ruled out any extension but Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is ""open to creative ideas"". Additional support may yet be forthcoming for regions hit by additional and increasingly widespread lockdown measures. It is thought future schemes will focus more on retraining and creating new jobs rather than returning those still on furlough to the jobs many think they still have but in reality do not.

"Anti-government protesters have installed a plaque declaring Thailand ""belongs to the people"", in a bold show of opposition to the monarchy. The plaque was laid near Bangkok's Grand Palace in the latest challenge to Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Student-led protests calling for reform of the country's monarchy and political system have been going on since July. The protests over the weekend were some of the largest in years, with thousands defying authorities to demand change. Authorities say 18,000 people joined Saturday's demonstration, although others give higher figures. Many stayed to continue the protest into Sunday, before dispersing. Their calls for royal reform are particularly sensitive in Thailand, where criticism of the monarchy is punishable by long prison sentences. Protesters are also demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who took power in a 2014 coup and won disputed elections last year. This video can not be played Thousands gathered in the Thai capital for Saturday's protests On Sunday morning, student activists cemented a commemorative ""People's Plaque"" close to a field known as Sanam Luang, or Royal Field. The plaque, dated 20 September, 2020, proclaims in Thai: ""The people have expressed the intention that this country belongs to the people, and not the king."" Organisers said the plaque was a replacement for another marking the end of absolute monarchy in the 1930s, which went missing in 2017. The mystery of the missing brass plaque The students risking it all to challenge the monarchy Cheers erupted as activists installed the new plaque, with protesters chanting: ""Down with feudalism, long live the people."" Police did not intervene and there were no reports of violence. A spokesman for the Thai government told Reuters news agency police would not use violence against protesters. Student protest leaders handed over a letter of demands to the king's Royal Guard police Later on, protesters who had planned to march to Government House were blocked from doing so by hundreds of unarmed police manning crowd control barriers. Instead, the protesters marched to hand a letter of demands for reform of the monarchy to the king's Royal Guard police. Protest leaders declared victory after saying Royal Guard police had agreed to pass on their demands to police headquarters. There has been no comment from the police. ""Our greatest victory in the two days is to show that ordinary people like us can send a letter to royals,"" protest leader Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak said, telling crowds to return for another demonstration next week. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve. Protesters were on the streets of Bangkok again on Sunday The Future Forward Party (FFP) had proved particularly popular with young, first-time voters and garnered the third-largest share of parliamentary seats in the March 2019 election, which was won by the incumbent military leadership. Protests were re-energised in June when prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit went missing in Cambodia, where he had been in exile since the 2014 military coup. His whereabouts remain unknown and protesters accuse the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - something the police and government have denied. Since July there have been regular student-led street protests. Demonstrators have demanded that the government headed by Prime Minister Chan-ocha, a former army chief who seized power in the coup, be dissolved; that the constitution be rewritten; that the authorities stop harassing critics. The demands of protesters took an unprecedented turn last month when a 10-point call for reform to the monarchy was read out at one rally. The move sent shockwaves through a country which is taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it. Protesters want Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to step down The young woman who delivered the manifesto, Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, has said their intention ""is not to destroy the monarchy but to modernise it, to adapt it to our society"". But she and her fellow activists have been accused of ""chung chart"" - a Thai term meaning ""hatred of the nation"" - and they say they are deeply fearful of the consequences of doing ""the right thing"" by speaking out. Each of Thailand's 19 constitutions of modern times has stated, at the top, that: ""The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship"" and that ""no person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action"". These provisions are backed by article 112 of the criminal code, known as the lese-majeste law, which subjects anyone criticising the royal family to secret trials and long prison sentences. The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy is unclear and human rights groups say the law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and opposition calls for reform and change. The law had been increasingly enforced in the years after the 2014 coup, although it has slowed since King Vajiralongkorn let it be known he no longer wanted it to be so widely used. But observers say the government has used other legal routes, including the sedition law, to target dissent.

"Banners supporting Walus are a common feature in Polish football stadiums Huge banners bearing the portrait of Janusz Walus can often be seen draped around football stadiums in Poland calling for the freedom of a man serving a life sentence in South Africa for the 1993 murder of prominent anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani. Many feared that Hani's killing could provoke a racial war, coming at a crucial point in talks for the white minority to hand over power, which eventually happened when Nelson Mandela became president the following year after the country's first all-race elections. It is unclear how Walus became a symbol for young Polish nationalists and fascists but about 10 years ago, he started receiving letters from supporters in Poland, journalist Cezary Lazarewicz, who interviewed Walus for his book, told the BBC. ""They wrote to him that they admired him because he tried to stop communism in South Africa, that he is the great hope of the white race,"" he said. In pictures and videos posted online some of the football fans in the stands are carrying scarves with the hashtag #StayStrongBrother printed on them. It's inspired by a song dedicated to him which includes the lyrics: ""A few men could ever take the step you did, to enter the path of glory and victory"". ""The fans are not calling on Walus' release on humanitarian grounds, but they are glorifying what he did and the ideology,"" Dr Rafal Pankowski, from Never Again association, an anti-racist group, told the BBC. The song, which is sung in English, is ""a good example of the internationalisation of contemporary white nationalism,"" he adds. Who was Chris Hani? Leader of the South African Communist Party Chief of staff of uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC), allied to the SACP Launched attacks against apartheid government Seen as a potential successor to Nelson Mandela Assassinated on 10 April 1993 Walus, an immigrant from Poland who had acquired South African citizenship, and his co-defendant Clive Derby-Lewis, were sentenced to death shortly after Hani's killing, but the sentence was commuted to life sentence after South Africa abolished the death penalty. They both appealed for amnesty during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1997, with Walus saying that he was driven by political, anti-communist motives to kill Hani, who was then the secretary-general of the South African Communist Party (SACP), and also a leading figure in the armed wing of the African National Congress. The two parties were close allies in the fight against apartheid. Their appeal was rejected. Derby-Lewis, who provided the gun used to kill Hani, died in 2016, a year after he was granted parole for health reasons. Walus, who is serving his life sentence at a maximum security prison in Pretoria, continues to find fame online. Even more shockingly, the range of merchandise supporting him and celebrating him as a ""political prisoner"" has been sold on a South African-owned online market website. The BBC confirmed that scarves, a T-shirt, and a sticker bearing the name and image of Janusz Walus had been put up for sale on OLX's Polish website. These items have since been removed. Scarves from several football clubs were among those removed from OLX OLX is owned by technology-investment company Prosus, a subsidiary of South African-based global tech giant Naspers. The Never Again association reported the sale of the Walus items and other ""racist"" items to OLX. ""Promoting fascism or racial hatred is prohibited by the Polish law but the implementation of the law is notoriously weak,"" Dr Pankowski said. This T-shirt was put up for sale on the OLX platform OLX Poland's regulations also prohibit selling items containing ""content inciting hatred based on national, ethnic, racial, religious differences or due to non-denominational status"". In a statement to the BBC, Naspers said that ""right-wing elements in Poland have violated the terms of use of the OLX Poland platform. Although they only managed to do so to a very limited extent, any content that incites violence, racism, or discrimination is abhorrent and contrary to the values and beliefs of our organisation"". ""Our systems use technology automatically to identify and remove listings that violate OLX's policies,"" spokesperson Shamiela Letsoalo said. The Walus items were not listed under his name and so the system missed them, the statement said, adding that they were ""swiftly removed"" after the team was notified. But this isn't enough for SACP spokesman Alex Mashilo, who told the BBC that Naspers had ""to take action, more than what they said out of convenience"". He added that the party would ""consider this matter further and decide the next steps to adopt"". One explanation for the rise in visibility of Walus' cause is a series of court and government decisions which led to the quashing of a 2016 decision to release him on parole. Hani's family and the SACP had opposed the move even after South African authorities stripped Walus of his citizenship in 2017, clearing the way for him to be deported to Poland if he was freed from prison. In March, the justice ministry finally ruled out his release. Walus is ""unrepentant except for his pretences to be seen to be complying with parole eligibility,"" Mr Mashilo said. ""The uncorrectable assassin who almost plunged South Africa into a civil war with far-reaching implications must not be released on parole. As things stand, there has been no full disclosure of the truth and all the circumstances surrounding Hani's assassination,"" Mr Mashilo added. He said questions remained about the gun used to kill Hani. ""The murder weapon that the man pulled the trigger of was taken from military armoury. Who took it, whose hands did it go through... to [get to] its destination, Walus, and his assassination of Hani?"" he asked. Supporters of the ruling ANC party have also been opposed to freeing Walus on parole The last time most South Africans saw Walus was during the TRC sessions, answering questions about Hani's murder. At some point during the hearings he locked his head in a slightly titled position and shot a blank but searing stare across the room - it's a look like this which can be seen on display in scarves and banners in Polish football stadiums. Last year an audio message from Walus was uploaded to YouTube and Facebook, in which he thanked his fans for raising legal fees and buying sports equipment. Walus told Polish journalist Lazarewicz he believes black people and white people should live separately When Lazarewicz visited Walus two years ago for an interview, he found a man who, 25 years after his incarceration, was unrelenting in his convictions. ""Four years ago Walus met in prison with Hani's daughter - Lindiwe. He told her [that] when he lost his father [in 1997] then he understood that Chris Hani was not only a communist, but he was also a father and husband,"" Lazarewicz said. ""Walus told me that he was very sorry for killing Lindiwe's father. But he never regretted [killing a] communist leader. He told me, in 1993, there was a war in South Africa and he felt like a soldier... he still believes in the system of racial segregation and that whites and blacks should live apart,"" he added. This could explain why Walus has become an icon of white supremacist groups. So even as his supporters call for his freedom in football games in Poland, it's their shared allegiance to a racist ideology that will block any chance of parole and confine him to prison for the rest of his life.

"Banners supporting Walus are a common feature in Polish football stadiums Huge banners bearing the portrait of Janusz Walus can often be seen draped around football stadiums in Poland calling for the freedom of a man serving a life sentence in South Africa for the 1993 murder of prominent anti-apartheid leader Chris Hani. Many feared that Hani's killing could provoke a racial war, coming at a crucial point in talks for the white minority to hand over power, which eventually happened when Nelson Mandela became president the following year after the country's first all-race elections. It is unclear how Walus became a symbol for young Polish nationalists and fascists but about 10 years ago, he started receiving letters from supporters in Poland, journalist Cezary Lazarewicz, who interviewed Walus for his book, told the BBC. ""They wrote to him that they admired him because he tried to stop communism in South Africa, that he is the great hope of the white race,"" he said. In pictures and videos posted online some of the football fans in the stands are carrying scarves with the hashtag #StayStrongBrother printed on them. It's inspired by a song dedicated to him which includes the lyrics: ""A few men could ever take the step you did, to enter the path of glory and victory"". ""The fans are not calling on Walus' release on humanitarian grounds, but they are glorifying what he did and the ideology,"" Dr Rafal Pankowski, from Never Again association, an anti-racist group, told the BBC. The song, which is sung in English, is ""a good example of the internationalisation of contemporary white nationalism,"" he adds. Who was Chris Hani? Leader of the South African Communist Party Chief of staff of uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC), allied to the SACP Launched attacks against apartheid government Seen as a potential successor to Nelson Mandela Assassinated on 10 April 1993 Walus, an immigrant from Poland who had acquired South African citizenship, and his co-defendant Clive Derby-Lewis, were sentenced to death shortly after Hani's killing, but the sentence was commuted to life sentence after South Africa abolished the death penalty. They both appealed for amnesty during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1997, with Walus saying that he was driven by political, anti-communist motives to kill Hani, who was then the secretary-general of the South African Communist Party (SACP), and also a leading figure in the armed wing of the African National Congress. The two parties were close allies in the fight against apartheid. Their appeal was rejected. Derby-Lewis, who provided the gun used to kill Hani, died in 2016, a year after he was granted parole for health reasons. Walus, who is serving his life sentence at a maximum security prison in Pretoria, continues to find fame online. Even more shockingly, the range of merchandise supporting him and celebrating him as a ""political prisoner"" has been sold on a South African-owned online market website. The BBC confirmed that scarves, a T-shirt, and a sticker bearing the name and image of Janusz Walus had been put up for sale on OLX's Polish website. These items have since been removed. Scarves from several football clubs were among those removed from OLX OLX is owned by technology-investment company Prosus, a subsidiary of South African-based global tech giant Naspers. The Never Again association reported the sale of the Walus items and other ""racist"" items to OLX. ""Promoting fascism or racial hatred is prohibited by the Polish law but the implementation of the law is notoriously weak,"" Dr Pankowski said. This T-shirt was put up for sale on the OLX platform OLX Poland's regulations also prohibit selling items containing ""content inciting hatred based on national, ethnic, racial, religious differences or due to non-denominational status"". In a statement to the BBC, Naspers said that ""right-wing elements in Poland have violated the terms of use of the OLX Poland platform. Although they only managed to do so to a very limited extent, any content that incites violence, racism, or discrimination is abhorrent and contrary to the values and beliefs of our organisation"". ""Our systems use technology automatically to identify and remove listings that violate OLX's policies,"" spokesperson Shamiela Letsoalo said. The Walus items were not listed under his name and so the system missed them, the statement said, adding that they were ""swiftly removed"" after the team was notified. But this isn't enough for SACP spokesman Alex Mashilo, who told the BBC that Naspers had ""to take action, more than what they said out of convenience"". He added that the party would ""consider this matter further and decide the next steps to adopt"".

"Anti-government protesters have installed a plaque declaring Thailand ""belongs to the people"", in a bold show of opposition to the monarchy. The plaque was laid near Bangkok's Grand Palace in the latest challenge to Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Student-led protests calling for reform of the country's monarchy and political system have been going on since July. The protests over the weekend were some of the largest in years, with thousands defying authorities to demand change. Authorities say 18,000 people joined Saturday's demonstration, although others give higher figures. Many stayed to continue the protest into Sunday, before dispersing. Their calls for royal reform are particularly sensitive in Thailand, where criticism of the monarchy is punishable by long prison sentences. Protesters are also demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who took power in a 2014 coup and won disputed elections last year. This video can not be played Thousands gathered in the Thai capital for Saturday's protests On Sunday morning, student activists cemented a commemorative ""People's Plaque"" close to a field known as Sanam Luang, or Royal Field. The plaque, dated 20 September, 2020, proclaims in Thai: ""The people have expressed the intention that this country belongs to the people, and not the king."" Organisers said the plaque was a replacement for another marking the end of absolute monarchy in the 1930s, which went missing in 2017. The mystery of the missing brass plaque The students risking it all to challenge the monarchy Cheers erupted as activists installed the new plaque, with protesters chanting: ""Down with feudalism, long live the people."" Police did not intervene and there were no reports of violence. A spokesman for the Thai government told Reuters news agency police would not use violence against protesters. Student protest leaders handed over a letter of demands to the king's Royal Guard police Later on, protesters who had planned to march to Government House were blocked from doing so by hundreds of unarmed police manning crowd control barriers. Instead, the protesters marched to hand a letter of demands for reform of the monarchy to the king's Royal Guard police. Protest leaders declared victory after saying Royal Guard police had agreed to pass on their demands to police headquarters. There has been no comment from the police. ""Our greatest victory in the two days is to show that ordinary people like us can send a letter to royals,"" protest leader Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak said, telling crowds to return for another demonstration next week. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve. Protesters were on the streets of Bangkok again on Sunday The Future Forward Party (FFP) had proved particularly popular with young, first-time voters and garnered the third-largest share of parliamentary seats in the March 2019 election, which was won by the incumbent military leadership. Protests were re-energised in June when prominent pro-democracy activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit went missing in Cambodia, where he had been in exile since the 2014 military coup. His whereabouts remain unknown and protesters accuse the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping - something the police and government have denied. Since July there have been regular student-led street protests. Demonstrators have demanded that the government headed by Prime Minister Chan-ocha, a former army chief who seized power in the coup, be dissolved; that the constitution be rewritten; that the authorities stop harassing critics. The demands of protesters took an unprecedented turn last month when a 10-point call for reform to the monarchy was read out at one rally. The move sent shockwaves through a country which is taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it. Protesters want Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha to step down The young woman who delivered the manifesto, Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, has said their intention ""is not to destroy the monarchy but to modernise it, to adapt it to our society"". But she and her fellow activists have been accused of ""chung chart"" - a Thai term meaning ""hatred of the nation"" - and they say they are deeply fearful of the consequences of doing ""the right thing"" by speaking out. Each of Thailand's 19 constitutions of modern times has stated, at the top, that: ""The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship"" and that ""no person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action"". These provisions are backed by article 112 of the criminal code, known as the lese-majeste law, which subjects anyone criticising the royal family to secret trials and long prison sentences. The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy is unclear and human rights groups say the law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and opposition calls for reform and change. The law had been increasingly enforced in the years after the 2014 coup, although it has slowed since King Vajiralongkorn let it be known he no longer wanted it to be so widely used. But observers say the government has used other legal routes, including the sedition law, to target dissent.

"President Donald Trump had threatened to ban the app in the US unless a satisfactory deal was struck US President Donald Trump has expressed his approval of a deal that would allow Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok to continue operating in the US. Mr Trump told reporters he had given his ""blessing"" to a partnership between TikTok and US firms Oracle and Walmart. The president had ordered the app to be banned in the US, citing national security concerns. US security officials fear data collected by TikTok's owner may be handed to the Chinese government. TikTok's owner, ByteDance, has denied accusations that it is controlled by or shares data with China's ruling Communist Party. However, the TikTok deal does not affect a ban on the Chinese-owned messaging and payments app WeChat, which will no longer be available in US app stores from Sunday night. Tencent, the conglomerate that owns WeChat, has described the US ban as ""unfortunate"". On Saturday, Mr Trump said the deal would ensure the data of the estimated 100 million Americans who use the app was safe, telling reporters: ""The security will be 100%."" ""I have given the deal my blessing,"" Mr Trump said as he left the White House ahead of an election rally in North Carolina. ""I approve the deal in concept."" Is the US about to split the internet? What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat TikTok and ByteDance both welcomed President Trump's approval of a proposed deal, which would still need to be signed off by the Chinese government. TikTok said the deal would ensure US national security requirements were fully satisfied, while ByteDance said it was working to reach an agreement that was ""in line with US and Chinese law"" as soon as possible. Vanessa Pappas, TikTok interim chief executive, said in a video posted on Saturday that the app was ""here to stay"" in the US. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. President Trump's support for the deal comes days after his administration said it would bar people in the US from downloading TikTok through any app store from Sunday. However, the US Commerce Department said it had now delayed this deadline for a week until 27 September in the ""light of recent positive developments"". The row over TikTok comes at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and the Chinese government over a number of issues, including trade disputes, protests in Hong Kong and Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The deal would see the establishment of a new company, dubbed TikTok Global. That company would be headquartered in the US, possibly in the state of Texas, with a majority of American directors, a US chief executive and a security expert on the board. Oracle and Walmart are expected to take significant stakes in the company, and ByteDance has agreed to security safeguards on the data of US users. TikTok's data would be stored by Oracle, which would have the right to inspect its source code. This video can not be played What's going on with TikTok? President Trump said the new TikTok company will be ""totally controlled by Oracle and Walmart"". But in a joint statement on Saturday, Oracle and Walmart said they were together investing to acquire 20% of the newly formed TikTok Global business. Of that 20% stake, Oracle will take 12.5%, while Walmart will take 7.5%, reports say. The deal will see TikTok Global become majority-owned by American investors, but Bytedance will retain a share of the US operation. This falls somewhat short of President Trump's demand for an outright sale of TikTok's US arm to an American company. That was the intention of an executive order Mr Trump signed in August. However, Mr Trump did say the deal would provide new jobs and tax revenue for the country. In their statement, Oracle and Walmart said TikTok Global would create more than 25,000 new jobs and pay more than $5bn (Â£3.8bn) in tax in the US. This is not the deal that Donald Trump had envisioned - he had wanted the US arm of the company to be sold. That's not quite what's happening here. This is more like a joint venture between three companies. Oracle's role is particularly important, acting as a ""trusted partner"" safeguarding the data of users. But in the proposed deal TikTok's Chinese owner Bytedance would still own much of the new entity. So what made Trump decide to approve it? Well, he appears now to be satisfied that the security arrangements proposed. But it's more complex than that. The deal also proposes a $5bn education fund - and will reportedly create 25,000 US jobs. This is not a done deal though, the Chinese government still has to approve it - and there's no guarantee that will happen. TikTok is a video-sharing app. Users can post up to a minute of video and have access to a vast database of songs and filters. They use the app to share 15-second videos that often involve lip-synching to songs, comedy routines and unusual editing tricks. The app collects a huge amount of user data - including what videos people watch and comment on, location data, phone model and even how people type. But much of this data collection is similar to other social networks like Facebook. The app is reported to have around 800 million active monthly users worldwide, most of whom are in the US and India. India has already blocked TikTok as well as other Chinese apps. Australia, which has already banned Huawei and telecom equipment-maker ZTE, is also considering banning TikTok. Teen's TikTok post about China camps goes viral How much data does TikTok collect?
