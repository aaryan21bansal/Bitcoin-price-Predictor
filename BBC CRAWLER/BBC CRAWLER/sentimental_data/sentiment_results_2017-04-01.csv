"When Rebecca Lowe set off solo from the UK for Iran by bicycle, her friends thought she had taken leave of her senses. But although she had to endure gropers, extreme heat and heavy-handed police, most of the people she met were a long way removed from stereotypes. The day I left London to embark on a 6,000-mile (10,000km), year-long cycle to Tehran, I was deeply unprepared. I wasn't fit. I had never used panniers. I had no sense of direction. It was six years since I had last ridden up a hill. But for all my doubts, I was dedicated to the task at hand. My aims were simple: develop enviably shapely calves, survive and shed light on a region long misunderstood by the West. Mostly, I wanted to show that the bulk of the Middle East is far from the volatile hub of violence and fanaticism people believe. And that a woman could cycle through it safely. Not everyone had faith in my ability to do so, however. ""We think you'll probably die,"" one friend told me before I left. ""We've put the odds at about 60:40."" Others were less optimistic. A man in the pub said I was a ""naive idiot who would end up decapitated in a ditch - at best"". A good friend sent me a copy of Rudyard Kipling's If, stressing the importance of keeping ""your head when all about you / Are losing theirs"". Yet I remained tentatively confident. The region may be politically precarious, but the people I knew from experience to be warm and kind. Crime rates were low and terrorist strongholds isolated and avoidable. Even exposed on a bike, I felt my odds of staying alive weren't bad. I'd chosen a bicycle for its simplicity and slowness of pace, and its immersive, worm's-eye view. On a bike you don't just observe the world but are absorbed within it. You are seen as unthreatening and endearingly unhinged, and are welcomed into people's lives. I set off in July 2015. Over the next four months I inched my way with sluggish determination across Europe. As summer bled into autumn, my stamina gradually grew - along with my thighs. By Bosnia they were formidable. By Bulgaria they had developed their own gravitational field. But leaving Europe was nerve-wracking. I was now outside my comfort zone, in the relative unknown. In front of me lay Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, Oman, the UAE and Iran. Pre-warned about men, terrorists and traffic, I began the next leg of my journey with caution. I swiftly relaxed, however. A truck driver stopped just to hand me a satsuma. A cafe owner gave me his earmuffs. Dozens of others offered food, water, lifts and lodgings, and endless varieties of kebab. Throughout the Middle East, it was the same. Doors were forever flung wide to greet this strange, two-wheeled anomaly who was surely in need of help, and possibly psychiatric care. My hosts varied widely: rich and poor, mullahs and atheists, Bedouin and businessmen, niqab-clad women and qabaa-robed men. Every person and community was different, but certain traits linked them all: kindness, curiosity and tolerance. Rebecca meets an Egyptian named Aisha Adham In Sudan, families fed me endless vats of ful (bean stew) and let me sleep in their modest mud-brick houses. One Nubian family gently restored me to health after I ran out of water in the Sahara and collapsed, vomiting and delirious, on their doorstep: the lowest point of the trip, and the only time I experienced true panic. Iranian hospitality felt like a soft protective cloak, omnipresent and ever-reliable. So much wonderful, impractical food was given to me by passers-by - watermelons, bread, bags of cucumbers - that much had to be discarded. Persian culture pulsed with contradictions. On my first day, the police admonished me for removing my headscarf in blazing heat under a tree. Minutes later the officer's sister-in-law was serving me khoresh gheimeh (lamb and split pea stew) in her nearby bungalow. The trip was not all blissfully trouble-free, of course. There were the sex pests, for a start. In Jordan, Egypt and Iran, I was groped, ogled and propositioned with disappointing regularity. In Egypt, one randy tuk-tuk driver got his comeuppance following a juicy bum squeeze by being beaten to a pulp by the police convoy on my tail - my horror at their brutality only outdone by my undisguised glee. In Jordan, a truck driver who'd picked me up following a puncture repeatedly asked for kisses and grabbed my breasts. Fortunately his bravado ceased abruptly at the sight of my penknife wafting ominously close to his crotch. Such incidents angered me intensely, and were often frightening and unsettling. Lechery is hardly a preserve of the Middle East, but there were areas where strains of patriarchy and entitlement ran deep. I realised quickly, however, that these men were not monsters. They were ignorant and often ill-educated. Not to mention severely sexually frustrated within a culture where physical intimacy is shameful and stigmatised. They were more cowardly opportunists than malicious aggressors, and it was usually easy enough to send them scuttling cravenly on their way. There were certain things no-one could help with, however. The traffic was obscene by Turkey and got progressively worse. The heat was obscene by Sudan - upwards of 40 C - and also got progressively worse. Toilets were a serious concern. In the remote gold mining regions of northern Sudan, where few women ventured, there simply weren't any. ""Look around you,"" a man at one roadside shack told me, gesturing to the entirely exposed desert behind him. ""The Sahara is your toilet."" The most worrisome issue, however, was political. Across the region, repression was palpable, and foreign journalists clearly weren't welcome. Don't tell the authorities your profession, I was told, or others would pay the price too. I took this advice - yet it was hard to feel at ease. In Egypt, ruled by a heavy-handed military regime, tourists were tightly controlled and protected. The police were suffocating in their oversight, escorting me 500 miles (800km) down the Nile and aggressively grilling everyone I met. In Iran, I was given more freedom. Yet foreigners are not permitted to stay with locals without permission, and several of my hosts endured an intense grilling by police. Some of those aware of my profession declined any contact at all due to fear of repercussion. Everywhere I went, security and oppression continually curbed freedom and dissent. In Turkey, pro-Kurdish human rights lawyer Tahir ElÃ§i was killed by an unknown gunman a few days after we met. In Sudan, two students were killed in clashes with regime forces and supporters during my brief stay in Khartoum. In Jordan and Lebanon, refugee camps were visibly struggling to cope with the growing numbers of Syrians fleeing war. The enduring impression was a region in crisis, stretched hopelessly between tyranny and terror. Yet there was light along the way - and that light was the people. ""The world shouldn't judge us by our politics,"" a member of the Center for Civil Society and Democracy, a Syrian activist group I spent Christmas with, told me. ""We hate our politics. We should be judged by ourselves."" And that, for me, is the nub of the matter. The Middle East is a risky place, but the risks are primarily political. Beyond the pockets of conflict and terror highlighted daily in the media lies a broader reality: that of warm, compassionate communities living normal, everyday lives. So is it safe for a woman to cycle alone across the Middle East? With the right precautions, yes. Would I let my daughter do it? Absolutely not in a month of Sundays - are you mad?

"Sue Townsend's most famous creation was a spotty teenage boy Adrian Mole, the angst-ridden diarist created by the late Sue Townsend, reaches his 50th birthday on 2 April. His diaries, over eight volumes, made Townsend one of the best-selling British authors of recent decades. But what made the character so compelling? Stephen Mangan played Mole in The Cappuccino Years Stephen Mangan played Mole in the 2001 TV adaption of Townsend'sThe Cappuccino Yearsand worked closely with the writer on bringing him to life on screen. Now aged 48, he began reading theSecret Diaryas a teenager. ""Obviously when you read it as a 13 or 14-year-old you miss some of the nuances, but what's so clever about the books is that you get so many different perspectives,"" he says. ""It's written from the point of view of a 13-year-old boy, but it's also there's the story of [his separating] parents. It's a very clever trick, because through his lack of awareness you learn so much about marriage, parenting and life. ""A lot of the poignancy and depth of the book is revealed to you later when you're a little bit older."" Mole's waspish observations of the politics of the day are another feature of Townsend's books. He criticises Margaret Thatcher, the Falklands War and - in later editions - New Labour and Tony Blair. ""Sue was very engaged politically and socially tuned in to what was going on, and Adrian was her way in to discuss that,"" Mangan adds. ""She deals with big cultural phenomena through the books and with characters you love and sympathise with. ""We can be very entrenched in our attitudes, and with comedy, especially one based on a dweeby and nerdy loser like Adrian, bypasses this. ""We still read Jane Austen today, despite those books being a satire of the social scene at the time - if it's done with that amount of wit, warmth and intelligence it becomes universal."" In the early 1980s, while Mole was worrying about his spots and dreaming about his beloved Pandora, author Nina Stibbe was leaving their hometown of Leicester for London. Then a young nanny - and now a successful novelist in her own right - she instantly recognised the problems occupying Mole. ""I read it when it first came out and - although I was 19 not 13 and had just moved to London - it was interesting because it was like a vindication,"" she says. ""He was neurotic, he was anxious, but he didn't mind about it, he just got on with worrying, and it was the same stuff that I was worrying about. ""He was worrying about his family, his mother's drinking and promiscuity, and I think it was the first time there was a character doing this sort of thing in such a charming way."" Stibbe's collection of lettersLove, Ninachronicles her time observing the London literary scene of the 1980s (she was employed as a nanny by Kay Wilmers, editor of the London Review of Books, and frequent visitors to the houses included Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller). ""When the first diary came out I was living in London, I was a nanny, and I was around all these very accomplished writers and playwrights, and they were all loving [Mole],"" she adds. ""I think people can identify with him - the way he worries about things that might go wrong is something that affects us all, whether it's health or what's happening next year. ""I wrote about divorce once, and I thought about [Mole's parents] George and Pauline's marriage, because it's so interestingly done - my parents had lots of friends like that. ""It was all so real, and Sue was writing from experience. The main thing is that it's hilarious, that's the nub and the magic of it."" Louise Moore grew up reading the Mole diaries - and years later wrote a fan letter to Townsend which led to a long-lasting friendship. When Townsend asked Moore to publishThe Cappuccino Years, in which Mole has a brief stint as a celebrity chef before moving back to his native Leicestershire, she described it as ""like winning the Lottery"". ""I'd just left school [when I read theSecret Diary...] and I loved it,"" she said. ""It's the quintessential humour that I love. She says Mole's ""everyman"" qualities kept fans on his side throughout his struggles with life. ""Sue was very clear that she didn't want Adrian to grow up and be unappealing,"" she adds. ""She knew him so well, she'd said that when she was writing other books she'd start to think about him, and he followed her through her life. ""He was her mouthpiece in a way. He's very ridiculous and naÃ¯ve, but he also has a great wisdom and empathy for the human condition. ""He quietly triumphs in the face of almost constant adversity - he's one of the world's unsung, ordinary heroes."" Leicester is the backdrop for much of the Mole books, but it's importance to the character - and Townsend - is often overlooked, says Dr Corinne Fowler, an associate professor at the University of Leicester. ""Sue was very connected to the region,"" she says. ""At her funeral one of the actors who was involved in the first production said she insisted she took the local actors with her when it transferred to London because of her commitment to the local arts scene. ""Apparently there were a few references to Leicester in the early manuscripts, but it seems the editor must have asked them to be removed. I think that tells you something about literary culture... anywhere outside London risked being seen as parochial if it includes the local references for a region. Later on I would imagine she had that authority to put those [references] in."" Mole's appeal has always been much wider, though, and to mark his half-century, three new radio plays featuring the character have been commissioned by the university's Centre for New Writing. ""[Townsend] would have had a field day with Brexit,"" adds Dr Fowler. ""She would have given a voice to the grievances of the Remainers and the political developments across the decade. ""But I think it's interesting how it transcends places. Much of it's a comment on Thatcher's Britain, about growing up in poverty in the UK, about so many national things pertinent to the UK. ""So it's incredible to have someone growing up in Sao Paulo, for example, and understanding and liking it.""

"Smugglers being chased by the Royal Navy. Virtually every seaside community in Britain saw its share of smuggling in the 18th Century A boat beaches in a lonely cove at night, the crew hurriedly unloading its cargo of tea to waiting men and pack horses while armed lookouts stand guard against a surprise swoop by the revenue men. It may be a stereotypical image, but in the 18th Century, a cuppa was in such high demand that many Britons were willing to risk jail for the privilege. In fact, this kind of smuggling was a vital part of Britain's economy for some 200 years. It was a trade triggered by increasingly high tariffs or duties, taxes a merchant would have to pay to legally import tea. The duties on importing tea reached a staggering 119% in the 1750s - which meant that if you could avoid paying the tax, the cost of your brew dropped by more than half. Tea became hugely popular in Britain in the 1700s Not surprisingly many customers turned to the smugglers, who were willing to risk imprisonment or have their ships destroyed and goods seized if they were caught. Free trade and smuggling are closely linked. When import taxes or tariffs are low, there's not much profit to be made from smuggling. Conversely, when a government makes it expensive to legally import items it encourages smugglers who can undercut the official price. Tea was one of the most important items illegally brought into Britain in the 18th Century - everybody wanted to drink it, but most could not afford it at the official price. Tea chests in London in the 1950s - the nation's love affair with the drink has endured In an age before income tax, tea duties accounted for 10% of government revenues, which was enough to pay for the Royal Navy, but as tariffs on it reached 119% it gave smugglers their chance. ""If you had high tariffs and goods people wanted, it gave smugglers a business opportunity,"" says Exeter University historian Helen Doe. More than 3,000 tonnes of tea was smuggled into Britain a year by the late 1700s, with just 2,000 tonnes imported legally. In some areas whole communities were dependent on smuggling, from landowners who might finance the operation down to the fishermen who might be crewing the boats. There were three main types of smuggling, says Robert Blyth, senior curator at the National Maritime Museum in London. A romanticised view of the smuggling trade; in reality smugglers often used threats of violence against customs men ""There's small-scale smuggling, where you might row your boat out to meet a ship and take off some of its cargo to sell illegally, the ship's captain declaring the missing cargo as 'spoiled at sea' when it gets to port to officially unload the rest,"" he says. ""Then there are commercially organised groups bringing contraband into harbours across the UK in a sophisticated operation. ""Finally, you have simple theft and pilfering in major ports like London from ships that have already moored, but have not yet been checked by the revenue."" It wasn't just the British who were developing a taste for tea. The popularity of the drink in Sweden meant the country also played an important role in 18th Century smuggling into Britain. Gothenburg was the base for the Swedish East India Company's operations Swedish East India Company merchants were able to buy the best quality Chinese tea because unlike other European countries they were prepared to pay in silver - rather than seeking to barter or trade. Quite a few were actually Scottish, political refugees who had fled to Sweden after the failure of the 1745 Jacobite uprising, and who thus saw little wrong in avoiding paying tax to Britain's Hanoverian government. So popular was this trade that newspapers in Scotland and northern England openly carried adverts for this smuggled tea, called ""Gottenburgh Teas"". Building specialised docks with guarded warehouses helped cut down stealing of goods once ships had reached London For many tea traders in Britain, buying smuggled tea made sense, says Derek Janes, a history researcher at Exeter University. ""Britain's own East India Company had a monopoly on tea imports, so if an Edinburgh merchant wanted to buy it you had to go to London, you had to pay to bring it back to Scotland - and you had to pay upfront. ""But if you bought it from the smugglers it would be half the price - with no tax to pay - they would deliver to your door and you would get up to four months credit. A much better service!"" One of those involved in this trade was John Nisbet, who became rich enough to commission architect John Adams to design his harbourside mansion in Eyemouth in the Scottish borders, complete with hidden partitions for the smuggled tea. Often when the customs officials got a tip-off about his ship it was too late - the cargo had already been smuggled ashore. And if a smuggler did have his goods seized, he could sometimes negotiate a price to buy it back from the government. ""John Nisbet had a ship and cargo seized, but you can see the lawyer for the board of customs in Edinburgh say that the witnesses had disappeared, so the customs did a deal. He paid Â£250 to get it all back, which still left him in profit,"" says Mr Janes. By 1784, the government realised high tariffs were creating more problems than they were worth and cut tea duties to just 12.5%, making tea affordable for most people. The change meant smugglers switched to bringing in spirits and wine instead. The end of the Napoleonic wars saw the Royal Navy in undisputed command of the Channel, making it much harder for smugglers to avoid detection The Napoleonic wars saw an upsurge in smuggling, but after 1815 with the Royal Navy in undisputed command of the sea, its days were numbered. Ultimately, many smugglers failed. In the long run, the business did not generate enough cash to compensate for the risks of losing stock or ships to the customs. John Nisbet may have been able to afford a fine house but even he went bust eventually, the result of one too many cargo seizures. In the end, it was economics that finally put an end to the smuggling era. Britain's adoption of a free trade policy in the 1840s reduced import duties significantly, making smuggling no longer viable. And thanks to that shift in policy, you can now sit back, relax and enjoy a nice cup of tea without any fears of going to prison.

"An infestation of ""longtails"" caused a rather unusual problem for Rick Faragher Rick Faragher is no pied piper - he is from the Isle of Man and people there are deeply superstitious about using the three-letter ""r"" word for vermin. But the BBC News reporter had to face his fears when he was sent to cover a story in Belfast that made his blood run cold. I winced the moment I got the nod. I'd covered some difficult stories for the BBC but this was the most daunting in terms of subject matter. It's not that I have an issue with the creatures themselves, it's just their name. For the first 29 years of my life, I had never actually used the word. But that was about to change in 2015. It was unavoidable. I had a professional obligation to utter the dreaded word - RAT. A rat by any other name - ringie, joey or roddan are acceptable in the Isle of Man Like any self-respecting Manxman - Isle of Man native - I had opted for other terms - ""longtail"" is the most common. Others such as ""ringie"", ""joey"" or the native Gaelic word ""roddan"" are also acceptable. I was out of my homeland and out of my comfort zone. I honestly thought I could hear the creatures sniggering at my plight. But I went out and  I mumbled my way around the word with the owner of the infested house. ""I hear you've got problems withâ¦ visitors?"" I said. This was a disaster. I felt embarrassed already. Even people who move to the Isle of Man often dodge the term, whether through genuine fear of bad luck, or to avoid shock and outrage from the locals. Some say it began with fishermen who brought their superstitions back to shore. I knew there were three ways to stop a jinx if ever I was forced to say it: Whistle immediately afterwards; touch a piece of wood while saying it, or cross my fingers. There's an ancient belief that killing a wren on St Stephen's Day is good luck for you... not such great luck for the wren People in parts of Ireland and the Isle of Man refer to 26 December as Wren's Day or Hunt the Wren. It comes from the ancient belief that killing a wren on St Stephen's Day was good luck. In Scotland, there are many superstitions about certain animals. Some farmers believe that the birth of a black-faced sheep brings bad luck for all the flock - this is where the expression ""black sheep of the family"" originates. Seeing a black hare, however, is considered good luck. A Scots canary is considered a singer greater than all other birds and to harm it in any way causes the person to lose their voice. The strange markings on its eggs have led people to believe it is the devil's bird. Many people across Ireland believe thatthorn trees are home to fairiesand, if anyone tries to cut them down or damage them, it is likely they will die young, or become seriously ill. Green keepers at one Belfast golf club refuse to remove a fairy tree which has been growing there for more than 120 years. If a player's ball hits the tree they must apologise to the fairies immediately. The interviews with the owner and environmental health officer were soon filmed and it was time for my piece to camera - almost three decades of superstition about to end. I fidgeted, cleared my throat, and slowly climbed the ladder to the attic. After a couple of seconds the time had comeâ¦ ""Rats."" Rats: ""They fought the dogs and killed the cats and bit the babies in the cradles"" I said it without hesitation in an attempt to sound convincing. My right hand squeezed the ladder. My left hand was out of shot, fingers firmly crossed. We Manxmen are not alone. Dr Andrew Sneddon, from Ulster University, said superstitious beliefs about rats were commonplace in Ireland in the early 20th Century. ""In County Galway, people believed that if you were plagued by rats you could get them to move on by getting an owl's quill and dipping it in raven's blood while saying 'rats be gone',"" he said. In the Middle Ages, people believed fairies could ""blast"" cattle and humans ""In County Cavan, there were people who used charms to banish rats for you, and in County Laois, rats were believed to be a sign of an enemy or bad luck."" It seems it is not just rats that gave our ancestors sleepless nights. ""From the Medieval period onwards, Ireland, in common with the Highlands and islands of Scotland, and the Isle of Man, fairy belief is very strong in the sense that you try not to upset the fairies because they are dangerous,"" said Dr Sneddon. ""They can whisk away healthy children and leave sickly changelings in their wake. They can fairy blast or elf-shoot your cattle and make them ill, they can also blast humans. ""They can also abduct you and take you away to their land. This can also happen if you step into a fairy ring, either made of mushrooms or a Neolithic stone circle. ""In Ireland, as a precaution, traditionally you don't mention the name fairy, you say gentry or good people."" Consider yourself warned.

"This video can not be played 1 April brings changes to some important rates and taxes Household budgets are likely to be further stretched in the first week of April, as dozens of items including water bills, council tax, NHS charges, and some broadband and energy charges all rise. Those on welfare will feel the squeeze especially, as payment rates are frozen for the second year in succession, and the generosity of some benefits are reduced. However, those in work are likely to become better off, as tax rates become more generous, and the National Living Wage also rises. Some of these changes will occur on 1 April, at the start of the government's financial year, while others occur on 6 April, the start of the tax year. From 6 April the personal allowance - the annual amount you can earn before paying tax - rises from Â£11,000 to Â£11,500. This should save over 20 million people Â£100 a year, and take thousands out of tax altogether. At the same time the starting point for paying the higher, or 40%, rate of tax will move from Â£43,000 to Â£45,000. This will save higher rate taxpayers a further Â£400 a year. However, in Scotland the higher rate threshold has been frozen at Â£43,000, so better-off taxpayers north of the border will see no benefit. Millions of people over the age of 25 will receive a 4% pay rise from 1 April, as the National Living Wage (NLW) increases from Â£7.20 an hour to Â£7.50. However, those between the ages of 21 and 24, who receive the National Minimum Wage (NMW), will get a rise of only 1.4% - well below the current 2.3% CPI inflation rate. The new wage rates are: NLW (25+): Â£7.50 NMW (21-24): Â£7.05 NMW (18-20): Â£5.60 NMW (under 18): Â£4.05 NMW apprentice: Â£3.50 Savers can apply to open a new Lifetime Isa (Lisa) from 6 April. The government will add a 25% bonus to your savings after a year, up to a maximum of Â£1,000. The Lisa is designed for people who want to buy a property, or need a retirement income. Anyone nearing the age of 40 is advised to consider opening a Lisa soon, as those over that age cannot start an account. More details about the Lisahere. The allowance for saving into an ordinary Individual Savings Account (Isa) goes up from Â£15,250 to Â£20,000 from 6 April. The money can be invested in a cash Isa, or in stocks and shares. There is no tax to pay on income from an Isa, or on any capital gain. Anyone buying a new car from 1 April will pay a different rate of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). This is because car emissions have got so much cleaner that most of them would no longer qualify for VED at all. New buyers will pay a special rate in the first year, depending on engine emissions, followed by a fixed rate in one of three categories thereafter: zero emission, standard or premium. The standard rate will be Â£140. Luxury cars, costing more than Â£40,000 will pay an extra Â£310. Rates for existing car owners will not change. VED: Small car buyers face higher costs Inheritance tax will become less onerous for people who want to leave property to their children. Currently, any estate worth more than Â£325,000 carries a tax liability of 40% on anything above that threshold. But from 6 April there will be a new transferable main residence allowance on property within the estate, enabling individuals to pass on an extra Â£100,000 tax free. Couples who are married, or in a civil partnership, will now be able to pass on Â£850,000 in total without paying tax, an amount that will rise to Â£1m by 2021. How does inheritance tax work? People living in England will see the steepest general rise in council tax. From 1 April the rise will average 4%, equating to Â£61 for a typical Band D property. The rise will be smaller in district councils, which do not have responsibility for social care, and up to 4.99% in those that do. In Scotland the average rise is 3%, equating to about Â£32 for a Band D property. However, householders in the top four bands (E to H) will see extra increases, due to MSPs deciding to increase the ""multiplyer"". Those with properties in band E will see typical rises of Â£105 a year, while those in band H are likely to pay Â£517 more. Council taxpayers in Wales will see a rise of 3.1% on average, equal to about Â£35 a year on a Band D property. Rate-payers in Northern Ireland have still not been told what their bill will be, due to political issues. From 6 April there will be cuts to future child tax credits. Where a first child is born after this date, claimants will no longer receive the family element of the payment, worth Â£545 a year. Those whose first child was born before 6 April will see no change. In addition, those who have a third or subsequent child after this date will no longer receive a payment for that child - limiting future tax credits to two children only. The same will apply to people claiming universal credit. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies,external(IFS) calculates that as a result of this change alone, 600,000 three-child families will on average be Â£2,500 worse off than under the old system. But in practice no existing parent, and no existing claimant, will actually lose money. From Monday 3 April new claimants for the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG) of ESA will receive Â£29 a week less than existing claimants. These are people whom the government judges may be capable of working at some stage in the future. They will receive Â£73 instead of Â£102, to bring them into line with claimants for Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA). The IFS has estimated that half a million future claimants will receive Â£1,400 a year less than current claimants. April 2017 sees the start of the second year in which many state benefits will be frozen. This includes JSA, ESA, child benefit and some housing benefit payments. Given that CPI inflation is currently running at 2.3%, this will amount to a real terms cut for tens of millions of people. The freeze is due to last until March 2020. From 10 April, those people who claim universal credit (UC) will be allowed to keep more of what they earn from a job before their benefits are reduced. Previously those in work were allowed to keep 35p out of every pound they earned, before their UC payment was cut. Now they will be allowed to keep 37p in every pound.  This is as a result of the so-called taper rate being reduced from 65% to 63%. The cost of an NHS prescription in England rises on 1 April from Â£8.40 to Â£8.60. However the cost of pre-payment cards has been frozen. Dental charges in England are also rising. The cost of a check-up will go up by 90p to Â£20.60, the cost of a filling goes up by Â£2.40 to Â£56.30, and the most complex work will go up by Â£10 to Â£244.30. From 1 April, four million consumers who use pre-payment meters for their gas and electricity will see their charges capped. The regulator, Ofgem, says they should each save around Â£80 a year. However, on average they were paying Â£220 more than other consumers, so they will still be paying a higher charge than others. Water and sewerage bills will go up on 1 April. The average rise in England and Wales is 2%, making a typical annual bill Â£395. In Scotland the rise will be 1.6%, or around Â£5 per household. Residents of Northern Ireland pay for water through their rates bills. Some energy bills will rise significantly. SSE customers on standard tariffs will see electricity prices rise by 14.9% on 28 April. E.On will increase electricity prices by 13.8%, and gas prices by 3.8%, on 26 April. Most other suppliers increased their prices in March. Several telecoms companies, including BT, EE and Vodafone are putting up prices. The cost of BT broadband, for example, will go up by Â£2.50 a month. On 1 April the cost of a TV licence goes up by Â£1.50, to Â£147.

"Russian singer Julia Samoilova has been denied a visa to perform in Kiev The Eurovision Song Contest, an annual pop extravaganza where each country sends an act to compete for others' votes, is never just about the music. Some would cite its unrivalled commitment to sequins - others, the fiercely biased voting. Until recent years, though, there was little about the competition that would give politicians sleepless nights. But now a fierce row between Russia and this year's hosts - Ukraine - has seen a warning letter from Eurovision's organisers land on the Ukrainian prime minister's desk. So what's the cause of the conflict, and how did it get this far? A record 43 countries from theEuropean Broadcasting Area,externalwere due to don their finest spandex this year. But last month,Ukraine banned Russia's chosen artist, Julia Samoilova, from entering the country for three years. Why? Because in 2015 she made what it calls an illegal visit to sing in Crimea - which was annexed by Russia three years ago - entering via Russia rather than the Ukrainian mainland. Russia and Ukraine have been at loggerheads since the annexation and subsequent fighting in east Ukraine, which Moscow is accused of stoking. Ukraine is hosting Eurovision because its singer, Jamala,won in Sweden last year. She took the crown with 1944, a song about Josef Stalin's mass deportation of Crimean Tatars during World War Two. Jamala won last year's Eurovision for the Ukraine - meaning the country will host 2017's festivities Russia, who were favourites in the run-up to the event, limped home in third. Moscow is especially irked by the ban on Samoilova, 27, as she uses a wheelchair and the slogan of this year's Eurovision is ""Celebrate diversity"". Outrage is an understatement. A deputy foreign minister called the ban on Samoilova outrageous, cynical and inhumane. One MP is demanding that the contest be moved to another country, while a second warned that Russia would boycott every Eurovision to come unless organisers intervened to resolve the row. Russia's Channel One, which broadcasts Eurovision, said in a statement: ""Ukraine didn't even have the common sense to make use of this opportunity to look like a civilised country."" Samoilova performed at the opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games in Sochi It alsorefused an offer by Eurovision to have Samoilova join in the competition remotely, via satellite. ""We find the offer of remote participation odd and refuse it, for it is going absolutely against the very essence of the event,"" the official Russian broadcaster said. According to the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow, some suspect Moscow knew what would happen when it chose Julia Samoilova, knowing that she had travelled to Crimea. Eurovision organisers want the focus on the event, not the politics. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), a group of public media outlets that produces Eurovision, is demanding that Kiev let Samoilova perform. Otherwise, it says, Ukraine faces the threat of exclusion from future contests. Ingrid Deltenre, head of the EBU, wrote to Ukraine's Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman on 23 March to issue the warning. Eurovision chiefs have written to Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman ""No previous host country has prevented an artist performing at the Eurovision Song Contest and the EBU would not like a precedent to be set in 2017,""she wrote,externalin the letter leaked to media. ""We consider the current ban of the Russian singer as unacceptable. As a consequence the UAPBC [Ukraine's National Public Broadcasting Company] might be excluded from future events."" ""We are increasingly frustrated, in fact angry, that this year's competition is being used as a tool in the ongoing confrontation between the Russian Federation and Ukraine,"" Ms Deltenre added. She said that if Kiev didn't lift its ban, ""it would certainly have a very big negative impact on Ukraine's international reputation as a modern, democratic European nation"". Who is the UK's 2017 entry? The Eurovision song contest will be held in Kiev on 13 May - and we can expect the same kitsch pop-fuelled love-in as usual. But whether Russia's act will take the stage is still unclear. Samoilova has said she is ""not upset"" by Ukraine's decision. The singer told Russia's state-controlled television she did not understand why Ukraine saw ""some kind of threat in a little girl like me"". ""I will keep going,"" she added. ""I somehow think that everything will change."" Samoilova was selected just one day before the 13 March deadline for nomination Born in April 1989 in Ukhta, Russia Her song Flame is Burning was composed by Leonid Gutkin, who also produced Russia's 2013 and 2015 entries Has been in a wheelchair since childhood, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy: a neuromuscular disorder causing muscle wastage She was a 2013 finalist in Russia's X Factor competition and performed at the opening ceremony to the 2014 Sochi Winter Paralympics Russia rejects 'Eurovision via satellite' Russia out of tune with Ukraine's Eurovision show Ukraine bars Russian Eurovision singer X Factor singer seeks Eurovision glory Eurovision Song Contest LA firefighters say 'no possibility' of containing blazes as fifth wildfire breaks out Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"Kim Jong-Un (c) A bitter stand-off between Malaysia and North Korea appears at an end after the two countries revoked a travel ban which had effectively kept their respective citizens hostages for more than three weeks. But has North Korea come out on top? The diplomatic row was sparked by the killing of Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. According to Malaysia, Kim died as the result of exposure to aVX chemical weapons agentin a plot widely believed to have been orchestrated by as many seven North Koreans and assisted - whether wittingly or not - by two Asian women currently in custody. While Malaysia has not officially accused North Korea of responsibility for the killing, their investigation has involved an autopsy of Kim's body and an attempt to question the suspected North Korean plotters. They also presented a report documenting the use of chemical weapons to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Pyongyang rejected any suggestion that it was behind the killing while publicly asserting that the dead individual was not the half-brother of the North Korean leader, but rather an entirely different individual. Malaysia and North Korea - a friendship on ice Kim Jong-nam: Main players in mysterious killing Who could organise a VX murder? Confronted by North Korea's unwillingness to allow its staff to be questioned, Malaysia refused to hand over Kim's body and the North retaliated by refusing to allow Malaysians to leave the North. As a result of Thursday's agreement, several North Korean suspects,reportedly together with Kim's body, were allowed to travel on Friday to North Korea and, in return, nine Malaysians were also permitted to travel home. There were emotional reunions in Kuala Lumpur airport as Malaysians citizens returned home from North Korea While a welcome outcome for the Malaysian detainees, the government of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak appears to have capitulated to the North's coercive tactics - not the first time Pyongyang has used detention as a means of exerting diplomatic leverage. However, the background to the agreement is murky and it is possible that the Malaysian government, which apparently succeeded in questioning the North Korean suspects before they returned home, may have had its own leverage to employ against the North. Diplomatic relations date from 1973 and the two countries have commercial ties. They totalled $4m (Â£3.1m) in 2016 - modest but still significant for a country such as North Korea which has relatively limited foreign trade. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak engaged in a tit-for-tat row with North Korea after the murder North Korea imports rubber, palm oil and refined oil from Malaysia, and there are hundreds of North Koreans working in the mining and restaurant sectors in Malaysia. Keen to promote tourism, North Korea had also introduced a visa-free travel arrangement with Malaysia - which was suspended as a result of the latest row. More importantly, Malaysia has long been a key site for illegal arms component acquisition and weapons trading by North Koreans operating through a number of front companies. A UN report has highlighted some of these activities and while the Malaysian authorities have yet to provide a formal response, their recent decision to delist two of the firms allegedly involved is an indication that the benefits for the North Koreans of the Malaysian relationship in terms of facilitating their covert commercial activity and evading international sanctions may be at risk. Whether Malaysia would have used the potential loss of this cover as a negotiating gambit is unclear. For now, Prime Minister Najib's recent public remarks expressing his hope that a ""case like this"" doesn't happen again, suggests that diplomatic ties, while frayed, will continue but with Pyongyang effectively on probation. To the wider world, the powerful evidence that North Korea continues to flout international norms, whether through state-sanctioned executions or forced detentions, is a sobering reminder of the challenge of engaging constructively with Pyongyang. Footage of a North Korean missile test was broadcast on a big screen in Pyongyang in March Such bad behaviour, when set alongside the North's nuclear and missile tests, as well as its increased ability to threaten its neighbours, suggests that conscious, premeditated provocation, rather than impulsiveness, may be part of the intentional strategy of Kim Jong-un. Instead of labelling him as ""not a rational actor"", which is what US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley did, or a ""crazy fat kid"", in the words of Senator John McCain, the world might be better advised to recognise Kim Jong-un's success in single-mindedly pursuing his own interests. By not playing by the rules, Pyongyang has been, to date, strikingly successful in getting what it wants. The challenge for the international community is finding an effectively coordinated means of responding to these provocations, without appearing to give in to diplomatic blackmail.

"The NHS - as we know - is under pressure. One of the priorities for the coming years is to get people living healthier lives to prevent illness. The health service is playing its part by thinking outside the box and using novel ways to get people active and engaged with their health. As we all know, gardening can be physically hard work. Digging or raking a lawn for 30 minutes requires as much energy as a 2km run, while trimming shrubs and plants is as good for you as walking. So it should come as no surprise that some doctors are promoting gardening to their patients. One of these is Dr Michael Dixon, a GP from Devon, who has been appointed NHS England's social prescribing lead to champion non-medical ways of treating patients. ""It can have a huge impact. GPs see so many patients that don't necessarily need pills and potions but instead require something that gets them active, socialising or in touch with nature. What better activity is there than gardening?"" He speaks from experience. For the last 10 years his practice has been running a social prescribing scheme that refers patients on to local activities from dance and art to, of course, gardening. His practice has a fruit and herb garden and next year, thanks to funding from a local housing developer, a community garden will open. Working mum Alice was told she was at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes by her GP. She was referred by her doctor to boxing lessons to help her get fitter and lose weight in order to keep the disease at bay. Her local surgery is taking part in a GP-led scheme in Leeds which is helping those affected by chronic illness to get fitter by offering exercise classes and advice to patients with a referral. Alice said when her doctor told her she was at risk it ""frightened"" her and her family, but she says she's now enjoying ""the power that you get from being a boxer"". This video can not be played The scheme is for those with illnesses such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and arthritis Her personal trainer Claire helps patients with many different types of chronic illness and those with obesity. ""The eventual aim is to try and help them deal with their pain, help them prevent certain illnesses and with that we've found we have a 100% pass rate with all our patients that we've signed off. So it's something that patients feel comfortable with because they can come to their GP surgery and attend an exercise session."" And Alice says she has felt a big difference. ""I actually feel not my age for a change. As a northern mum working full time, with kids, we've got this habit of always putting our families first, our jobs first, and we never make time just for ourselves. ""But now my special treat is giving myself time to exercise, making myself healthier, then everybody else benefits within my family."" Line dancing and drumming groups are just two of the novel ways people in the north west boroughs of Halton, St Helens and Knowsley are being encouraged to stay active and engaged. The opportunities are provided through the local social prescription service run by voluntary sector bodyWellbeing Enterprises.,external It works by building on the resources that are available already locally, working with existing services, clubs and organisations to co-design and deliver the programmes on offer. Over the years this has involved linking up with singing clubs, dance classes, guitar clubs, knitting groups and local leisure centres. And it can even involve utilising the skills of patients who get referred to them, says Wellbeing Enterprises chief executive officer Mark Swift. ""We had one patient who could play the ukuele so we set up a ukuele class. It really took off  and we ran out of the instruments. On another occasion a doctor was referred to us who was a good tango dancer soÂ she helped run a tango club. It helpedÂ herÂ and many others. ""It is about using the what is already available - there are some terrific schemes that exist in the community."" A three-month follow-up with one group of patients showed they benefited from a 70% reduction in depression symptoms, an 80% improvement in well-being levels and 53% improvement in self-reported health status. In Lancashire, doctors are working with schools to encourage pupils to get active to combat child obesity. The idea has been borrowed from an initiative called the Daily Mile, which first got going in Stirling in Scotland. In Morecambe and Carnforth, a GP has taken it into local schools to encourage pupils to become fitter at a time of rising concern about child obesity. Dr Andy Knox has worked with school heads so that there is time each day for pupils to run one mile or take an equivalent amount of exercise indoors. He is part of the Better Care Together initiative in the area which brings together local health and social care leaders. The children are monitored every month for strength and stamina and they have seen marked improvements over the last year. And the teachers say pupils' concentration and behaviour has improved after the daily run. Some parents have taken their cue and started running each day. Children, interviewed by BBC News, said they enjoyed their runs though it was tough going when they started.

"In the early 1980s, the Aids virus seemed to emerge from nowhere. There was no cure and its origins were a mystery. But one theory began to surface - that it was the product of secret US military research at the Fort Detrick Laboratory. What was the source for this piece of fake news? The answer was the KGB, the Soviet intelligence service. ""The Aids disinformation campaign was one of the most notorious and one of the most successful Soviet disinformation campaigns during the Cold War,"" argues Thomas Boghardt, a historian at the US Army Center of Military Historywho has studied the case in detail.,external KGB political officers in the field were tasked with spending up to a quarter of their time on what were called ""active measures"". Mr Boghardt believes the KGB station in New York first came up with the idea, which played into distrust in US institutions and rumours of covert biological warfare programmes. ""Intelligence meant not only gathering but using - or weaponising - that intelligence for influence operations,"" he explains. The aim of these ""active measures"" was to sow confusion and distrust either within a country or between allies. He says that in 1980, the Soviets spent an astonishing $3bn (Â£2.4bn) a year on active measures. It was not the only time the KGB successfully pushed a conspiracy theory. Within weeks of the assassination of President Kennedy, it tried to circulate stories of official CIA involvement. The Russians tried to implicate the CIA in the assassination of President Kennedy It even covertly financed a book on the subject published in America within a year of the killing. Many attempts at disinformation were amateurish and failed. The main challenge was crafting something plausible. Those that succeeded either blended fact with fiction or worked with the grain of existing conspiracies. When it came to targeting Britain, Moscow had help in the shape of former MI6 officer and KGB spy, Kim Philby. ""He would provide advice on how to do it,"" General Oleg Kalugin - formerly of the KGB and Philby's ex-colleague - told me. ""He said 'this would not work, that sounds too Soviet'."" Former KGB General Oleg Kalugin says double agent Kim Philby helped make Russian interventions realistic Typically this would involve taking genuine documents from Western countries which spies had stolen and then adding in a few fake paragraphs to twist the meaning. ""We preferred to work on genuine documents with some additions and changes, and Philby in that sense was [the] number one guy,"" says Kalugin, now based in the US. In the 1980s, the US tried to counter the tide of KGB disinformation by setting up an ""Active Measures Working Group"", with experts from across government agencies. ""The only way you could counter active measures was by coming back with the truth,"" explains David Major, a former FBI official who served on the group. Gordon Corera presentedSubversion: Weston BBC Radio 4 on Friday 31 March at 11:00 BST. You canlisten to it, and the previous episode Subversion: Easton the BBC Radio 4 website. It would try and identify fake stories and then advise the media about their source. ""We were saying which one of these stories turns out to be fake news."" Major says. It tried to counter one claim that Americans were going to South America, ostensibly to adopt children but actually to harvest their body parts. The challenge in the Cold War was getting out a story. In the case of the Aids virus, it was planted in a small journal in India which was funded by the KGB. The story - on 17 July 1983 - warned that Aids might invade India and was the product of US experiments, with an anonymous US scientist linking it to Fort Detrick. Scientists at the US Army's Fort Detrick Laboratory were falsely accused of generating AIDS Initially, there was not much pick-up. But two years later, Soviet news outlets ran the story, citing the Indian reports. That meant they could claim they were not the source. The story then spread rapidly over the next few years and can still be found in the wilder edges of the internet. The KGB placed great emphasis on not just recruiting people who had access to secrets but people who could influence opinion, so called ""agents of influence"". ""The Soviet and Soviet Bloc intelligence agencies were very good at cultivating contacts with journalists for instance, or intellectuals, who sometimes knowingly and sometimes unknowingly would be used as launching platforms for fake or leaked stories,"" explains Prof Thomas Rid of King's College, London. Sometimes documents would also be mailed anonymously to journalists. But did active measures stop at the end of the Cold War? ""The Soviet Union may have dissolved in 1990-91 but Soviet intelligence stayed virtually intact both in terms of its organisation and the goals it pursued - and that includes active measures,"" says Mr Boghardt. There were also new opportunities thanks to technology. ""In the 1990s when the Internet slowly emerged, it was really a no-brainer to start to use a platform that made it a lot easier to leak anonymously, to give information anonymously to the public,"" argues Prof Rid. The KGB did allegedly try and influence American elections in the past - for instance by pushing the ""Reagan means War"" line in the 1984 US election - andthe US intelligence community believes that it did so again in 2016 through a wide-ranging influence operation. FBI Director James Comey has confirmed there was an open investigation over the links between the Trump campaign and Russia This included hacking into organisations like the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign officials' emails and feeding information to websites. ""What we've seen during the Cold War, somewhat counter-intuitively, is artisanal active measures - very labour intensive at the front end, down to using white gloves when you sign the letter in order to avoid fingerprints, the letter that you then mail anonymously,"" says Prof Rid. ""It really required good tradecraft. But what we see in 2016 is the opposite: lazy industrial scale hacking and dumping."" The leaking of real information is different from the creation of fake news stories, but they too are alleged to have appeared in 2016 although it is harder to trace their origins in the online world. In the current environment, the term fake news has taken on many meanings. Russian intelligence's active measures may well be part of a chaotic mix. But in a world in which accusations of fake news and conspiracy are bandied around freely, even exposing such measures can be swept up in a whirlwind of claim and counter-claim. The result is confusion. And more divisions which any future active measures can then exploit. Gordon Corera presentedSubversion: Weston BBC Radio 4 on Friday 31 March at 11:00 BST.

" Major crimes like the Krays’ reign of terror, the Great Train Robbery andthe Hatton Garden jewel heisthave spawned fascinating dramas. But what about the cunning plans that failed, not because of brilliant detective work, but because of the criminals’ own incompetence? Here’s a selection of our favourites... As a burglar, you wouldn’t think that keeping on top of your social media chores would be a priority. But it was for a burglar in West Virginia in 2009, who took the unusual step of checking his Facebook account… on the computer of the woman from whose home he’d just pinched two diamond rings. He then forgot to log out, thereby giving police a fairly sizeable clue as to his identity. If you've gone to the trouble of hiring professional make-up artists to change your skin colour, using prosthetics, and hiring multiple getaway cars to confuse police, it would be a terrible mistake to leave your mobile in one of the getaway vehicles. That's exactly what the Graff Diamond robbers in London did before robbing a shop of over £60m worth of jewels. The police traced numbers dialled on the phone, leading to the capture of four robbers, all of whom received hefty sentences. Arthur Cheney of California was a prolific bank robber in California and was caught in 2007 when his car was searched and police found a to-do list. One entry on the list was “Robbery – 100s and 50s only."" A man who clearly believed in ""go big or go home"" was Thomas Blood, an Irish adventurer who decided to go for the crown jewels in 1671. He assumed the dress and character of a parson and made friends with the keeper of the crown jewels. He asked to see the collection and then bashed the keeper over the head with a sword. The keeper unexpectedly regained consciousness and sounded the alarm, and Blood was caught. Unbelievably, King Charles was amused at Blood’s bravado and gave him the chance to retire in peace in Ireland. A sense of direction is fairly essential when planning a robbery. Two thieves based near Brisbane decided to rob a jewellers but broke into the neighbouring fried chicken shop by mistake. They held that up, having clearly decided to make the best of a bad job, escaped with the takings but were caught and arrested. They then tried again, this time smashing through the back doors, but found themselves in the animal welfare charity shop next door. The Millennium Dome in 2000 was the target for a group of jewel thieves going for the De Beers diamond exhibition. Their plan was to escape up the Thames by speed boat. In a police sting worthy of Hollywood, the tipped-off Flying Squad dressed as cleaning staff and foiled the ram-raid attempt. Hurrah! Crime doesn’t pay, boys and girls. And incompetent crime makes you a laughing stock to boot... Criminologist David Wilson talks to former bank robber Noel ""Razor"" Smith about his life in crime.

"The Rentberry website is expanding across the US How would you feel if, desperate for somewhere to live, you had to bid against other prospective renters? Some people were perturbed when Rentberry - a website that runs rental auctions - launched last year. In fact, inan article its own boss highlights,external, one tenant rights lawyer described the site as ""callous"". ""We made a huge splash,"" chief executive Alex Lubinsky recalls. The site allows landlords to set a preferred rent. Prospective tenants then bid below that figure to see if they can get a good deal. During the process, landlords see not only the bids, but information about the would-be tenants - including their credit score. There are now about 100,000 properties and more than 50,000 users on the site, which is also expanding to offer listings across the whole of the United States. Alex Lubinksy claims that Rentberry can help making the renting process more transparent Mr Lubinsky insists that the system is fair. He argues, for instance, that it is better than going into a closed or partially closed bidding system where tenants do not know the full details of what others may be offering. And he reveals a new feature: in the coming weeks Rentberry will implement a machine learning system that will analyse local rental market data to help landlords set reasonable prices. It will also try to rate prospective tenants for landlords based on information that Rentberry has about them, such as how many years they have been working. ""People say we create competition, but competition already exists,"" he adds, arguing that ""only the market"" can suggest what is a fair price for a property. In New York, for example, around 4,000 properties are listed on the site - and in such a ""hot market"" they tend to be let on Rentberry within four or five days, says Mr Lubinsky. At the moment, the price of rental properties in many parts of the US is going up. Mortgage rates are also up - so more people who would like to buy a house are having to rent instead, which further increases demand, explains Adam DeScantis at the National Association of Realtors. ""First-time buyers made up 32% of buyers in February, historically that should be closer to 40%,"" he says. More than a third of US households are renters - nearly 110 million people. The rise in renters has also followed millions of foreclosures thanks to the financial crisis, points out Jonathan Spader at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. ""Rent increases in many cities in the US have outpaced incomes, making affordability a challenge,"" he explains. Rentberry has faced criticism from some who feel it is likely to push up prices - only those with the biggest budgets will fare well when bidding, they say. In response, Mr Lubinsky says that, on average, agreed rents were 5% less than the landlord's asking price on the platform. But how does that compare with what the rest of the market is doing? ""We compared the data on the rental platforms in US for the largest cities (including New York and Miami) and at this moment the final rental price on Rentberry is 4.3% lower than on other sites,"" he adds. Mr Lubinsky also points out that the site requires bidders to submit personal information such as their social security number in order to take part in an auction - an effort to stop people trying to drive up the cost with false bids. Renters bid for properties - with landlords able to see credit scores and choose the best offers ""People who actually submit offers are dead serious about getting the place,"" he says. That might not be enough to satisfy some of the more traditional property managers, suggests New York estate agent Douglas Wagner at Bond New York. ""Sometimes they want to meet and interview a tenant personally before they offer a lease,"" he explains. UK-based property expert Kate Faulkner also points out that not everything can be decided on data alone. Rentberry says it provides transparency to the rental market In general, prospective tenants and landlords need to meet, she argues, and get ""reassurance that they are going to be able to help each other over time"". Mr Wagner explains, though, that at the moment the rental market is hotting up in New York so believes that perhaps some landlords will be tempted by a new approach. ""They may want to buy in and test it,"" he suggests. ""But I also anticipate that the more traditional, older generation management companies might resist because they're so accustomed to the way they do things.""

"This video can not be played Serbian spoof election candidate Luka Maksimovic may attract more than 10% of the vote What does it say about a country, specifically its politicians, when one of the three leading election contenders is a satirical candidate? Going into the final days of campaigning, Ljubisa Preletacevic is vying with well-established political players in the race to become Serbia's next president. They include a former president of the United Nations General Assembly, Vuk Jeremic; the ultranationalist leader of the Serbian Radical Party, Vojislav Seselj; and a former minister of the economy, Sasa Radulovic. Preletacevic has been consistently out-polling all of them. Not bad for a man who does not actually exist. Posters of ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj (L) vie with those of favourite Aleksandar Vucic For all the considerable publicity about his presidential bid, it would take an upset of unprecedented scale for him to prevent Aleksandar Vucic from becoming head of state. The incumbent prime minister looks a reasonable bet to pass the 50% threshold and win in the first round. But the man on the white horse is an irresistible story. Read more from Guy: Train row almost pulls Serbia and Kosovo off the rails Can Belgrade's artisans survive? The creator of Ljubisa Preletacevic is a 25-year-old student, Luka Maksimovic. He came up with the character for last year's local elections in Mladenovac, a suburb of Serbia's capital, Belgrade. The student and his friends were as stunned as everyone else when Preletacevic led a coalition (known as ""Hit It Hard"" or ""Keep It Strong"", depending on the translator) to 20% of the vote. This video can not be played Luka Maksimovic's campaign video pokes fun at Serbian corruption The character was supposed to be a joke - a parody of an opportunist politician. The namePreletacevicis a pun:prelatacis a word used to describe a political figure who switches parties for political gain. The ever-present white suit and his nickname, ""Beli"" (white), also cock a snook at politicians who promise probity on the campaign trail, but head straight for the trough once elected. In contrast, Preletacevic and his cohorts brazenly commit to making false promises. One particularly eyebrow-raising proposal was a plan to open a euthanasia department for pensioners in a local hospital, to cut down on the cost of care for the elderly. Preletacevic pokes fun at corruption, a major problem in Serbia The parody struck such a chord that Preletacevic's SPN party, which stands roughly for ""Have You tasted the sauerkraut?"" has become the biggest opposition grouping on Mladenovac council, with 12 seats. His appeal appears to be spreading nationwide, to the considerable chagrin of economic reformers and ultranationalists alike. His alter-ego, Luka Maksimovic, has responded with grim satisfaction to double-digit poll ratings, accusing Serbian politicians of being ""dirty and corrupt"" and declaring that it is time ""at least to try to do something to change that"". Whether a comedy candidate with little-to-nothing in the way of serious policies can promote a meaningful analysis of the shortcomings of Serbian politics is another question. Among the main candidates are: ex-foreign minister Vuk Jeremic (L), former ombudsman Sasa Jankovic and ex-economy minister Sasa Radulovic Veteran political analyst Bosko Jaksic has mixed feelings. ""He does have two effects. He can encourage young voters who don't want to go to the polls. So he can, with his satire, mobilise them. ""But the second effect is that he is counting on those who are dissatisfied."" It is not favourite Aleksandar Vucic who is losing votes, he believes, but his most serious challengers, ex-ombudsman Sasa Jankovic and former foreign minister Vuk Jeremic. ""This is a serious moment and it's not time for games and humour,"" he warns. Aleksandar Vucic will, in all probability, complete a smooth transition from the prime minister's office to the presidency. And the power base in Serbia will go with him. But perhaps, as well as raising laughs, Ljubisa Preletacevic will raise awareness that Serbian politics has problems that need serious consideration.

"The Trump administration's immigration enforcement priorities are beginning to affect legal residents as well as undocumented men and women. This week,a number of visa and green card holders,externalwere faced with the prospect of deportation, whichstirred debate,externalabout what crimes should disqualify an immigrant from staying in the US. One man,externalis fighting to have his case retried because he claims his lawyer failed to instruct him that a guilty plea would initiate the deportation process. The case is currently being heard by the US Supreme Court. Here's a look at some of the people making news for facing deportation this week. DrPankaj Satija and Dr Monika Ummat Granted astay:30March,inHouston, Texas Drs Satija and Ummat, a married couple, both had legal status to live and work in the US as neurologists. Both have green card applications sponsored by their employers. Because of a backlog in processing green card requests going back to 2008, the doctors have been granted provisional legal status to be in the US until their applications are officially approved. When Dr Satija's father fell ill in October, the couple flew to India. A Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agent stamped their travel paperwork despite the fact that it had expired the previous year. No one noticed the mistake until the doctors tried to return to the US, when another CBP agent noticed the document had expired four months earlier. Initially, immigration agents allowed Dr Satija and Dr Ummat to re-enter the US and attempt to correct their paperwork. However, a few weeks ago they were informed that they would have to leave the US and would not be granted temporary permission to stay. Their lawyer, Gordon Quan, says his clients were able to secure a 90-day extension to fix their paperwork. ""We were just trying to get some time for the sake of the patients because people had surgeries, were in the middle of operations,"" says Mr Quan. ""I got a call from the hospital saying that some patients may even die if the doctors are forced to leave during that time."" Xiaoyuan Zhang, 22 Detainedby Ice:23January, in Maricopa County, Arizona An Arizona State University student from China, Mr Zhang wasconvicted of illegally filming women,externalin a campus bathroom in January. Mr Zhang was in the country on a student visa. After his conviction, Mr Zhang received a sentence of 10 years of supervised probation and was prohibited from contacting any of the victims he filmed. However, Mr Zhang now faces deportation because an immigration judge decided his legal basis for being in the US ended when he was convicted for felony voyeurism. He remains in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) custody at the Florence Correctional Center in Arizona, awaiting arrangements to be deported to China. JoseCoyote Perez, 41 Detained: February,inLivingston, New York JosÃ© Coyote PÃ©rez, far left Mr Perez is a dairy farm employee and an advocate for migrant workers. He was working on a campaign to allow undocumented residents of New York to apply for driver's licenses before Ice agents arrested him in February. Born in Mexico, he has lived in Livingston County, New York, for 17 years and has four children, three of whom are US citizens. Mr Perez had a deportation case against him that was administratively closed in September 2016. He had no criminal record, and possessed a social security number, and a work permit. Having an immigration case administratively closed ""is essentially like being in limbo,"" says Fox. ""You're not on a path to citizenship, but you're not going to be deported as long as you comply with the conditions."" When Ice officials asked him to come into a local office for a routine check-in this year,he was subsequently detained,external. ""I was part of the community and represented my colleagues and I felt free finally, after living in fear for so long,"" Mr Perez said in a written statement. ""People know me, I speak up, I am not hiding, and when they called me to go in and sign I went, I didn't hide."" Mr Perez is scheduled to have a hearing to set his bail on 19 April. Adolfo Sanchez-Reyes, 43 Detained:24March, from Rockville, Maryland Two weeks ago, Sanchez-Reyes's son, Henry Sanchez-Milian,was arrested on rape chargesin Rockville, Maryland, after allegedly assaulting a 14-year-old girl in a high school bathroom. On 24 March, officers looked into Mr Sanchez-Reyes' immigration status as part of their investigation into his son's alleged crime. He was arrested for residing in the US illegally. Mr Sanchez-Reyes has been issued a notice to appear in immigration court. He is currently detained at the Howard County Detention Facility in Maryland and could face deportation to Guatemala. Francisco K Rodriguez Dominguez, 25 Released onbond:27March,in Portland, Oregon Mr Rodriguez Dominguez, a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was detained by Ice agents at his Portland home on 26 March. He has lived in the US since he was 5 years old. In December, Mr Rodriguez Dominguez faced charges for drunk driving, but a judge allowed his to enter a diversion program that would clear the charge from his record. If the charge remained, Mr Rodriguez Dominguez's Daca status could have been revoked. After protests demanding his release, Mr Rodriguez Dominguez left Ice custody on bond on Monday.

"It is clear that the UK will face a tough divorce from the European Union after European Council President Donald Tusk characterised the forthcoming talks as ""difficult, complex"" and possibly ""confrontational"". From the outset it is clear that the EU side will control the agenda. That was underlined again on Friday in an early skirmish over procedure. Theresa May wanted divorce talks to run in parallel with negotiations about a future trading relationship. That won't happen. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been quick to rule that out and was given swift backing by the French president Francois Hollande. That was reinforced again on Friday with the leak of the European Council's negotiating guidelines. Why is this so important? Europe's leaders want to ensure that Britain agrees to the principles governing the terms of Brexit as a condition for talks continuing. As Mr Tusk said, the UK cannot just walk away without paying debts. Angela Merkel insists the principles of Brexit should be negotiated before a trade deal with the UK can be considered On the EU side there is another calculation: it will be easier to ensure unity among the 27 member states on the terms of the divorce, rather than on trade, when different national interests could come into play. Preserving unity is a fundamental concern and Mr Tusk insisted that the EU ""will act as one"". By insisting that the principles of the divorce bill be settled first, the leaders of the 27 are also stopping Mrs May using payments as a bargaining chip over the future trading relationship. There were, however, some hints at flexibility, with Mr Tusk saying that the EU would monitor the negotiations and determine when ""sufficient progress had been achieved to allow talks to proceed to the next phase of a future relationship"". Of course, it is the EU that will decide what progress has been made but those negotiations on trade could begin as early as the autumn. Key points from the UK's Article 50 letter Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU What is Article 50? A guide to what happens now What will happen to UK trade post-Brexit? EU sets out phased Brexit strategy For the EU there are four priorities in the talks: settling the divorce bill which some in Brussels have estimated at â¬60bn (Â£50bn), establishing the future status of EU citizens living in the UK, keeping open Northern Ireland's borders and agreeing which laws companies will operate under post-Brexit. But EU leaders have opened the door to holding trade talks before Brexit has been completed and some in the UK will see that as a promising gesture. The negotiating guidelines allow for a transition period before a future trading agreement is in place. In Brussels there is an expectation that some kind of transition period will be needed after the divorce talks have been completed. A trade deal can only be formally concluded once the UK has ended its membership. EU leaders are expected to finalise the union's negotiating position on 29 April The EU sees that transitional period as being ""limited"" and will insist that the UK continues to abide by Union rules during this period. That could prove very controversial because it means there is a very real prospect that, come the next UK general election in 2020, some payments to the EU are still being made with a continuing role for the European Court. There are differences among Europe's leaders over how constructive they are willing to be in the talks. Some want to demonstrate that leaving the EU is not easy, that divorce must hurt. The French believe there must be an element of pain to deter others, although the prospect of other countries leaving is currently very remote. Mr Tusk's perspective is that the process of leaving is ""punitive"" enough without further punishment being necessary. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Friday that in calls he had made over the past two days there had been ""lots of goodwill' from European Union ministers. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has emphasised the ""goodwill"" shown by other EU members The wider reaction is that the UK, by triggering Article 50, has stepped into the unknown and taken a huge risk. ""A highly indebted Britain has most to lose from uncertainty,"" was one assessment. The mood in the European press has been generally gloomy, seeing departure as an act of self-harm, of Britain being tied up in Kafkaesque procedures, of British citizens being worse off by â¬5,000 (Â£4,300) a year. Some papers focused on the UK's future isolation, repeating what passes for accepted wisdom in Brussels that in a global world countries are better off in larger blocs. Among some commentators there was the scarcely veiled hope that at some stage the UK will return to the European fold, tail between legs. The British strategy is to be constructive towards the EU project and to deliver on the ""sincere co-operation"" it has promised Angela Merkel. It has accepted that some payments will have to be made to meet existing obligations, that EU citizens will have to retain rights during the negotiating period and that there may be some limited role for the EU's courts in settling trade disputes. Theresa May will have to balance her room for manoeuvre with the demands of her own party The UK has some cards: it can offer help with security and intelligence but, by tying that assistance to the future trading relationship, it prompted German MPs to cry ""blackmail"". Mr Johnson responded by saying that Britain's commitment to EU defence was ""unconditional"". But it is clear that every time the UK tries to play its cards there will be voices, particularly from the European Parliament, in full complaint. Mrs May and her team will have to handle the parliament with great skill, as it will have a say on any eventual deal. Europe will be on alert for any attempt by Britain to divide and rule the remaining 27 EU countries. Mrs Merkel has set out the German interest: despite intensive lobbying from German car manufacturers it is the unity and integrity of the European Union that will be the priority - the EU must not be damaged or weakened by these negotiations. These guidelines will be fleshed out into a more comprehensive negotiating document that will be presented to Europe's leaders at the end of April. Mrs May knows compromises will have to be made to avoid the talks breaking down, but her room for manoeuvre is limited by sections of her own party who are determined to ensure a clean break with the EU.
