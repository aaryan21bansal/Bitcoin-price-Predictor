"The helicopter was photographed taking off from the pitch shortly before the crash A helicopter carrying the owner of Leicester City FC crashed in flames near the club's ground, killing five people. The club confirmed its owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, was among those killed, along with two members of his staff, another passenger, and the pilot. Here is what we know so far about the crash. The helicopter took off from the King Power Stadium at about 20:30 BST on Saturday, as it often does after Leicester City games. BT Sport cameras captured the take-off on live TV, as presenter Jake Humphrey watched and commented on it with pundits Owen Hargreaves, Chris Sutton and John Hartson. The helicopter was captured by television cameras as it took off from the pitch A bang was heard shortly after as the helicopter spiralled out of control and crashed near a car park. Former Leicester City and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton witnessed the crash when he was coming out of the ground with his wife. ""We saw the chairman's helicopter above us and all of a sudden it seemed to be making a funny noise and started to spin,"" he said. Leicester helicopter crash victims named Fans lead tributes to chairman Who was Leicester's billionaire owner? ""All of a sudden it started coming towards us and my wife started panicking. ""It seemed to drop a little bit and then obviously crash. ""Then there were sparks coming out the back and then some small flames, and then larger flames, I mean this all happened very quickly, and then suddenly it just blew up."" Freelance photographer Ryan Brown had been at the match covering the game. ""I heard the helicopter take off,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I turned around and it made a whirring noise and grinding noise and then went silent, it was spinning out of control. ""The blades had stopped spinning and then there was a big bang and a big fireball. Lots of people started running towards the scene; as I came around the corner there was a huge fireball. ""It crashed right near the stadium. It just cleared the stadium roof and landed in an industrial park next to it."" Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, Izabela Roza Lechowicz and Eric Swaffer were killed in the crash Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, 60, was a billionaire and founder of duty-free consortium King Power International. He bought Leicester City in 2010 and the club went on to win the Premier League title in 2015-16 in one of the greatest sporting surprises of all time. The father-of-four was ranked as the fifth richest person in Thailand by Forbes Magazine. He used to fly to and from Leicester's home games and his properties in London and Berkshire, landing his helicopter on the pitch. Two members of his staff, Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, were with him on his final flight. Eight-year fairytale ends in tragedy Who were the victims? Owner's wife and son visit stadium Ms Nusara was a former model who was runner-up in Miss Thailand Universe 2005, and was voted most photogenic in the same contest. Little is known about Mr Kaveporn but his Facebook page said he was from Bangkok. The helicopter's pilot, Eric Swaffer, had more than 20 years of flying experience as a private jet and helicopter pilot, flying helicopters for live media broadcasting including Channel 4's The Big Breakfast. He lived in Surrey with his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz, who died alongside him in the crash. Ms Lechowicz moved to the UK from Poland in 1997 and became a pilot after meeting Mr Swaffer. She was a winner of the #polka100 award, an accolade for ""exceptional women who inspire the Polish community in Britain"". This video can not be played Fans were visibly shocked following the crash on Saturday evening An investigation into the crash is being led by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), which investigates civil aircraft accidents across the UK. The investigation will look into how the Agusta Westland AW169 helicopter crashed in what is believed to be the first accident involving an AW169 aircraft. The owners have two helicopters - an older one registered as G-LCFC and a newer one registered as G-VSKP. The helicopter that landed at the stadium was the G-VSKP. Jim Rowlands, a former RAF Puma crew member, said the spinning nature of the aircraft indicated there was a problem with the tail rotor - the part of a helicopter that normally stops it from spinning around in the opposite direction to the main rotor blades. ""If you lose your tail rotor it's almost impossible to recover from,"" said Mr Rowlands. ""You can't get out of it. It would be more luck than judgment if you were to survive."" His ""gut feeling"" was there was some kind of mechanical problem but said there were ""so many things that it could have been"". ""It could have been a human factor, it could have been pilot error or poor maintenance that led to something,"" he said. An AAIB spokesman said: ""A team from the AAIB has been deployed to the site and is investigating. ""Anyone with information that might be helpful to the investigation is asked to contact the police."" Fans gathered at the King Power Stadium to leave flowers and pay their respects The Duke of Cambridge led the tributes to Mr Vichai on Monday, saying he was lucky to have known him for several years. ""He was a businessman of strong values who was dedicated to his family and who supported a number of important charitable causes,"" Prince William, who is president of the FA, said. ""He made such a big contribution to football, not least through Leicester City's magical 2016 season that captured the imagination of the world."" Former Leicester City and England striker Gary Lineker tweeted to say he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Mr Vichai's death. He signed off the Match of the Day programme on Saturday by saying it had been a ""dreadful day"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking outside the stadium, club ambassador Alan Birchenall said Leicester City owed ""everything"" to Mr Vichai. ""I had to pay my respects to a lovely guy,"" he said. ""We owe everything to him. We wouldn't have won it [the Premier League] without him. We wouldn't have got near it without him. ""There won't be a dry eye among any of the staff today."" Mr Swaffer's friend Lucie Morris-Marr said the pilot was a ""veteran in the field"" and would have done all he could to prevent lives being lost in the crash. She described him as a ""funny and vivacious"" man who was in an ""aviation love story"" with Ms Lechowicz. The couple were professional pilots who lived together in Camberley, Surrey. Ms Lechowicz moved to the UK from Poland in 1997. In a statement, the Polish embassy said: ""She [Mrs Lechowicz] was a great pilot, winner of the #Polka100 contest. It contributed to the creation of a positive image of Poland in the UK."" Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The outpouring of grief is a testament to how many people's lives were touched by those on board.""

One fan said of the family: ""They are the heart and soul of Leicester City Football Club. ""If it wasn't for them none of this would have been possible in recent years and dreams wouldn't have come true. ""It's very disturbing, not just for fans of the club but for everyone in the football world.""

Mr Vichai has regularly given supporters free beer and pies at matches to mark special occasions, made donations to the city hospital, and treated the 2016 title-winning squad to a fleet of blue BMWs.

The reception area is described as silent, people looking around and crying and not knowing what to do and consoling each other. I remember the owners taking over. I said hello to them in native tongue, their face lit up. I have generated relationships with them, seen them in Thailand in Bangkok in their home surrounding, they are really nice people. The chairman looked at me today on the way to the executive box and said ""hello and good afternoon"". He donated millions of pounds to Leicester Royal Infirmary, and also gave money to the University of Leicester. He's taken Leicester into his own heart - it's a hugely important place for him that he's made home. It's a one-club city here in Leicester, and we've welcomed him with open arms.

Mayor Peduto said: ""To the victims' families and friends - we will be here to help you through this horrific episode - the darkest day of Pittsburgh's history.

The suspect is still in hospital, in fair condition with multiple gunshot wounds, but is scheduled to make his first court appearance at 13:30 local time (17:30 GMT) on Monday. Officials said there was nothing to indicate he had any accomplices. One injured officer was released from hospital on Saturday, another should be released on Sunday, with the other two needing more treatment. The remaining two injured people are members of the congregation. The 29 charges were announced in a statement,externalissued by the US Attorney's Office of the Western District of Pennsylvania: Eleven counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence.

""One of the worst I've seen, and I've [worked] on some plane crashes. It's very bad."" US media said he had shouted ""All Jews must die"" as he carried out the attack. Social media posts by someone with the name Robert Bowers were also reported to be full of anti-Semitic comments. Suspected attacker Robert Bowers FBI special agent Bob Jones told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to the attack. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Pittsburgh People lit candles as they mourned the victims of the attack In the dwindling light, and with the cold autumn rain falling, hundreds gathered in front of the 6th Presbyterian church just a few streets away from the Tree of Life Synagogue. Holding their candles, they sang the Jewish prayer of healing. The elders in the community had wanted to wait a day before holding the vigil, but the young people said no - they wanted an immediate chance to share their grief and voice their hurt. Fifteen-year-old Sophia Levin declared that she was a different Jew today to the one she was yesterday. Anti-Semitism, she said, had been something she thought happened elsewhere and in earlier times; but now she knew it was right here, right now. Some of these young people have been involved in the student gun control movement that sprang up after the Parkland shooting earlier this year. One of them, Rebecca Glickman, told the crowd that gun control was needed now more than ever. She told me that an anti-Semite with a gun is more dangerous than an anti-Semite without a gun, so that's a good place to start. He described the gunman as a ""maniac"" and suggested the US should ""stiffen up our laws of the death penalty"". ""These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop,"" he said.

"A vigil is held at the Allegheny County Soldiers Memorial in Pittsburgh Survivors of the deadly gun attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue have recalled how they took refuge and hid in storage rooms to avoid the roaming attacker. One congregation leader said their training in active-shooter situations had helped save lives. When the suspect was detained after a shootout, he reportedly told Swat officers he wanted ""all Jews to die"". The 11 victims were named on Sunday and included a husband and wife, and a woman aged 97. Another six people were injured, including four policemen. Would you tackle a gunman? America's gun culture in 10 charts Mayor Bill Peduto said that this was the ""darkest day of Pittsburgh's history"". The suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, faces 29 criminal charges over what is thought to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. He is still in hospital being treated for multiple gunshot wounds but is scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Three congregations were reportedly meeting at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill district of Pittsburgh on Saturday morning. Members of the New Light congregation were meeting in a basement area,external, Carl Solomon, 81, a congregation member who turned back from the synagogue but had spoken to survivors, told the New York Times. Pittsburgh shooting: What we know so far Richard Gottfried, 65, and Daniel Stein, 71, were in the kitchen and both were shot dead. Congregation co-president Stephen Cohen told the paper there was ""no place to hide"" there. He said Rabbi Jonathan Perlman had shepherded two other people into a storage room, although one, Melvin Wax, 88, chose to later open the door and was shot dead. Mr Cohen said ""everyone froze but Rabbi Perlman"". He told the Associated Press news agency that leaders had taken part in active-shooter drills ""and I think that's what ultimately saved the people who were saved"". Worshipper Joseph Charny, 90, said he saw a man appear at the door and heard shots. He told the Washington Post:""I looked up and there were all these dead bodies."",externalHe said he and two others hid in an upstairs storage room until it was safe to come out. They were named on Sunday as Joyce Fienberg, 75; Rose Mallinger, 97; Jerry Rabinowitz, 66; Cecil Rosenthal, 59, and his brother David, 54; married couple Bernice Simon, 84, and Sylvan Simon, 86; and Irving Younger, 69. 'He was a beautiful person, a beautiful soul' Tributes have been pouring in from those who knew the victims. Myron Snider described his friend Melvin Wax as a ""sweet, sweet guy"" and unfailingly generous. The Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh Ben Schmitt, a patient of Jerry Rabinowitz, said the family medical practitioner was ""kind and funny... [he] completely personified the term 'bedside manner'"". Cecil and David Rosenthal were described as ""kind, good people with a strong faith and respect for everyone around"". One injured officer was released from hospital on Saturday, another was due to be released on Sunday, with the other two needing more treatment. By Hugo Bachega in Pittsburgh All day during a cold, grey Sunday, residents and others brought flowers and candles to the entrance of the synagogue in Squirrel Hill, the heart of Jewish life in Pittsburgh. There were words of disbelief and a common determination that they would not allow this tragedy to change such a vibrant place. ""You're going to see an outpouring of love and support and a strengthened community. Not just the Jewish community but Pittsburgh as a whole,"" said 34-year-old Molly Butler, who came with her children, Mikey and Lily, aged nine and six. At an evening vigil at a local hall, hundreds gathered inside, dozens more outside in the light rain, to say this was an attack not only on one community but on their entire city. The message: ""Love will defeat hatred, light will defeat darkness."" Read more from Hugo He was armed with three Glock handguns and an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. He owned them legally, a law enforcement officer told the Associated Press. This video can not be played Police audio of the moment the suspect is captured Officers arrived after receiving calls about an active shooter at 09:54 local time (13:54 GMT) on Saturday and encountered the suspect as he was trying to leave. The gunman fired at them and ran upstairs. As Swat officers searched for victims, the gunman opened fire on them and injured two. The suspect was detained after being wounded in an exchange of fire with officers. Officials said the gunman had made statements regarding genocide as well as a desire to kill Jewish people. There are few details about Robert Bowers but there is a trail of anti-Semitic comments on social media. Suspected attacker Robert Bowers His neighbour, Chris Hall, told AP: ""The most terrifying thing is just how normal he seemed."" Officials said there was nothing to indicate he had any accomplices. FBI special agent Robert Jones told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to the attack. The 29 charges were announced in a statement,externalissued by the US Attorney's Office of the Western District of Pennsylvania: Eleven counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence.

"The helicopter was photographed taking off from the pitch shortly before the crash A helicopter carrying the owner of Leicester City FC crashed in flames near the club's ground, killing five people. The club confirmed its owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, was among those killed, along with two members of his staff, another passenger, and the pilot. Here is what we know so far about the crash. The helicopter took off from the King Power Stadium at about 20:30 BST on Saturday, as it often does after Leicester City games. BT Sport cameras captured the take-off on live TV, as presenter Jake Humphrey watched and commented on it with pundits Owen Hargreaves, Chris Sutton and John Hartson. The helicopter was captured by television cameras as it took off from the pitch A bang was heard shortly after as the helicopter spiralled out of control and crashed near a car park. Former Leicester City and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton witnessed the crash when he was coming out of the ground with his wife. ""We saw the chairman's helicopter above us and all of a sudden it seemed to be making a funny noise and started to spin,"" he said. Leicester helicopter crash victims named Fans lead tributes to chairman Who was Leicester's billionaire owner? ""All of a sudden it started coming towards us and my wife started panicking. ""It seemed to drop a little bit and then obviously crash. ""Then there were sparks coming out the back and then some small flames, and then larger flames, I mean this all happened very quickly, and then suddenly it just blew up."" Freelance photographer Ryan Brown had been at the match covering the game. ""I heard the helicopter take off,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I turned around and it made a whirring noise and grinding noise and then went silent, it was spinning out of control. ""The blades had stopped spinning and then there was a big bang and a big fireball. Lots of people started running towards the scene; as I came around the corner there was a huge fireball. ""It crashed right near the stadium. It just cleared the stadium roof and landed in an industrial park next to it."" Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, Izabela Roza Lechowicz and Eric Swaffer were killed in the crash Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, 60, was a billionaire and founder of duty-free consortium King Power International. He bought Leicester City in 2010 and the club went on to win the Premier League title in 2015-16 in one of the greatest sporting surprises of all time. The father-of-four was ranked as the fifth richest person in Thailand by Forbes Magazine. He used to fly to and from Leicester's home games and his properties in London and Berkshire, landing his helicopter on the pitch. Two members of his staff, Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, were with him on his final flight. Eight-year fairytale ends in tragedy Who were the victims? Owner's wife and son visit stadium Ms Nusara was a former model who was runner-up in Miss Thailand Universe 2005, and was voted most photogenic in the same contest. Little is known about Mr Kaveporn but his Facebook page said he was from Bangkok. The helicopter's pilot, Eric Swaffer, had more than 20 years of flying experience as a private jet and helicopter pilot, flying helicopters for live media broadcasting including Channel 4's The Big Breakfast. He lived in Surrey with his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz, who died alongside him in the crash. Ms Lechowicz moved to the UK from Poland in 1997 and became a pilot after meeting Mr Swaffer. She was a winner of the #polka100 award, an accolade for ""exceptional women who inspire the Polish community in Britain"". This video can not be played Fans were visibly shocked following the crash on Saturday evening An investigation into the crash is being led by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), which investigates civil aircraft accidents across the UK. The investigation will look into how the Agusta Westland AW169 helicopter crashed in what is believed to be the first accident involving an AW169 aircraft. The owners have two helicopters - an older one registered as G-LCFC and a newer one registered as G-VSKP. The helicopter that landed at the stadium was the G-VSKP. Jim Rowlands, a former RAF Puma crew member, said the spinning nature of the aircraft indicated there was a problem with the tail rotor - the part of a helicopter that normally stops it from spinning around in the opposite direction to the main rotor blades. ""If you lose your tail rotor it's almost impossible to recover from,"" said Mr Rowlands. ""You can't get out of it. It would be more luck than judgment if you were to survive."" His ""gut feeling"" was there was some kind of mechanical problem but said there were ""so many things that it could have been"". ""It could have been a human factor, it could have been pilot error or poor maintenance that led to something,"" he said. An AAIB spokesman said: ""A team from the AAIB has been deployed to the site and is investigating. ""Anyone with information that might be helpful to the investigation is asked to contact the police."" Fans gathered at the King Power Stadium to leave flowers and pay their respects The Duke of Cambridge led the tributes to Mr Vichai on Monday, saying he was lucky to have known him for several years. ""He was a businessman of strong values who was dedicated to his family and who supported a number of important charitable causes,"" Prince William, who is president of the FA, said. ""He made such a big contribution to football, not least through Leicester City's magical 2016 season that captured the imagination of the world."" Former Leicester City and England striker Gary Lineker tweeted to say he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Mr Vichai's death. He signed off the Match of the Day programme on Saturday by saying it had been a ""dreadful day"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking outside the stadium, club ambassador Alan Birchenall said Leicester City owed ""everything"" to Mr Vichai. ""I had to pay my respects to a lovely guy,"" he said. ""We owe everything to him. We wouldn't have won it [the Premier League] without him. We wouldn't have got near it without him. ""There won't be a dry eye among any of the staff today."" Mr Swaffer's friend Lucie Morris-Marr said the pilot was a ""veteran in the field"" and would have done all he could to prevent lives being lost in the crash. She described him as a ""funny and vivacious"" man who was in an ""aviation love story"" with Ms Lechowicz. The couple were professional pilots who lived together in Camberley, Surrey. Ms Lechowicz moved to the UK from Poland in 1997. In a statement, the Polish embassy said: ""She [Mrs Lechowicz] was a great pilot, winner of the #Polka100 contest. It contributed to the creation of a positive image of Poland in the UK."" Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The outpouring of grief is a testament to how many people's lives were touched by those on board."" Leicester City won the Premier League under Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's ownership Season ticket holder Richard Jackson, of Market Bosworth, said he was ""devastated"" by what had happened. ""These owners have been absolutely fantastic; probably the best owners in the whole English system,"" he said. One fan said of the family: ""They are the heart and soul of Leicester City Football Club. ""If it wasn't for them none of this would have been possible in recent years and dreams wouldn't have come true. ""It's very disturbing, not just for fans of the club but for everyone in the football world."" Leicester City season ticket-holder Richard Mobbs (left) and Thai student Anupat Maturongpituck both came to the King Power Stadium to pay their respects Richard Mobbs, from Burton Overy in Leicestershire, said he last saw the chairman in June when they discussed a player who was about to join the club. Mr Mobbs described Mr Srivaddhanaprabha as a ""lovely, quiet, down to earth man"", and paid tribute to his family. Mr Vichai's death has had a ""great impact"" in Thailand, according to a Thai student studying in Leicester Anupat Maturongpituck, a student from Thailand studying at the University of Leicester, came to the King Power Stadium on Sunday to ""pay my respects"", adding news of the crash has had a ""great impact"" in Thailand. Mr Vichai has regularly given supporters free beer and pies at matches to mark special occasions, made donations to the city hospital, and treated the 2016 title-winning squad to a fleet of blue BMWs. Another fan said: ""It's ended up as probably the darkest day in Leicester City Football Club's history."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil's presidential election. But who is he? Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won a sweeping victory in Brazil's presidential election. The former army captain won 55.2% of the vote against 44.8% for Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party. Mr Bolsonaro's pledge to fight crime and corruption following a string of scandals have won him mass support. However critics are worried by his praise of Brazil's former dictatorship, and by his comments on race, women and homosexuality. In one infamous incident in 2015 he told a fellow lawmaker she was too ugly to rape. Mr Bolsonaro's controversial comments, his pro-gun stance and his populist approach to politics have led to some media dubbing him ""Trump of the Tropics"". Jair Bolsonaro: The Trump of the Tropics? Brazil's swing to the right brings hope and fear What are Bolsonaro's policies? President Trump himself took to Twitter on Monday to praise the Brazilian president-elect. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. For his supporters, Mr Bolsonaro is a politician who they say will bring much needed change to the country - a swing to the right after four elections won by the left. For the past four years, Brazil has been consumed by a criminal investigation - known as Operation Car Wash - that has uncovered massive corruption. Dozens of business and political leaders have been jailed. Among them wasformer President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, who was barred from standing in the election. Tears and celebration on Brazil's streets Who supports Bolsonaro? Brazil election guide in five charts The 63-year-old leads the Social Liberal Party (PSL), an anti-establishment group that combines social conservatism and pro-market policies. Mr Bolsonaro is a deeply polarising figure who has had a divisive effect on Brazilians with both supporters and opponents taking to the streets to make their voices heard. This video can not be played Rival supporters argue after Brazil poll result He has in the past defended the killing of opponents to the country's former military regime and said he is ""in favour of dictatorship"". But after the results came in, he told supporters he would be a ""defender of democracy"" and uphold the constitution. One of his flagship policies is to restore security by relaxing gun laws and suggested that ""every honest citizens"" should be able to own a gun. He has promised to reduce state intervention in the economy and indicated that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. He takes over on 1 January 2019. Election drives wedge between friends Analysis by BBC's Katy Watson in Sao Paulo Is there a chance Mr Bolsonaro could soften his stance, now he's won power? Few experts believe it. You only need to look to another firebrand in the continent for guidance. ""The things that Donald Trump outlined and the signals that he gave during the campaign he carried through with,"" says Kyle Pope of the Columbia Journalism Review, who has studied parallels between Brazil's new president and the leader of the US. Many say a comparison with Mr Trump is inaccurate. Instead, they say Mr Bolsonaro is more akin to Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Whatever the comparison, what is clear is that country's sharp swing to the right will resonate beyond Brazil as another populist takes power. And the opposition will redouble efforts not to take away the gains that country's made since it returned to democracy 30 years ago. The future looks messy for Brazil. Yes and no. On the one hand, his PSL party achieved a remarkable breakthrough in this month's legislative election, increasing its representation from one to 52 seats in the lower house. However Mr Haddad's PT remains the largest party, with 56 seats. But most ominously for Mr Bolsonaro, there will be a record 30 parties represented in the next Congress. This suggest that finding backing for legislation could be difficult for the new president. A number of Latin American leaders congratulated Mr Bolsonaro: Argentine President Mauricio Macri described the poll results as Mr Bolsonaro's ""triumph"" Chilean President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era congratulated Brazilians for a ""clean and democratic election"" Colombia's Ivan Duque welcomed the result and called for the two countries' ""brotherly relations"" to be strengthened further Mexican outgoing President President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto hailed Brazil's ""democratic strength"" Peru's Martin Vizcarra wished Mr Bolsonaro ""full success"" Venezuela's NicolÃ¡s Maduro extended his ""congratulations to the people of Brazil"" Amnesty International said that taking into account his campaign pledges, Mr Bolsonaro's victory could pose a ""huge risk"" to Brazil's indigenous peoples, LGBT communities, black youth, women, activists and civil society organisations.

"Philip Hammond will deliver his Budget on Monday afternoon The government will set a new Budget if it is unable to reach a Brexit deal with the EU, the chancellor has said. Philip Hammond said a no-deal Brexit would require a ""different response"", with ""fiscal buffers"" being maintained to provide support for the economy. Mr Hammond was speaking on the eve of his Budget, which he will present to the Commons on Monday. He also hinted at more funds for the universal credit rollout, after claims that millions of homes will lose money. The spending plans take place at a time of uncertainty over Brexit, with no deal in place five months before the UK's departure date. Questioned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Hammond told Sky News' Ridge on Sunday programme: ""We would need to look at a different strategy and frankly we'd need to have a new Budget that set out a different strategy for the future."" Remembering the Budgets that backfired Extra Â£420m to tackle potholes in England Chancellor pressured over universal credit Mr Hammond said the Budget forecasts to be used on Monday were based on an ""average-type free trade deal"" being agreed between the two sides. But if the UK leaves without a deal, the government would have to ""revisit where we are"", he told the BBC's Marr Show. The chancellor added: ""I have got fiscal reserves that would enable me to intervene."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was ""deeply worried"" that the government was edging towards a no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May has recently promised ""an end to austerity"", the cuts made to public spending since 2010. Asked about this pledge, Mr Hammond said detailed information would have to wait for next year's spending review. ""Once we get a good deal from the European Union and the smooth exit from the EU we will be able to show the British people that the fruits of their hard work are now at last in sight,"" he said.

A deal based on the government's preferred model - which has been criticised by the EU and some Tory MPs - would ""minimise the negative effect"" of leaving, he said. But Mr Hammond warned he could not say at this stage whether the overall impact would be positive or negative for the UK. Labour has dismissed the government's austerity promise. Mr McDonnell said Labour would spend Â£50bn to ""start the process"" of reversing spending cuts, a process he said would take until the end of the next Parliament. This would be done in a ""realistic and responsible"" way, he said. The government has also been under pressure to commit extra funds to the flagship universal credit reform, amid reports that millions of households face losing money under the new system. Conservative MPs have been among those demanding more money to protect people moving onto the new payment, which replaces six benefits and merges them into a single payment. Allow Twitter content?

Asked about this, Mr Hammond told the BBC's Marr Show he had used previous Budgets to put money into the project, adding: ""When we see things that need addressing, we address them."" Labour says the universal credit should be scrapped, and Mr McDonnell called for the Budget to be voted down if the government does not agree to halt its repeatedly delayed rollout across the UK. Other expected Budget announcements include a Â£30bn package for England's roads, Â£900m in business rates relief for small business and Â£650m to rejuvenate high streets.

"Baby Hallie was just 1lb 1oz (500g) when she was born A baby born weighing just 1lb 1oz (500g) is defying the odds, her mother has said. Baby Hallie was born to Robyn Bryant and James Dury at 28 weeks after they were told to prepare for the worst. During the pregnancy, Hallie's legs and arms measured shorter than usual, leaving doctors concerned that she had a genetic issue. She was delivered via emergency caesarean on Tuesday at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Specialist unit care may have saved premature baby 'Miracle' baby born between chemotherapy and menopause Baby box safety doubts raised by experts Consultants believed Hallie had a genetic or chromosomal condition as she was weeks behind in her development in routine scans. Further tests showed that she had a number of complications, including a fused kidney, and Robyn, 23, and James, 27, were told Hallie could die in the womb at any time from 20 weeks. Robyn was in hospital at 28 weeks, months before her January 8 due date for an emergency caesarean. ""When they took Hallie out, they realised my placenta hadn't been working the way it should,"" Ms Bryant  said. ""She had been starving of oxygen, which was why she was so small. Robyn said Hallie has defied the odds of survival ""I don't think anyone expected her to be breathing when she came out but she proved them all wrong, and was screaming. ""I wasn't prepared for her to be crying so I was blown away. ""She is absolutely tiny - about the size of my phone. ""She's having a little bit of oxygen but she's practically breathing alone.  It's a miracle. Mum Robyn says baby Hallie is about the size of her phone ""We're so grateful to Dr Conner in Fetal Medicine Unit in the Heath, and Dr Watermeyer in Royal Glamorgan. They couldn't do enough for us."" The family expect to spend their first Christmas together in hospital, where doctors expect Hallie to stay until ""at least January."" Ms Bryant said: ""We could have been so much worse off and she could actually not be here. We're very grateful.""

"It has been a divisive election in which supporters of the rival candidates have at times clashed Millions of Brazilians are choosing between two very different politicians to be their next president. Far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro is facing leftist Fernando Haddad of the Workers' Party in the second and final round of presidential elections. While his poll lead has narrowed, Mr Bolsonaro remains in the lead. The election has been overshadowed by corruption scandals and a knife attack on Mr Bolsonaro in which he lost 40% of his blood and needed emergency surgery. Five charts that tell you more about Brazil's election Who are the people supporting Jair Bolsonaro? Who are the people opposing Jair Bolsonaro? Why friends are being divided by this election Jair Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former army captain, is from the small, conservative Social Liberal Party.His provocative statements on abortion, race, migration, homosexuality have earned him the nickname ""Trump of the Tropics"". Mr Bolsonaro and his wife Michelle voted in Rio Fernando Haddad, a 55-year-old former SÃ£o Paulo mayor and education minister, is the son of a family of Lebanese immigrants. Fernando Haddad voted in SÃ£o Paulo He replaced former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, currently serving a 12-year prison sentence on corruption charges, as the presidential candidate for the Workers' Party less than a month before the first round of the election. One of Mr Bolsonaro's flagship campaign issues has been to increase security for Brazilian citizens. He has portrayed himself as a hardliner who will restore safety to Brazil's streets, indicating that his government will aim to relax laws restricting the ownership and carrying of guns. His economic policy plans include proposals to reduce government ""waste"" and promises to reduce state intervention in the economy. He has also said that he will ""cleanse"" Brazil of corrupt politicians, and that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Supporters of Fernando Haddad say democracy itself is at stake in this election Fernando Haddad has campaigned on a promise to make Brazil a more inclusive country for all its citizens. He said that if elected his government would invest in the public sector to stimulate the economy. As a former education minister, it comes as little surprise that Mr Haddad argues that making education accessible to all should be a key priority. He argues this approach would be the best way to narrow the wide gap between the rich and poor in Brazil. ""Every human being has to get up and have a destination, whether that is the university, a school, day care for their child, a workplace, a dignified job, a small business,"" he said in a radio interview. Two final opinion polls released on Saturday showed that support for Mr Haddad had increased, though Mr Bolsonaro was still expected to win about 55% of the vote. ""This thing is going to turn around,"" Mr Haddad told supporters at his final campaign rally. Mr Bolsonaro made his final pitch on social media. He has not campaigned in public since he was stabbed in the stomach at a rally in September, sending him to hospital for three weeks. ""God willing, tomorrow will be our new independence day,"" he tweeted. By BBC South America Correspondent Katy Watson We have spent the day at a couple of voting centres in Rio. The first was in the upmarket neighbourhood of Leblon, next to the iconic Ipanema beach. There were quite a few people dressed in the ""colours"" of their candidate - green, blue and yellow in support of Jair Bolsonaro, red for those voting for Fernando Haddad. Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro tend to dress in the colours of the Brazilian flag Most voters came and went in peace but a group of Bolsonaro supporters started heckling those voting for Haddad. ""Go to Venezuela you socialists,"" they shouted at those supporting the Workers' Party. At the voting centre in Rocinha, a poor neighbourhood, very few displayed their political allegiances. Hardly anyone would talk to us, hesitant to declare their vote. There has been so much anger and division in these elections, and the tension just continues to build. Outgoing President Michel Temer has an approval rating of only 2%, so many Brazilians are hungry for political change. They say they are fed up with the corruption scandals which have seen dozens of high-ranking politicians and influential businesspeople go to jail over the past few years Mr Bolsonaro - who says he will root out corruption, although he has given few details as to how he plans to do this - has benefited from this anger directed at the established political parties. Many of those who said they would cast their vote for him said they would do so because they did not want to see the Workers' Party return to power. But Mr Bolsonaro's rhetoric and his misogynistic, racist and homophobic comments have alienated many Brazilians who fear that his far-right policies could undermine Brazil's democratic institutions. There have been mass rallies for and against Mr Bolsonaro and the divisions run deep, sometimes even within families.

"The helicopter was photographed taking off from the pitch shortly before the crash A helicopter carrying the owner of Leicester City FC crashed in flames near the club's ground, killing five people. The club confirmed its owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, was among those killed, along with two members of his staff, another passenger, and the pilot. Here is what we know so far about the crash. The helicopter took off from the King Power Stadium at about 20:30 BST on Saturday, as it often does after Leicester City games. BT Sport cameras captured the take-off on live TV, as presenter Jake Humphrey watched and commented on it with pundits Owen Hargreaves, Chris Sutton and John Hartson. The helicopter was captured by television cameras as it took off from the pitch A bang was heard shortly after as the helicopter spiralled out of control and crashed near a car park. Former Leicester City and England goalkeeper Peter Shilton witnessed the crash when he was coming out of the ground with his wife. ""We saw the chairman's helicopter above us and all of a sudden it seemed to be making a funny noise and started to spin,"" he said. Leicester helicopter crash victims named Fans lead tributes to chairman Who was Leicester's billionaire owner? ""All of a sudden it started coming towards us and my wife started panicking. ""It seemed to drop a little bit and then obviously crash. ""Then there were sparks coming out the back and then some small flames, and then larger flames, I mean this all happened very quickly, and then suddenly it just blew up."" Freelance photographer Ryan Brown had been at the match covering the game. ""I heard the helicopter take off,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""I turned around and it made a whirring noise and grinding noise and then went silent, it was spinning out of control. ""The blades had stopped spinning and then there was a big bang and a big fireball. Lots of people started running towards the scene; as I came around the corner there was a huge fireball. ""It crashed right near the stadium. It just cleared the stadium roof and landed in an industrial park next to it."" Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, Izabela Roza Lechowicz and Eric Swaffer were killed in the crash Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, 60, was a billionaire and founder of duty-free consortium King Power International. He bought Leicester City in 2010 and the club went on to win the Premier League title in 2015-16 in one of the greatest sporting surprises of all time. The father-of-four was ranked as the fifth richest person in Thailand by Forbes Magazine. He used to fly to and from Leicester's home games and his properties in London and Berkshire, landing his helicopter on the pitch. Two members of his staff, Nusara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, were with him on his final flight. Eight-year fairytale ends in tragedy Who were the victims? Owner's wife and son visit stadium Ms Nusara was a former model who was runner-up in Miss Thailand Universe 2005, and was voted most photogenic in the same contest. Little is known about Mr Kaveporn but his Facebook page said he was from Bangkok. The helicopter's pilot, Eric Swaffer, had more than 20 years of flying experience as a private jet and helicopter pilot, flying helicopters for live media broadcasting including Channel 4's The Big Breakfast. He lived in Surrey with his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz, who died alongside him in the crash. Ms Lechowicz moved to the UK from Poland in 1997 and became a pilot after meeting Mr Swaffer. She was a winner of the #polka100 award, an accolade for ""exceptional women who inspire the Polish community in Britain"". This video can not be played Fans were visibly shocked following the crash on Saturday evening An investigation into the crash is being led by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), which investigates civil aircraft accidents across the UK. The investigation will look into how the Agusta Westland AW169 helicopter crashed in what is believed to be the first accident involving an AW169 aircraft. The owners have two helicopters - an older one registered as G-LCFC and a newer one registered as G-VSKP. The helicopter that landed at the stadium was the G-VSKP. Jim Rowlands, a former RAF Puma crew member, said the spinning nature of the aircraft indicated there was a problem with the tail rotor - the part of a helicopter that normally stops it from spinning around in the opposite direction to the main rotor blades. ""If you lose your tail rotor it's almost impossible to recover from,"" said Mr Rowlands. ""You can't get out of it. It would be more luck than judgment if you were to survive."" His ""gut feeling"" was there was some kind of mechanical problem but said there were ""so many things that it could have been"". ""It could have been a human factor, it could have been pilot error or poor maintenance that led to something,"" he said. An AAIB spokesman said: ""A team from the AAIB has been deployed to the site and is investigating. ""Anyone with information that might be helpful to the investigation is asked to contact the police."" Fans gathered at the King Power Stadium to leave flowers and pay their respects The Duke of Cambridge led the tributes to Mr Vichai on Monday, saying he was lucky to have known him for several years. ""He was a businessman of strong values who was dedicated to his family and who supported a number of important charitable causes,"" Prince William, who is president of the FA, said. ""He made such a big contribution to football, not least through Leicester City's magical 2016 season that captured the imagination of the world."" Former Leicester City and England striker Gary Lineker tweeted to say he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of Mr Vichai's death. He signed off the Match of the Day programme on Saturday by saying it had been a ""dreadful day"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking outside the stadium, club ambassador Alan Birchenall said Leicester City owed ""everything"" to Mr Vichai. ""I had to pay my respects to a lovely guy,"" he said. ""We owe everything to him. We wouldn't have won it [the Premier League] without him. We wouldn't have got near it without him. ""There won't be a dry eye among any of the staff today."" Mr Swaffer's friend Lucie Morris-Marr said the pilot was a ""veteran in the field"" and would have done all he could to prevent lives being lost in the crash. She described him as a ""funny and vivacious"" man who was in an ""aviation love story"" with Ms Lechowicz. The couple were professional pilots who lived together in Camberley, Surrey. Ms Lechowicz moved to the UK from Poland in 1997. In a statement, the Polish embassy said: ""She [Mrs Lechowicz] was a great pilot, winner of the #Polka100 contest. It contributed to the creation of a positive image of Poland in the UK."" Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The outpouring of grief is a testament to how many people's lives were touched by those on board."" Leicester City won the Premier League under Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's ownership Season ticket holder Richard Jackson, of Market Bosworth, said he was ""devastated"" by what had happened. ""These owners have been absolutely fantastic; probably the best owners in the whole English system,"" he said. One fan said of the family: ""They are the heart and soul of Leicester City Football Club. ""If it wasn't for them none of this would have been possible in recent years and dreams wouldn't have come true. ""It's very disturbing, not just for fans of the club but for everyone in the football world."" Leicester City season ticket-holder Richard Mobbs (left) and Thai student Anupat Maturongpituck both came to the King Power Stadium to pay their respects Richard Mobbs, from Burton Overy in Leicestershire, said he last saw the chairman in June when they discussed a player who was about to join the club. Mr Mobbs described Mr Srivaddhanaprabha as a ""lovely, quiet, down to earth man"", and paid tribute to his family. Mr Vichai's death has had a ""great impact"" in Thailand, according to a Thai student studying in Leicester Anupat Maturongpituck, a student from Thailand studying at the University of Leicester, came to the King Power Stadium on Sunday to ""pay my respects"", adding news of the crash has had a ""great impact"" in Thailand. Mr Vichai has regularly given supporters free beer and pies at matches to mark special occasions, made donations to the city hospital, and treated the 2016 title-winning squad to a fleet of blue BMWs. Another fan said: ""It's ended up as probably the darkest day in Leicester City Football Club's history."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Walsh said ""bar the last few weeks"" it was the ""best experience of my life"" Seann Walsh, who was photographed kissing his dance partner Katya Jones outside a pub, has been eliminated from Strictly Come Dancing. The comedian's time on the show was overshadowed by controversy after the pictures were published in the Sun on Sunday three weeks ago. The revelation led to theend of his relationship with actress Rebecca Humphries. Walsh said ""bar the last few weeks"" it was the ""best experience of my life"". Following a low-scoring Viennese waltz the public vote put them in the bottom two, alongside ex-cricketer Graeme Swann and Oti Mabuse. After the dance-off the judges unanimously voted Walsh and Jones off, making them the fifth couple to leave the show. Walsh and Jones lost out to Graeme Swann and partner Oti Mabuse in the dance-off Walsh said: ""When you watch it and hear people at the end say this has been the best experience in my life...you don't really believe, but this has been without a doubt the best experience of my life. Probably bar the last few weeks. ""But generally speaking, from the beginning it really was. I can't believe it, it's been amazing."" Turning to Jones, he said it had been a ""dream come true and that's because of you"". After the results show, the pair sent separate tweets, thanking fans and each other.

"Sgt Christopher Russo and Sgt Kirby Tonkin were just in time to grab the kangaroo before it drowned Two Australian police officers have described the moment they jumped into the sea to rescue a drowning kangaroo. Sergeants Christopher Russo and Kirby Tonkin dragged the unconscious animal out of the water and performed chest compressions to revive it. The kangaroo is now recovering after the dramatic rescue in the Mornington Peninsula area, south of Melbourne. Sgt Tonkin said it was a ""good feeling"", adding ""every life is worth saving and we just did what we could"". The incident happened in the late afternoon on Saturday. Local resident Mia Grant saw the kangaroo bounce across the road towards Safety Beach. ""I saw him swimming and started filming but he suddenly got caught in the backwash of the waves so we got him out and waited for police,"" she told Australian media. The kangaroo, bedraggled but alive But the exhausted animal became spooked and leapt back into the sea - this time with the two officers in hot pursuit. ""He had less than a minuteâ¦ he went under and as he came up you could see foam coming out of his nose. He was drowning,"" Sgt Russo explained. ""I grabbed his tail and Kirby cradled his head and dragged him onto the beach and cleared his lungs to get the water out of him. Then we just started to push on his chest and he started breathing again and I could feel a heartbeat."" The officers dragged the unconscious animal back to the beach Ms Grant praised the officers' actions.,external""You see a lot of bad things and to see someone so instantaneously race in after an animal gives you faith in humanity,"" she said. The kangaroo was wrapped in a blanket and taken to a police station to recover The kangaroo was taken to the local police station, before being picked up by wildlife services. ""We will let him recover at his own pace but he has a paddock full of grass and lots of water to drink and he seems very happy with that,"" said Michelle Thomas, director of the local Animalia Wildlife Shelter.

"This video can not be played Meghan started her tribute to the women of New Zealand with a Maori greeting The Duchess of Sussex has praised the first women in the world to win the right to vote during a speech in New Zealand about feminism and fairness. Meghan was speaking on day one of her visit to the country with Prince Harry. It is the last stop on their tour. The duchess started with a few words of Maori, leading to applause and cheers from the audience in Wellington.

There were whoops, cheers and friendly laughter at the words. The duchess met guests at the reception to celebrate the anniversary of women's suffrage She said: ""The achievements of the women of New Zealand who campaigned for their right to vote and were the first in the world to achieve it are universally admired. ""In looking forward to this very special occasion, I reflected on the importance of this achievement, but also the larger impact of what this symbolises. ""Because yes, women's suffrage is about feminism, but feminism is about fairness."" She continued: ""Suffrage is not simply about the right to vote but also about what that represents: the basic and fundamental human right of being able to participate in the choices for your future and that of your community."" Meghan ended by saying: ""So bravo New Zealand, for championing this right 125 years ago for the women who well deserve to have an active voice and an acknowledged vote."" ""In the words of your suffragette, Kate Sheppard: all that separates, whether race, class, creed or sex is inhuman and must be overcome.""

"The police said the traumatised girl offered her piggy bank money to save her father from gunmen A gang of masked men shot a man and also threatened to shoot his teenage daughter who had offered them her piggy bank money to leave her family alone. The man, who is in a stable condition in hospital, has ""potentially life-changing injuries"" after the attack in Garvagh, County Londonderry. He was shot in the arms and legs and beaten with a bat in what the police said was a paramilitary-style attack. The gang also chased the girl and tried to set fire to items in the house. Police said the man is being treated for gunshot wounds and head injuries and his daughter has been left ""severely traumatised"". The teenager's phone was stolen to prevent her calling for help. She was upstairs when the gang broke into the property on Kurin Lane shortly before 22:30 BST on Saturday. The intruders chased the girl in the house and threatened her when she hid from them, according to the PSNI Limavady Facebook page. ""She came out petrified with her Piggy Bank, HER PIGGY BANK! hoping that the men would take it and leave her dad alone,"" one outraged officer wrote. ""Instead they stole her phone and shot her dad. My heart is broken for this girl. ""It makes me feel physically sick and enraged to my core,"" the PSNI post added. In a statement, Det Ch Insp White said: ""This a sickeningly vicious shooting and beating which has left this man with serious and potentially life-changing injuries, and a young girl severely traumatised, ""What sort of men would think it is acceptable to subject a young girl to this level of brutality and violence? ""Every child has the right to feel safe and protected in their own home - how is this poor child going to sleep tonight or in coming nights? What are the long term effects on her going to be?"" ""It's quite obvious the hypocrites who carried out this dreadful attack don't care at all about the children in their community. I wonder how they would feel if their own child witnessed such a level of violence? ""There is absolutely no justification for an attack like this in our communities and we must all work together to bring those responsible to justice and to stop this from happening to another child."" DUP councillor Sam Cole said the incident has left the girl ""traumatised"" DUP councillor Sam Cole said the girl was awoken by the ""commotion"" downstairs. Mr Cole told BBC News NI: ""She came down and saw the masked men. She pleaded with them and offered them her piggy bank with money in it to just leave her daddy alone. ""But it wasn't enough and they went ahead and shot the middle-aged man in the knees and arms and bludgeoned him as well. ""It's left the young girl traumatised. ""They took her phone because they thought she might alert the police so she ran to a neighbour in a really distressed, traumatic state.""

"It has been a divisive election in which supporters of the rival candidates have at times clashed Millions of Brazilians are choosing between two very different politicians to be their next president. Far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro is facing leftist Fernando Haddad of the Workers' Party in the second and final round of presidential elections. While his poll lead has narrowed, Mr Bolsonaro remains in the lead. The election has been overshadowed by corruption scandals and a knife attack on Mr Bolsonaro in which he lost 40% of his blood and needed emergency surgery. Five charts that tell you more about Brazil's election Who are the people supporting Jair Bolsonaro? Who are the people opposing Jair Bolsonaro? Why friends are being divided by this election Jair Bolsonaro, a 63-year-old former army captain, is from the small, conservative Social Liberal Party.His provocative statements on abortion, race, migration, homosexuality have earned him the nickname ""Trump of the Tropics"". Mr Bolsonaro and his wife Michelle voted in Rio Fernando Haddad, a 55-year-old former SÃ£o Paulo mayor and education minister, is the son of a family of Lebanese immigrants. Fernando Haddad voted in SÃ£o Paulo He replaced former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, currently serving a 12-year prison sentence on corruption charges, as the presidential candidate for the Workers' Party less than a month before the first round of the election. One of Mr Bolsonaro's flagship campaign issues has been to increase security for Brazilian citizens. He has portrayed himself as a hardliner who will restore safety to Brazil's streets, indicating that his government will aim to relax laws restricting the ownership and carrying of guns. His economic policy plans include proposals to reduce government ""waste"" and promises to reduce state intervention in the economy. He has also said that he will ""cleanse"" Brazil of corrupt politicians, and that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Supporters of Fernando Haddad say democracy itself is at stake in this election Fernando Haddad has campaigned on a promise to make Brazil a more inclusive country for all its citizens. He said that if elected his government would invest in the public sector to stimulate the economy. As a former education minister, it comes as little surprise that Mr Haddad argues that making education accessible to all should be a key priority. He argues this approach would be the best way to narrow the wide gap between the rich and poor in Brazil. ""Every human being has to get up and have a destination, whether that is the university, a school, day care for their child, a workplace, a dignified job, a small business,"" he said in a radio interview. Two final opinion polls released on Saturday showed that support for Mr Haddad had increased, though Mr Bolsonaro was still expected to win about 55% of the vote. ""This thing is going to turn around,"" Mr Haddad told supporters at his final campaign rally. Mr Bolsonaro made his final pitch on social media. He has not campaigned in public since he was stabbed in the stomach at a rally in September, sending him to hospital for three weeks. ""God willing, tomorrow will be our new independence day,"" he tweeted. By BBC South America Correspondent Katy Watson We have spent the day at a couple of voting centres in Rio. The first was in the upmarket neighbourhood of Leblon, next to the iconic Ipanema beach. There were quite a few people dressed in the ""colours"" of their candidate - green, blue and yellow in support of Jair Bolsonaro, red for those voting for Fernando Haddad. Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro tend to dress in the colours of the Brazilian flag Most voters came and went in peace but a group of Bolsonaro supporters started heckling those voting for Haddad. ""Go to Venezuela you socialists,"" they shouted at those supporting the Workers' Party. At the voting centre in Rocinha, a poor neighbourhood, very few displayed their political allegiances. Hardly anyone would talk to us, hesitant to declare their vote. There has been so much anger and division in these elections, and the tension just continues to build. Outgoing President Michel Temer has an approval rating of only 2%, so many Brazilians are hungry for political change. They say they are fed up with the corruption scandals which have seen dozens of high-ranking politicians and influential businesspeople go to jail over the past few years Mr Bolsonaro - who says he will root out corruption, although he has given few details as to how he plans to do this - has benefited from this anger directed at the established political parties. Many of those who said they would cast their vote for him said they would do so because they did not want to see the Workers' Party return to power. But Mr Bolsonaro's rhetoric and his misogynistic, racist and homophobic comments have alienated many Brazilians who fear that his far-right policies could undermine Brazil's democratic institutions. There have been mass rallies for and against Mr Bolsonaro and the divisions run deep, sometimes even within families.

"The museum originally opened in 1920, but has been closed for six years Part of Syria's national museum has reopened to the public six years after civil war forced its closure. The world-renowned antiquities museum in Damascus closed in 2012 to protect its ancient artefacts from damage. Most of the collection was then evacuated and kept at secret locations to keep exhibits safe. The decision to reopen part of the museum comes as the Syrian government maintains normality is returning to the conflict-wracked country. Earlier this year, the capital was secured by President Bashar Assad's forces, but fighting still continues in some areas of the country. The seven-year conflict in Syria has left more than 350,000 people dead, and devastated many historic cities and sites across the country. The Museum of Lost Objects Syria's priceless heritage under attack Why is there a war in Syria? Culture Minister Mohamed al-Ahmad said the reopening of the museum sent a ""genuine message"" that the country's rich cultural heritage was not destroyed by ""terrorism"", the Associated Press reports. Only part of the National Museum of Damascus opened to visitors on Sunday, but the museum's deputy director said authorities were working on reopening it all. ""We will exhibit a group of artefacts from all periods from prehistory, the ancient east and the classical and Islamic eras in this section,"" Ahmad Deeb told the media. The museum's gardens stayed open to the public during the conflict, but the building was closed as Damascus fell under rebel rocket fire. An estimated 300,000 artefacts were protected by the government around the country The inauguration ceremony was organised by the culture and tourism ministries Syria, as one of the most centrally placed locations for trade routes throughout ancient history, is renowned for its rich and diverse heritage. Some of its famous sites, including the Unesco world heritage site at Palmyra, fell into the hands of the Islamic State militant group and were intentionally damaged. Others, like the ancient heart of Aleppo, were destroyed by fierce and relentless fighting. An unknown number of antique items are suspected to have been smuggled abroad and sold since the conflict began - with accusations falling on all sides. Government officials have said thousands of artefacts have been successfully recovered from militant-held areas or on the border. Earlier this month hundreds of these recovered artefacts were put on display at the Damascus Opera House.

"Philip Hammond will deliver his Budget on Monday afternoon The government will set a new Budget if it is unable to reach a Brexit deal with the EU, the chancellor has said. Philip Hammond said a no-deal Brexit would require a ""different response"", with ""fiscal buffers"" being maintained to provide support for the economy. Mr Hammond was speaking on the eve of his Budget, which he will present to the Commons on Monday. He also hinted at more funds for the universal credit rollout, after claims that millions of homes will lose money. The spending plans take place at a time of uncertainty over Brexit, with no deal in place five months before the UK's departure date. Questioned about the impact of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Hammond told Sky News' Ridge on Sunday programme: ""We would need to look at a different strategy and frankly we'd need to have a new Budget that set out a different strategy for the future."" Remembering the Budgets that backfired Extra Â£420m to tackle potholes in England Chancellor pressured over universal credit Mr Hammond said the Budget forecasts to be used on Monday were based on an ""average-type free trade deal"" being agreed between the two sides. But if the UK leaves without a deal, the government would have to ""revisit where we are"", he told the BBC's Marr Show. The chancellor added: ""I have got fiscal reserves that would enable me to intervene."" Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was ""deeply worried"" that the government was edging towards a no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May has recently promised ""an end to austerity"", the cuts made to public spending since 2010. Asked about this pledge, Mr Hammond said detailed information would have to wait for next year's spending review. ""Once we get a good deal from the European Union and the smooth exit from the EU we will be able to show the British people that the fruits of their hard work are now at last in sight,"" he said.

A deal based on the government's preferred model - which has been criticised by the EU and some Tory MPs - would ""minimise the negative effect"" of leaving, he said. But Mr Hammond warned he could not say at this stage whether the overall impact would be positive or negative for the UK. Labour has dismissed the government's austerity promise. Mr McDonnell said Labour would spend Â£50bn to ""start the process"" of reversing spending cuts, a process he said would take until the end of the next Parliament. This would be done in a ""realistic and responsible"" way, he said. The government has also been under pressure to commit extra funds to the flagship universal credit reform, amid reports that millions of households face losing money under the new system. Conservative MPs have been among those demanding more money to protect people moving onto the new payment, which replaces six benefits and merges them into a single payment. Allow Twitter content?

"Joanne O'Keefe's son was killed when a driver failed to stop The number of hit-and-run crashes in England and Wales has risen by 45% in four years, the BBC has learned. Recorded hit-and-run incidents increased from 19,239 in 2013 to 28,010 in 2017, according to Freedom of Information responses from 27 of the 44 police forces in England and Wales. Road safety charity Brake said drivers who kill should face tougher sentences. The Ministry of Justice last year saidlife sentences will be introducedfor causing death by dangerous driving. It said the government ""is committed to making sure that the courts have sufficient powers to deal with driving offences"". Alfie O'Keefe-Hedges was just 16-years-old when he was knocked off his moped by a car at a roundabout in north London in November 2016. The trainee mechanic died eight days later in hospital. The man driving the vehicle, Ali Bahramzadeh, failed to stop. The 22-year-old had taken his mother's car without permission and had no licence or insurance. Bahramzadeh was later jailed for 12 months for causing death by careless driving, driving while uninsured and failing to stop following a collision. Alfie O'Keefe was at college and had just got a girlfriend at the time of the crash Alfie's mum, Joanne, keeps his ashes in a wooden Arsenal football club box surrounded by photos and candles in their living room. She believes drivers who fail to stop should be given stronger sentences. ""I think a longer sentence would have made a difference to me,"" she said. ""Obviously not my heartache, that will never go away, but I would have felt justice was done, something was done for my son who had his life taken away like that. ""I just can't understand the way the law works, he got 12 months and a two-and-a-half year ban from driving. What sort of justice is that?"" Alfie O'Keefe died after a hit-and-run collision in November 2016 According to figures from the Freedom of Information responses, the number of hit-and-run crashes increased in successive years from 2013 to 2017 in England and Wales. 'I had to tell my mum her son had died' Killer drivers to receive life sentences By comparison, in Scotland the figures fell over the same four years. The Police Service of Northern Ireland was not able to provide a response. The Motor Insurers' Bureau, the body that compensates victims of uninsured drivers, also said the number of victims of hit-and-runs has been rising since 2013. It now handles more than 16,000 cases a year. Currently, hit-and-runs where there is no other evidence of careless or dangerous driving face a maximum sentence of six months. However, Brake said sentences needed to be stronger. ""Hit-and-run drivers who kill must face the same penalties as those convicted of causing death by dangerous driving, removing the current incentive for some to flee the scene,"" it said in a statement. Dr Matt Hopkins, from the University of Leicester, has interviewed dozens of hit-and-run drivers about why they failed to stop. ""What the research seems to be pointing to is that a fair proportion of hit-and-run collisions are related to drivers who tend not to have valid insurance, tend not to have a valid licence"", he said. ""I think that's extremely concerning."" The Home Office said there had been 39% fewer road fatalities in 2017 compared with 2007. ""It is for chief constables and locally elected police and crime commissioners to decide how to deploy their resources in response to local priorities,"" a statement said.

"Baby Hallie was just 1lb 1oz (500g) when she was born A baby born weighing just 1lb 1oz (500g) is defying the odds, her mother has said. Baby Hallie was born to Robyn Bryant and James Dury at 28 weeks after they were told to prepare for the worst. During the pregnancy, Hallie's legs and arms measured shorter than usual, leaving doctors concerned that she had a genetic issue. She was delivered via emergency caesarean on Tuesday at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Specialist unit care may have saved premature baby 'Miracle' baby born between chemotherapy and menopause Baby box safety doubts raised by experts Consultants believed Hallie had a genetic or chromosomal condition as she was weeks behind in her development in routine scans. Further tests showed that she had a number of complications, including a fused kidney, and Robyn, 23, and James, 27, were told Hallie could die in the womb at any time from 20 weeks. Robyn was in hospital at 28 weeks, months before her January 8 due date for an emergency caesarean. ""When they took Hallie out, they realised my placenta hadn't been working the way it should,"" Ms Bryant  said. ""She had been starving of oxygen, which was why she was so small. Robyn said Hallie has defied the odds of survival ""I don't think anyone expected her to be breathing when she came out but she proved them all wrong, and was screaming. ""I wasn't prepared for her to be crying so I was blown away. ""She is absolutely tiny - about the size of my phone. ""She's having a little bit of oxygen but she's practically breathing alone.  It's a miracle. Mum Robyn says baby Hallie is about the size of her phone ""We're so grateful to Dr Conner in Fetal Medicine Unit in the Heath, and Dr Watermeyer in Royal Glamorgan. They couldn't do enough for us."" The family expect to spend their first Christmas together in hospital, where doctors expect Hallie to stay until ""at least January.""

"This video can not be played ""It's a horrific crime scene. One of the worst, and I've been on plane crashes"" A man suspected of killing 11 people in a synagogue in Pittsburgh has been charged with murder - in what is believed to be the worst anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. Robert Bowers, 46, is accused of opening fire at the Tree of Life synagogue during its Sabbath service. He faces 29 criminal counts, including use of a firearm to commit murder. Federal prosecutors say they will also file hate crime charges, and the suspect could face the death penalty. President Donald Trump described the attack as a ""wicked act of mass murder"". Six people - including four police officers - were injured in Saturday's attack. The suspect was also wounded in a shootout with police. Pittsburgh shooting: What we know so far America's gun culture in 10 charts Hundreds of people - from the neighbourhood and also all across Pittsburgh - later gathered for an interfaith vigil for the victims of the attack in the synagogue in Squirrel Hill. This video can not be played Crowds sing at a vigil in Pittsburgh Sophia Levin, a local resident and one of the organisers, told the BBC people wanted to be ""together, not alone"", and the vigil would help heal the city. President Trump said he would visit Pittsburgh soon. He also ordered US flags at government buildings to be flown at half-mast until 31 October. The 29 charges were announced in a statement,externalissued by the US Attorney's Office of the Western District of Pennsylvania: Eleven counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death Eleven counts of use of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence Four counts of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer Three counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence On Saturday morning, worshippers had gathered at the synagogue for a baby naming ceremony during the Sabbath. Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week. This video can not be played Police audio of the moment the suspect is captured Police said they received first calls about an active shooter at 09:54 local time (13:54 GMT), and sent officers to the scene a minute later. According to reports, Mr Bowers, a white male, entered the building during the morning service armed with an assault rifle and three handguns. The gunman had already shot dead 11 people and was leaving the synagogue after about 20 minutes when he encountered Swat officers and exchanged fire with them, FBI agent Robert Jones said. The attacker then moved back into the building to try to hide from the police. He surrendered after a shootout, and is now being treated in hospital for what has been described as multiple gunshot wounds. The Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh The crime scene was ""horrific"", Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told reporters. ""One of the worst I've seen, and I've [worked] on some plane crashes. It's very bad."" Mr Hissrich said no children were among the casualties. US media said he had shouted ""All Jews must die"" as he carried out the attack. Social media posts by someone with the name Robert Bowers were also reported to be full of anti-Semitic comments. Suspected attacker Robert Bowers FBI special agent Bob Jones told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to the attack. He said that any motive remains unknown but that authorities believe he was acting alone. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Pittsburgh People lit candles as they mourned the victims of the attack In the dwindling light, and with the cold autumn rain falling, hundreds gathered in front of the 6th Presbyterian church just a few streets away from the Tree of Life Synagogue. Holding their candles, they sang the Jewish prayer of healing. The elders in the community had wanted to wait a day before holding the vigil, but the young people said no - they wanted an immediate chance to share their grief and voice their hurt. Fifteen-year-old Sophia Levin declared that she was a different Jew today to the one she was yesterday. Anti-Semitism, she said, had been something she thought happened elsewhere and in earlier times; but now she knew it was right here, right now. Some of these young people have been involved in the student gun control movement that sprang up after the Parkland shooting earlier this year. One of them, Rebecca Glickman, told the crowd that gun control was needed now more than ever. She told me that an anti-Semite with a gun is more dangerous than an anti-Semite without a gun, so that's a good place to start. He called the shooting a ""terrible, terrible thing"". ""To see this happen again and again, for so many years, it's just a shame,"" he told reporters. He described the gunman as a ""maniac"" and suggested the US should ""stiffen up our laws of the death penalty"". ""These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop,"" he said. Gun control around the world Fight or flight: Would you tackle a gunman? Mr Trump added that the incident had ""little to do"" with US gun laws. ""If they had protection inside, maybe it could have been a different situation."" Former US President Barack Obama voiced a different position on the ongoing gun law debate,  tweeting: ""We have to stop making it so easy for those who want to harm the innocent to get their hands on a gun."" This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said in a statement that the incident was an ""absolute tragedy"",externaland that such acts of violence could not be accepted as ""normal"". The president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Jeff Finkelstein, said his ""heart goes out to all these families"". ""Now I'm just sad. This should not be happening. Period. It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighbourhood here in Squirrel Hill,"" he said. Jonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL),  a Jewish non-governmental organisation that fights anti-Semitism, said he was ""devastated"". ""We believe this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,external,"" he said in a statement. World leaders also condemned the attack, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said he was ""heartbroken and appalled"", and German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said: ""We all have to stand up against anti-Semitism, everywhere."" Extra police officers have been deployed at synagogues and Jewish centres across the US after the attack.

There were whoops, cheers and friendly laughter at the words. The duchess met guests at the reception to celebrate the anniversary of women's suffrage She said: ""The achievements of the women of New Zealand who campaigned for their right to vote and were the first in the world to achieve it are universally admired. ""In looking forward to this very special occasion, I reflected on the importance of this achievement, but also the larger impact of what this symbolises. ""Because yes, women's suffrage is about feminism, but feminism is about fairness."" She continued: ""Suffrage is not simply about the right to vote but also about what that represents: the basic and fundamental human right of being able to participate in the choices for your future and that of your community."" Meghan ended by saying: ""So bravo New Zealand, for championing this right 125 years ago for the women who well deserve to have an active voice and an acknowledged vote."" ""In the words of your suffragette, Kate Sheppard: all that separates, whether race, class, creed or sex is inhuman and must be overcome.""

"The hashtag ""romadicebasta"" (Rome says enough) has been trending on social media Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Rome to protest at the Italian capital's run-down state. Demonstrators gathered outside the city hall to denounce Mayor Virginia Raggi for failing to tackle issues including uncollected rubbish and potholed roads. Ms Raggi took control of Rome in 2016 for the Five Star Movement (M5S), which formed a national coalition government earlier this year. Her popularity has fallen after failing to address the indebted city's issues. On Saturday, demonstrators gathered waving the plastic orange netting that authorities use to cordon off areas of damaged roads, dangerous pavements and fallen trees. Other problems that the city faces include rats and wild boar roaming the streets and poor transport services - some 20 buses have reportedly caught fire this year alone. Some donned the orange netting used by authorities to cordon off potholes Many blame Mayor Virginia Raggi for not doing more to fix the city The protest followsthe collapse of an escalator on one of the main metro stations, which injured more than 20 people earlier this week. Many were Russian fans of CSKA Moscow, visiting for their Champions League match against Roma. Protest party finds ruling Rome is hard Why do Rome's buses keep catching fire? Why Rome sends trains filled with rubbish to Austria Rome's first female mayor says she is making progress tackling the city's problems, and needs more time to finish the job. But critics say things are getting worse, not better. The hashtag #romadicebasta, or Rome says enough in English, has been trending after a number of shocking incidents in the Eternal City. Police arrested three migrants aftera 16-year-old girl's body was found in a derelict building. She had been drugged and gang raped. Videos posted online have shown a number of wild boar running through the streets and feasting on rubbish. Reports suggest up to 8,000 people may have attended the demonstration Romans have had enough Ms Raggi took office after corruption scandals tainted the public image of traditional parties. But she herself is now standing trial for allegedly abusing her power over an appointment in her administration. A verdict is due on 10 November, and Ms Raggi says she will resign if convicted - which could lead to fresh elections.

"Sam Gilbert and Louise Young took the plunge when organising something different for their big day An outdoor ceremony surrounded by fields, followed by a memorable plunge into the water at an evening pool party. It may not sound like your typical wedding - and that's exactly what Louise Young and Sam Gilbert wanted. But like many others, they were bound by restrictions on where couples can marry in England and Wales, meaning they had to attend a legal ceremony at a register office before their dream day. Such restrictions could come to an end soon, after it was revealed ashake-up of the lawwill feature in Monday's Budget. The review will look at giving couples more choice on where they hold their wedding and could mean restrictions are lifted on al fresco locations, from gardens to beaches. Existing rules mean couples are unable to have a legal outdoor wedding - unless it takes place in a structure with a solid, permanent roof with a designated licence. The great outdoors - a legal wedding venue of the future? This will make a big difference, says Louise, as going to a register office before their humanist ceremony outdoors was a ""faff"" and an ""inconvenience"". ""It caused a little upset in the family initially,"" the 30-year-old, from Essex, told the BBC. ""Older family members, for example, just didn't 'get it' and saw the register office part as the important bit, whereas for us, it was simply an inconvenient formality. ""The personal, outdoor ceremony was the special and meaningful bit for us."" She says the fact they did not want any guests at the legal part was originally seen as a ""bit of a snub"", so the potential rule change would have made a ""big difference"" to them - and will do for others. ""So many face the same issues we had,"" she says. ""Some end up marrying in church in spite of not really being religious, just so they can legally be married and get it all done on the same day - often to please family. ""Many who haven't gone down that route also express feeling limited in their choices and tied to expensive 'all-in-one' type wedding venues. ""Wedding venues do have a firm hold over the entire wedding industry at the moment and the costs can be astronomical."" A planned shake-up of the law could allow couples to get married outside Wedding planner Linzi Barford, from that black & white cat, says the legal aspect of the wedding ceremony has been ""rather archaic for some years now"". She says she has worked with a lot of couples who, like Louise and Sam, opt to have a celebrant wedding in the location of their choice - such as their home, in a field or at a festival - but have to ""tick the legal box"" by going to a register office separately. ""Unfortunately this splits up your wedding celebrations and can also cause some family tensions when guests realise that the ceremony they are attending is not actually the legal one."" She hopes the proposed change will help couples who use her services in a number of ways, including removing the cost of two ceremonies for those who do not want to have their wedding in a religious venue or register office. Danielle Rolfe, from Hampshire wedding venue Penton Park, says she frequently has to explain the rules to couples who want outdoor weddings - and would like the venue to be able to fulfil their wishes. ""I would love to see people get married in our garden,"" she says. ""If enough people can stand there, why shouldn't you be able to marry there?"" In the meantime, the venue has two licensed outdoor settings - one is a garden gazebo and the other is the house's front doorstep, as it fulfils the roof requirement. ""It is a compromise, and we wanted to offer something,"" she says. Louise Young and Sam Gilbert had to attend a register office for a legal ceremony before their big day The potential rule change will bring England and Wales in line with Scotland, where couples enjoy much more freedom in where they can tie the knot. This news has been met with excitement from future brides and grooms, says outdoor wedding specialist Emily Braithwaite, founder of The Outside Bride blog. ""This is an amazing move forward and a boost for the wedding industry, as couples will have more flexibility to do what they want, where they want - creating the day of their dreams without the limitations that some conventional venues create,"" she says. For Louise, the possible rule change has come two years too late, but she says she can see how it will benefit many others. ""As wedding photographers ourselves too, we shoot a lot of weddings for couples like us,"" she says. ""We know it's going to make a world of difference to them.""

"This video can not be played ""It's a horrific crime scene. One of the worst, and I've been on plane crashes"" Eleven people have been killed, officials say, in a gun attack on a synagogue in the US city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The gunman, who opened fire as the Tree of Life synagogue held a service, was later taken into custody. President Donald Trump said ""a lot of people"" had been killed and injured in a ""wicked act of mass murder"". The suspect, who has been officially identified as Robert Bowers, 46, was injured and is receiving treatment. Two other people are in hospital in a critical condition, police said. Pittsburgh shooting: What we know so far America's gun culture in 10 charts Federal investigators are treating the shooting as a hate crime. The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish non-governmental organisation that fights anti-Semitism, said: ""We believe this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,external."" People lit candles as they mourned the victims of the attack Hundreds of people - from the neighbourhood and also all across Pittsburgh - later gathered for an interfaith vigil for the victims of the attack in Squirrel Hill. Sophia Levin, a local resident and one of the organisers, told the BBC some people were ""really sad"" and the mood was ""heavy"". But she added that people also wanted to be ""together, not alone"", and the vigil would help heal the city. President Trump said he would visit Pittsburgh, following the attack. On Saturday morning, worshippers had gathered at the synagogue, in the Squirrel Hill neighbourhood, for a baby naming ceremony during the Sabbath. Squirrel Hill has one of the largest Jewish populations in Pennsylvania and this would have been the synagogue's busiest day of the week. According to reports Mr Bowers, a white male, entered the building armed with an assault rifle and two pistols. The Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh Reports say he barricaded himself in a room at the synagogue when police approached. Emergency services arrived at the building at about 10:00 local time (14:00 GMT), and gunshots could be heard. Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich later confirmed Mr Bowers was in police custody and was being treated in hospital. The crime scene was ""horrific"", he told reporters. ""One of the worst I've seen, and I've [worked] on some plane crashes. It's very bad,"" he added. Officers cordon off the area outside the synagogue He said that two officers were injured in an ""initial confrontation"" and that a further two Swat officers were later hurt by the gunman when they entered the building. He said that no children were among the casualties. US media said he had shouted ""All Jews must die"" as he carried out the attack. Social media posts by someone with the name Robert Bowers were also reported to be full of anti-Semitic comments. Suspected attacker Robert Bowers Pittsburgh FBI's special agent in charge of the investigation, Bob Jones, told a press conference that Mr Bowers did not appear to be known to authorities prior to events on Saturday. He said that any motive remains unknown but that authorities believe he was acting alone. Mr Jones added that the investigation was ""in the early stages"". ""We will look at every aspect of the suspect's life,"" he said. Mr Bowers is receiving treatment for what has been described as multiple gunshot wounds. Gary O'Donoghue, BBC News, Pittsburgh In the dwindling light, and with the cold autumn rain falling, hundreds gathered in front of the 6th Presbyterian church just a few streets away from the Tree of Life Synagogue. Holding their candles, they sang the Jewish prayer of healing. The elders in the community had wanted to wait a day before holding the vigil, but the young people said no - they wanted an immediate chance to share their grief and voice their hurt. Fifteen-year-old Sophia Levin declared that she was a different Jew today to the one she was yesterday. Anti-Semitism, she said, had been something she thought happened elsewhere and in earlier times; but now she knew it was right here, right now. Some of these young people have been involved in the student gun control movement that sprang up after the Parkland shooting earlier this year. One of them, Rebecca Glickman, told the crowd that gun control was needed now more than ever. She told me that an anti-Semite with a gun is more dangerous than an anti-Semite without a gun, so that's a good place to start. He called the shooting a ""terrible, terrible thing"". ""To see this happen again and again, for so many years, it's just a shame,"" he told reporters on Saturday. He described the gunman as a ""maniac"" and suggested the US should ""stiffen up our laws of the death penalty"". ""These people should pay the ultimate price. This has to stop,"" he said. Gun control around the world Fight or flight: Would you tackle a gunman? Later on Saturday, Mr Trump appeared at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indianapolis, saying: ""There must be no tolerance for anti-Semitism. It must be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears."" Speaking to reporters after the event, Mr Trump said the attacker was not one of his supporters, describing him as ""sick"". This video can not be played What's Donald Trump said about guns and gun control? Mr Trump has also said that the incident had ""little to do"" with US gun laws. ""If they had protection inside, maybe it could have been a different situation.""

Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said in a statement that the incident was an ""absolute tragedy"",externaland that such acts of violence could not be accepted as ""normal"". He said: ""These senseless acts of violence are not who we are as Americans. ""My thoughts right now are focused on the victims, their families and making sure law enforcement has every resource they need."" The president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Jeff Finkelstein, said his ""heart goes out to all these families"". ""Now I'm just sad. This should not be happening. Period. It should not be happening in a synagogue. It should not be happening in our neighbourhood here in Squirrel Hill,"" he said.

"The fracking site in Lancashire is located near a farm A second tremor of 0.8 magnitude has been recorded within 24 hours at the UK's only active site for fracking. It was detected on Saturday after drilling for shale gas resumed in Lancashire following a 0.8 tremor on Friday. Neither was felt at surface. Since 15 October, Little Plumpton has been the first UK shale fracking site after the process was halted in 2011 when it waslinked with earthquakes. Fracking firm Cuadrilla said it aimed to resume operations on Monday. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique to extract gas and oil from the earth Liquid is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil within Applications have also been submitted by various firms in Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and for a second site in Lancashire The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says shale gas ""has the potential to be a new domestic energy source"" Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they will oppose fracking until further research is completed into its environmental impact The process restarted on Saturday morning after a 0.8 magnitude tremor on Friday, which is categorised as a ""red"" event by the monitoring system regulated by the Oil and Gas Authority. Saturday's tremor was detected at the firm's site in Little Plumpton shortly before 12:00 BST. Any tremor measuring 0.5 or above means fracking must be temporarily stopped while tests are carried out. Fracking has drawn strong opposition, including from activist and designer Vivienne Westwood (centre) A Cuadrilla spokeswoman said that, as the operations had finished before the detection, ""This is not an 'red' incident under the traffic light system operated by the Oil and Gas Authority as we were not pumping fracturing fluid as part of our hydraulic fracturing operations at the time. ""However we will, as always, continue to monitor the seismic activity closely and plan to resume hydraulic fracturing on Monday 29 October."" She said all relevant regulators had been informed. A spokesman for the the Oil and Gas Authority said: ""While the operations at the Preston New Road site have been designed to minimise any disturbance, minor events like these were expected."" He added: ""Provided that the event is in line with the agreed Hydraulic Fracture Plan and the risk of induced seismicity continues to be appropriately managed, then operations may resume on Monday."" Fracking started near Preston New Road on 15 October Fracking resumed earlier this week after it was paused as a precautionfollowing a 0.4 tremor on Tuesday. On Friday, a Cuadrilla spokesman said: ""Micro seismic events such as these result in tiny movements that are way below anything that would be felt at surface, much less cause any harm or damage."" The firm's chief executive Francis Egan added: ""It is an extraordinarily conservative figure, far below the 2.5 in Europe or 4 in Canada."" Mr Egan said he expected more incidents to be recorded because of the sensitivity of the recording equipment used by the company. Fracking resumed in October for the first time since 2011 after campaigners failed to stop the process with an injunction bid. A spokesman for Frack Free Lancashire said ""more fossil fuels had no place in a modern-day energy strategy"". Test drilling was suspendedafter two tremorsin the nearby Fylde Coast - one of 2.3 magnitude and the other of 1.5 - in April and May 2011 respectively. A study foundit was ""highly probable"" the test drilling for shale gas caused the tremors. A government-appointed panel recommended greater monitoring and said operators should observe a ""traffic light"" regime, with tremors of 0.5 or above triggering a ""red light"" and an immediate halt. Cuadrilla said earlier this month it would spend at least three months fracking two horizontal wells and then test to see if the gas flow was commercially viable.

"The hashtag ""romadicebasta"" (Rome says enough) has been trending on social media Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Rome to protest at the Italian capital's run-down state. Demonstrators gathered outside the city hall to denounce Mayor Virginia Raggi for failing to tackle issues including uncollected rubbish and potholed roads. Ms Raggi took control of Rome in 2016 for the Five Star Movement (M5S), which formed a national coalition government earlier this year. Her popularity has fallen after failing to address the indebted city's issues. On Saturday, demonstrators gathered waving the plastic orange netting that authorities use to cordon off areas of damaged roads, dangerous pavements and fallen trees. Other problems that the city faces include rats and wild boar roaming the streets and poor transport services - some 20 buses have reportedly caught fire this year alone. Some donned the orange netting used by authorities to cordon off potholes Many blame Mayor Virginia Raggi for not doing more to fix the city The protest followsthe collapse of an escalator on one of the main metro stations, which injured more than 20 people earlier this week. Many were Russian fans of CSKA Moscow, visiting for their Champions League match against Roma. Protest party finds ruling Rome is hard Why do Rome's buses keep catching fire? Why Rome sends trains filled with rubbish to Austria Rome's first female mayor says she is making progress tackling the city's problems, and needs more time to finish the job. But critics say things are getting worse, not better. The hashtag #romadicebasta, or Rome says enough in English, has been trending after a number of shocking incidents in the Eternal City. Police arrested three migrants aftera 16-year-old girl's body was found in a derelict building. She had been drugged and gang raped. Videos posted online have shown a number of wild boar running through the streets and feasting on rubbish. Reports suggest up to 8,000 people may have attended the demonstration Romans have had enough Ms Raggi took office after corruption scandals tainted the public image of traditional parties. But she herself is now standing trial for allegedly abusing her power over an appointment in her administration. A verdict is due on 10 November, and Ms Raggi says she will resign if convicted - which could lead to fresh elections.

"We don't know how you're going to perform Shut Up properly either mate... In Shut Up, Stormzy raps: ""Shut down Wireless, shut down Twitter."" He played that song, which contains five swear words, during his headline set at this year's Wireless Festival. But if he performed an uncensored version of that song atnextyear's Wireless, it could in fact shut down the event. New licensing rules,external, which come in from 2019, mean Wireless can still be held at London's Finsbury Park - as long as performers don't swear on stage. It's one of a handful of new rules from Haringey Council - including restrictions on noise levels, opening times and ""offensive"" clothes. So Wireless Festival could be very different in the future. Radio 1 Newsbeat has been taking a look at how these new rules could affect things. Post Malone would have trouble performing without slipping up on swearing (or getting served after 9:30pm) at Wireless 2019 Given these new restrictions, just a quick look at this year's line-up would put the festival in a bit of trouble if it was the same in 2019. Post Malone opened his set with Too Young (it contains 20 swear words), Lisa Mercedez's outfit could be judged as ""attire which exposes the groin, private parts, buttock or female breast(s)"" and surprise headliner Drake finished after the new 10pm performing curfew. Under the new rules, Stormzy would have to change at least 17 of the 21 songs performed during his set in 2018 because of the lyrics. The council's report says ""some of the language"" used by acts on the main stage was ""clearly audible and not appropriate"" for children in the local area to hear. Lisa Mercedez The rules are part of Haringey Council's look at how the festival promoter Live Nation runs the event, after 67 complaints were made about things like noise levels, drug taking and anti-social behaviour at the festival. A committee decided to change its conditions instead of taking away the licence altogether. If the new rules are not followed or organisers don't show ""reasonable efforts"" to make sure they're being followed, the festival could be given fines or stopped from being held in Finsbury Park in the future. The Friends of Finsbury Park group says it is pleased the council is doing something to limit the ""excessive and invasive noise"" and is happy that the event will finish earlier. But the group says some of its ideas have been ignored. It wanted a limit on the number of people allowed to attend, which it called the ""most important"" point. Last year 37,000 people went to Wireless. The current maximum capacity is 49,999. When asked how it would police the new rules, Festival Republic - which promotes the event - told Newsbeat: ""There's no statement from our side for the time being."" However, the festival's website does claim that ""Festival Republic is dedicated to having a positive impact on the local community"". Live Nation and The Friends of Finsbury Park have 21 days to appeal the decision. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,externalandTwitter,external.

"The pointless business meeting - we've all been there, says Stephanie Every time economists wonder why Britain's productivity is so low, it takes all my strength to resist spitting out one loathsome word - ""meetings"", says workplace commentator Stephanie Hare. Conference calls and video conferencing are the worst. You can write off the first several minutes because you and your colleagues will be troubleshooting technical issues, checking that everyone can see what's being shared on the screen, and struggling to mute or unmute yourselves. And just as everyone finally gets stuck into some content, someone will inevitably crash in, apologise for being late, and the whole thing starts over. In my experience, I've found that it's best to mute yourself before you start screaming. Often there's no pre-meeting agenda, so it's entirely possible to attend a meeting without knowing what you're supposed to contribute or get out of it. Nor is it always apparent why some of us are in the meeting. We may be wasting our time spectating, when we could be getting on with something more valuable - like working. Elon Musk: Walk out of a meeting if it's a waste of your time And if no-one agrees any ""action points"" at the end, you can leave a meeting wondering what just happened during that hour of your life that you'll never get back. No wonder Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, recently urged colleagues to walk out of meetings as soon as it becomes obvious that they are not adding value. ""It's not rude to leave,"" he explains. ""It's rude to make someone stay and waste their time."" Amazon's Jeff Bezos is so wary of bad meetings, he's devised an entire mitigation strategy. He avoids meetings before 10am, as he's figured out that he's not productive before then He keeps meetings small - with attendance limited to the number of people that can be fed by two pizzas And he's banned Powerpoint Instead, he demands that his executives write a six-page ""narratively constructed"" memo. ""It has real sentences and verbs and nouns,"" he confides. ""It's not just bullet points."" Jeff Bezos: Keep things small, not before 10am - and read the meeting's memos Now you Powerpoint junkies out there are no doubt gasping in disbelief. I can only imagine how apoplectic you'll be when you hear this: no-one talks anyone through a deck in a Bezos meeting. Instead, the first 30 minutes are spent in silence, reading the memo, because Bezos knows that executives can behave like teenagers: showing up to meetings without doing any preparation. Are some of you blushing? You know who you are! Why you shouldn't hug your colleagues Why team-building events can be terrible Yet even if you've sent out your agenda to your perfectly sized group and agree action points at the end, you can still run a bad meeting by failing to ensure that all voices are heard. This is more than just bad manners - it's bad management. Our more introverted colleagues may not have the appetite, or frankly, the energy, to elbow their way into a conversation dominated by those who are more expressive. And research shows consistently that women are often ignored and interrupted by men in meetings. Include everybody, don't let the motor-mouths dominate your meetings, says Stephanie Hare So to run a better meeting, here's a few action points for us all to consider. For instance, research shows that when a woman asks the first question or offers the first comment in a meeting, other women are likely to speak, too. So ladies, when you're offered the space - take it. Second, create space for quieter colleagues by asking them beforehand how they would like to be heard. After years of being talked over in meetings, I can promise you that they have many ideas. Third, we all need to hold ourselves accountable. If we truly think a meeting is a good use of our time, let's check with our colleagues. Finally, let's not take it personally if one of our colleagues pulls an Elon Musk and leaves our meeting. It doesn't necessarily mean we're boring - just that they've added what value they can.
