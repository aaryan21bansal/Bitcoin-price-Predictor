"Former Labour MP Angela Smith has joined the Liberal Democrats, calling them ""the strongest party to stop Brexit"". She said: ""We are facing a national crisis and people deserve better than the choice of the old two parties."" Ms Smith is the third MP to join the Lib Dems in a week, after Luciana Berger and Philip Lee defected. She quit Labour in February to form the Change UK party with six other MPs. The decision by Ms Smith, who is MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, brings the total number of Lib Dem MPs to 17, with Mr Leedramatically crossing the floorfrom the Conservatives on 3 September. Ms Smith's former Labour and Change UK colleague Ms Bergerjoined the Lib Demsdays later. Amber Rudd resigns from government Tory MP defects ahead of crucial Brexit vote Ex-Labour MP Berger joins Liberal Democrats Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said Ms Smith made a ""brave decision"" to leave Labour earlier this year over ""the mishandling of anti-Semitism claims and Jeremy Corbyn's stance on Brexit"". She said: ""We welcome Angela's commitment to stopping Brexit, and to building a fairer, more liberal society."" Ms Smith said she intended to fight against Brexit and campaign for ""the constitutional reform needed to mend our broken politics"". She said: ""We need a more inclusive, tolerant politics for our country that values diversity. ""The Liberal Democrats are the strongest party to stop Brexit and build a society that gives opportunities to everyone, tackle the climate crisis and invest in our public services."" Meanwhile Labour MP John Mann has used his exit from the Commons to criticise Jeremy Corbyn's record as leader, and blame him for the party's current anti-Semitism crisis. Mr Mann - who is standing down as the Labour MP for Bassetlaw - is set to take up a full-time post as the Government's ""anti-Semitism tsar"". He said he could not campaign for Mr Corbyn knowing he could become prime minister, and told The Sunday Times he would ""never forgive"" him for allowing the party to be ""hijacked"" by anti-Semites. He told the paper: ""Corbyn has given the green light to the anti-Semites and, having done so, has sat there and done nothing to turn that round.""

"A US Congressional committee is investigating President Donald Trump in connection with a potential conflict of interest over military spending at a Scottish airport near his golf resort.

"The superstore is 12 times the size of an average Oxfam shop An Oxfam ""superstore"" has opened it doors in Oxford - the city where the charity opened its first shop. Oxfam said it worked with a Swedish charity ahead of the launch of store, which is based on an ""out-of-town format"". The 18,500 sq ft (1,718 sq m) store has a drive-through option for people to drop off donations. The charity said it was the biggest of its shops worldwide, and that 150 volunteers would run it. It is the charity's first superstore Julie Neeve, project manager for the store, said: ""It was just an idea that we wanted to look at - an out-of-town format - and we spent some time with a Swedish charity looking at a similar model, understanding what they do. ""Then we found this amazing site across the road from our headquarters in Oxford."" Volunteer Rosemary Shurgold said: ""I love it. I think it is inspirational and well-stocked. ""It's the future and I really hope it's going to be a great success. ""There is always something happening and this organisation does not stand still."" Volunteer Rosemary Shurgold called the shop ""inspirational"" Oxfam opened its first shop in Oxford in 1948 and now has more than 600 stores across the UK.

"After suffering a string of parliamentary defeats over Brexit this week, Boris Johnson's strategy for leaving the EU on 31 October looks to be in trouble. A bill designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit, which would require Mr Johnson to ask for an extension to the UK's departure date, is expected to pass into law on Monday. Here is a round up of what the commentators say about the prime minister's position and his possible next moves. Katy Balls, deputy political editor of the Spectator, tweeted that Dominic Cummings, the senior adviser to the prime minister, told a meeting of government aides that they needed to be ""cool like Fonzies"" as No 10 plots its next move. The directive is part of a strategy to ""wait for others to melt"" while the government increases the pressure. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. But Rachel Sylvester, a political columnist for The Times, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that cabinet ministers ""certainly aren't cool like Fonzies"". ""I spoke to one last night who said they've completely miscalculated on Labour's attitude to a election and there's a real fear that there is no plan B. ""It is very hard to see how Boris Johnson gets out of this mess, he seems to have checkmated himself... and it's very difficult to see where he goes without humiliating himself or losing power."" Sebastian Payne, Whitehall correspondent for the Financial Times, questioned whether No 10 had a hidden trick up its sleeve. He told Today: ""They could for example, bring a no confidence motion in Mr Johnson himself. ""It would look weird for the Tories to say they have no confidence in their own government, but all it would need would be a straight majority, and if they win that, then we could start the train towards an election."" He added that No 10 had made a ""strategic miscalculation"" in assuming Labour would ""cave in"" to Tory calls for an election - and that it was Corbyn's party who were acting ""cool like Fonzies"". What are the PM's election options? MPs willing to go to court to enforce Brexit delay Do voters support a no-deal Brexit? ""Dominic Cummings has decided that the Tories have to become the real Brexit party... In those northern and midlands constituencies that voted Leave, there is a lot of pathological hatred towards the Tories in those seats. ""The question is, does the sheer force of Brexit and Mr Johnson break those bonds? Theresa May tried this in 2017... they thought they were going to win [in those constituencies] and they stayed in their old voting tribes, it's a big risk. ""If it pays off, Mr Johnson could get a nice healthy majority, but the Tories will essentially become the Brexit Party."" Matthew d'Ancona, editor of the slow-news outlet Tortoise, told Newsnight Mr Johnson had had a ""disastrous week in political showbusiness"". ""One minute you're Stormzy and the next minute you wake up and you're Michael Barrymore. ""That's what's happened. He was sold to us as this guy who is a winner, he could do all the things that Theresa May hadn't been able to do, and he could unite the party and the country by the sheer bringing of confidence and charisma. Could Mr Johnson still be a winner like Stormzy? ""He's like a person pressing the button on the app on his phone in fury, saying why is it not happening the way that he wants it to. ""The reason is that Brexit is fabulously difficult to achieve. We are untangling 40 years of legal, constitutional and commercial arrangements."" Mr Johnson has said that resigning as prime minister if he did not get a deal with the EU by 17 October was ""not a hypothesis"" he would be willing to contemplate. But Mr Johnson could tactically resign as prime ministerin the hope of getting back in. Rachel Sylvester called this idea ""bizarre"". She added: ""The whole point about Boris Johnson, the reason he was elected Tory leader, is that he is supposed to be a winner - and already he's lost four out of four parliamentary votes, and he's looking bizarre even on the election campaign trail, which he has already started out on."" Tom Holland, the author of Dominion, a new book about the history of Christianity, compared the prime minister's tumultuous week to the ""classical history that Boris Johnson's entire education has been marinated [in]"". He told Newsnight Mr Johnson might be drawing on such lessons for his Brexit plans, adding ""that there is a kind of heroism in dying on your sword"". Allow Twitter content?

Boris Johnson's decision to deselect 21 rebel Tory MPs, is a ""brutal strategy"", Mr Holland said, adding: ""In terms of his reputation and status, he is laying quite a lot on the line."" Could the prime minister repackage Theresa May'swithdrawal agreementand persuade MPs to vote for it a fourth time round, so he doesn't have to request an extension? John Rentoul, the chief political commentator of The Independent,wrote on Saturday:,external""Is there a change that could be made to the withdrawal agreement that would persuade 30 more MPs than voted for it last time to do so at the last moment? ""It doesn't seem likely. Johnson cut the ground from under his own feet on Wednesday, when he said that, if the anti-no-deal bill became law, it 'effectively ends the negotiations' with the EU."" But if EU leaders regard another extension as only ""postponing the problem"", they may prefer to help achieve ""an orderly Brexit, with a deal"".

"David Lidington made his remarks to the BBC's Today programme Former cabinet minister David Lidington has said there will have to be ""some kind of direct rule"" for Northern Ireland ahead of Brexit. Stormont has been without an executive for more than two years and Parliament has had to pass some key legislation for Northern Ireland in the interim. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of October. Mr Lidington said if there was no deal, it would be unconscionable to leave part of the UK without real governance. 'Stop fast-tracking NI laws' call rejected PM and NI secretary clash over Parliament suspension Does suspension 'slam brakes' on NI legislation? Stormont stalemate - how things stand The Conservative MP, who was in charge of overseeing Brexit preparations for devolved nations in Theresa's May's government, made the comments on the BBC's Today programme on Saturday. ""There will have to be some kind of direct rule and, I think, it's important that the government gets that sorted and in place, before the end of October, that deadline,"" he said. ""At the moment, the Northern Ireland civil service has no power to do things like give emergency support to farmers or food producers whose supply chains into the Irish Republic could be completely killed by a no-deal exit. The UK's planned departure date from the European Union is coming swiftly down the tracks ""All of a sudden their customers south of the border would say: 'Sorry you haven't got the certification. It's no longer an EU product, I can't legally buy this from you anymore'. ""The civil service of Northern Ireland does not have any power to help in those circumstances or to take other emergency measures that would be needed in the event of no deal. ""I think it would be unconscionable to leave any part of the United Kingdom without proper governance in the circumstances of that kind of crisis and for Northern Ireland, in particular, where the politics is fragile, the case is stronger than anywhere else to get this sorted in advance."" DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the DUP is ""ready to go into government tomorrow"" Speaking on the same radio programme, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party was  ""ready to go into government tomorrow, we have no preconditions"". ""We are ready to serve the people of Northern Ireland in a government,"" he added. But, he added: ""If Sinn FÃ©in continue to refuse to do that, then someone is going to have to start taking decisions. We cannot allow the people of Northern Ireland to continue to be disadvantaged because of Sinn FÃ©in's refusal to share power."" However, Sinn FÃ©in MP Chris Hazzard said that the idea of direct rule ""underscores once again that the dysfunctional Tory government is in complete hock in this grubby little deal with the DUP"". Mr Hazzard told the same programme:  ""People again on this side of the Irish sea in Ireland are completely bemused at the chaos, the dysfunction and reminded again that their interests will never be served at Westminster."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood told BBC News NI it was up to the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in to get back into government. Mr Eastwood accused the two parties of handing ""power away from local politicians"". ""Now they can protest about that. If they want to do something about it, they should get into government - that's how we solve this issue. ""That's how we send a very clear message to London that we are not having a crash-out Brexit."" Stormont's power-sharing government collapsed in January 2017amid a bitter row about a green energy scheme. Parliament is due to be suspended next week, returning a fortnight before the Brexit deadline, which some MPs say will cause problems for Northern Ireland. There are questions about what might happen if the government needs to pass any urgent legislation to mitigate a no-deal Brexit in Northern Ireland. Earlier this week, Conservative MP Simon Hoare was backed by Mr Lidington in warning that if Stormont was not restored by 31 October, NI civil servants would not be able to take ""any initiative"" to off-set issues raised by a no-deal Brexit. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has said that if talks to restore power-sharing did not succeed before Brexit,direct powers would need to be implemented ""at pace"". In July, Mr Lidington, who was then the de-facto deputy prime minister,warned that a no-deal Brexit could lead to the break up of the union. Does suspension 'slam brakes' on NI legislation?

"Diane Frost says she struggled to get a response when she complained about the bill Diane Frost was surprised when an energy bill arrived on her doormat for two very good reasons. Firstly it was from her former energy provider, Extra Energy, that had collapsed nine months earlier, and secondly it was for a whopping Â£4,431. ""I was totally shocked. I wasn't expecting it so long after the company went bust,"" she says. It's not clear why she was charged such a huge amount, but the worry is she may not be alone in being wrongly billed. Extra Energy is just one of ten smaller energy providers that collapsed within the space of a year, thanks in part to higher wholesale prices, new regulations, and the consequent pinch on their finances. That has left 850,000 customers, who have been switched to new providers but could find themselves, like Diane, receiving follow-up bills, sometimes long after they've ceased to be customers, as their old providers are wound up by administrators. The energy industry regulator, Ofgem, has already said in the case of Extra Energy it is aware of ""high levels of complaints"". Ofgem says it is ""extremely disappointed"" that customers were having to wait for so long for their final bills and that it was aware that some customers were querying the amounts being charged. Diane lived in a two bedroom terraced house in Leicester with her 23-year-old son and they were used to paying Â£35 a month for her energy. She was only with Extra Energy for two-and-a-half years and can't see how she could possibly owe anything near Â£4,000. ""I couldn't get any answers out of [the company],"" she says. ""I think it's been dealt with terribly."" Extra Energy went into administration in November 2018.At the time it saidthe introduction of a price cap by the government had ""made the energy market unviable"". Administrators PwC took over responsibility for finalising the bills, which it says it has now completed for a ""significant majority"" of customers. But that still leaves thousands of former Extra Energy customers waiting for their final bill, ten months after the firm's collapse. PwC said it would ""continue to work with customers... to resolve any issues as quickly and efficiently as possible."" Extra Energy's inadequate customer data systems are largely to blame for the delay, according to Ellen Fraser, energy analyst at Baringa. She describes them as ""horrendous"" and says PwC has had to go through the records customer by customer including meter readings. ""Ofgem need to be mindful that when organisations fail their data is typically in poor shape and administrators are likely to use that poor data to chase debt,"" she says. Diane's Â£4,430 bill was for energy use at her two-bed terraced house in Leicester Ofgem says as from next month it will begin a new round of consultation that will include looking at tests for suppliers already operating in the energy market and what happens when they go bust. For its part PwC has said it is looking into Diane's case as a matter of urgency, but that came only after five weeks and being contacted by the BBC's personal finance programme Money Box. Diane is still angry, and is determined to fight for the matter to be cleared up. ""They're not going to get the money off me, no way,"" she says and she suggests any other former Extra Energy customers who think they've been wrongly charged should do the same. ""Don't give in to them whatever you do. Don't give in,"" she says. Energy bills: 'I don't know who to trust' PPI: 'It was a jaw-dropping amount' Mum and dad 'one of UK's biggest mortgage lenders' The bill Diane received was so large it was obvious to her that it was a mistake, but she fears other people might accept a smaller charge without questioning it. ""Some people out there are really vulnerable and would have paid this without even looking into it,"" she says. ""It's not fair and it should be dealt with properly."" Customers who are concerned over legacy bills they receive from administrators for their former providers will also find their options for recourse are more limited than if they were complaining about their current energy supplier. Administrators like PwC are not bound by Ofgem's rules and regulations, because they aren't an energy company, nor can consumers turn to the energy Ombudsman for the same reason. Simon Baker, a commercial law specialist at Baker Skelly law firm, says there is a legal option they can pursue however, since general consumer law applies to companies like PwC. ""It may be hard for consumers to verify a bill from so long ago, but it may be worth challenging it if the sum claimed seems questionable,"" he says. It's likely the courts would want to see some kind of evidence over how the bill was calculated by the firm issuing it, he adds. In a statement PwC told Money Box: ""We continue to progress final billing of Extra Energy customers and are pleased that this exercise has been finalised for a significant majority of customers."" The firm also said it would encourage any customer who has any concerns around their energy bill to raise them with the Extra Energy team on 0800 953 4774/0800 368 5452.

I actually thought we had the better chances, unfortunately we didn't take them. ""I can't be anymore proud of my players. They left everything out on the pitch today and did everything I asked, we just came up a little bit short. But I'm really encouraged, it's really positive and it's just the start for us.

FT: Man City 1-0 Man Utd Manchester City manager Nick Cushing told BT Sport: ""I thought their goal was coming, they had two or three really good chances. It was unlike us to be so sloppy - I wasn't pleased (in the first half). Our standard of play was not at the level and we were getting outworked and kept giving the ball away cheaply. ""We came out in the second half and showed our intent and moved the ball quicker. ""We just need to get back on the training field because the games are going to come thick and fast and they will be difficult.""

"This video can not be played What is so-called ""fake news"" and how do you spot it? (From 2018) Plans to help tackle so-called ""fake news"" have been announced by the BBC and some of the biggest names in journalism and technology. The new measures include an early warning system for use during elections or when lives may be at risk, extra online education and improved access to impartial resources for voters. Major publishers, Google, Twitter and Facebook have helped devise the scheme. The BBC said the moves were ""crucial steps"" in fighting disinformation. BBC boss warns against 'assault on truth' Who will regulate digital political ads? India's fake news that just won't go away It follows criticism of big technology firms for failing to do enough to prevent the spread of ""false news"" - fromscares about vaccinesto storiesmanufactured to influence elections. Other recent events such asthis year's Indian electionshave also highlighted the dangers of disinformation and the risk it poses to democracy. This video can not be played Damian Collins, the committee's chairman, says ""sophisticated"" fake news is causing a ""crisis for democracy"" Earlier this summer, the BBC convened a Trusted News Summit, bringing together senior figures from major global technology firms and publishing to help tackle the problem. The group drew-up new plans including: Early warning system: creating a system so that organisations can alert each other rapidly when they discover disinformation that threatens human life or disrupts democracy during elections. The emphasis will be on moving quickly and collectively to undermine disinformation before it can take hold. Media education: a joint online media education campaign to support and promote media education messages. Voter information: co-operation on civic information around elections, so there is a common way to explain how and where to vote. Shared learning:Â  particularly around high-profile elections. BBC Director General Tony Hall said: ""Disinformation and so-called fake news is a threat to us all. At its worst, it can present a serious threat to democracy and even to people's lives. ""This summit has shown a determination to take collective action to fight this problem and we have agreed some crucial steps towards this."" Further details will be released at a later date.

"The superstore is 12 times the size of an average Oxfam shop An Oxfam ""superstore"" has opened it doors in Oxford - the city where the charity opened its first shop. Oxfam said it worked with a Swedish charity ahead of the launch of store, which is based on an ""out-of-town format"". The 18,500 sq ft (1,718 sq m) store has a drive-through option for people to drop off donations. The charity said it was the biggest of its shops worldwide, and that 150 volunteers would run it. It is the charity's first superstore Julie Neeve, project manager for the store, said: ""It was just an idea that we wanted to look at - an out-of-town format - and we spent some time with a Swedish charity looking at a similar model, understanding what they do. ""Then we found this amazing site across the road from our headquarters in Oxford."" Volunteer Rosemary Shurgold said: ""I love it. I think it is inspirational and well-stocked. ""It's the future and I really hope it's going to be a great success. ""There is always something happening and this organisation does not stand still."" Volunteer Rosemary Shurgold called the shop ""inspirational"" Oxfam opened its first shop in Oxford in 1948 and now has more than 600 stores across the UK.

"Hassan Rouhani (2nd right) says European partners can save the nuclear deal Iran says it has begun using new advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium - the latest step in reducing its commitment to a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Forty such centrifuges were now operational, said nuclear agency spokesman Behruz Kamalvandi. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons. Iran stopped abiding by two commitments in July in response to sanctions the US reinstated when it abandoned the deal. President Donald Trump wants to force Iran to negotiate a new agreement that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles. But Iran has so far refused. Why limits on Iran's enrichment matter Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Can the nuclear deal can be saved? Other countries which are parties to the deal - the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - have tried to keep it alive. But the sanctions have caused Iran's oil exports to collapse, the value of its currency to plummet, and sent its inflation rate soaring. The 2015 deal was designed to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons, though Iran has always denied wanting to do so. The UK government expressed disappointment. ""This third step away from its commitments under the nuclear deal is particularly disappointing at a time when we and our European and international partners are working hard to de-escalate tensions with Iran,"" the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. French defence minister Florence Parly said France would continue to push Iran to respect the accord. She was speaking in Paris after talks with her US counterpart, Mark Esper, who said he was not surprised at what Iran was doing. ""They had been violating it, they had violated the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for many years, so it's no surprise that the Iranians are going to pursue what the Iranians have always intended to pursue,"" he said. Mr Kamalvandi announced the new measures on Saturday. He told a news conference that Iran's Atomic Energy Agency had activated 20 IR-4 and 20 IR-6 centrifuges - which could enrich high-quality uranium. New centrifuges would be developed to meet the country's needs, he said. He added that Iran's steps were reversible - but this depended on other partners returning to their obligations under the deal. In the meantime, Iran would continue to allow inspections by the global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA confirmed on 1 July that Iran had breached the 300kg (660lb) limit on the amount of enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained Six days later, Iran began enriching uranium to 4.5% concentration so it could make fuel for its Bushehr power plant - beyond the 3.67% cap enshrined in the nuclear deal. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. Under the accord, Iran is allowed to operate no more than 5,060 IR-1 centrifuges - the oldest and least-efficient model - until 2026. It is also permitted to continue research and development in a manner that does not accumulate enriched uranium, and to test more advanced IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges, which can more quickly enrich uranium. After 2024, it may commence the testing of up to 30 IR-6 centrifuges. The installation of advanced centrifuges would shorten Iran's so-called ""break-out time"" - the time required for it to produce enough fissile material for a bomb. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal Iranian officials have given a cautious welcome to a French proposal to offer Iran a $15bn (Â£12bn) line of credit, secured by oil, in return for its full compliance with the nuclear deal. That would allow Iran to obtain foreign currency. A senior US official told Reuters news agency that the Trump administration was ""pretty sceptical"" of the French initiative but had not ruled out approving it.

"Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) is one of the cheapest interplanetary missions ever undertaken India's space programme has succeeded at the first attempt where others have failed - by sending an operational mission to Mars. The Mangalyaan satellite was confirmed to be in orbit shortly after 0800, Indian time. It is, without doubt, a considerable achievement. This is a mission that has been budgeted at 4.5bn rupees ($74m), which, by Western standards, is staggeringly cheap. The American Maven orbiter that arrived at the Red Planet on Monday is costing almost 10 times as much. Back in June, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi even quipped that India's real-life Martian adventure was costing less than the make-believe Hollywood film Gravity. Even Bollywood sci-fi movies like Ra.One cost a good chunk of what it has taken to get Mangalyaan to Mars. $74m Cost of India's Mangalyaan mission $671m Cost of Nasa's Maven Mars mission Launched on5 Nov  2013 Weighs1,350kg Closest point to Mars366km So how has India done it?  For sure, people costs are less in this populous nation, and the scientists and engineers working on any space mission are always the largest part of the ticket price. Home-grown components and technologies have also been prioritised over expensive foreign imports. But, in addition, India has been careful to do things simply. Narendra Modi said the country had achieved the ""near impossible"" ""They've kept it small. The payload weighs only about 15kg. Compare that with the complexity in the payload in Maven and that will explain a lot about the cost,"" says Britain's Prof Andrew Coates, who will be a principal investigator on Europe's Mars rover in 2018. ""Of course, that reduced complexity suggests it won't be as scientifically capable, but India has been smart in targeting some really important areas that will complement what others are doing."" Mangalyaan has gone equipped with an instrument that will try to measure methane in the atmosphere. This is one of the hottest topics in Mars research right now, following previous, tantalising observations of the gas. Earth's atmosphere contains billions of tonnes of methane, the vast majority of it coming from microbes, such as the organisms found in the digestive tracts of animals. The speculation has been that some methane-producing bugs, or methanogens, could perhaps exist on Mars if they lived underground, away from the planet's harsh surface conditions. Mangalyaan will measure methane in the Martian atmosphere - a crucial question It is a fascinating prospect. So, even though Mangalyaan has a small payload, it will actually address some of the biggest questions at the Red Planet. Western scientists are excited also to have the Indian probe on station. Its measurements of other atmospheric components will dovetail very nicely with Maven and the observations being made by Europe's Mars Express.  ""It means we'll be getting three-point measurements, which is tremendous,"" says Prof Coates. This will enable researchers to better understand how the planet lost the bulk of its atmosphere billions of years ago, and determine what sort of climate it could once have had, and whether or not it was conducive to life. I have read a lot about the criticism of Mangalyaan and India's space programme. There's an assumption among many, I guess, that space activity is somehow a plaything best left to wealthy industrial countries; that it can have no value to developing nations. Students in Chennai saluted the country's space scientists The money would be better spent on healthcare and improved sanitation, so the argument goes. But what this position often overlooks is that investment in science and technology builds capability and capacity, and develops the sort of people who benefit the economy and society more widely. Space activity is also a wealth generator. Some of the stuff we do up there pays for stuff down here. The industrialised nations know it; that's one of the reasons they invest so heavily in space activity. Consider just the UK.  It has dramatically increased its spending on space in recent years. The government has even identified satellites as being one of the ""eight great technologies"" that can help rebalance the UK economy and drive it forward. India wants a part of this action, too, and in Mangalyaan and its other satellite and rocket programmes, the nation is putting itself into a strong position in international markets for space products and services.

"Peter Hartley was jailed for 16 months A sex offender who concealed a spy camera in the ladies' toilets at Pinewood Studios has been jailed. Maintenance worker Peter Hartley, 50, planted a tiny motion-triggered camera behind a grille in the toilets at the studios in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. The camera was spotted in June by a woman working at Pinewood, where the new James Bond film is being shot, Aylesbury Crown Court heard. Hartley, of Uxbridge, west London, was jailed for 16 months. The latest Bond film is being filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire He will be on the sex offenders register for 10 years. Hartley, who was working as a maintenance man, was caught after the worker noticed light reflecting from the lens similar ""to light reflecting off the face of a watch"" and used a screwdriver to take off the grille. Prosecutor Daniel Wright told the court the device was marketed as a ""spy camera"" and Hartley had used a piece of tape to cover its LED light to try to stop it being detected. Hartley, who has a history of similar offences dating back to 2008, contacted his public protection officer at the Met Police later that morning to tell him he had reoffended. He has previous convictions for placing cameras in a council building in Coventry in 2009 and for placing one in the changing rooms of a leisure centre in 2016. Hartley has a total of three convictions for eight offences. He later pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism at Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court. In a victim impact statement, the young woman who found the camera said she had needed mental health treatment and had suffered from acute anxiety. Jailing Hartley, Judge Francis Sheridan said the victim's life ""has been devastated by a dirty-minded individual who preys on women"".

"Reiss, Ralston and Ricky (l-r) Gabriel were jailed after DNA linked to them was found on a pistol intended for a violent criminal Identical triplets have been jailed after DNA linked them to a plot to supply an ""extremely dangerous criminal"" with an Uzi sub-machine gun. DNA found on a handgun linked it to either Reiss, Ralston or Ricky Gabriel but it was impossible for police to prove which brother it belonged to. However, an investigation revealed all three were involved. The 28-year-olds, from Edmonton in north London, were sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court. Forensic examinations of a handgun found DNA linked Reiss, Ralston an Ricky Gabriel. Ricky and Ralston Gabriel, who are both semi-professional footballers, were found guilty of conspiracy to possess firearms and ammunition with intent to endanger life in July and each jailed for 14 years. Reiss Gabriel was found guilty of the same charge and also admitted possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life after being caught with a handgun in July last year, and two counts of possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply. He was jailed for 18 years. Armed police found an Uzi sub-machine gun with a silencer and ammunition and a loaded pistol on courier Hamza Ahmed Armed police found an Uzi sub-machine gun with a silencer and ammunition and a loaded pistol on courier Hamza Ahmed, 21, after stopping a taxi in Tottenham, north London, on 10 April 2017. The DNA recovered from the pistol was not attributable to just one of the triplets, as they shared almost identical DNA. Detectives carried out an extensive investigation to find out which of the brothers was involved in handling the firearms - but mobile phone and surveillance evidence revealed it was all three, the court heard. Aron Thomas was given a life sentence for two counts of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life. The brothers were the final three of eight individuals charged over a plot to supply weapons. Prosecutor Kerry Broome said: ""An Uzi sub-machine gun is clearly an extraordinarily serious firearm. It is not capable of any lawful use. It has the capability to cause maximum indiscriminate harm. ""The pistol was loaded. They were both ready for immediate use."" The firearms were meant for Aron Thomas, 32, who was caught with another loaded revolver and ammunition when he was held on 26 April 2017. At the time, he was on licence, having been released from an 11-year prison sentence for opening fire at random towards a crowded street near Wood Green Tube station in 2010. Thomas, from Holloway, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years last year after he was found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life. Hamza Ahmed, Elyace Hamchaoui and Joshua Miller were also jailed over the plot Ahmed, from Archway, north London, was jailed for 16 years for one count of conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life in relation to the first incident. Middleman Elyace Hamchaoui, 23, from Arnos Grove, north London, was sentenced to 14 years in prison for the same charge. Joshua Miller, 27, of no fixed address, was jailed for 17 years for conspiracy to possess a firearm with intent to endanger life in relation to the second incident.
