"The clip was originally submitted to a pro-Trump forum on the social media site Reddit The US President has tweeted a short video clip of him wrestling a person with the CNN logo for a head. The clip is an altered version of Donald Trump's appearance at a WWE wrestling event in 2007, in which he ""attacked"" franchise owner Vince McMahon in a scripted appearance. The animation appears to have been posted to a pro-Trump internet forum earlier in the week. CNN later accused the president of inciting violence against the media. One panellist on ABC's morning show, Ana Navarro - a Republican Trump critic and CNN contributor - said ""it is an incitement to violence. He is going to get somebody killed in the media."" But Homeland Security Adviser Thomas Bossert, who had appeared earlier on the same ABC programme, said: ""No-one would perceive that as a threat."" The clip was submitted to a Donald Trump forum on the social media site Reddit four days ago, where it became one of the most popular posts. Trump's fake Time magazine cover Trump Twitter museum opens in New York After the president's tweets, Reddit users expressed disbelief at the president'suse of the clip,external. It was also retweeted by the official presidential Twitter account,@POTUS,external, operated by the White House. This video can not be played Meet the Progressive Liberal: an anti-Trump wrestler in Appalachia Mr Trump has repeatedly clashed with the CNN news network, which he calls ""fake news"". CNN's top White House correspondent Jim Acosta, who has been critical of the White House's attitude to the press, simply tweeted: ""Isn't pro wrestling fake?"" Meanwhile, the CNN Communications team tweeted a seemingly sarcastic response quoting White House press officer Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said on Thursday: ""The President in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary."" In a later statement, the news network said ""clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied... [he is] involved in juvenile behaviour far below the dignity of this office."" ""We will keep doing our jobs. He should start doing his."" Donald Trump has shown time and time again that he views politics as performance art; another reality television competition where the more drama and conflict there is, the better. His CNN-wrestling video tweet is just the latest, most jarring example. For Mr Trump the political process is like a World Wrestling Entertainment match. The plot is contrived; the action is fake; the outcome predetermined. During his campaign, he pulled back the curtain on the show and laughed along with his supporters at the spectacle. He encouraged his crowds to cheer the hero (him) and berate the villains (everyone else). As president, nothing has changed. CNN has just been chosen as the latest number-one bad guy. The president's tweet will certainly harshen the level of discourse in the nation. Already there are accusations that Mr Trump is inciting violence. Most of his supporters, however, will see it as Mr Trump probably intended - the latest episode in the biggest show ever to hit the US political scene; the newest twist in the remaking of the modern US presidency. Read more of Anthony's analysis Mr Trump's unusual tweet comes a day after he said his use of social media ""is not Presidential -it's modern day presidential."" On Thursday, the presidentlaunched a crude personal attackon MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough. His tweets were condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike. Trump-Brzezinski row: Why facelift-gate matters Mr Trump has an entryin the World Wrestling Entertainment hall of fame,externalfor his appearance in the franchise a decade ago. In 2007, franchise owner Vince McMahon challenged Mr Trump to a so-called ""Battle of the Billionaires"" at a Wrestlemania event, with a wager that the loser would have their head shaved. The US professional wrestling scene is largely pre-scripted and seen as a form of entertainment rather than a sport. Mr Trump was also a victim in the scripted fight During the same event, Mr Trump was ""thrown"" to the mat by wrestler Steve Austin with his signature move, ""the stone cold stunner."" Rather than fighting directly, each business magnate backed a performer. Mr Trump's wrestler was victorious. But on the sidelines of the ring, Donald Trump performed his scripted attack on McMahon, providing the original video for his beat-down of CNN. Mr Trump then helped to shave McMahon's head on television.

"The car appeared to have hit the front of the building A McLaren supercar was reduced to a twisted, burned-out wreck after it struck a building and burst into flames. The driver and passenger of the 570S, which sell for around Â£143,000, escaped with minor injuries following the crash at Heywood, near Trowbridge, Wiltshire. The fire service was called to Westbury Road just before 06:30 BST on Sunday. Crews found the occupants had made it out of the burning sports car, which was stuck beneath a collapsed wall. Fire crews were called to the crash site early on Sunday Chris Evans reviewed a McLaren 570S on Top Gear Images taken by Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue show small fragments of the car's distinctive orange paintwork are still visible. It is not known what speed the McLaren had been travelling at prior to the crash. Damien Bence, from the fire service, said it was ""absolutely amazing"" the car's occupants walked away from the scene. ""Prior to hitting the building it snapped an electric pole in half, and forced the top half of the pole through the window of the house,"" he said. ""We were confronted with a live electrical cable which was strewn across the highway so crews had to negotiate their way through part of a wood in order to get to the incident.""

"Acid attacks are not uncommon against women in India A woman in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh who survived an alleged gang-rape and four separate acid attacks has been targeted again by an acid-thrower. She was attacked outside a women's hostel in Lucknow while getting water from a hand pump, police said. The woman, 35, had been receiving round-the-clock police protection because of the previous attacks, which were linked to a property dispute. Anger is growing at the authorities' inability to protect her. She was allegedly gang-raped and first attacked with acid by two men in 2008, over a property dispute, the details of which are not clear. The same two men are then accused of throwing acid at her twice more - in 2012 and 2013 - to try and get her to drop the criminal charges against them. In depth: The women fighting back after acid attacks Raped comic 'super hero' returns in new role This video can not be played Laxmi Saa was 15 when a 32-year-old man threw acid at her after she rejected his marriage proposal - she spoke to Kinjal Pandya-Wagh from the BBC's Delhi Bureau In March, she was attacked again while travelling on a train with her daughter. This time she was forced to drink acid. Two men are facing trial for all of the attacks but were released on bail in April, the AFP agency reports. According to government figures, there are hundreds of such attacks involving acid each year in India, although campaigners say the real figures are much higher. The victims, who have to live with terrible disfigurements, are mainly women and are often targeted by jealous partners, campaigners say. Despite aSupreme Court rulingin 2013 to regulate the sale of acid, critics say it is still widely and easily available. The cafe helping to support acid attack victims in India.

"The Civil Aviation Authority says drone use has increased significantly A drone flying close to Gatwick Airport led to the closure of the runway and forced five flights to be diverted. An airport spokesman said the runway had been closed for two periods on Sunday - of nine and five minutes - after the drone was sighted. Easyjet said four of its flights were diverted, while British Airways said one aircraft was diverted to Bournemouth. Other flights were put into holding patterns as a precaution. Sussex Police is investigating. The airport said: ""Runway operations at Gatwick were suspended between 18:10 BST and 18:19, and again from 18:36 to 18:41, resulting in a small number of go-arounds and diverts."" Craig Jenkins, who was flying with Easyjet from Naples, Italy, said: ""We were crossing over the Channel and it [the plane] started circling. ""It did four or five circles... before the captain said we were landing at Stansted. ""First, they said Gatwick was closed because of an incident. Shortly after, they said it was a drone."" Mr Jenkins, from Greenwich, south-east London, said passengers were given the choice of disembarking at Stansted or waiting an hour to fly back to Gatwick. Niamh Slatter, from Sussex, was flying from Valencia, Spain, when her BA flight was diverted to Bournemouth. ""We were due to land 15 minutes early, but ended up circling over the south coast,"" she said. ""Our attempted landing at Gatwick was aborted quite late as the drone had been spotted again, so we were told that the flight was being diverted to Bournemouth."" Easyjet apologised for the inconvenience, saying the circumstances were ""outside"" of the firm's control. The UK Airprox Board monitors near-miss incidents. An Airprox is the official term for a situation where the distance between aircraft and their relative positions and speed were such that the safety of the aircraft may have been compromised. There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - more than double the number for 2015. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. The Civil Aviation Authority recommends drones be flown at no higher than 400ft. However, the highest Airprox involving a drone was at 12,500ft. Of the 142 Airprox incidents involving drones recorded since 2010, 40 of them were near to Heathrow. Six of them, up to May, had been near to Gatwick. This video can not be played Drones should be flown no higher than 400ft In November 2016, the UK's drone code was revised and updated to help pilots ensure they fly the gadgets safely. The revised code turned the five main safety tips into a mnemonic, spelling drone, to make it easier to remember. Don't fly near airports or airfields Remember to stay below 120m (400ft) and at least 50m (150ft) away from people Observe your drone at all times Never fly near aircraft Enjoy responsibly UK revises safe flying drone code The British Airline Pilots' Association's flight safety specialist, Steve Landells, said the threat of drones flown near aircraft ""must be addressed before we see a disaster"". ""We believe a collision, particularly with a helicopter, has the potential to be catastrophic,"" he said. The union has called for compulsory registration of drone users and said new technology should be considered, including a system where the drone transmits enough data for the police to track down the operator. The Civil Aviation Authority said there were serious consequences for people who broke the rules when flying drones. ""Drone users have to understand that when taking to the skies they are potentially flying close to one of the busiest areas of airspace in the world. ""[It is] a complex system that brings together all manner of aircraft including passenger aeroplanes, military jets, helicopters, gliders and light aircraft,"" a spokesman said. ""It is totally unacceptable to fly drones close to airports and anyone flouting the rules can face severe penalties including imprisonment.""

"The USS Stetham, pictured here arriving in Shanghai in 2015, sailed close to Triton Island Beijing has called the presence of a US warship near a disputed island in the South China Sea ""a serious political and military provocation"". The USS Stethem sailed close to Triton Island, part of the Paracel Islands archipelago, claimed by China and others. China responded by sending military vessels and fighter jets to the area. It happened hours before US President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping spoke on the phone. During the call, Mr Xi told Mr Trump that ""negative factors"" were affecting US-China relations, according to a read-out of the call carried on Chinese state TV. A White House statement about their call did not say if they had discussed the incident. It said the leaders had instead ""reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearised Korean peninsula"". Why is the South China Sea contentious? Satellite photos 'show weapons' built on islands The US has repeatedly warned China against its occupation and aggressive reclamation of islands in disputed waters, but Beijing says it is within its sovereign rights to do so. Ina statement late on Sunday,,externalChina's foreign ministry confirmed reports that the USS Stethem had entered waters claimed by China. The warship had sailed within 12 nautical miles of Triton Island - which is also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam - as part of its ""freedom of navigation"" operations, according to news agencies and Fox News citing US defence officials. UN rules dictate that any territory can claim the waters up to 12 nautical miles from its coast. The sailing of a US ship within those limits indicates the US does not recognise the territorial claim. This video can not be played Rupert Wingfield-Hayes gets a view of a new Chinese runway on Mischief Reef Beijing said it would use ""all necessary means to defend national sovereignty and security"". It also accused the US of ""deliberately stirring up troubles"" in the region as China and Southeast Asian neighbours have ""cooled down and improved the situation"". China has been embroiled in maritime disputes with several of its regional neighbours in recent years. Chinese tour groups have also visited the Paracels The US conducts a programme called ""freedom of navigation"" whichthe State Department says,externalis to highlight the need to protect global maritime rights. The US, it says, will not acquiesce ""in unilateral acts of other states designed to restrict the rights and freedoms of the international community in navigation and overflight and other related high seas uses"". It views Beijing's construction of artificial islands on disputed reefs in the South China Sea as a threat to freedom of navigation. The military operation is the second since Mr Trump took office. In May,the USS Dewey sailedless than 12 nautical miles from an artificial island built by China called Mischief Reef, which is part of the Spratly Islands. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said a few days later thatthe US would not acceptChina's militarisation of man-made islands in the region. In previous years, the US has conducted such operations against China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the South China Sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years as Beijing has begun re-asserting its claims. The area is a major shipping route, and a rich fishing ground, and is thought to have abundant oil and gas reserves. The various islands and waters are claimed in part or in whole by Taiwan, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. Much of the conflict has been centred on two clusters of islands, the Paracels and Spratlys. China claims the largest portion of territory, saying its rights go back centuries, and issued a map in 1947 detailing its claims. Under President Xi Jinping, China has ramped up its territorial assertions, building artificial islands and military facilities on reefs while also carrying out naval patrols in disputed waters. But China denies the accusations of militarisation, saying the facilities are for civilian and defence purposes. Last year aninternational tribunal rejected Chinese claimsto the area, backing a case brought by the Philippines. China called the ruling ""ill-founded"" and said it would not be bound by it.

"At least 80 people are thought to have been killed in the fire No-one will be prosecuted for illegally subletting a Grenfell Tower flat, the government says, as work continues to identify all those killed in the fire. It says its priority is supporting survivors and identifying loved ones and is urging people to help. At least 80 people are thought to have died in the fire at the west London block and it's feared the full death toll won't be known for months. Meanwhile cladding on 181 blocks in 51 areas has now failed fire safety tests. Cladding from as many as 600 tower blocks across Englandis being testedas it is thought Grenfell Tower's recently-installed cladding may have helped the fire to spread. All of the material checked so far in the wake of the tragedy on 14 June has failed the tests. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was testing the buildings it was most worried about first. Where have cladding fire tests failed? What we know so far Who were the victims? Earlier this week, police warned it would not know the final death toll until at least the end of the year and appealed for the public to come forward with any information about those who were inside at the time of the fire on 14 June. The Metropolitan Police and Home Office have also both said they are not interested in the immigration status of anyone living in the building. Legal guidance telling prosecutors not to bring charges for subletting given the ""public interest"" in identifying the victims has been issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders. ""It is a priority for investigators to establish who was in Grenfell Tower on that tragic day and it is crucial that we do everything possible to support them,"" she said. The decision was made alongside the Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC, who added: ""Every piece of information will help the authorities accurately identify who was in the flats at the time of the fire. A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? ""I hope this statement provides some much needed clarity to residents and the local community, and encourages anyone with information to come forward."" Announcing the move, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid added: ""Supporting those affected by the tragic events at Grenfell Tower has been the absolute priority of the government - that includes making sure that loved ones still missing are identified. ""Therefore I would urge those with information to come forward without fear of prosecution."" Supporters of Grenfell survivors took part in anti-government protests in London on Saturday The news follows an announcement by Kensington and Chelsea Council that it would suspend the rents of those forced to leave their homes after the fire. Residents living in nearby buildings - the so-called finger blocks - have been without hot water since the neighbourhood's boiler was destroyed during the fire. Now the council has confirmed their rent will be suspended until at least January 2018 and any rent deducted since 14 June will be refunded. It comes after a victims' group said one resident had had rent deducted from their bank account since the fire. The west London council has been heavily criticised for its response to the disaster, leading this week to the resignation of its leader, Nicholas Paget-Brown, and his deputy, Rock Feilding-Mellen. Robert Atkinson, leader of the opposition on Kensington and Chelsea council, told the BBC: ""I still have residents who are not housed. ""I still have residents have no hot water and I have got residents living in hotels which they are now sharing with Wimbledon spectators. That is not a satisfactory situation."" This video can not be played Conservative councillor Catherine Faulks apologises over victim rent blunder Sid-Ali Atmani, who lived on the 15th floor with his family and is currently in a hotel, told the BBC: ""Still we haven't any improvement regarding our situation. Our personal opinion is [that it is] a failure for people who are responsible for that."" A Kensington and Chelsea council spokesman said: ""We are focused on the needs of all affected residents, including those from Barandon Walk, Testerton Walk and Hurstway [the finger blocks]. ""This group of residents have suffered a huge disruption to their lives as they were evacuated from their homes."" He added that the council expected to have the hot water supply restored in the next week. He said some had gone back to their homes, but the council would continue to provide temporary accommodation for those who did not want to return. Meanwhile, Labour MP David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye died in the fire, told Sky News that the retired judge leading the public inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, would have to maintain the confidence of survivors. ""The job is not just to be independent and judicious - I am sure he is eminently legally qualified, of course he is - it is also to be empathetic and walk with these people on this journey,"" he said. Yvette Williams, from the Justice 4 Grenfell campaign group, told Sky News they would boycott the public inquiry into the tragedy if it did not have a wide remit and address ""systemic issues"".

"UK officials have ""quietly abandoned"" hopes of securing ""the government's promised cake-and-eat-it Brexit deal"", theGuardian reports,external. According to the paper, government insiders have reported a ""dramatic change of mood"" in the Department for Exiting the European Union since the general election. It says the idea of enjoying full trade access to the bloc - without concessions over immigration, courts and a financial settlement - is now being given less credence by officials. Many of the papers focus on the reported divisions within Conservative ranks about public spending. ""Cabinet split over austerity tax row"" is the front page headline in theDaily Telegraph,external. It suggests Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned ministers that ""unpopular tax rises"" will be required to fund possible moves, like lifting the cap on public sector pay increases.

Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external According tothe Times,external, Britain's new independent reviewer of counter-terrorism laws is concerned about the way jihadist attacks are covered by the media. It says Max Hill believes the publication of images of dead terrorists can give, in his words, ""the oxygen of publicity in death, to those who apparently craved martyrdom"". But one senior media lawyer, Mark Stephens, tells the paper: ""It is extremely unhelpful to make the argument that freedom of speech needs to be curbed, in an effort to fight terror."" The lead in theFinancial Times,externalis about a delegation from the City of London travelling to Brussels this week, with what it describes as ""a secret blueprint for a post-Brexit free-trade deal on financial services"". The paper says there is concern among bankers that the deadline for the UK to leave the EU, in March 2019, will come before a ""credible deal has been struck"". ""Blame it on our boys"",externalis the front page headline in the Sun.  It claims that Iraqis, who had alleged that they were mistreated by American troops, were told by lawyers to accuse UK forces instead, because the Ministry of Defence was easier to sue. The paper quotes someone who used to work for a law firm handling such claims, saying it was widely known that many were fake.

"A 50mph speed limit will remain in place while traffic management systems are tested A Â£174m upgrade to turn the M3 into a ""smart"" motorway in Surrey and Hampshire has opened. The 13.4-mile stretch between Farnborough and the M25 is now a four-lane carriageway after the main construction work was completed. Motorists have faced years of disruption sincework beganin 2014. Ongoing roadworks and some overnight restrictions will continue to affect motorists with speed limits in place as the system is tested. Technology is being used to manage traffic flows with variable speed limits and use of the hard shoulder. Speed limits will remain in place until later this month. Motorists have faced years of road works on the M3 during the widening work The M3 passes through Chobham Common, an area of heathland in Surrey. Before work began, the government said the M3 smart motorway would improve journey times by 15%, but the then Highways Agency raised concerns extra traffic would cause EU air quality rules to be broken. In June 2014, a plan to impose a 60mph speed limit on that part of the M3 to cut air pollution wasput on holdby the then Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, with the Highways Agency asked to look at other ways of tackling pollution. Maintenance work on the motorway is still to be completed, including the rebuilding of the Woodlands Lane bridge over the motorway near Windlesham, which will continue until later in the year, Highways England said. Pranav Devale, project manager for Highways England, said: ""This new stretch of smart motorway will tackle congestion and improve journey times for the 130,000 drivers who use it every day."" Back in 2014, Highways England said the main project work would be completed by December 2016. But James Wright of Highways England said: ""The reason we are finishing construction now rather than last December is that, shortly after we started work and after a bit of local lobbying, we agreed to do a large amount of maintenance work at the same time as the smart motorway upgrade."" He said the extra work included fully resurfacing the road and replacing a bridge over it. ""This is extra work with extra benefits and we do not consider it a delay,"" he added.

"Mike Pence has said he would not dine alone with any woman who was not his wife, Karen (pictured) Many eyebrows were raised when it emerged US Vice-President Mike Pence would not dine alone with a woman who was not his wife. How old fashioned, the internet cried. Only, now it seems he is not alone. A surprise poll for theNew York Times,externalhas discovered more than half of women agree with him - as well as 45% of men. And as for a drink? Forget about it. Just 29% of women think that would be appropriate in a one-on-one situation. Are Mike Pence's dining habits chivalrous or sexist? However, the poll - conducted by Morning Consult, surveying almost 5,300 people -  found the numbers shift considerably according to your politics: the more liberal your views, the more likely you were to mix with a member of the opposite sex, one on one. Just 62% of Republicans found it acceptable, compared to 71% of Democrats. Similar divides can also be seen according to religion - the more devout you are, the less appropriate you view it - and to education: 24% of male respondents of who did not reach college think it is inappropriate to have a one-on-one working meeting with a woman, compared with 18% who got a bachelor's degree or higher. Michael, US:Simply ask yourself: would you want your partner to go out for dinner alone with someone else? Most likely the answer is no. Hence, then why should you? It's simply being wise and not naive. Sandra, US:Not entirely sure why people don't understand that you can have a platonic, working or otherwise relationship with a member of the opposite sex without  sexual overtones. To my way of thinking it demeans woman in terms of woman thinking men are only interested in their bodies... If you can't trust your partner or yourself out of sight the problem is you. Stephen, Australia:I totally agree with Mike Pence. He's protecting his marriage and his reputation. It is not sexist, it is wise. In an era where people look to the Kardashians for their moral standards Mike Pence's policy, in this area at least, is commendable. Emily, US:These archaic views are just another example of why we shouldn't have been surprised at a Trump/Pence victory last November. Mario, South Africa:Men who are not sure about their self-control should indeed dine and drink alone. Perhaps dinner and a drink with their mothers should be permitted, but I am not so sure about sisters and daughters after reading some comments uttered by Donald Trump. Vince, UK:Really? How very Victorian of them. Are they scared they might end up doing something they shouldn't. I can't believe in the 21st century some people think this is an issue. Sarah, US:I'm a 52-year-old, white, college educated, atheist, left-wing, married woman ... and there's no way I would have a one-on-one meal/drink with a man who was not my husband. Not even a Starbucks. M.H., Canada:I would definitely lunch or have dinner alone with a man whom I knew and trusted and with whom I had a lot in common. I am also a year away from being 90 and find it hard to believe that there is anything wrong with this. Are Mike Pence's dining habits chivalrous or sexist? Silicon Valley's women have spoken.

"The venue is being shut down by the city in the aftermath A rapper who was performing at the Arkansas nightclub where 25 people were shot has been arrested on unrelated charges, US police say. Gunfire was exchanged during a concert at the Power Ultra Lounge nightclub in Little Rock early on Saturday. Ricky Hampton, known by his stage name Finese 2 Tymes, was detained by police early on Sunday. Little Rock Police tweeted,externalthat the arrest was on outstanding warrants and is unrelated to the shooting. A total of 28 people were injured, including three in a stampede. The youngest victim was said to be 16. Two people were in a serious condition, but officials said all were expected to survive. The mayor of Little Rock, Mark Stodola, said the shooting was the result of a disagreement involving a number of patrons at the club, which quickly escalated because of ""the presence of rivalries and weapons"". ""I want to reassure our public that this was not an act of terrorism, but a tragedy... It does not appear to be a planned shooting,"" Mr Stodola told reporters. Mr Hampton's poster for the event was criticised in the aftermath of the shooting Little Rock Police Chief Kenton Buckner said the authorities were investigating whether a longstanding rivalry between gangs was to blame for the shooting. In a post on Facebook, Mr Hampton offered condolences to the injured who came to see him perform, saying ""violence is not for the club."" ""We all come with one motive at the end of the day, and that's to have fun. Not to be hurt,"" he said. The KATV network quoted Mr Hampton's booking agent as saying the rapper had ""nothing to do"" with the shooting. Promotional material for Mr Hampton's concert was criticised by Mayor Stodola and others on social media for its image of the rapper holding an assault rifle pointed at the camera. The city of Little Rock has suspended the Power Ultra Lounge's licence, and officials say they plan to shut down the club permanently. The venue's landlord has also posted an eviction notice at the site, reports said. Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson thanked the first responders to the scene - but also expressed concern about violence in the city. ""Little Rock's crime problem appears to be intensifying. Every few days it seems a high-profile shooting dominates the news, culminating with this morning's event,"" he said. He said a new strategy and extra resources were needed to ""take the violent threats off the streets"". A previous version of this article quoted US media reports that inaccurately said Mr Hampton had been arrested in connection with the shooting.

"Trump's history with wrestling goes back at least a decade On Saturday, Donald Trump tweeted that he's redefining the social media behaviour of a ""modern-day"" president. On Sunday he once again proved it. Mr Trump's CNN-wrestling video, apparently cribbed from a user on the internet message board Reddit, may be unfamiliar commentary coming from the chief executive of the US, but it's classic Trump. He has shown time and time again that he views politics as performance art; another reality television competition where the more drama and conflict there is, the better. Candidate Trump belittled his Republican opponents - Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and company - then shrugged it off as part of the game. He turned Hillary Clinton, whom he had once praised and buddied around with at his wedding, into a ""crooked"" caricature who should be shipped off to prison. He portrayed the media, and CNN in particular, as cartoon villains that he can rhetorically beat into submission. Mr Trump's choice of a professional wrestling clip for his latest tweet was particularly apt, as throughout his campaign he treated the political process like a World Wrestling Entertainment match. The drama is contrived; the action is fake; the outcome predetermined. Trump body-slams CNN I'm modern day presidential, says Trump He pulled back the curtain on the show and laughed along with his supporters at the spectacle. He encouraged his crowds to cheer the hero (him) and berate the villains (everyone else). Journalists - corralled in their pens - were often singled out for derision, and his adoring legions would turn and jeer, shaking their fists, but also, for the most part, enjoying themselves. On more than one occasion while covering Mr Trump's campaign, I would have a friendly conversation with someone at his rally - an elderly woman in a homemade Trump t-shirt in Virginia or a leather-jacket-clad rancher in Nevada - then watch as they heartily booed me and my colleagues at Mr Trump's prompting. This video can not be played Are President Trump's attacks on the media undermining the news? The press, like Mr Trump's opponents on the debate stage, were all part of his performance; the black-clad villains in his show. Some in the media have rushed to condemn Mr Trump's wrestling tweet as a thinly-veiled threat of violence against the media. CNN issued a statement calling it a ""sad day"" and asserting deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied earlier in the week when she said the president had never ""promoted or encouraged violence"". White House 'in smear threat to TV hosts' Trump and the media - Is it war or love? Such imagery coming from the president of the US will certainly harshen the level of discourse in the nation, and there is the not insignificant possibility that some may view it as a call for violence. This video can not be played 'I want to upset people', says the Progressive Liberal, an anti-Trump wrestler Most, however, will see it as the president probably intended - the latest episode in the biggest show ever to hit the US political scene; a new plot twist to keep the audience entertained. As Mr Trump said in a speech lashing out against his media critics on Saturday night: ""I'm president, and they're not."" Donald Trump played by his rules and won. He's going to keep reminding us that it's not the same game anymore. Welcome to the modern presidency. Donald Trump posts video 'beating' CNN Meet wrestling's anti-Trump villain.

"The government is to end an arrangement that allows other countries to fish in UK waters, it has been announced. The convention allows Irish, Dutch, French, German and Belgian vessels to fish within six and 12 nautical miles of UK coastline. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the move would help take back control of fishing access to UK waters. The European Commission said it ""took note"" but felt the convention had been superseded by EU law. Ireland's minister for agriculture, food and the marine, Michael Creed, however, said it was ""unwelcome and unhelpful"". ""Brexit poses very serious challenges to the seafood sector and this announcement will form part of the negotiations,"" he said. The Scottish government backed the idea,saying it had been pressing for it ""for some time"". The London Fisheries Convention sits alongside the EU Common Fisheries Policy, which allows all European Union countries access between 12 and 200 nautical miles of the UK and sets quotas for how much fish nations can catch. The relationship between the UK and Ireland is further governed by a separate arrangement. Withdrawing from the convention, which was signed in 1964 before the UK joined what became the EU, means UK vessels will also lose the right to fish in waters six to 12 nautical miles offshore of the other countries. What happens to the 12 to 200 mile area will be one of the issues at stake in Brexit negotiations. Read more on how Brexit would affect fishing waters Michael Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr the change was about ""taking back control"" of UK waters, 6-12 miles from the coast. When the UK left the EU it would become an ""independent coastal state"", he said. He said the EU's common fisheries policy had been an environmental disaster and the government wanted to change that, upon Brexit, to ensure sustainable fish stocks in future. But the SNP's Richard Lochhead, who held the post of fisheries minister in Scotland until last year, has concerns around fishing being used as a ""bargaining chip"" by the government, which would ""let down UK fishermen"". ""Michael Gove is doing his best to get maximum publicity out of the easy bit,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. ""But the difficult, complex bit is still to come [with] the Common Fisheries Policy. UKIP's fisheries spokesman Mike Hookem also said he feared another ""wholesale betrayal"" without assurances about the 200-mile zone. ""Fishing communities across Britain voted to leave the EU to get back the rights to earn a living, support their communities and to stop the EU plundering our seas of fish that the UK could exploit economically,"" he said. He added that the announcement was ""no victory for the fishing community"" and was instead a ""government attempt to use smoke and mirrors to placate British fishermen, while at the same time having the option of handing most our fishing rights to the EU"". Government figures say,externalfishing contributed Â£604m to UK GDP in 2015 and employed around 12,000 fishers. In 2016, the fish processing industry supported around 18,000 jobs. The industry's body, the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, welcomed the decision. Chief executive Barrie Deas said: ""This is welcome news and an important part of establishing the UK as an independent coastal state with sovereignty over its own exclusive economic zone."" Its chairman Mike Cohen said a 12-mile exclusive zone for UK boats would be ""a good thing"" for the UK's inshore fishing fleet. Will McCallum, Greenpeace UK head of oceans, said leaving the convention would not in itself deliver a better future for the UK fishing industry, and that for years governments had blamed the EU for their ""failure"" to support the small-scale, sustainable fishers. He said, for example, that the UK had had the power since 2013 to decide how to allocate its EU fishing quota but that areport by Greenpeace in 2016,externalhad found almost two thirds of that quota was concentrated in the hands of three companies. He said the UK would also still be bound by the UN convention of the law of the seas - which requires cooperation with neighbours. But Mr McCallum said he was ""excited"" that the government was making fishing a priority, after fearing fishing communities would end up ""at the bottom of the heap"" amidst complex Brexit negotiations. Environmental law firm ClientEarth consultant Dr Tom West said the move appeared to be an aggressive negotiating tactic. ""As a country outside the EU we need to consider how we can best co-operate with our neighbours, rather than unilaterally withdrawing from all agreements in the hope that standing alone will make us better.""

"Joana Burns was not said to be a regular drug user A 22-year-old maths student died after taking MDMA for a ""final fling"" to mark the end of university. Joana Burns had completed her Sheffield Hallam University degree when she went on a night out at The Foundry, at the University of Sheffield's Students' Union building, on 6 June. A South Yorkshire Police report found she and her friends paid Â£7 each for the drug, commonly known as ecstasy. One friend told officers that Miss Burns was not a regular drug user. The friend said: ""It was just supposed to be a one-off, 'final fling' to finish university."" Another friend said there was an ""understanding/assumption"" that the group would take drugs on the night out. Miss Burns was taken from the Glossop Road venue to the Northern General Hospital after falling ill, while another young woman was also admitted in a critical condition after taking drugs. The University of Sheffield's Students' Union says it ""operates a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs consumption, possession and dealing"" Police compiled the report for a licensing hearing at Sheffield City Council. PC Paul Briggs said during a visit to the premises a week before the student's death, he found the Foundry's drugs box to be ""considerably full"" of confiscated substances. A ""large quantity"" of drugs was seized by door staff on the night of the incident, the report added. Temporary Ch Supt Shaun Morley said officers from South Yorkshire Police's licensing team had recovered a large quantity of drugs seized by door staff at previous visits to the premises. The University of Sheffield Students' Union website said anyone caught with drugs would be removed from the premises. A fundraising page for Miss Burns' memorial fund has seen more than Â£1,250 pledged in donations.

"This video can not be played Stephen Hawking spoke to the BBC about climate change and Donald Trump Stephen Hawking says that US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement could lead to irreversible climate change. Prof Hawking said the action could put Earth onto a path that turns it into a hothouse planet like Venus. He also feared aggression was ""inbuilt"" in humans and that our best hope of survival was to live on other planets. The Cambridge professor spoke exclusively to BBC News to coincide with his 75th birthday celebrations. Arguably the world's most famous scientist, Prof Hawking has had motor neurone disease for most of his adult life. It has impaired his movement and ability to speak. Yet through it all, he emerged as one of the greatest minds of our time. His theories on black holes and the origin of the Universe have transformed our understanding of the cosmos. Prof Hawking has also inspired generations to study science. But through his media appearances what has been most impressive of all has been his humanity. His main concern during his latest interview was the future of our species. A particular worry was President Trump's decision towithdraw from the Paris climate agreementto reduce CO2 levels. What is climate change? What is in the Paris climate agreement? ""We are close to the tipping point where global warming becomes irreversible. Trump's action could push the Earth over the brink, to become like Venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid,"" he told BBC News. ""Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it's one we can prevent if we act now. By denying the evidence for climate change, and pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement, Donald Trump will cause avoidable environmental damage to our beautiful planet, endangering the natural world, for us and our children."" The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also highlights the potential risk of hitting climate tipping points as temperatures increase - though there are gaps in our knowledge of this topic. In its Fifth Assessment Report,external, the IPCC authors wrote: ""The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger tipping points (thresholds for abrupt and irreversible change) remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing multiple tipping points in the Earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising temperature."" When asked whether he felt we would ever solve our environmental problems and resolve human conflicts, Prof Hawking was pessimistic, saying that he thought our days on Earth were numbered. ""I fear evolution has inbuilt greed and aggression to the human genome. There is no sign of conflict lessening, and the development of militarised technology and weapons of mass destruction could make that disastrous. The best hope for the survival of the human race might be independent colonies in space."" And on Brexit, he feared UK research would be irreparably damaged. ""Science is a cooperative effort, so the impact will be wholly bad, and will leave British science isolated and inward looking"". I asked him what he would like his legacy to be. ""I never expected to reach 75, so I feel very fortunate to be able to reflect on my legacy. I think my greatest achievement, will be my discovery that black holes are not entirely black."" ""Quantum effects cause them to glow like hot bodies with a temperature that is lower, the larger the black hole. This result was completely unexpected, and showed there is a deep relationship between gravity and thermodynamics. I think this will be key, to understanding how paradoxes between quantum mechanics and general relativity can be resolved."" When asked if money or practicality were no object, what his dream present would be, he said it would be a cure for motor neurone disease - or at least a treatment that halted its progression. ""When I was diagnosed at 21, I was told it would kill me in two or three years. Now, 54 years later, albeit weaker and in a wheelchair, I'm still working and producing scientific papers. But it's been a great struggle, which I have got through only with a lot of help from my family, colleagues, and friends.""

"This video can not be played Gove's quick-fire answers on the Andrew Marr show - Brexit and his return to the cabinet The government should listen to review bodies' recommendations for public sector pay, Michael Gove has said. His comments come as the prime minister and chancellor face increasing pressure from ministers and backbenchers to end the 1% public sector pay cap. The environment secretary did not call directly for the cap to be lifted but said ministers should respect the ""integrity"" of the pay review process. Labour said it would allow the review bodies to award ""a fair pay rise"". Pay rises for five million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% since 2013, before which there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. The Conservatives went into the election pledging to maintain the cap until 2020, but some MPs are now calling for a rethink after the party lost its majority. Two review bodies dealing with the pay of police and teachers will make recommendations later this month, and there are growing expectations that one or both could call for rises that exceed the government's cap. The cabinet is split on the principle of scrapping the cap, but it could be dismantled bit by bit. ""I think that we should listen to the pay review bodies who govern each individual area of public sector pay,"" Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The presenter suggested the cap, imposed by the chancellor, set the parameters for the bodies' recommendations. ""They take account of that but they also take account of other questions as well, including the number of people who enter the profession, whether we need to have an increase in pay in order to ensure we get the very best people into the profession,"" Mr Gove said. ""These pay review bodies have been set up in order to ensure that we can have authoritative advice on what's required, in order to ensure that the public services on which we rely are effectively staffed and the people within them are effectively supported."" Deciphering the public sector pay hints Public sector pay cap 'under review' Thousands join anti-government protest Asked what he personally thought about scrapping the pay cap, he said: ""I am not an individual - I am a member of a collective team."" Mr Gove, a former education secretary, has told theSunday Times,externalthat when the review bodies made recommendations on school teachers' pay, ""I think I always accepted them."" ByBBC political correspondent Iain Watson Privately, ministers believe it is perfectly possible that at least some of the pay review bodies - which also cover health service workers, prison officers and senior public servants - will call for average increases of more than 1%. A government minister with good links to Downing Street told the BBC that review body recommendations would be honoured, even if this breached the current pay cap. But No 10 insists that ministers will decide whether to accept recommendations on a case-by-case basis. So while the pay cap may not be abolished for every public sector employee all at once, it is possible that its erosion will begin soon. Other Sunday newspapers also reported on a growing revolt within the Conservative Party over its approach to austerity and public spending. The Observer says there is a""chorus of demands"",externalfrom within the party for a radical overhaul of state funding, with cabinet ministers and senior MPs calling for more money for NHS workers and schools, as well as a ""national debate"" on tuition fees. According to the paper, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Education Secretary Justine Greening are lobbying for an easing of austerity. The paper says the pressure to abandon austerity puts Chancellor Philip Hammond under pressure to consider raising taxes to fund any extra public spending. The Telegraph,external, meanwhile, reports that Ms Greening has told Prime Minister Theresa May she wants the government to abandon plans to cut per pupil funding over the coming years. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said the Tories were in ""turmoil"" The paper says it is understood the education secretary wants a public statement within weeks outlining the change in direction so that schools know the funding they are to receive before they break up for the summer holidays. According to the paper, the proposal would mean spending an extra Â£1.2bn by 2022. Mr Gove said he would not ""second guess"" the current education secretary but Tory backbencher Heidi Allen, also appearing on Andrew Marr,  said it was ""great to see Justine coming out and saying: 'Yes, there needs to be more money for schools.'"" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the reports revealed ""turmoil"" in the Conservative Party. ""They're saying 'Wait for the pay review bodies,' even though they're the ones insisting on a 1% cap,"" the Labour frontbencher told Andrew Marr. ""We're saying to the pay review bodies: 'Get rid of the 1% cap and give a fair pay rise.'"" Thousands demonstrated against austerity in central London on Saturday Asked what level Labour thought was fair, he said the review bodies ""should consider"" a pay rise in line with the rise in average earnings across the economy. ""Clearly, they are not going to be able to overturn the 14% loss that NHS workers have had over seven years but they have to come up with responsible recommendations, which we would accept."" Mr Ashworth suggested that some of the cost of the pay awards in the NHS could be offset by savings in the amount the health service paid to agency workers, due to a shortage of full-time staff. Last week a Labour attempt to scrap the 1% cap was defeated in Parliament. But the pressure to ease austerity has intensified since June's general election, with a number of backbench Tory MPs arguing that it cost the party votes and contributed to the loss of its majority. On Saturdaythousands of people gathered in central Londonfor a demonstration against austerity that was addressed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

"Brad Pitt stars as a military commander in Afghanistan in Netflix's dark satire The longest war the US has ever fought - 16 years and counting - is about to get longer as President Donald Trump decides on sending several thousand more troops to Afghanistan. As with the wars in the Middle East, Afghanistan highlights the difficult political choices and counter-insurgency strategies the US has been pursuing fruitlessly since 9/11. Today six Muslim countries (Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Afghanistan) are in a state of meltdown - partly as a result of US policies. The ""war on terror"" launched by President George Bush, the US invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and the conflicting policies of carrying out regime change in the midst of an ever-expanding Islamist extremist opposition have all created greater dilemmas for the US. Since 9/11 there have been many good books and documentary films made about these dilemmas. Yet in all this time Hollywood has been unable to produce a movie that informs or educates the average movie-goer as to the bigger picture on why failure persists and jihadism spreads. The few Hollywood films made about America's wars tend to be either satires or action movies in the John Wayne mould, showing US troops as heroic and caring but professional killers. An exception was the 2008 film Hurt Locker, which won six Oscars and depicted the dilemmas faced by a US Explosive Ordinance Disposal unit in Iraq. But even Hurt Locker dealt with only a slice of the problem, as did otherwise well-made documentaries about US forces in Afghanistan such as Restrepo and Korengal. How Trump might break Afghan stalemate Four days behind the Taliban front line Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? Hollywood movies do not ask the difficult strategic questions. Should the US invade or interfere in countries it knows little about, how do US troops win over local support, is nation building and promotion of democracy feasible by one part of the US government while another part pursues a war strategy?  Can the US ever understand tribal societies through the barrel of a gun? Hollywood has left us devoid of any understanding of the escalating global chaos. That is until now. A remarkable new film, War Machine starring Brad Pitt, which at first whiff sounds like a gonzo-type war movie, brilliantly portrays these themes outlined above. David Michod, the Australian writer and director, and Netflix have made a movie that is both dark and satirical, emotional and belly-laugh funny, as well as being educative about US interventions. The film is based on a character similar to former Nato commander US General Stanley McChrystal (R) The script is based on the Rolling Stone magazine article and subsequent book The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America's War in Afghanistan, by the late journalist Michael Hastings. His article led to the 2010 sacking of Stanley McChrystal, the US general in charge of the war in Afghanistan, after he and his staff officers made disparaging remarks about President Barack Obama to the journalist. The movie tells the story leading up to Gen McChrystal's dismissal. The casting of Pitt as Gen Glen McMahon, the imagined McChrystal who is beloved by his men but also full of comic eccentrics, is near perfect. Pitt plays his role partly as absurdist comedy but also as someone who is on a steep learning curve on how to win or lose modern wars. Full of bluster and self confidence Gen McMahon arrives to take charge in Kabul after another general had failed. ""Let's go win this thing,"" and ""Let's knock this on the head,"" he tells his military aides - a coterie of equally brilliant actors whose cameos act as foils for Gen McMahon's slow realisation that he is only repeating what other generals before him have tried and failed to do. Gen McMahon cannot get the additional US troops he needs because Mr Obama is reluctant to send any. Gen McMahon cannot stop Afghan farmers from growing poppy because, officials tell him alternative crops like cotton would be competing with US farmers. Fellow Nato officers teach Gen McMahon a new reality. ""You can't build a nation at gunpoint"" and ""you can't win the trust of a country by invading it"", he is told. A cynical President Hamid Karzai, superbly played by Ben Kingsley (with all of Mr Karzai's habitual tics), hears out Gen McMahon describing how he will mark out a new direction. ""We will build Afghanistan into a free and prosperous nation,"" says Gen McMahon.  ""Sounds a lot like the old direction,"" Mr Karzai replies with a knowing smile. Ben Kingsley plays Hamid Karzai, Afghanistan's former president Several dark yet truthful encounters speed up Gen McMahon's understanding. A troubled and angry US marine played by Lakeith Stanfield questions how his contradictory strategy can work. Trained to kill, the marines is now told he must show ""courageous restraint"". ""I can't tell the difference between the people and the enemy,"" says the marine. ""They all look alike to me. We can't help them and kill them at the same time. I am confused,"" he states. Actress Tilda Swinton, playing a German politician, tells Gen McMahon that ""you are spread all over the country and fighting 1,000 separate battles with local people who don't want you in their villages and that is a war you will never win"". The general is gobsmacked into silence. The film will not get a wide cinema release because it is showing on Netflix. However, this is a film that should particularly be shown at universities and colleges, and discussed amongst young and old. It helps us understand why counter-insurgency is failing, terrorism expanding and why wars have destroyed so many countries. It helps explain why after 16 years Washington is still debating troop numbers.

"At least 80 people are thought to have been killed in the fire No-one will be prosecuted for illegally subletting a Grenfell Tower flat, the government says, as work continues to identify all those killed in the fire. It says its priority is supporting survivors and identifying loved ones and is urging people to help. At least 80 people are thought to have died in the fire at the west London block and it's feared the full death toll won't be known for months. Meanwhile cladding on 181 blocks in 51 areas has now failed fire safety tests. Cladding from as many as 600 tower blocks across Englandis being testedas it is thought Grenfell Tower's recently-installed cladding may have helped the fire to spread. All of the material checked so far in the wake of the tragedy on 14 June has failed the tests. However, the Department for Communities and Local Government said it was testing the buildings it was most worried about first. Where have cladding fire tests failed? What we know so far Who were the victims? Earlier this week, police warned it would not know the final death toll until at least the end of the year and appealed for the public to come forward with any information about those who were inside at the time of the fire on 14 June. The Metropolitan Police and Home Office have also both said they are not interested in the immigration status of anyone living in the building. Legal guidance telling prosecutors not to bring charges for subletting given the ""public interest"" in identifying the victims has been issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders. ""It is a priority for investigators to establish who was in Grenfell Tower on that tragic day and it is crucial that we do everything possible to support them,"" she said. The decision was made alongside the Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC, who added: ""Every piece of information will help the authorities accurately identify who was in the flats at the time of the fire. A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? ""I hope this statement provides some much needed clarity to residents and the local community, and encourages anyone with information to come forward."" Announcing the move, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid added: ""Supporting those affected by the tragic events at Grenfell Tower has been the absolute priority of the government - that includes making sure that loved ones still missing are identified. ""Therefore I would urge those with information to come forward without fear of prosecution."" Supporters of Grenfell survivors took part in anti-government protests in London on Saturday The news follows an announcement by Kensington and Chelsea Council that it would suspend the rents of those forced to leave their homes after the fire. Residents living in nearby buildings - the so-called finger blocks - have been without hot water since the neighbourhood's boiler was destroyed during the fire. Now the council has confirmed their rent will be suspended until at least January 2018 and any rent deducted since 14 June will be refunded. It comes after a victims' group said one resident had had rent deducted from their bank account since the fire. The west London council has been heavily criticised for its response to the disaster, leading this week to the resignation of its leader, Nicholas Paget-Brown, and his deputy, Rock Feilding-Mellen. Robert Atkinson, leader of the opposition on Kensington and Chelsea council, told the BBC: ""I still have residents who are not housed. ""I still have residents have no hot water and I have got residents living in hotels which they are now sharing with Wimbledon spectators. That is not a satisfactory situation."" This video can not be played Conservative councillor Catherine Faulks apologises over victim rent blunder Sid-Ali Atmani, who lived on the 15th floor with his family and is currently in a hotel, told the BBC: ""Still we haven't any improvement regarding our situation. Our personal opinion is [that it is] a failure for people who are responsible for that."" A Kensington and Chelsea council spokesman said: ""We are focused on the needs of all affected residents, including those from Barandon Walk, Testerton Walk and Hurstway [the finger blocks]. ""This group of residents have suffered a huge disruption to their lives as they were evacuated from their homes."" He added that the council expected to have the hot water supply restored in the next week. He said some had gone back to their homes, but the council would continue to provide temporary accommodation for those who did not want to return. Meanwhile, Labour MP David Lammy, whose friend Khadija Saye died in the fire, told Sky News that the retired judge leading the public inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, would have to maintain the confidence of survivors. ""The job is not just to be independent and judicious - I am sure he is eminently legally qualified, of course he is - it is also to be empathetic and walk with these people on this journey,"" he said. Yvette Williams, from the Justice 4 Grenfell campaign group, told Sky News they would boycott the public inquiry into the tragedy if it did not have a wide remit and address ""systemic issues"".

"This video can not be played Archaeologist Lorena Vazquez explains why the Aztecs created their skull towers Tales of the tower of skulls which struck fear into the hearts of Spanish conquistadors have been passed down through the generations in Mexico. Said to be the heads of defeated warriors, contemporary accounts describe tens of thousands of skulls looming over the soldiers - a reminder of what would happen if they did not conquer territory. For the next 500 years, the skulls lay undisturbed underneath what was once the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, but is now Mexico City. Until, that is, a group of archaeologists began the painstaking work of uncovering their secrets two years ago. What they found has shocked them, because in among the skulls of the young men are those of women and children - bringing into question everything historians thought they knew. The skulls were first discovered in 2015 A team of archaeologists has been painstakingly uncovering them ever since ""We were expecting just men, obviously young men, as warriors would be, and the thing about the women and children is that you'd think they wouldn't be going to war,"" Rodrigo Bolanos, a biological anthropologist investigating the find, told news agency Reuters. ""Something is happening that we have no record of, and this is really new, a first."" So far, archaeologists have found 676 skulls in a site next to Mexico City's Metropolitan Cathedral, which was built over the Templo Mayor, one of the most important Aztec temples. Historians have been surprised to discover the remains of women and children among the skulls For many years, it has been thought they were the skulls of warriors defeated in battle Its base has yet to be uncovered, and it is thought many more skulls will be found. They are believed to form part of the Huey Tzompantli, a skull rack some 60 metres (200ft) in diameter which stood on the corner of the chapel of Huitzilopochtli, the Aztec god of the sun, war and human sacrifice. Archaeologists have no doubt it is one of the racks, or tzompantli, described by soldier Andres de Tapia, who accompanied Hernan Cortes in the 1521 conquest of Mexico. Cortes landed at Veracruz, on Mexico's east coast, in 1519. Two years later, allied with other native forces, Cortes' men captured the Aztec capital. So far, more than 650 skulls have been found Many more skulls are believed to be hidden underneath the city The secret of why we like to eat chocolate Mexico profile At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played Syrian state TV released footage of the aftermath of the Tahrir square blast A suicide bomber has launched an attack in the Syrian capital, with reports saying at least 19 people were killed. Syrian police had been chasing three suspected car bombers that were trying to enter the capital, state TV said. Police stopped and detonated two of the vehicles, but the third driver entered Tahrir square in the east and blew himself up after being surrounded. Syria is in the midst of a six-year-long civil war, with Damascus still mostly under government control. At least 12 people were injured in Sunday's blast, reports said. State TV said the attackers had planned to bomb crowded areas in the capital on the first working day after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ""The terrorist bombings killed and wounded several civilians and caused physical damage to the area,"" a police official told state news agency Sana. Why is there a war in Syria? Refugee camp destroyed in fire A local resident told AFP he heard ""gunfire at around 06:00 (03:00 GMT), then an explosion which smashed the glass of houses in the neighbourhood"". An AFP correspondent at the scene saw extensive damage to nearby buildings and two bombed cars at one side of the square. Syria's foreign ministry sent a letter to the UN saying up to 20 people were killed and dozens of women and children were among the wounded, Reuters reports. Police said the attackers had intended to target busy areas in the capital No group has said it carried out the attack. More than 300,000 people have lost their lives in the Syrian war, which began with anti-government protests in 2011. The UN's refugee agency says that since the conflict began about 5.5 million people have left the country, and another 6.3 million have been left internally displaced. Nearly 500,000 Syria refugees return home Six decisive points that changed Syria's war Damascus has remained mostly under the control of President Bashar al-Assad, and avoided much of the fighting. However, the capital has experienced a number of suicide bomb attacks. In March, two bomb attacks in the capital killed more than 40 people - the majority of them Iraqi pilgrims visiting the Bab al-Saghir cemetery, which houses Shia mausoleums. A jihadist group affiliated with al-Qaeda claimed that attack. A few days later,an attack on the capital's main court complexkilled at least 31 people. That attack was claimed by the Islamic State militant group (IS). Such attacks may become more common as IS loses its territory and resorts to its tactic of striking soft targets in cities to sow instability, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher reports.

"French hostage Sophie Petronin was abducted from Gao in December A Mali-based al-Qaeda affiliate has released a video of six foreign hostages ahead of a visit by French President Emmanuel Macron to the country. They include a French NGO worker, an elderly Australian surgeon and a Colombian nun. No ""genuine"" negotiations to release them have taken place, the video says. Mr Macron is in Mali to consolidate western backing for a regional force against the militants. Among the hostages seen in the footage is Sophie Petronin, who was abducted last December in the town of Gao, where she ran an NGO helping malnourished children. The video's narrator said Ms Petronin was hoping that Mr Macron would help return her to her family. Speaking in Mali's capital Bamako, Mr Macron said France and the ""Sahel G5"" countries - Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania and Niger - had to work together to eradicate ""terrorists, thugs and murderers"". He said France would ""put all our energy towards eradicating"" those who had kidnapped Ms Petronin. Mr McGown has been held since 2011 The video also shows South African hostage Stephen McGown asking when his ordeal will come to an end. ""Now we're making a new video, but I don't know what to say. It's all been said in the past. It's all been said in previous videos I've made,"" he says. The release of this video will lead many to believe that it was timed to coincide with a meeting of West African leaders and France's president in Mali on Sunday. It is a reminder that al-Qaeda affiliates remain the main jihadist threat across the region. Some of the hostages were abducted a few years ago while others more recently - keeping hostages that long and seizing new ones show how much al-Qaeda relies on ransom money to operate. The deployment of yet another force, discussed on Sunday, is part of a huge security build-up in the Sahel, where foreign military presence has increased in the last few years. But observers say political solutions are also needed across the impoverished region, where a lack of infrastructure and opportunities allows jihadist groups to thrive. World's most dangerous peacekeeping mission Mr McGown was kidnapped from a hotel in Timbuktu in 2011 along with two others, Swede Johan Gustafsson - who wasreleased last month- and Dutchman Sjaak Rijke - who was freed by French special forces in 2015. Also shown is Australian Ken Elliott, who is in his 80s. He was abducted in January 2015 in Djibo with his wife Jocelyn, where the couple had beenrunning the town's only medical facilities. Jocelyn was released in February 2016. ""To my family I just want to say again I love you all,"" he says. This video can not be played Dicko Seydou from Djibo tells BBC World News about Dr Ken Elliott's work The others are Romanian mineworker Iulian Ghergut, who says he was abducted in Burkina Faso in April 2015, Swiss missionary Beatrice Stockly, kidnapped in Mali in January 2016, and Colombian nun Gloria Argoti, seized in Mali in February. Burkina Faso's new war against militants The 17-minute video was released by a group calling itself the Group to Support Islam and Muslims, formed in early March as a result of a merger between Mali-based jihadist group Ansar Dine, al-Mourabitoun, and the Sahara branch of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). Who are AQIM? In November the NGO Gift of the Givers said AQIM elders had agreed to release Mr McGown butyounger members did not want to. Mali's security has gradually worsened since 2013, when French forces repelled allied Islamist and Tuareg rebel fighters who had seized control of much of the north. Mr Macron wants greater support for the Sahel G5, who are setting up a 5,000-strong force based in SÃ©varÃ© in central Mali to fight rising militant attacks. He hopes to help raise funds for the force - so far, the EU has pledged only â¬50m (Â£44m; $57m), while Mali's foreign minister has estimated that the force would cost closer to â¬400m. Mr Macron said attempts to combat terrorism needed to be accompanied by parallel efforts to improve development in the region, including fighting climate change and improving governance. There are 4,000 French troops and 12,000 UN peacekeepers in the region. Last month, five people - soldiers from Portugal and Mali, a Malian woman working for the EU mission and civilians from China and Gabon - were killed when gunmen from an al-Qaeda-linked groupstormed a tourist resortnear the capital Bamako.

"President Trump says his tweets helped him to win the US presidential election US President Donald Trump has defended his use of social media in a series of tweets, following a row over comments he made about two MSNBC TV presenters. ""My use of social media is not presidential - it's modern day presidential,"" he tweeted on Saturday. Earlier in the week, the presidentlaunched a crude personal attackon Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough. His tweets were condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike, despite the White House springing to his defence. Mr Trump's aides have previously expressed concern over his tweets. But the president said on Saturday that social media gave him the opportunity to connect directly to the public, bypassing the mainstream media, whose content Mr Trump regularly labels as ""fake news"". ""The FAKE & FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media,"" he tweeted, adding: ""But remember, I won the 2016 election with interviews, speeches and social media."" Trump-Brzezinski row: Why facelift-gate matters Trump Twitter museum opens in New York Trump's fake Time magazine cover Six things that could topple Trump's wall,external Mr Trump also stepped up his attack on CNN after the US news network retracted an article alleging that one of the president's aides was under investigation by Congress. ""I am extremely pleased to see that @CNN has finally been exposed as #FakeNews and garbage journalism. It's about time!"" The story that caused the upset, which was later removed from the website following an internal investigation,resulted in the resignations of three CNN journalists: Thomas Frank, investigative unit editor and Pulitzer Prize winner Eric Lictblau and Lex Harris, who oversaw the investigations unit. Mr Trump has repeatedly called CNN ""fake news"" and has previously labelled Buzzfeed a ""failing pile of garbage"". At a news conference in February, the president was introduced to the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel, to which he responded: ""Here's another beauty."" Meanwhile, addressing military veterans at the John F Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington on Saturday, Mr Trump promised that America would ""win again"", prompting cheers from the crowd as he attacked media outlets. ""The fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them,"" he said at the Celebrate Freedom Rally. ""The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House. But I'm president, and they're not."" The US president has more than 33 million followers on Twitter. Although it is becoming seemingly more difficult for the president to shock this audience, his 140-character posts have been condemned by both politicians and commentators. Some consider the language used by Mr Trump as unsuitable for the holder of the highest office. On Friday, the New York Post publisheda three-word editorial,externalon Mr Trump's tweets: ""Stop. Just stop."" This video can not be played Trump's tweets: Four women, two takes It followed the president's tweets on Thursday mocking MSNBC Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski, saying she had been ""bleeding badly from a facelift"" when he saw her six months ago. He also verbally attacked her co-host and partner, Mr Scarborough, describing him as ""psycho Joe"". Ms Brzezinksi and Mr Scarborough hit back, accusing the president of an ""unhealthy obsession"" with them"". Theyalleged the White House had tried to blackmail theminto apologising for their show's negative coverage of President Trump. Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski were targeted in Donald Trump's latest Twitter tirade Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr Trump's remarks were ""beneath the office"" of president, while fellow Republican Ben Sasse said ""this isn't normal and it's beneath the dignity of your office"".

"Police cordoned off the scene following reports of multiple shootings at a nightclub At least 25 people have been shot at a nightclub in the US state of Arkansas, two of whom are in critical condition, police say. Three others were injured in a stampede of people fleeing the scene. The youngest victim was said to be 16. The exchange of gunfire took place at about 02:30 local time (07:30 GMT) at a concert, but there was no immediate information about a suspect. Police and local officials said the incident was not terrorism-related. The mayor of Little Rock, Mark Stodola, said it was the result of a disagreement involving a number of patrons at the Power Ultra Lounge nightclub, which quickly escalated because of ""the presence of rivalries and weapons"". ""I want to reassure our public that this was not an act of terrorism, but a tragedy... It does not appear to be a planned shooting,"" Mr Stodola told reporters. He said that all of the 28 people injured in the incident were expected to survive. Little Rock police chief Kenton Buckner said the authorities were investigating whether a longstanding rivalry between gangs was to blame.

"This video can not be played Gove's quick-fire answers on the Andrew Marr show - Brexit and his return to the cabinet The government should listen to review bodies' recommendations for public sector pay, Michael Gove has said. His comments come as the prime minister and chancellor face increasing pressure from ministers and backbenchers to end the 1% public sector pay cap. The environment secretary did not call directly for the cap to be lifted but said ministers should respect the ""integrity"" of the pay review process. Labour said it would allow the review bodies to award ""a fair pay rise"". Pay rises for five million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% since 2013, before which there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. The Conservatives went into the election pledging to maintain the cap until 2020, but some MPs are now calling for a rethink after the party lost its majority. Two review bodies dealing with the pay of police and teachers will make recommendations later this month, and there are growing expectations that one or both could call for rises that exceed the government's cap. The cabinet is split on the principle of scrapping the cap, but it could be dismantled bit by bit. ""I think that we should listen to the pay review bodies who govern each individual area of public sector pay,"" Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The presenter suggested the cap, imposed by the chancellor, set the parameters for the bodies' recommendations. ""They take account of that but they also take account of other questions as well, including the number of people who enter the profession, whether we need to have an increase in pay in order to ensure we get the very best people into the profession,"" Mr Gove said. ""These pay review bodies have been set up in order to ensure that we can have authoritative advice on what's required, in order to ensure that the public services on which we rely are effectively staffed and the people within them are effectively supported."" Deciphering the public sector pay hints Public sector pay cap 'under review' Thousands join anti-government protest Asked what he personally thought about scrapping the pay cap, he said: ""I am not an individual - I am a member of a collective team."" Mr Gove, a former education secretary, has told theSunday Times,externalthat when the review bodies made recommendations on school teachers' pay, ""I think I always accepted them."" ByBBC political correspondent Iain Watson Privately, ministers believe it is perfectly possible that at least some of the pay review bodies - which also cover health service workers, prison officers and senior public servants - will call for average increases of more than 1%. A government minister with good links to Downing Street told the BBC that review body recommendations would be honoured, even if this breached the current pay cap. But No 10 insists that ministers will decide whether to accept recommendations on a case-by-case basis. So while the pay cap may not be abolished for every public sector employee all at once, it is possible that its erosion will begin soon. Other Sunday newspapers also reported on a growing revolt within the Conservative Party over its approach to austerity and public spending. The Observer says there is a""chorus of demands"",externalfrom within the party for a radical overhaul of state funding, with cabinet ministers and senior MPs calling for more money for NHS workers and schools, as well as a ""national debate"" on tuition fees. According to the paper, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Education Secretary Justine Greening are lobbying for an easing of austerity. The paper says the pressure to abandon austerity puts Chancellor Philip Hammond under pressure to consider raising taxes to fund any extra public spending. The Telegraph,external, meanwhile, reports that Ms Greening has told Prime Minister Theresa May she wants the government to abandon plans to cut per pupil funding over the coming years. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said the Tories were in ""turmoil"" The paper says it is understood the education secretary wants a public statement within weeks outlining the change in direction so that schools know the funding they are to receive before they break up for the summer holidays. According to the paper, the proposal would mean spending an extra Â£1.2bn by 2022. Mr Gove said he would not ""second guess"" the current education secretary but Tory backbencher Heidi Allen, also appearing on Andrew Marr,  said it was ""great to see Justine coming out and saying: 'Yes, there needs to be more money for schools.'"" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the reports revealed ""turmoil"" in the Conservative Party. ""They're saying 'Wait for the pay review bodies,' even though they're the ones insisting on a 1% cap,"" the Labour frontbencher told Andrew Marr. ""We're saying to the pay review bodies: 'Get rid of the 1% cap and give a fair pay rise.'"" Thousands demonstrated against austerity in central London on Saturday Asked what level Labour thought was fair, he said the review bodies ""should consider"" a pay rise in line with the rise in average earnings across the economy. ""Clearly, they are not going to be able to overturn the 14% loss that NHS workers have had over seven years but they have to come up with responsible recommendations, which we would accept."" Mr Ashworth suggested that some of the cost of the pay awards in the NHS could be offset by savings in the amount the health service paid to agency workers, due to a shortage of full-time staff. Last week a Labour attempt to scrap the 1% cap was defeated in Parliament. But the pressure to ease austerity has intensified since June's general election, with a number of backbench Tory MPs arguing that it cost the party votes and contributed to the loss of its majority. On Saturdaythousands of people gathered in central Londonfor a demonstration against austerity that was addressed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

"This video can not be played Gove's quick-fire answers on the Andrew Marr show - Brexit and his return to the cabinet The government should listen to review bodies' recommendations for public sector pay, Michael Gove has said. His comments come as the prime minister and chancellor face increasing pressure from ministers and backbenchers to end the 1% public sector pay cap. The environment secretary did not call directly for the cap to be lifted but said ministers should respect the ""integrity"" of the pay review process. Labour said it would allow the review bodies to award ""a fair pay rise"". Pay rises for five million public sector workers are set by independent pay review bodies, but have effectively been capped at 1% since 2013, before which there was a two-year freeze on pay for all but the lowest-paid workers. The Conservatives went into the election pledging to maintain the cap until 2020, but some MPs are now calling for a rethink after the party lost its majority. Two review bodies dealing with the pay of police and teachers will make recommendations later this month, and there are growing expectations that one or both could call for rises that exceed the government's cap. The cabinet is split on the principle of scrapping the cap, but it could be dismantled bit by bit. ""I think that we should listen to the pay review bodies who govern each individual area of public sector pay,"" Mr Gove told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The presenter suggested the cap, imposed by the chancellor, set the parameters for the bodies' recommendations. ""They take account of that but they also take account of other questions as well, including the number of people who enter the profession, whether we need to have an increase in pay in order to ensure we get the very best people into the profession,"" Mr Gove said. ""These pay review bodies have been set up in order to ensure that we can have authoritative advice on what's required, in order to ensure that the public services on which we rely are effectively staffed and the people within them are effectively supported."" Deciphering the public sector pay hints Public sector pay cap 'under review' Thousands join anti-government protest Asked what he personally thought about scrapping the pay cap, he said: ""I am not an individual - I am a member of a collective team."" Mr Gove, a former education secretary, has told theSunday Times,externalthat when the review bodies made recommendations on school teachers' pay, ""I think I always accepted them."" ByBBC political correspondent Iain Watson Privately, ministers believe it is perfectly possible that at least some of the pay review bodies - which also cover health service workers, prison officers and senior public servants - will call for average increases of more than 1%. A government minister with good links to Downing Street told the BBC that review body recommendations would be honoured, even if this breached the current pay cap. But No 10 insists that ministers will decide whether to accept recommendations on a case-by-case basis. So while the pay cap may not be abolished for every public sector employee all at once, it is possible that its erosion will begin soon. Other Sunday newspapers also reported on a growing revolt within the Conservative Party over its approach to austerity and public spending. The Observer says there is a""chorus of demands"",externalfrom within the party for a radical overhaul of state funding, with cabinet ministers and senior MPs calling for more money for NHS workers and schools, as well as a ""national debate"" on tuition fees. According to the paper, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Education Secretary Justine Greening are lobbying for an easing of austerity. The paper says the pressure to abandon austerity puts Chancellor Philip Hammond under pressure to consider raising taxes to fund any extra public spending. The Telegraph,external, meanwhile, reports that Ms Greening has told Prime Minister Theresa May she wants the government to abandon plans to cut per pupil funding over the coming years. Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said the Tories were in ""turmoil"" The paper says it is understood the education secretary wants a public statement within weeks outlining the change in direction so that schools know the funding they are to receive before they break up for the summer holidays. According to the paper, the proposal would mean spending an extra Â£1.2bn by 2022. Mr Gove said he would not ""second guess"" the current education secretary but Tory backbencher Heidi Allen, also appearing on Andrew Marr,  said it was ""great to see Justine coming out and saying: 'Yes, there needs to be more money for schools.'"" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the reports revealed ""turmoil"" in the Conservative Party. ""They're saying 'Wait for the pay review bodies,' even though they're the ones insisting on a 1% cap,"" the Labour frontbencher told Andrew Marr. ""We're saying to the pay review bodies: 'Get rid of the 1% cap and give a fair pay rise.'"" Thousands demonstrated against austerity in central London on Saturday Asked what level Labour thought was fair, he said the review bodies ""should consider"" a pay rise in line with the rise in average earnings across the economy. ""Clearly, they are not going to be able to overturn the 14% loss that NHS workers have had over seven years but they have to come up with responsible recommendations, which we would accept."" Mr Ashworth suggested that some of the cost of the pay awards in the NHS could be offset by savings in the amount the health service paid to agency workers, due to a shortage of full-time staff. Last week a Labour attempt to scrap the 1% cap was defeated in Parliament. But the pressure to ease austerity has intensified since June's general election, with a number of backbench Tory MPs arguing that it cost the party votes and contributed to the loss of its majority. On Saturdaythousands of people gathered in central Londonfor a demonstration against austerity that was addressed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.

"Police images showed Luiz Carlos da Rocha changing appearance Brazilian police have captured a notorious drug kingpin who used plastic surgery to evade capture for almost 30 years, authorities say. Luiz Carlos da Rocha - nicknamed ""White Head"" - is believed to be the leader of a massive cocaine empire in South America. Federal police said sentences handed down to Rocha amount to more than 50 years of prison time. Police said he was ""a criminal who lived discreetly and in the shadows"". Rocha was arrested in Sorriso, in the western state of Mato Grosso, on Saturday, a police statement said. The drug kingpin had been living in the city under the assumed name Vitor Luiz de Moraes. Agents compared old known photos of Rocha to the images of the new suspect, ""and concluded that Luiz Carlos da Rocha and Vitor Luiz are the same person"". Suitcases full of cash, a gun and other objects belonging to Rocha were found Brazilian police said his organisation was known to be violent, making use of armed escorts, armoured cars, and heavy weapons. It produced cocaine in Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, before shipping it through an elaborate logistics system to Europe and the United States. Luiz Carlos da Rocha is also accused of being one of the main providers of cocaine to criminal organisations within Brazil, in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. In total, police estimate his empire produced some five tonnes of cocaine each month. Operation Spectrum - the name given to the sting - also seized some $10m (Â£7.6m) worth of criminal assets, including farms, other real estate, luxury vehicles and aircraft. Officers believe Rocha's wealth is closer to $100m, and say they will seek to seize the rest of his assets in the second phase of the operation.

"This video can not be played Syrian state TV released footage of the aftermath of the Tahrir square blast A suicide bomber has launched an attack in the Syrian capital, with reports saying at least 19 people were killed. Syrian police had been chasing three suspected car bombers that were trying to enter the capital, state TV said. Police stopped and detonated two of the vehicles, but the third driver entered Tahrir square in the east and blew himself up after being surrounded. Syria is in the midst of a six-year-long civil war, with Damascus still mostly under government control. At least 12 people were injured in Sunday's blast, reports said. State TV said the attackers had planned to bomb crowded areas in the capital on the first working day after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ""The terrorist bombings killed and wounded several civilians and caused physical damage to the area,"" a police official told state news agency Sana. Why is there a war in Syria? Refugee camp destroyed in fire A local resident told AFP he heard ""gunfire at around 06:00 (03:00 GMT), then an explosion which smashed the glass of houses in the neighbourhood"". An AFP correspondent at the scene saw extensive damage to nearby buildings and two bombed cars at one side of the square. Syria's foreign ministry sent a letter to the UN saying up to 20 people were killed and dozens of women and children were among the wounded, Reuters reports. Police said the attackers had intended to target busy areas in the capital No group has said it carried out the attack. More than 300,000 people have lost their lives in the Syrian war, which began with anti-government protests in 2011. The UN's refugee agency says that since the conflict began about 5.5 million people have left the country, and another 6.3 million have been left internally displaced. Nearly 500,000 Syria refugees return home Six decisive points that changed Syria's war Damascus has remained mostly under the control of President Bashar al-Assad, and avoided much of the fighting. However, the capital has experienced a number of suicide bomb attacks. In March, two bomb attacks in the capital killed more than 40 people - the majority of them Iraqi pilgrims visiting the Bab al-Saghir cemetery, which houses Shia mausoleums. A jihadist group affiliated with al-Qaeda claimed that attack. A few days later,an attack on the capital's main court complexkilled at least 31 people. That attack was claimed by the Islamic State militant group (IS). Such attacks may become more common as IS loses its territory and resorts to its tactic of striking soft targets in cities to sow instability, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher reports.

"Gerhard Ludwig MÃ¼ller will not have his mandate renewed Pope Francis has decided to replace a conservative cardinal who openly questioned the pontiff's attempts to create a more inclusive church. Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig MÃ¼ller will not have his five-year mandate as Catholicism's chief theologian renewed.

"Moscow said that cyber-attack allegations from Ukraine's security services were ""unfounded"" Ukraine says it has proof that Russian security services were involved in the cyber-attack that targeted businesses around the world earlier this week. The country's security service, the SBU, said it had obtained data that points to a link with an attack on the nation's capital, Kiev, in December. Ukrainian firms were among the first to report issues with malicious software on Tuesday, before the virus spread. Moscow denied any involvement, adding that the allegations were ""unfounded"". The virus, which disrupted IT systems across the globe, froze computers and demanded a ransom be paid in the digital currency Bitcoin, which is untraceable. However, the attack also hit major Russian firms, leading some cyber security researchers to suggest that Moscow was not behind it. But on Saturday, Ukraine's SBU said in a statement that - through data obtained from international anti-virus companies - it had established a connection with a previous attack involving the so-called Petya virus, which it alleges was not designed to secure ransom payments. The malware hall of fame How can businesses be protected? The SBU later said the ransom demand was a cover, adding that the attack was aimed at disrupting the operations of state and private companies in Ukraine and causing political destabilisation. The lack of any real mechanism for securing financial payments, the SBU said, led the agency to this assumption. Ukraine appears to have been particularly badly hit in the recent attacks. The police received about 1,000 messages on intrusions in the operations of computer networks over a 24-hour period. A total of 150 companies filed official complaints with the police. In December, the country's financial, transport and energy systems were targeted by what investigators judged to be a cyber-attack. The incident resulted in apower cut in Kiev. The attack earlier this week comes two months after another global ransomware assault,known as WannaCry, which caused major problems for the UK's National Health Service.

"About 650 migrants were rescued and brought to the Italian port of Catania on Saturday Germany, France and Italy's interior ministers are to meet for crisis talks as Italy warns the influx of migrants into the country is unsustainable. Italy has threatened to close its ports and impound rescue ships run by aid agencies carrying people from Libya. It needs more support as people cross the Mediterranean from Africa in large numbers, the UN's refugee agency said. More than 500,000 migrants have passed through Italian ports since 2014, and numbers are on the rise again. Italy is the main destination for migrants attempting to reach Europe by sea, due to its proximity to Libya. According to the UN, 83,650 people have reached Italy by sea since the beginning of the year - a 20% increase on the same period in 2016. Syrian Journey: Choose your own escape route Refugee camp destroyed in fire Numbers have been rising steeply, with about 12,600 migrants and refugees arriving last weekend alone. Most migrants make the journey across the Mediterranean in rickety boats, and the UN estimates that 2,030 migrants have died or gone missing since the start of the year. Libya is a gateway to Europe for migrants from across sub-Saharan Africa as well as the Arabian peninsula, Egypt, Syria and Bangladesh. Many are fleeing war, poverty or persecution. The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, said that among the arrivals in Italy there was an alarmingly high rate of unaccompanied children or victims of sexual or gender-based violence. The Italian coastguard takes the lead in co-ordinating rescue operations but many of the vessels run by non-profit groups sail under the flags of other nations, including EU countries like Germany and Malta. On Wednesday, Italy threatened to stop vessels from other countries from bringing migrants to its ports. Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni has accused other European nations of ""looking the other way"". Speaking on Sunday, Interior Minister Marco Minniti said: ""If the only ports refugees are taken to are Italian, something is not working."" ""We are under enormous pressure,"" he added. This video can not be played This video from May shows the coastguard rescuing a migrant clinging to a ship's rudder It is not clear if blocking rescue ships would be legal. The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea dictates that any ship learning of distress at sea must assist regardless of circumstances, and that the country responsible for operations in that area has primary responsibility for taking them from the ship. Pope: Migrant centres are 'concentration camps' Under a solidarity plan agreed in 2015, EU countries were meant to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers between them, to help relieve pressure on Italy and Greece. The UK and Ireland were exempt from the plan, while Romania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary voted against accepting mandatory quotas. So far, only about 20,900 of the 160,000 refugees have been relocated. Life on board the rescue boats The Czech Republic has accepted only 12 of the 2,000 it had been designated, while Hungary and Poland have taken in none. The EU hasbegun legal actionagainst the three countries for ignoring ""repeated calls"" to take their share. Some EU countries have taken large numbers of migrants separately, including Germany, which had an influx of more than 800,000 migrants in 2015. Most of them were refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, who arrived in Germany by land via theBalkan migration route. ""What is happening in front of our eyes in Italy is an unfolding tragedy,"" the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said. ""This cannot be an Italian problem alone,"" he added. On Thursday, the EU's migration commissioner, Dimitris Avramopoulos, promised more financial support for Italy, and urged member states to demonstrate greater solidarity. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
