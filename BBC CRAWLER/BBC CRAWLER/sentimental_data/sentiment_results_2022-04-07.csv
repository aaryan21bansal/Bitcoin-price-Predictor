"This video can not be played Debunking Russian claims about Bucha killings Russian troops were heard discussing killing civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, in messages intercepted by German intelligence, German media say. Der Spiegel magazine says some of the radio traffic tracked by the BND intelligence agency appears to match locations of bodies just outside Kyiv. The BND has so far made no public comments on the issue. Ukraine says more than 300 civilians were killed by the Russians in Bucha - Moscow denies any involvement. Recent images of Bucha streets strewn with bodies have shocked the international community. Some of the victims appeared to have been shot in the back of the head after their hands were tied. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of genocide, an accusation flatly rejected by Moscow. Warning: This piece contains graphic images which some may find upsetting. Bucha was seized by Russian troops soon after President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. After more than a month, the Russians eventually withdrew from Bucha, and Ukrainian forces soon entered the town. Workers have been removing civilians' bodies found on the streets of Bucha into body bags The BND's intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday, Der Spiegel reported on Thursday. In one intercepted radio message, the magazine said, Russian soldiers appeared to be talking about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talked about shooting someone on a bike, which appeared to match a notorious photo showing a dead cyclist in Bucha. According to Spiegel, the intercepts also appeared to indicate that mercenaries from Russia's private Wagner group played a key role in the Bucha killings. An unnamed security source told Reuters news agency: ""It's true that the [German] federal government has indications of Russian perpetration in Bucha"". ""However, these findings on Bucha refer to satellite images. The radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" Russia says its forces withdrew from Bucha on 30 March. The Ukrainians say this happened in the early hours of 31 March. On 1 April, footage was postedfilmed from a car,externaldriving through the town which showed bodies on either side of a road. Russia has claimed, without providing evidence, that the footage shows ""fake dead bodies"" and it was ""staged"" after its troops had left the town. However, a satellite image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, directly contradicted the Russian claim. The photo by the Maxar technology company shows objects that appear to be bodies in the exact locations where they were subsequently found by Ukrainian forces when they regained control of the town north of Kyiv.

"Justin Trudeau has promised to address Canada's soaring home prices Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has proposed a two-year ban on some foreigners buying homes. The measure comes as the country grapples with some of the worst housing affordability issues in the world. Prices have jumped more than 20%, pushing the average home in Canada to nearly C$817,000 ($650,000; Â£495,000) -  more than nine times household income. But industry analysts say it's not clear a ban on foreign buyers will address the problem. Data on purchases by foreign buyers in Canada is limited, but research suggests they amount for a small fraction of the market. ""I don't thinkÂ it's going to have a hugeÂ impact,"" said Ben Myers, president of advisory firm Bullpenn Research & Consulting in Toronto, who found foreigners accounted for just 1% of purchases in 2020, down from 9% in 2015 and 2016. ""It's a fairly low number and let's face it, the people that really want to buy ... are going to find alternative ways to do it."" Mr Myers said the soaring housing costs reflect strong population growth and a shortage of supply, due in part to rules that restrict development. The issues have worsened since the pandemic hit in 2020, when policymakers in Canada and elsewhere slashed interest rates to stabilise the economy, lowering borrowing costs and boosting demand even further. The moves have fuelled the soaring housing prices seen in many markets around the world, but in Canada the disconnect between home prices and incomes is one of the most dramatic, according to OECD data. Mr Trudeau pledged to tackle housing affordability during his campaign for election last year. In addition to the temporary ban on foreign buyers, the budget proposal his government unveiled on Thursday sets aside billions to spur new construction and proposes new programmes, such as a tax-free savings account for first-time buyers. This video can not be played Why it takes 30 years to buy a house in Canada Mr Trudeau has also discussed banning certain bidding processes that favour investors, who by some measures have accounted for about one in five homes purchased in Canada since 2014. The proposed ban on foreign buyers would exempt permanent residents and foreign students and workers, as well as those buying their primary residence. The proposal builds on actions such as special taxes that some parts of Canada have already taken against out-of-town and foreign buyers. House prices see record cash rise, says Nationwide Australia house prices soar at 'unsustainable' rate In Ontario, for example, provincial Premier Doug Ford recently announced plans to raise an existing tax on foreign buyers from 15% to 20% and expand it beyond Toronto to the entire province. While foreign purchases are not the driver of the affordability issues, taxing them at least captures revenue that can be re-deployed to address such problems, said Steve Pomeroy, head of Focus Consulting, a housing policy firm. ""If you ban them, you don't really have much of an impact on suppressing rising home prices and you give up the revenue,"" he said. New Zealand introduced a similar measure banning foreign buyers in 2018. ""It's good politics because it's easy to blame a victim that nobody cares about,"" Mr Pomeroy added. ""I don't think it will have much of an impact."" Paul Kershaw, professor at the University of British Columbia and founder of Generation Squeeze, also said he saw little in  Mr Trudeau's proposal likely to slow price increases or significantly address affordability. ""It's not clear the housing measures will be sufficient to break Canada's addiction to high and rising home prices,"" he said, noting that for existing homeowners, the high prices help amass wealth. Mr Pomeroy said he does expect price appreciation to slow in coming months, as the central bank raises interest rates. The Canadian housing market is particularly susceptible to such moves, since many buyers rely on five-year mortgages rather than the long-term ones common in the US and UK. But higher interest rates will only make it less affordable for prospective buyers trying to break into the market, he warned. Mr Myers said over the long-term, he expects hot markets such as Toronto and Vancouver to become dominated by renters, as regular buyers get priced out of the market, unless politicians address supply. But Mr Pomeroy said high development costs means that adding supply will not necessarily reduce prices, unless the additions are dramatic. ""Unless you've got born into the right family ... the prospects for young buyers are quite dim,"" he said.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife pays Â£30,000 a year to maintain her non-dom status, her spokeswoman has confirmed. Akshata Murty isreported to have received Â£11.6m,externalin dividends in the past year from Indian firm Infosys. But her non-dom status means she is not liable for UK tax on income earned abroad. She does not have to pay UK tax on dividends - currently a rate of 39.35%. The Â£30,000 fee is chargeable if a person has lived in the UK forat least seven of the previous nine years.,external Under government rules, people can be granted non-dom status - meaning the UK is not considered their permanent home - if they live in the UK but intend to go back to their home country. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak faced ""very serious questions to answer"" about his family's finances, adding: ""If it now transpires that his wife has used schemes to reduce her tax, while he's been increasing taxes on working people, that's breathtaking hypocrisy."" The Liberal Dems have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". Firm part-owned by Sunak's wife closing Russia office I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak National Insurance rise starts to hit pay packets Ms Murty is an Indian citizen and has retained family ties there, and the BBC understands she has said she would eventually like to return there. She owns a 0.9% stake in the software firm Infosys - founded by her billionaire father - estimated to be worth more than Â£500m. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng defended Mr Sunak, saying it was ""completely unfair"" to scrutinise the tax affairs of Ms Murty, ""who is not a politician"" and rejecting opposition claims that she was sheltering from UK taxes. And 10 Downing Street has dismissed reports that it is behind a series of politically damaging leaks against the chancellor as ""baseless"" and ""categorically untrue."" A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on a tax return that they intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in his company. Ms Murty married Mr Sunak in 2009. The fee for non-dom status rises to Â£60,000 a year when a person has been in the UK for at least 12 of the previous 14 years. And anyone living in the UK for 15 years automatically loses the status. Ms Murty has declined to say when her non-dom status began. ""India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously,"" Ms Murty's spokeswoman said. ""So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. ""She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income."" But tax experts have questioned Ms Murty's statement, suggesting UK non-dom status is a ""choice"" and something people can give up. Asked if Ms Murty paid tax on her Infosys dividend payments in India, her representative said ""international tax"" was paid on her ""international income"". It is not clear, however, whether she pays tax on her dividend income in India or another jurisdiction. The Indian government says dividend income is taxable at the rate of 20% for non-residents, unless they qualify for any deductions. But the dividend rate can come down to 10% for people who are eligible to benefit from the UK's tax treaty with India. In a letter to Mr Sunak, Labour asked if his wife paid all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands. The chancellor made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's tax status as part of his declaration of interests when he first became a government minister in 2018. In an interview with the Sun newspaper, Mr Sunak said Ms Murty ""followed the letter of the law"" over taxes. ""To smear my wife to get at me is awful,"" he added, saying: ""And if she was living here and didn't just happen to be married to me, this obviously would not be at all relevant.""

"Returnal's astronaut Selene must fight for survival on an ever-changing planet Sci-fi horror game Returnal was the big winner at this year's Bafta Games Awards, scooping four prizes. They included the top honour - best game - for the Playstation 5 shooter. ""It feels wonderful of course and we're so proud for the team that made it,"" Housemarque studio head Ilari Kuittinen told BBC News. Jane Perry won best leading performer for playing Returnal's Selene, an astronaut who gets stuck in a time loop after crash landing on an alien planet. In her acceptance speech at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, the actress thanked Bafta for ""recognising the artistry and the incredible talent in the games industry"". She also thanked the game's makers for ""bringing to life - and several deaths - the person who became Selene"". Perry continued: ""Performers dream of having a role like that to sink our teeth into. She is a middle-aged woman, she's a single mom and she is courageous and strong. And despite her considerable loss and trauma, she never gives up. ""She hopes for a better future and I think given the very serious state of the world right now that we can all take inspiration from Selene."" Tim Dawson and Wren Brier won two Baftas for Unpacking Other winners at Thursday's ceremony included It Takes Two, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Unpacking, which won two Baftas each. Unpacking, a puzzle game in which a woman's life unfolds as the player unboxes her possessions over a series of house moves, was conceived when Wren Brier and partner and co-creator Tim Dawson moved in together. ""It's incredible to have our little weird game recognised,"" Brier said when accepting the narrative award. ""We're not telling a complicated story in Unpacking but the way we tell it is different, and it's nice to see that that's appreciated and resonates with people."" The Brisbane-based couple were more shocked when it was named winner of the EE game of the year, the only category voted for by the public. ""Wow. We really, really didn't expect this one. Like, there was no chance,"" Brier said. This is the 18th year that Bafta has honoured the best of the gaming world. It Takes Two creators Josef Fares (left) and Oskar Wolontis also won two Baftas Gaming boomed in popularity during the pandemic. Last week,it was revealedthat Brits spent a record Â£7.16bn on games, hardware and accessories in 2021 - up 32% compared with 2019. Thursday was the first time the industry had got together in person for the Bafta Games Awards since 2019. The past two ceremonies have been staged virtually because of Covid. And many of this year's winners had worked on their creations during lockdown. The award for best British game went to racing title Forza Horizon 5, set in Mexico but made in Leamington Spa by Playground Games. Studio head Trevor Williams said: ""I'm really honoured and proud. It wasn't the easiest game to finish, I'll be honest. ""We shipped it in the middle of the pandemic and it was just truly inspiring working with a team that not only tried to ship the game but at every turn tried to ship the best game that they could. You truly are masters of your craft."" Accepting It Takes Two's trophy for best original property, Hazelight Studios' Swedish founder Josef Fares said: ""This is a surprise. We're super happy and proud."" When he returned to the stage to pick up the multiplayer prize, Fares joked: ""This one was expected, actually.""

"The Met Police accept 15 recommendations made by the Independent Office for Police Conduct The Met Police has vowed to ""root out people who do not belong in the force"" following an investigation into harassment and racism in a police unit. The policewatchdog discovered""disgraceful"" misogyny, discrimination and sexual harassment in a police unit based at Charing Cross police station. Following the investigation, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) made 15 recommendations. The force has accepted all of the recommendations. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid said the proposals will ""drive forward lasting change"". Mr Javid said: ""Like so many people I was disgusted to see officers involved in sharing deeply offensive and discriminatory messages. Their behaviour was unacceptable. ""We are determined to root out people who don't share our values and don't belong in the Met. ""As we do this, unfortunately, we will continue to see more cases where officers and staff fail to uphold our expectations of them."" Bas Javid said while the IOPC had recognised steps had already been taken to improve culture and standards, ""it's clear we still have a large amount of work to do"" Officers were found to have joked about rape and exchanged offensive social media messages. Most officers investigated were police constables and based at the Charing Cross station, the IOPC said. The inquiry was launched in March 2018 into nine linked independent investigations concerning serving police officers from the Met. Investigations began after an officer allegedly had sex with a vulnerable woman in a room inside a London police station, the IOPC said - although this allegation was never proven. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid said he ""felt ashamed and disappointed"" by the actions of officers based at the Charing Cross station The force said it would commit to zero-tolerance on racism, misogyny, bullying and harassment. In line with the recommendations, the force made a public commitment to being an anti-racist organisation. Otherrecommendations,externalincluded making sure future investigations into bullying and harassment were ""suitably independent"". IOPC regional director Sal Naseem said: ""We welcome the Met's full acceptance of our recommendations and the programme of work it has announced to create a better working environment and improve the service for the communities it serves in London."" Of the 14 officers investigated, two were dismissed for gross misconduct and put on the barred list, preventing future employment with the police. Another two resigned and several others faced disciplinary action, the IOPC said. Nine are still serving with the force, while another is working as a contractor in a staff role.

"The PM has defended the government's new energy strategy, following criticism it does little to help people struggling with soaring bills. Boris Johnson said it was a ""long-term plan"" focused on energy supply and the government had already introduced other policies to tackle rising energy costs. The strategy, which aims to increase UK energy independence, includes plans to boost nuclear, wind and hydrogen power. But Labour said it was ""too little, too late"" to help with rising costs. And experts called for a bigger focus on energy efficiency and insulation to help bring bills down. Consumers are facing huge increases in energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed gas prices even higher. Speaking at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, Mr Johnson said the strategy was about ""tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future"". Citing policies including a Â£6bn energy efficiency fund and support for heat pumps, he said the government was ""already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more"". Will the UK's energy strategy work? How much nuclear power does the UK use? Under the government's new plans,external, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030. There is a big focus on offshore wind, with a new target of producing up to 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy from this source by 2030. Officials said this would be more than enough to power every home in the UK. The strategy says the government wants to ""lead the world once again"" in nuclear power, reversing what it describes as ""decades of underinvestment"". A new body called Great British Nuclear will be launched to bolster the UK's nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 24 GW of electricity will come from that source - 25% of the projected electricity demand. The government hopes to deliver up to eight new reactors, built on existing sites, with a new reactor approved each year until 2030. Nuclear- The government plans to reduce the UK's reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors, including two at Sizewell in Suffolk. A new body will oversee the delivery of the new plants. Wind- The government aims to reform planning laws to speed up approvals for new offshore wind farms. For onshore wind farms it wants to develop partnerships with ""supportive communities"" who want to host turbines in exchange for guaranteed cheaper energy bills. Hydrogen- Targets for hydrogen production are being doubled to help provide cleaner energy for industry as well as for power, transport and potentially heating. Solar- The government will consider reforming rules for installing solar panels on homes and commercial buildings to help increase the current solar capacity by up to five times by 2035. Oil and gas- A new licensing round for North Sea projects is being launched in the summer on the basis that producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than doing so abroad. Heat pumps- There will be a Â£30m ""heat pump investment accelerator competition"" to make British heat pumps which reduce demand for gas. Read more about what the strategy says here. For onshore wind, the strategy commits to consulting on developing partnerships with ""a limited number of supportive communities"" who want to host wind turbines in exchange for guaranteed lower energy bills. However, the strategy says there will be no ""wholesale changes"" to current planning regulations for onshore wind. Although it is one of the cheapest forms of energy, new onshore wind projects have been declining since 2015 when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning rules in response to some complaints that wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy. Defending the decision not to prioritise onshore wind, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK already had about 30GW of onshore wind capacity. He added that new sites ""will have a very high bar to clear"". Environmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with disbelief and anger at some of the measures in the strategy. They cannot believe the government has offered no new policies on saving energy by insulating buildings. They say energy efficiency would immediately lower bills and emissions, and is the cheapest way to improve energy security. A Downing Street source said the strategy was now being seen as an energysupplystrategy. Campaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea, even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate. There is a strong welcome, though, for the promise of more energy from wind offshore with speedier planning consent. The same boost has not been offered to onshore wind. The decision to boost nuclear has drawn a mixed reaction. Some environmentalists say it's too dear and too dangerous. They ridicule the idea from some politicians that every city could have its own mini reactor. But other climate campaigners believe nuclear must be part of the energy mix. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the measures announced were not enough to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. ""All we've got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn't even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save Â£400 on everybody's bill,"" he said. The former boss of energy regulator Ofgem, Dermot Nolan, said: ""Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels.""

The destruction to the town of Borodyanka is ""much more horrific"" than what has already been uncovered in nearby Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has said in his newest Facebook address to the nation late on Thursday. ""They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodyanka,"" Zelensky said in his remarks from Kyiv. ""It's much more horrific there. There are even more victims of Russian occupiers."" Both towns are suburbs of Kyiv and saw fierce fighting in the battle for the capital. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Destruction in the Ukrainian town of Borodyanka A building bombed by the Russian army in Borodyanka. Twenty-six bodies have been recovered from underneath the rubble of two destroyed apartment buildingsin Borodyanka, north west of Kyiv, according to Ukraine's prosecutor general. Iryna Venediktova accused Moscow of deliberately targeting civilian areas, in a post on Facebook. ""There is no military site here,"" she said, adding that Russian forces ""shelled residential infrastructure in the evenings, when there was a maximum amount of people home"". Venediktova claimed there was ""evidence of the Russian forces' war crimes at every turn"". Russia's Nobel Peace Prize winning journalist Dmitry Muratov says he has been attacked with red paint laced with the solvent acetone on a train in Russia.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"". Russia has previously said that 1,351 soldiers have been killed. The full death toll is not known, but a Nato official has been quoted in the US media as saying between 7,000 and 15,000, and there are similar US estimates. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been speaking
to reporters after todayâs meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Belgium. âThere is a greater determination than ever to stand with
Ukraine,â he said, and to inflict âeven greater costsâ on Russia for its
invasion. He also said for every Bucha - a city in which Russia has been accused of committing war crimes - there were likely to be more places in which atrocities were happening. Blinken also welcomed the earlier vote to suspend Russia
from the UN Human Rights Council, saying: âToday, a wrong was righted.â Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the news that Russia has been suspended from the UN's Human Rights Council. Kulebasaid,external: ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history."" More now on that vote moments ago to suspend Russia from the UNâs
Human Rights Council during a session in New York. Ninety-three countries voted
in favour of the move, 24 against, and there were 58 abstentions. Among the countries who supported the suspension were the
US, EU nations, the UK, and of course Ukraine itself. China, Syria, and Belarus were among those who voted against the motion. And India, Egypt, and South Africa were among the nations
which abstained. You can see the full list here,external.  The General Assembly of the United Nations has just voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council during a session in New York. It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraineâs ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of âhorrificâ abuses â raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russiaâs own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba speaking at the Nato meeting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberghas statedthat allies are âready to do moreâ to provide military equipment and support to Ukraine. But Ukraineâs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at a press conference earlier at Nato HQ in Brussels, said that help was needed in âdays not weeksâ if it was to avoid coming too late. Articulating the severity of the situation, Kuleba compared the unfolding fighting in the Donbas region to the Second World War. â[It] will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations... the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.â He said this would ânot be a local operationâ based on current observations of Russian preparations. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours - and the outcome of this battle will be decided on the battlefield,"" he added. The Donbas is Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. The term refers to two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian-backed separatists declared ""republics"" in parts of the regions in 2014 and Russian forces have captured more territory since Vladimir Putin's invasion began in late February. Russian forces executed civilians in various locations in the Kyiv region, according to new testimonypublished by Amnesty International.,external The human rights organisation interviewed more than 20 people from towns and villages near the capital, some were witnesses to, or had direct knowledge of, the violence committed, it says. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" says Amnesty International Secretary General AgnÃ¨s Callamard. ""Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" In one account given, a woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty two Russian soldiers entered her house on 9 March, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. With Russian forces retreating from the north of Ukraine, disturbing
stories of life under occupation have been emerging. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen has
been told of Russian troops using villagers as human shields against Ukrainian
counter-attacks. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces have committed
atrocities, and sought to point the finger of blame elsewhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999993
"The PM has defended the government's new energy strategy, following criticism it does little to help people struggling with soaring bills. Boris Johnson said it was a ""long-term plan"" focused on energy supply and the government had already introduced other policies to tackle rising energy costs. The strategy, which aims to increase UK energy independence, includes plans to boost nuclear, wind and hydrogen power. But Labour said it was ""too little, too late"" to help with rising costs. And experts called for a bigger focus on energy efficiency and insulation to help bring bills down. Consumers are facing huge increases in energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed gas prices even higher. Speaking at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, Mr Johnson said the strategy was about ""tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future"". Citing policies including a Â£6bn energy efficiency fund and support for heat pumps, he said the government was ""already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more"". Will the UK's energy strategy work? How much nuclear power does the UK use? Under the government's new plans,external, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030. There is a big focus on offshore wind, with a new target of producing up to 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy from this source by 2030. Officials said this would be more than enough to power every home in the UK. The strategy says the government wants to ""lead the world once again"" in nuclear power, reversing what it describes as ""decades of underinvestment"". A new body called Great British Nuclear will be launched to bolster the UK's nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 24 GW of electricity will come from that source - 25% of the projected electricity demand. The government hopes to deliver up to eight new reactors, built on existing sites, with a new reactor approved each year until 2030. Nuclear- The government plans to reduce the UK's reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors, including two at Sizewell in Suffolk. A new body will oversee the delivery of the new plants. Wind- The government aims to reform planning laws to speed up approvals for new offshore wind farms. For onshore wind farms it wants to develop partnerships with ""supportive communities"" who want to host turbines in exchange for guaranteed cheaper energy bills. Hydrogen- Targets for hydrogen production are being doubled to help provide cleaner energy for industry as well as for power, transport and potentially heating. Solar- The government will consider reforming rules for installing solar panels on homes and commercial buildings to help increase the current solar capacity by up to five times by 2035. Oil and gas- A new licensing round for North Sea projects is being launched in the summer on the basis that producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than doing so abroad. Heat pumps- There will be a Â£30m ""heat pump investment accelerator competition"" to make British heat pumps which reduce demand for gas. Read more about what the strategy says here. For onshore wind, the strategy commits to consulting on developing partnerships with ""a limited number of supportive communities"" who want to host wind turbines in exchange for guaranteed lower energy bills. However, the strategy says there will be no ""wholesale changes"" to current planning regulations for onshore wind. Although it is one of the cheapest forms of energy, new onshore wind projects have been declining since 2015 when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning rules in response to some complaints that wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy. Defending the decision not to prioritise onshore wind, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK already had about 30GW of onshore wind capacity. He added that new sites ""will have a very high bar to clear"". Environmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with disbelief and anger at some of the measures in the strategy. They cannot believe the government has offered no new policies on saving energy by insulating buildings. They say energy efficiency would immediately lower bills and emissions, and is the cheapest way to improve energy security. A Downing Street source said the strategy was now being seen as an energysupplystrategy. Campaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea, even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate. There is a strong welcome, though, for the promise of more energy from wind offshore with speedier planning consent. The same boost has not been offered to onshore wind. The decision to boost nuclear has drawn a mixed reaction. Some environmentalists say it's too dear and too dangerous. They ridicule the idea from some politicians that every city could have its own mini reactor. But other climate campaigners believe nuclear must be part of the energy mix. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the measures announced were not enough to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. ""All we've got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn't even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save Â£400 on everybody's bill,"" he said. The former boss of energy regulator Ofgem, Dermot Nolan, said: ""Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels."" He said the lack of focus on energy efficiency, insulation and improving the quality of people's homes was ""an opportunity missed"". Asked in the Lords why the government was not spending more on improving the insulation of homes, a business minister suggested the Treasury was not willing to support this. Lord Callanan told peers: ""We're spending something like Â£6.6bn over the term of this Parliament on insulation schemes. It would have been good to go further but the Treasury wouldn't support it."" Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said if the government was ""concerned about energy bills and taking real climate action, it would be going even further on onshore wind"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the plans as ""utterly hopeless"", while the SNP's Stephen Flynn also called it a ""missed opportunity"". Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said the strategy was ""underwhelming"", describing the lack of funding to improve energy efficiency in homes as ""an enormous gaping hole"". He added that there appeared to be ""limited ambition"" for onshore wind, despite it being ""remarkably popular"". What's in the energy strategy? Will the UK's energy strategy work?

"Denise Welch says Toraq Wyngard subjected her to an ""incredibly terrifying and stressful"" ordeal A stalker who started a fire in the driveway of Loose Women TV star Denise Welch's home, leaving her ""terrified"", has been jailed. Toraq Wyngard, 64, who was found with a kitchen knife in his rucksack, caused Â£4,285 of damage after the fire spread. The former Coronation Street actress told Manchester Crown Court that his actions had ""changed her life"". He was jailed for seven years and seven months for stalking, arson, possession of a knife and criminal damage. The court heard that, just before 23:00 BST on 19 September, 2020, Wyngard started a fire in a skip outside the home the actress shares with her husband Lincoln Townley in Cheshire. Ms Welch, who appeared via videolink from the US, said she had been alerted to the fire by her husband's ""piercing scream"" when a member of the public knocked on their door after spotting the flames. Gareth Bellis, prosecuting, said CCTV showed a man in a distinctive baseball cap looking around the property before appearing to pour an accelerant into the skip and set it alight. The fire spread to the garage. Wyngard, of Cannon Street, Salford, was later arrested nearby wearing the cap, covered in metallic pin badges, and police discovered a kitchen knife in his rucksack. Toraq Wyngard attempted to change his plea after admitting the charges The court heard that he claimed to be a press photographer after police found two cameras in his bag. Officers also found a number of cameras, some covert, and binoculars during a search of his home. On 10 February 2021, while Wyngard was released under investigation, Ms Welch and Mr Townley discovered the words ""Witch"" and ""Pimp"" along with an upside-down cross scrawled on their front gate in blue marker pen, the court was told. CCTV showed Wyngard writing the graffiti and he was also seen at a nearby shop buying the pen. Ms Welch told the court: ""This whole experience terrified me and continues to do so."" ""It has changed my life. I have a wonderful life and this man has permanently scarred it,"" she said. The court heard that the couple now spend Â£2,000 a month on additional security. Wyngardpleaded guilty to the stalking chargesat a hearing last September but his sentencing was delayed after he later attempted to change his pleas, claiming he had been ""pressured"" into admitting the offences, the court heard. His application to change his pleas was rejected but Louise Cowen, defending, said Wyngard maintained he was not guilty. She said he suffered from bipolar affective disorder and had been failing to take his medication. Sentencing Wyngard, Judge Michael Leeming said: ""You have expressed not a single word of regret, not a single word of concern for your victims at all. ""Your only concern is for your own interests."" Speaking after the hearing, Senior Crown Prosecutor Angela Rowan said Toraq Wyngard had done ""all he can to avoid facing up to what he did"" and had ""tried to frustrate the court process during the course of these proceedings, causing unnecessary delay"". She said she was grateful to Ms Welch and her family ""for showing patience in allowing justice to prevail"". ""I hope today's sentence and restraining order gives them some peace,"" she added.

"Rishi Sunak said it was wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls to ""come clean"" on his family's financial affairs after it emerged his wife benefits from a tax-saving scheme. Akshata Murty has non-dom status, meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on income earned abroad. Ms Murty earns money from shares in an Indian software giant founded by her billionaire father. Her spokeswoman said she paid all tax due in the UK - but Labour called for ""complete transparency"". Under the rules, people can be granted non-dom status if they live in the UK but intend to return to their home country. Ms Murty is an Indian citizen and has retained family ties to India. The BBC understands she has said she would eventually like to return there. If she lived in the UK for 15 years she would automatically lose her non-dom status, under the rules, but she has declined to say when it came into effect. Firm part-owned by Sunak's wife closing Russia office I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak National Insurance rise starts to hit pay packets Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak had ""very serious questions to answer"" about his family's finances. ""If it now transpires that his wife has used schemes to reduce her tax, while he's been increasing taxes on working people, that's breathtaking hypocrisy,"" said Sir Keir. It ""just goes to show just how out of touch this chancellor is"" at a time when taxes are increasing for millions of workers, he added. Labour has written to the chancellor demanding to know if he has benefited from Ms Murty's tax status. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""Sunak now needs to come clean about which country his family pays tax in abroad and if it is a tax haven."" The Lib Dems have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng defended Mr Sunak, saying it was ""completely unfair"" to scrutinise the tax affairs of Ms Murty, ""who is not a politician"". He also rejected opposition claims that she was ""sheltering"" from UK taxes. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think she's been very clear, she's been very transparent, the chancellor's been very transparent, and this non-dom status has been part of the UK tax system for more than 200 years."" When asked about the criticism of Mr Sunak over his wife's tax affairs, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think it's very important in politics to keep people's families out of it."". Last week, Mr Sunak told the BBC it was ""very upsetting"" to see his wife being criticised in the media, as she was not an elected politician. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Non-domiciled tax status was introduced in 1799 to protect colonial investments during the time of the British Empire. Those who have it must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on your tax return that you intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in her dad's company, thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Non-dom status has been a frequent source of political controversy. Wealthy Conservative politicians, such as former party chairman Lord Ashcroft and environment minister Lord Goldsmith, have faced criticism over claiming it, although Lord Goldsmith has now given up his non-dom status. Ms Murty confirmed her non-dom status afterit was reported by the Independent website,externalon Wednesday. ""Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents' home,"" her spokeswoman said. ""India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. ""She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income."" But tax experts have questioned her statement, suggesting that non-dom status is a ""choice"" that people can give up. ""Domicile has nothing to do with a person's nationality,"" said Professor Richard Murphy, co-founder of left-wing campaign group the Tax Justice Network. He added: ""Just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK."" This video can not be played Rishi Sunak and Will Smith both saw their wives mocked, but the chancellor says: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody."" Ms Murty was born in India in 1980 and holds an Indian passport. In 2009, she married Mr Sunak, who became the MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire, in 2015. The couple, who have two daughters, have a flat in Downing Street, and own a number of properties in the UK  including a Â£1.5m home in his constituency, and a property in Santa Monica, California. Ms Murty's father founded the IT services company Infosys which has grown to be one of India's biggest firms. She owns a little under 1% of its shares, worth more than Â£500m. She also has interests in several companies in the UK. Last monththe Telegraph reported,externalMs Murty would have received Â£11.6m in dividends from Infosys in the past tax year. Her non-dom status means she would not have had to pay UK tax on those dividends, which is currently charged at a rate of 39.35%. Indian tax authorities say dividend income is taxable at the rate of 20% for non-residents unless they qualify for any deductions. But the dividend rate can come down to 10% for people who are eligible to benefit from the UK's tax treaty with India. Asked if Ms Murty paid tax on her Infosys dividend payments in India, her representative said ""international tax"" was paid on her ""international income"". It is not clear, however, whether she pays tax on her dividend income in India or another jurisdiction. In its letter to Mr Sunak, Labour asked if his wife pays all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands. Mr Sunak made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's tax status as part of his declaration of interests when he first became a government minister in 2018.

"US President-elect Donald Trump has called on Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national incomes on defence. That is more than double the military alliance's current target of 2%. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also told member countries to boost military spending as part of a new ""wartime mindset"". Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato was founded in Washington DC in April 1949 Nato'sprimary purpose,externalwas to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree thatif one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.,external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It alsoco-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.,external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades,both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliancesaid that Ukraine could eventually join,external. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg told President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine can join in ""the long-term"" After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Although then Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg reconfirmed Ukraine could join ""in the long term"", he said this would not happen until after the war ended. Nato currently asks every member country to spend at least 2% of national income - also known as GDP - on defence. It is thought that23 countries met that target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which spend the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. In July 2024, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmersaid the UK will increase its defence spending to 2.5% of GDP. In December 2024, Nato secretary general Rutte said that member stateswould have to ""shift to a wartime mindset"" and spend ""considerably more than 2%"" on defence,external. During his first term as US president, Trump persuaded many Nato members to increase defence spending. In 2018 he said thatall countries in the alliance should be committing 4% of GDP. At a press conference at his Florida home in January 2025,Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5%,external, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" While campaigning for his second presidential term, Trumpsaid he might encourage Russia to attack Nato countries which failed to spend enough, remarks which were strongly condemned by the White House and former Nato chief Stoltenberg. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Nato said Russia's invasion of Ukraine posed the""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".,external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisationthe Kiel Institute,externalsaid that the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (Â£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (Â£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. Atacms missiles can reach up to 300km (186 miles) and are hard to intercept due to their high speed In August 2024,Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets- the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024,the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"". Russia has previously said that 1,351 soldiers have been killed. The full death toll is not known, but a Nato official has been quoted in the US media as saying between 7,000 and 15,000, and there are similar US estimates. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been speaking
to reporters after todayâs meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Belgium. âThere is a greater determination than ever to stand with
Ukraine,â he said, and to inflict âeven greater costsâ on Russia for its
invasion. He also said for every Bucha - a city in which Russia has been accused of committing war crimes - there were likely to be more places in which atrocities were happening. Blinken also welcomed the earlier vote to suspend Russia
from the UN Human Rights Council, saying: âToday, a wrong was righted.â Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the news that Russia has been suspended from the UN's Human Rights Council. Kulebasaid,external: ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history."" More now on that vote moments ago to suspend Russia from the UNâs
Human Rights Council during a session in New York. Ninety-three countries voted
in favour of the move, 24 against, and there were 58 abstentions. Among the countries who supported the suspension were the
US, EU nations, the UK, and of course Ukraine itself. China, Syria, and Belarus were among those who voted against the motion. And India, Egypt, and South Africa were among the nations
which abstained. You can see the full list here,external.  The General Assembly of the United Nations has just voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council during a session in New York. It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraineâs ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of âhorrificâ abuses â raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russiaâs own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba speaking at the Nato meeting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberghas statedthat allies are âready to do moreâ to provide military equipment and support to Ukraine. But Ukraineâs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at a press conference earlier at Nato HQ in Brussels, said that help was needed in âdays not weeksâ if it was to avoid coming too late. Articulating the severity of the situation, Kuleba compared the unfolding fighting in the Donbas region to the Second World War. â[It] will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations... the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.â He said this would ânot be a local operationâ based on current observations of Russian preparations. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours - and the outcome of this battle will be decided on the battlefield,"" he added. The Donbas is Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. The term refers to two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian-backed separatists declared ""republics"" in parts of the regions in 2014 and Russian forces have captured more territory since Vladimir Putin's invasion began in late February. Russian forces executed civilians in various locations in the Kyiv region, according to new testimonypublished by Amnesty International.,external The human rights organisation interviewed more than 20 people from towns and villages near the capital, some were witnesses to, or had direct knowledge of, the violence committed, it says. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" says Amnesty International Secretary General AgnÃ¨s Callamard. ""Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" In one account given, a woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty two Russian soldiers entered her house on 9 March, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. With Russian forces retreating from the north of Ukraine, disturbing
stories of life under occupation have been emerging. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen has
been told of Russian troops using villagers as human shields against Ukrainian
counter-attacks. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces have committed
atrocities, and sought to point the finger of blame elsewhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9995989
"This video can not be played Debunking Russian claims about Bucha killings Russian troops were heard discussing killing civilians in the Ukrainian town of Bucha, in messages intercepted by German intelligence, German media say. Der Spiegel magazine says some of the radio traffic tracked by the BND intelligence agency appears to match locations of bodies just outside Kyiv. The BND has so far made no public comments on the issue. Ukraine says more than 300 civilians were killed by the Russians in Bucha - Moscow denies any involvement. Recent images of Bucha streets strewn with bodies have shocked the international community. Some of the victims appeared to have been shot in the back of the head after their hands were tied. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of genocide, an accusation flatly rejected by Moscow. Warning: This piece contains graphic images which some may find upsetting. Bucha was seized by Russian troops soon after President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. After more than a month, the Russians eventually withdrew from Bucha, and Ukrainian forces soon entered the town. Workers have been removing civilians' bodies found on the streets of Bucha into body bags The BND's intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday, Der Spiegel reported on Thursday. In one intercepted radio message, the magazine said, Russian soldiers appeared to be talking about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talked about shooting someone on a bike, which appeared to match a notorious photo showing a dead cyclist in Bucha. According to Spiegel, the intercepts also appeared to indicate that mercenaries from Russia's private Wagner group played a key role in the Bucha killings. An unnamed security source told Reuters news agency: ""It's true that the [German] federal government has indications of Russian perpetration in Bucha"". ""However, these findings on Bucha refer to satellite images. The radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" Russia says its forces withdrew from Bucha on 30 March. The Ukrainians say this happened in the early hours of 31 March. On 1 April, footage was postedfilmed from a car,externaldriving through the town which showed bodies on either side of a road. Russia has claimed, without providing evidence, that the footage shows ""fake dead bodies"" and it was ""staged"" after its troops had left the town. However, a satellite image from 19 March, first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by the BBC, directly contradicted the Russian claim. The photo by the Maxar technology company shows objects that appear to be bodies in the exact locations where they were subsequently found by Ukrainian forces when they regained control of the town north of Kyiv.

"Rishi Sunak said it was wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls to ""come clean"" on his family's financial affairs after it emerged his wife benefits from a tax-saving scheme. Akshata Murty has non-dom status, meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on income earned abroad. Ms Murty earns money from shares in an Indian software giant founded by her billionaire father. Her spokeswoman said she paid all tax due in the UK - but Labour called for ""complete transparency"". Under the rules, people can be granted non-dom status if they live in the UK but intend to return to their home country. Ms Murty is an Indian citizen and has retained family ties to India. The BBC understands she has said she would eventually like to return there. If she lived in the UK for 15 years she would automatically lose her non-dom status, under the rules, but she has declined to say when it came into effect. Firm part-owned by Sunak's wife closing Russia office I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak National Insurance rise starts to hit pay packets Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak had ""very serious questions to answer"" about his family's finances. ""If it now transpires that his wife has used schemes to reduce her tax, while he's been increasing taxes on working people, that's breathtaking hypocrisy,"" said Sir Keir. It ""just goes to show just how out of touch this chancellor is"" at a time when taxes are increasing for millions of workers, he added. Labour has written to the chancellor demanding to know if he has benefited from Ms Murty's tax status. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""Sunak now needs to come clean about which country his family pays tax in abroad and if it is a tax haven."" The Lib Dems have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng defended Mr Sunak, saying it was ""completely unfair"" to scrutinise the tax affairs of Ms Murty, ""who is not a politician"". He also rejected opposition claims that she was ""sheltering"" from UK taxes. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think she's been very clear, she's been very transparent, the chancellor's been very transparent, and this non-dom status has been part of the UK tax system for more than 200 years."" When asked about the criticism of Mr Sunak over his wife's tax affairs, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think it's very important in politics to keep people's families out of it."". Last week, Mr Sunak told the BBC it was ""very upsetting"" to see his wife being criticised in the media, as she was not an elected politician. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Non-domiciled tax status was introduced in 1799 to protect colonial investments during the time of the British Empire. Those who have it must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on your tax return that you intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in her dad's company, thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Non-dom status has been a frequent source of political controversy. Wealthy Conservative politicians, such as former party chairman Lord Ashcroft and environment minister Lord Goldsmith, have faced criticism over claiming it, although Lord Goldsmith has now given up his non-dom status. Ms Murty confirmed her non-dom status afterit was reported by the Independent website,externalon Wednesday. ""Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents' home,"" her spokeswoman said. ""India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. ""She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income."" But tax experts have questioned her statement, suggesting that non-dom status is a ""choice"" that people can give up. ""Domicile has nothing to do with a person's nationality,"" said Professor Richard Murphy, co-founder of left-wing campaign group the Tax Justice Network. He added: ""Just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK."" This video can not be played Rishi Sunak and Will Smith both saw their wives mocked, but the chancellor says: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody."" Ms Murty was born in India in 1980 and holds an Indian passport. In 2009, she married Mr Sunak, who became the MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire, in 2015. The couple, who have two daughters, have a flat in Downing Street, and own a number of properties in the UK  including a Â£1.5m home in his constituency, and a property in Santa Monica, California. Ms Murty's father founded the IT services company Infosys which has grown to be one of India's biggest firms. She owns a little under 1% of its shares, worth more than Â£500m. She also has interests in several companies in the UK. Last monththe Telegraph reported,externalMs Murty would have received Â£11.6m in dividends from Infosys in the past tax year. Her non-dom status means she would not have had to pay UK tax on those dividends, which is currently charged at a rate of 39.35%. Indian tax authorities say dividend income is taxable at the rate of 20% for non-residents unless they qualify for any deductions. But the dividend rate can come down to 10% for people who are eligible to benefit from the UK's tax treaty with India. Asked if Ms Murty paid tax on her Infosys dividend payments in India, her representative said ""international tax"" was paid on her ""international income"". It is not clear, however, whether she pays tax on her dividend income in India or another jurisdiction. In its letter to Mr Sunak, Labour asked if his wife pays all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands. Mr Sunak made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's tax status as part of his declaration of interests when he first became a government minister in 2018.

"Denise Welch says Toraq Wyngard subjected her to an ""incredibly terrifying and stressful"" ordeal A stalker who started a fire in the driveway of Loose Women TV star Denise Welch's home, leaving her ""terrified"", has been jailed. Toraq Wyngard, 64, who was found with a kitchen knife in his rucksack, caused Â£4,285 of damage after the fire spread. The former Coronation Street actress told Manchester Crown Court that his actions had ""changed her life"". He was jailed for seven years and seven months for stalking, arson, possession of a knife and criminal damage. The court heard that, just before 23:00 BST on 19 September, 2020, Wyngard started a fire in a skip outside the home the actress shares with her husband Lincoln Townley in Cheshire. Ms Welch, who appeared via videolink from the US, said she had been alerted to the fire by her husband's ""piercing scream"" when a member of the public knocked on their door after spotting the flames. Gareth Bellis, prosecuting, said CCTV showed a man in a distinctive baseball cap looking around the property before appearing to pour an accelerant into the skip and set it alight. The fire spread to the garage. Wyngard, of Cannon Street, Salford, was later arrested nearby wearing the cap, covered in metallic pin badges, and police discovered a kitchen knife in his rucksack. Toraq Wyngard attempted to change his plea after admitting the charges The court heard that he claimed to be a press photographer after police found two cameras in his bag. Officers also found a number of cameras, some covert, and binoculars during a search of his home. On 10 February 2021, while Wyngard was released under investigation, Ms Welch and Mr Townley discovered the words ""Witch"" and ""Pimp"" along with an upside-down cross scrawled on their front gate in blue marker pen, the court was told. CCTV showed Wyngard writing the graffiti and he was also seen at a nearby shop buying the pen. Ms Welch told the court: ""This whole experience terrified me and continues to do so."" ""It has changed my life. I have a wonderful life and this man has permanently scarred it,"" she said. The court heard that the couple now spend Â£2,000 a month on additional security. Wyngardpleaded guilty to the stalking chargesat a hearing last September but his sentencing was delayed after he later attempted to change his pleas, claiming he had been ""pressured"" into admitting the offences, the court heard. His application to change his pleas was rejected but Louise Cowen, defending, said Wyngard maintained he was not guilty. She said he suffered from bipolar affective disorder and had been failing to take his medication. Sentencing Wyngard, Judge Michael Leeming said: ""You have expressed not a single word of regret, not a single word of concern for your victims at all. ""Your only concern is for your own interests."" Speaking after the hearing, Senior Crown Prosecutor Angela Rowan said Toraq Wyngard had done ""all he can to avoid facing up to what he did"" and had ""tried to frustrate the court process during the course of these proceedings, causing unnecessary delay"". She said she was grateful to Ms Welch and her family ""for showing patience in allowing justice to prevail"". ""I hope today's sentence and restraining order gives them some peace,"" she added.

"The Sizewell C plant is one of the eight new nuclear plants the government wants approved by 2030 Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced extra support for nuclear power in the Budget. He wants to reclassify it as ""environmentally sustainable"" so the industry can access some of the financial incentives available to other forms of renewable energy. The government wants nuclear power to provide 25% of the UK's electricity needs by 2050. To generate nuclear power in non-military reactors, uranium atoms are bombarded by much smaller neutron particles. This causes the atoms to break down in process called nuclear fission, which releases huge amounts of energy as heat. The heat is used to boil water, producing steam which drives turbines and generates electricity. BBC Bitesize: How is nuclear power generated? Nuclear fusion breakthrough â what is it and how does it work? Like fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are non-renewable energy resources, but unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power stations do not producegreenhouse gases like carbon dioxide or methaneduring their operation. Building new nuclear plants does create emissions - through manufacturing the steel and other materials needed. But the emissions footprint - the total emissions generated across the lifecycle of a plant -is still very low.,external The government will consult on the proposal to reclassify nuclear power as ""environmentally sustainable"". But the announcement follows a similar moveby the EU in 2022. What's in the UK's new energy strategy? What does net zero mean? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? The International Atomic Energy Agency says nuclear power plants are among""the safest and most secure facilities in the world"",external. They are subject to stringent international safety standards. However, there have been a number of high-profile accidents which released large amounts of radioactive material into the environment. The worst nuclear accident in history was caused byexplosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine in 1986. More recently an enormous earthquake caused a tsunami which flooded the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan in 2011,causing a partial meltdown of the reactor cores. However, even under normal conditions, generating nuclear power produces hazardous radioactive waste, which needs to be safely managed and stored for hundreds of years. There are currently six plants that can supply about 20% of UK electricity demand,with 15.5% generated this way in 2022. Most are at the end of their life, but the government wants to deliverup to eight new reactors overall,external- with one to be approved each year until 2030. TheHinkley Point C plantis already under construction in Somerset, and in July 2022, the governmentgave the go-aheadfor the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast. Together these will be able to power 12 million homes in the UK. As well as larger nuclear power stations, the government also wants to develop Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). These work in the same way as conventional nuclear reactors,but on a smaller scale. The chancellor announced a new competition for SMRs to be delivered through a new body calledGreat British Nuclear.,external If a project proposed is ""demonstrated to be viable"", he said the government would co-fund it. The overall cost of nuclear power is comparable with other forms of energy, but nuclear plants are extremely expensive to build. Hinkley C is the first new nuclear power station to be built in the UK in more than 20 years The original budget for Hinkley C was Â£18bn in 2015. It is now expected to cost Â£33bn at today's prices. The government hopes anew financial funding modelcould cut the cost of future nuclear projects, including Sizewell C. In 2013, the government agreed to pay Â£92.50 per megawatt hour for Hinkley Point's electricity, an amount which will rise with inflation. Although this is much lower than the current price ofÂ£161 per megawatt hour,external, critics argue it's still too much. In 2019, before the global energy crisis pushed prices up, electricity cost Â£50 per megawatt hour, so if prices returned to this level, Â£92.50 would be very expensive. Energy price guarantee: What is happening to gas and electricity bills? Critics of nuclear power say the new plants will take so long to come on stream they will be too lateto help the UK meet its emissions targetsor reduce energy prices for consumers. Hinkley Point C is two years behind schedulepartially due to the pandemic, and Sizewell Cis expected to take nine years to construct,external. One of the benefits of SMRs is that they are much quicker to construct than larger plants.

"Tesco staff are set to see pay rise to Â£10.10 an hour from the end of July, the supermarket giant has announced. The UK's biggest private employer said staff wages will rise by 55p, up from Â£9.55 an hour, from 24 July. Meanwhile, its delivery drivers and click and collect assistants will get a 90p increase to Â£11 an hour. Tesco's move brings it in line with Lidl and Aldi, which became the UK's highest-paying supermarkets this year with the same hourly rate. Union Usdaw said Tesco's pay rise was ""testament"" to the hard work of staff at what it said was a ""difficult time"". The new pay deal will be handed to workers in stores and customer fulfilment centres. Last year, Morrisons became the first UK supermarket to announceit would pay at least Â£10 an hour from April 2021. Sainsbury's said in January it would pay shop workers at least Â£10 an hour, while the supermarket is expected to make a further announcement tomorrow on wages. Jason Tarry, chief executive officer of Tesco UK & ROI, said employees were getting a ""well-deserved pay rise, more access to extra hours, and setting out a long-term commitment and investment in their careers at Tesco"". Tesco store workers in London will get a similar increase bring their hourly pay to Â£10.78 per hour. Alongside pay rises, Tesco is to increase its ""colleague clubcard"" discount allowance by Â£500 to take the annual total allowance for all colleagues to Â£1,500 with immediate effect. Usdaw national officer Daniel Adams said the union was ""pleased"" to secure a pay deal that not only delivered ""the highest hourly rate of pay in the sector"", but also gave members a right to request a ""normal hours"" contract and ensured a minimum 16-hour contract in the future. Tesco employs about 300,000 people in the UK, and most of them work on the shop floor. Upping the core hourly wage by an extra 55p will add Â£200m to the wage bill. There's a battle to recruit and retain staff in many parts of the economy right now. As Britain's biggest retailer, Tesco needs to stay competitive on pay. It can also afford to do so. Tesco's been doing very well. It has momentum and scale in a sector that's as cut throat as it's ever been. This move also puts pressure on other retailers as they wrestle with soaring cost increases and how much of these they can pass on to consumers. Shop workers face the same cost of living pressures as everyone else and more pay deals are on the cards over the coming months. Earlier on Thursday, telecoms giant BT said it would hand its UK frontline workers a Â£1,500 pay rise in the company's biggest pay increase for more than 20 years. BT said the increase was ""focused on the lowest paid workers"" including engineers, contact centre staff and retail staff, and would work out as a roughly 8% increase for some. But the offer was rejected by the Communication Workers Union. It tweeted that it had ""no choice now but to immediately prepare for a statutory industrial action ballot"". People in the UK are facing increased pressure from living costs, with inflation rising at its fastest rate for 30 years, driven up by surging fuel, energy and food prices. The National Living Wage, which applies to workers over the age of 23, has increased from Â£8.91 per hour, to Â£9.50 per hour from this month. The National Minimum Wage, for those aged 21 to 22, has gone up to Â£9.18. The rate at which prices rise has been forecast to reach 8.7% in the final three months of 2022.

"Up to eight more nuclear reactors could be approved on existing sites as part of the UK's new energy strategy. The strategy, which aims to boost UK energy independence and tackle rising prices, also includes plans to increase wind, hydrogen and solar production. But experts have called for a bigger focus on energy efficiency and improving home insulation. Consumers are facing soaring energy bills after the Russian invasion of Ukraine pushed gas prices even higher. Under the government's new plans,external, up to 95% of the UK's electricity could come from low-carbon sources by 2030. It outlines, for example, the hope of producing up to 50 gigawatts (GW) of energy through offshore wind farms, which the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said would be more than enough to power every home in the UK. The government's energy strategy has been much-delayed, with one of the big points of contention reported to have been the construction of onshore wind turbines. Nuclear- The government plans to reduce the UK's reliance on oil and gas by building as many as eight new nuclear reactors, including two at Sizewell in Suffolk. A new body will oversee the delivery of the new plants. Wind- The government aims to reform planning laws to speed up approvals for new offshore wind farms. For onshore wind farms it wants to develop partnerships with ""supportive communities"" who want to host turbines in exchange for guaranteed cheaper energy bills. Hydrogen- Targets for hydrogen production are being doubled to help provide cleaner energy for industry as well as for power, transport and potentially heating. Solar- The government will consider reforming rules for installing solar panels on homes and commercial buildings to help increase the current solar capacity by up to five times by 2035. Oil and gas- A new licensing round for North Sea projects is being launched in the summer on the basis that producing gas in the UK has a lower carbon footprint than doing so abroad. Heat pumps- There will be a Â£30m ""heat pump investment accelerator competition"" to make British heat pumps which reduce demand for gas. Environmentalists and many energy experts have reacted with disbelief and anger at some of the measures in the strategy. They cannot believe the government has offered no new policies on saving energy by insulating buildings. They say energy efficiency would immediately lower bills and emissions, and is the cheapest way to improve energy security. A Downing Street source said the strategy was now being seen as an energysupplystrategy. Campaigners are also furious that ministers have committed to seeking more oil and gas in the North Sea, even though humans have already found enough fossil fuels to wreck the climate. There is a strong welcome, though, for the promise of more energy from wind offshore with speedier planning consent. The same boost has not been offered to onshore wind. The decision to boost nuclear has drawn a mixed reaction. Some environmentalists say it's too dear and too dangerous. They ridicule the idea from some politicians that every city could have its own mini reactor. But other climate campaigners believe nuclear must be part of the energy mix. The new strategy says the government wants to ""lead the world once again"" in nuclear power, reversing what it describes as ""decades of underinvestment"". The government announced that a new body called Great British Nuclear will be launched to bolster the UK's nuclear capacity, with the hope that by 2050 up to 24 GW of electricity will come from that source - 25% of the projected electricity demand. The focus on nuclear could deliver up to eight new reactors to be built on existing sites. The government hopes to have a new reactor approved each year until 2030 with the aim to have them up and running by 2050. It also confirmed advanced plans to approve two new reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk during this parliament. Wylfa in Anglesey and Oldbury in South Gloucestershire have also been named as candidates to host either large-scale plants, smaller modular nuclear reactors, or possibly both. The Great British Nuclear body will identify other appropriate sites. Tom Greatrex, boss of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the plans marked a ""vital step forward"" for the UK to meet its climate goals, and could create thousands of jobs. ""The ambition and determination to do much more and quicker is very welcome,"" he said. What's in the UK's new energy strategy? Will the UK's energy strategy work? How much nuclear power does the UK use? How high could my energy bills go? The government said it would reform planning rules to cut approval times for new offshore wind farms, with the ambition that by 2030 more than half of the UK's renewable capacity will be wind. For onshore wind, the strategy commits to consulting on developing partnerships with ""a limited number of supportive communities"" who want to host wind turbines in exchange for guaranteed lower energy bills. However, the strategy says there will be no ""wholesale changes"" to current planning regulations for onshore wind. Although it is one of the cheapest forms of energy, new onshore wind projects have been declining since 2015 when the government ended subsidies and introduced stricter planning rules in response to some complaints that wind turbines were an eyesore and noisy. Defending the decision not to prioritise onshore wind, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK already had about 30GW of onshore wind capacity. Speaking at the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant, he said onshore wind farms were ""controversial"" because of their visual impact and new sites ""will have a very high bar to clear"". The prime minister visited the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in Somerset on Thursday Mr Johnson said the strategy was about ""tackling the mistakes of the past and making sure that we are set well for the future"". Citing policies including a Â£6bn energy efficiency fund and support for heat pumps, he said the government was ""already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the strategy as ""too little"" and ""too late"" to help people with rising costs. ""All we've got today is a cobbled-together list of things that could and should have been done over the last 10 to 12 years and it doesn't even tackle really important things like insulating homes, which could save Â£400 on everybody's bill,"" he said. Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said it ""did not serve the needs of people or the climate"". Mr Ramsay suggested that if the government was ""concerned about energy bills and taking real climate action, it would be going even further on onshore wind"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the plans as ""utterly hopeless"", while the SNP's Stephen Flynn called it a ""missed opportunity"". No plans for new nuclear reactors in Scotland UK nuclear boost plan gives Anglesey plant hope Former Ofgem boss Dermot Nolan said: ""Most of these decisions will take a long time to have an impact and in the short run we will continue to be dependent on fossil fuels."" He said the lack of focus on energy efficiency, on insulation, on improving the quality of people's homes ""is an opportunity missed"". Dr Simon Cran-McGreehin, head of analysis at the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit said:  ""This is an immediate problem that needs solutions now, and this doesn't do anything on prices."" ""It tries to do some things on energy supply, but they're all medium to long-term measures. So it does seem to fail the exam question,"" he added. Will the UK's energy strategy work?

"Devon and Cornwall Police admitted misusing Jane's personal information and have agreed to pay a six-figure sum in costs and damages A woman who was gang-raped by men claiming to be Welsh rugby players has sued the police for naming her online. Jane, who was 17 when she was raped in a Plymouth hotel in 1978, said officers breached her legal right to anonymity as the victim of a sexual offence. Devon and Cornwall Police admitted misusing her personal information and has settled her claim, agreeing to pay a six-figure sum in costs and damages. ""What's happened to me is a second rape,"" said Jane. The force said it was unable to comment on the case. Jane, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, said she was a normal teenager when she went out with a friend in Plymouth one Saturday, 44 years ago. She met a man and agreed to go to his hotel with him. Once there, she had consensual sex with the man who said he was a maths teacher and part of a touring rugby team from Wales. There was a knock on the door and more than 10 men forced their way into the room before six or seven of them raped her. Jane reported what happened to police, first in 1993 and again in 2015. ""The first investigation unbeknown to me had been shut down four weeks after it had commenced,"" she said. ""I came forward 20 years later and asked to see the records of that first investigation, to find that there were no records and that I didn't exist."" Jane revisited the former hotel in Plymouth where she was raped in 1978 Due to her previous experience Jane was reluctant to re-report the rapes but was encouraged to do so and a new investigation was launched. Trying to track down the officers involved in the 1993 investigation, detectives in the second investigation arranged to have details of her rapes, including her name and address, published on an unsecure website for retired police officers and staff. Jane said she was unaware she had been identified on the website. In 2017, senior detectives visited Jane at her home and told her about the publication. ""I went into shock,"" she said. ""It was literally like an emotional bomb had gone off ... my first concern was that nobody in my family knew."" She asked for information about who had published her details and the name of the website but said the officers refused to tell her. Jane said afterwards she felt forced to disclose her rapes to her family. The force did not carry out a criminal investigation and Jane said she had to lobby for the breach of her anonymity to be treated as a crime. Eventually an investigation was started by another police force, who sent officers to interview her. Jane was raped in what was then the Strathmore Hotel in Plymouth Jane said she was not told there was a time limit for prosecuting an offence of breaching the anonymity of the victim of a sexual assault and that charges needed to be brought within six months of the publication being removed from the website. She said a file was handed to the CPS with ""days to run before it expired"". Jane said the CPS was not given full information about the website and that, when the CPS concluded there should not be a prosecution because it felt her details were not accessible to the general public, it was too late for her to appeal the decision. The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 provides life-long anonymity to victims of sexual offences, protecting victims from being identified in the media. A victim has the right to remain anonymous from the moment they make an allegation that they are the victim of a sexual offence. The law states nothing which could lead members of the public to identify a victim should be published, including their name, address, their school or place of work or a picture of the person. Source: www.legislation.gov.uk Jane said she had been told the website was password protected but because the officers had refused to tell her the name of the website, she was unable to check. She said: ""Nearly a year-and-a-half later I was going back over the papers, the CPS wrote to me, the person who looked at the case had named the publisher and he had named the website and within 20 minutes of properly looking for the website, I was in. ""That's two years after they had told me that it was password protected - it still wasn't password protected."" In the months and years that followed, Jane pursued a number of professional standards investigations, carried out by two other police forces, before appealing to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). In 2020, the IOPC determined two named officers - a detective inspector and a detective constable - ""may have breached the standards of professional behaviour"". The IOPC report said: ""This decision is somewhat academic because both officers have retired, and the legislation prohibits me from finding a case to answer for misconduct."" It said the conduct of the two officers was not believed to have ""reached the threshold to be considered gross misconduct"". The report said the detective inspector involved was ""ultimately responsible"" for organising the post on the website which ""breached"" Jane's anonymity and ""this was most likely due to him being ignorant of the relevant legislation or he failed to conduct due diligence into the security and accessibility of the website"". It said: ""Despite the fact that failings have been identified, I have not identified any sense of contrition or consequence on the part of the force and no apology has been offered."" The IOPC added that had the time limit for bringing charges under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act not expired, it would have ""recommended a re-referral to the CPS in respect of the anonymity breach to test whether 'additional information' would have affected their charging decision"". Jane said she felt compelled to engage her own legal representation because ""the police made it known that they were not going to act in my best interests"". In March 2021, Devon and Cornwall Police's legal team confirmed the force admitted liability for misuse of Jane's private information, breach of confidence and for breaching her rights under the Data Protection Act by placing her identifying details on the website. The financial settlement was agreed at the end of 2021. ""[When they initially came and visited me] they could have avoided four years of absolute hell for me, they could have avoided the amount of money that they have had to pay for the case to be concluded and they could have shown contrition,"" Jane said. She said she had asked for a face-to-face meeting and an apology from Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer, who was named as the defendant in her case, in exchange for a reduction in the settlement. This offer was declined and the force paid the higher amount, she said. ""The important thing for rape victims is to know that they can come forward in safety with trust and be assured that the police are working for their interests ... what I've experienced is quite the opposite,"" she said. No-one has ever been prosecuted for Jane's rapes, meanwhile, the investigation continues. In January 2020, Devon and Cornwall Policelaunched an appeal to find two men they believed could help identify the rapists. E-fit images of the two men, who Jane believed were friends with her rapists but did not rape her, were released. The police launched an appeal in January 2020 to find two men they believed could identify the rapists The force told the BBC: ""In adherence with the Sexual Offences [Amendment] Act 1992 we are unable to disclose details of any victim of a sexual offence to a third party without their explicit consent. ""In line with College of Policing guidelines we are unable to confirm nor deny whether any identified individual has been a victim of a crime or has been involved in a police investigation. ""Therefore, we are unable to comment further on this matter."" Jane called on the public to help identify the men who raped her. She said: ""Do I have hope? It's dwindling. Potentially I don't feel there's the will to investigate ... I know it's been a long time since those rapes but I would ask people to come forward ... if the police can't do it then it is down to the general public isn't it?"" Jane said throughout her ordeal her ""ability to consent to things that are happening to me has been taken away, firstly by the rapists and I would say that what's happened to me again is a second rape"". She said: ""I understand my rapists, rapists rape, I don't understand the police ... I would personally rather face my rapists than ever have to face the trauma of going through a rape investigation."" A spokesperson for the Devon and Cornwall Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC) said: ""It would be inappropriate for the police and crime commissioner to comment on any individual case. However, the commissioner does have a role in monitoring how the police handle and respond to complaints about Devon and Cornwall Police, its officers and operational police staff. ""Complaints should be sent directly to the force in the first instance. ""If a complainant is unhappy with the outcome of that complaint the OPCC can then review the case and will appoint an independent chair to carry out the review.""

"182 Hitachi trains were withdrawn from service due to cracks Industry standards should be reviewed after fatigue and corrosion led to high-speed trains being withdrawn from service, the rail regulator has found. Cracks were found in more than 180 Hitachi trains being used by Great Western Railway (GWR) and London North Eastern Railway (LNER) last year. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said the damage was partly due to the trains being corroded by salt in the air. Hitachi Rail said it took ""appropriate action to prioritise safety"". In May 2021, the withdrawal of the damaged Hitachi Class 800 and 385 series trainsled to a week of delays and cancellations for travellers. Affected operators were Great Western Railway, London North Eastern Railway, TransPennine Express and Hull Trains. Cracks were also found after examination of ScotRail's Class 385 and Southeastern's Class 395 trains. Train cracks caused by fatigue and corrosion Train disruption to continue after cracks found High-speed trains withdrawn over crack fears The ORR investigation found the design of the trains complied with existing standards but that corrosion cracks were found on lifting points - which allow carriages to be raised during maintenance work - resulting from the use of a particular type of aluminium, which was corroded by salt in the air. It said fatigue cracking was caused by the ""trains experiencing greater loads from train movement than allowed for in the original design"". It added: ""It is not yet known for certain why this happened, although potential factors include wheel wear and track design."" The trains first entered service in 2017. The ORR recommended further work was carried out to identify the reasons for cracks developing in the rolling stock. It said it had been assured of ""no safety failures and trains have performed as specified"" since they returned to service. Ian Prosser, ORR's chief inspector of railways, said Hitachi Rail and other operators had put in place ""robust plans to make sure the right safety issues are being managed"". ""Our review provides a clearer picture of the issue and we will continue our oversight to ensure work moves forward to agree the permanent solution and our recommendations are acted on,"" he added. ""It is important that the whole industry works together to learn lessons from what has happened."" Hitachi Rail has proposed a plan to replace and modify affected parts to be completed over six years in order to minimise the number of trains out of service at one time. In a statement, the company said the report confirmed ""all Hitachi trains meet relevant standards and that we took the appropriate action to prioritise safety and maintain train availability"". ""The proposed engineering solutions outlined in the report are currently being reviewed by all partners,"" it added. ""We are working together to finalise the plan for their implementation, while always prioritising safety and train availability to support consistent passenger services."" By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent When the cracks were discovered it caused chaos with Great Western Railway reduced to running just three intercity trains for a time. Tens of thousands of people found they could not travel. Now we are told it will take up to six years to put right. And the precise solution to the hairline cracks still hasn't been agreed. What we do know is that Hitachi will rent space at Eastleigh Works in Hampshire, and take trains out of service one at a time to fix them - it won't be cheap. For now, Great Western Railway says it has enough trains available to match its timetable, and passengers should not be affected.

"A drug testing charity is warning dangerous synthetic cannabis, sold as marijuana sweets, could be putting buyers at risk of death. It's after a 23-year-old woman died after eating a synthetic cannabis sweet that she'd ordered on a messaging app. A man's since been charged with possession with intent to supply Class B synthetic cannabinoid. The Loop says it's worried about a rise in the popularity of cannabis sweets known as gummies. That's because without testing, it's impossible to tell what's inside them. ""People are taking advantage of this,"" Guy Jones, a senior scientist at The Loop, tells Newsbeat. ""With herbal cannabis you can look at it you can smell it to decide whether it's real cannabis or not. With these highly processed forms, that is completely out of the window."" Both cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids - commonly referred to as Spice - are illegal toproduce possess, distribute or sell,externalin the UK. Some people can be legally prescribed cannabis by healthcare professionals for various medical conditions, however. Possession can result in up to five years in prison or an unlimited fine (or both), supply and production can result in up to 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine (or both). Police can give you an on-the-spot fine of Â£90 if you are caught with cannabis. One is grown, the other is created in a lab - designed to latch on the same receptors in the brain as cannabis, but with a completely different chemical structure. So even though some of the effects might seem familiar, the potential for different side effects is very different. Synthetic cannabinoids can cause hallucination, extreme paranoia and in the highest doses even death. Synthetic cannabinoids like Spice were made illegal in the UK in 2015 ""The concern is drug sellers are buying a regular supply of cannabis sweets and their supplier has gone out of stock,"" Guy says. ""They find another supplier who says, 'I've got these really good cannabis sweets, they're really strong'. But it turns out this person is just trying to turn a profit by using these really cheap synthetic cannabinoids."" He says everyone downstream faces a ""huge additional risk"". Buyers think they're purchasing cannabis which has ""essentially a non-existent risk of overdose"". In reality they're buying synthetic cannabinoids, which Guys explains ""carry a very very significant potential for death or serious harm by overdose"". It's not the first time these synthetic drugs have been in the news. In 2018, a prisoner who died after being found ""slumped"" in his cell at a Welsh prison, was found to havetaken Spice. Two high school pupils in Northern Ireland were given medical treatment last year, afterinadvertently consuming synthetic cannabisthrough an e-cigarette. The latest available data from the Office for National Statistics shows between 2018-2020, 169 deaths were recorded where the cause of death related to ""poisoning"" from synthetic cannabinoids. That's compared to 60 deaths in the three years before that. ""It's not a new thing,"" says Guy. But as countries around the world have legalised the recreational use of marijuana, the market has expanded and so too has the way people want to consume it. Everything from vaporisers, oils and creams you can rub on your skin, to edible sugar sweets have become popular - particularly in the US and Canada, where it's legal. Canada's marijuana marketalone is worth around CAD$5bn (Â£3bn; $4bn) a year. Lollipops containing THC, the chemical which makes users high, on sale in California where the drug has been legalised Guy says he expects users to be getting synthetic gummy products the same way they get any marijuana product, ""through social media, face to face or online"". ""Obtaining drugs doesn't seem to be a problem for the users of our service nor anybody else. I would expect that synthetic products are filtering through the same supply networks,"" he tells Newsbeat. There's also a warning for those determined to buy them and consume them. ""If you're really intent on taking something that isn't tested and have significant risks associated with it, start with a small amount. If you start with one whole dose you run the risk that whoever made it has been incompetent and has put say three whole doses in. If that's a synthetic cannabinoid there's a potential for serious harm."" FRANK,externalprovides a confidential service to anyone wanting information, advice or support about any aspect of drugs.

"Assistant Chief Constable Jennifer Mattinson said there are opportunities to provide a more consistent level of service A police force is ""not effectively safeguarding children"", a watchdog has said. Staffordshire Police needs to do more to give a consistently good service for all children and some investigations are confused,a report says,external. The force was criticised for its handling of some missing children cases with inspectors saying it takes too long to recognise risks and respond. The force said it was committed to making improvements. The inspection, by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS)  in September, found, overall, the force's arrangements ""aren't consistently providing a good enough response to effectively safeguard children"". Staffordshire Police said it is committed to making improvements Investigations into sexting offences among children are also ""sometimes confused"", the report said, with evidence of investigations being given to officers who do not have the right training. Officers do not always seize devices containing the images, which means they cannot be used for evidence or to help identify other victims., it added. HMICFRS has issued a series of recommendations including the force recognise missing children are particularly vulnerable, share information about online child abuse promptly and that officers speak to children and use that information to make decisions about their welfare. Inspectors said Staffordshire Police sometimes takes too long to recognise risks and respond to cases of missing children Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary Wendy Williams said the force has some areas of effective practice in child protection and it does understand the benefits of working closely with other local safeguarding organisations. ""However, Staffordshire Police urgently needs to make fundamental changes to improve many of its child protection arrangements and practices. ""While officers and staff who manage demanding child abuse cases are doing their best, some don't have enough knowledge or understanding of good child protection practice."" Staffordshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Jennifer Mattinson said: ""Work is very much underway to address the concerns raised and it has been for some time.""

"Rishi Sunak said it was wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls to ""come clean"" on his family's financial affairs after it emerged his wife benefits from a tax-saving scheme. Akshata Murty has non-dom status, meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on income earned abroad. Ms Murty earns money from shares in an Indian software giant founded by her billionaire father. Her spokeswoman said she paid all tax due in the UK - but Labour called for ""complete transparency"". Under the rules, people can be granted non-dom status if they live in the UK but intend to return to their home country. Ms Murty is an Indian citizen and has retained family ties to India. The BBC understands she has said she would eventually like to return there. If she lived in the UK for 15 years she would automatically lose her non-dom status, under the rules, but she has declined to say when it came into effect. Firm part-owned by Sunak's wife closing Russia office I know how Will Smith felt at Oscars, says Sunak National Insurance rise starts to hit pay packets Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Sunak had ""very serious questions to answer"" about his family's finances. ""If it now transpires that his wife has used schemes to reduce her tax, while he's been increasing taxes on working people, that's breathtaking hypocrisy,"" said Sir Keir. It ""just goes to show just how out of touch this chancellor is"" at a time when taxes are increasing for millions of workers, he added. Labour has written to the chancellor demanding to know if he has benefited from Ms Murty's tax status. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: ""Sunak now needs to come clean about which country his family pays tax in abroad and if it is a tax haven."" The Lib Dems have urged Mr Sunak to ban the partners of ministers from claiming non-dom status, calling it a ""loophole"". But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng defended Mr Sunak, saying it was ""completely unfair"" to scrutinise the tax affairs of Ms Murty, ""who is not a politician"". He also rejected opposition claims that she was ""sheltering"" from UK taxes. He told BBC Breakfast: ""I think she's been very clear, she's been very transparent, the chancellor's been very transparent, and this non-dom status has been part of the UK tax system for more than 200 years."" When asked about the criticism of Mr Sunak over his wife's tax affairs, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""I think it's very important in politics to keep people's families out of it."". Last week, Mr Sunak told the BBC it was ""very upsetting"" to see his wife being criticised in the media, as she was not an elected politician. A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas where somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions, such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Non-domiciled tax status was introduced in 1799 to protect colonial investments during the time of the British Empire. Those who have it must still pay UK tax on UK earnings but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time by stating on your tax return that you intend to live in the UK and wish to be considered British for tax purposes. Ms Murty has chosen to be domiciled in India via her father, the billionaire Narayana Murty, which means she doesn't need to pay taxes in the UK on dividends she receives from her stake in her dad's company, thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Non-dom status has been a frequent source of political controversy. Wealthy Conservative politicians, such as former party chairman Lord Ashcroft and environment minister Lord Goldsmith, have faced criticism over claiming it, although Lord Goldsmith has now given up his non-dom status. Ms Murty confirmed her non-dom status afterit was reported by the Independent website,externalon Wednesday. ""Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parents' home,"" her spokeswoman said. ""India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. ""She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income."" But tax experts have questioned her statement, suggesting that non-dom status is a ""choice"" that people can give up. ""Domicile has nothing to do with a person's nationality,"" said Professor Richard Murphy, co-founder of left-wing campaign group the Tax Justice Network. He added: ""Just because a person has Indian citizenship will never automatically grant them non-dom status in the UK."" This video can not be played Rishi Sunak and Will Smith both saw their wives mocked, but the chancellor says: ""At least I didn't get up and slap anybody."" Ms Murty was born in India in 1980 and holds an Indian passport. In 2009, she married Mr Sunak, who became the MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire, in 2015. The couple, who have two daughters, have a flat in Downing Street, and own a number of properties in the UK  including a Â£1.5m home in his constituency, and a property in Santa Monica, California. Ms Murty's father founded the IT services company Infosys which has grown to be one of India's biggest firms. She owns a little under 1% of its shares, worth more than Â£500m. She also has interests in several companies in the UK. Last monththe Telegraph reported,externalMs Murty would have received Â£11.6m in dividends from Infosys in the past tax year. Her non-dom status means she would not have had to pay UK tax on those dividends, which is currently charged at a rate of 39.35%. Indian tax authorities say dividend income is taxable at the rate of 20% for non-residents unless they qualify for any deductions. But the dividend rate can come down to 10% for people who are eligible to benefit from the UK's tax treaty with India. Asked if Ms Murty paid tax on her Infosys dividend payments in India, her representative said ""international tax"" was paid on her ""international income"". It is not clear, however, whether she pays tax on her dividend income in India or another jurisdiction. In its letter to Mr Sunak, Labour asked if his wife pays all foreign tax in India or in a tax haven such as the Cayman Islands. Mr Sunak made the Cabinet Office aware of his wife's tax status as part of his declaration of interests when he first became a government minister in 2018.

"The government has been under pressure to quickly deliver food supplies to residents Some residents under lockdown in Shanghai say they are running out of food, amid the city's biggest-ever Covid outbreak. Residents are confined to their homes, banned from leaving for even essential reasons such as grocery shopping. Nearly 20,000 cases were reported on Thursday in China's biggest city - another near-record high. Officials have admitted the city is facing ""difficulties"" but say they are trying to improve this. Shanghai Covid lockdown extended to entire city But public anger is also being stoked by other drastic measures - such as the removal of children from their parents if they test positive. Shanghai officials later responded by allowing parents who were also infected to accompany their children to isolation centres. However, according to a Reuters report, there are still complaints over children separated from parents who were not Covid-positive. All locals have to get tested regularly under the city-wide testing order The city began another round of mandatory mass testing on Wednesday to identify and isolate every case. Shanghai residents who test positive can't isolate in their homes even if their conditions are mild or asymptomatic. They have to go to mandatory quarantine facilities, which critics say have become crowded and have sub-par conditions. When Omicron first emerged in Shanghai a month ago, the city quarantined only certain compounds. Then as the virus spread officials last week implemented a staggered lockdown where the city was split into two and each half had separate measures. On Monday the lockdown was extended indefinitely to cover the entire city of 25 million people. Strict rules mean most people have to order in food and water and wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs. But the lockdown extension has overwhelmed delivery services, grocery shop websites and even the distribution of government supplies. Many delivery personnel are also in locked-down areas, leading to an overall decrease in delivery capacity. Locals in some areas of the city say they've been completely cut off. ""Please solve the problem of insufficient delivery capacity as soon as possible,"" one user wrote on social media site Weibo in response to city officials' video message. Another person wrote that it was the ""first time in my life that I have gone hungry"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Residents have also raised other concerns about price gouging, and how elderly or less tech-savvy residents are surviving. City officials acknowledged the food struggles on Wednesday, saying Shanghai had enough supplies of rice, noodles, grain, oil and meat but there were delays in distributing them. ""It is true there are some difficulties in ensuring the supply of daily necessities,"" said Liu Min, the deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce. On Thursday, Shanghai's vice mayor added the city would try to re-open some wholesale markets and food stores, and allow more delivery personnel out of locked-down areas. ""We have been holding meetings overnight to try and figure out solutions,"" said Chen Tong. The government has been under pressure to quickly deliver food supplies to residents China is one of the last remaining nations still committed to eradicating Covid, in contrast to most of the world which is trying to live with the virus in its Omicron variation. How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on? The country has successfully enacted full lockdowns before - endured by millions of people in cities including Xi'an and Wuhan  - but Shanghai is its biggest city and the case spread this time is much higher than previous outbreaks.

"Stock photo of person using a mobile phone while using a bicycle A Tory politician is calling for a ban on using mobiles while on a bicycle or e-scooter, after a concerning incident with a cyclist near Parliament. Baroness McIntosh of Pickering wants a law change so cyclists are prosecuted for the offence of using a phone, in the same way that car drivers are. There is no specific offence for a cyclist using a phone, but a minister pointed out cyclists can be prosecuted for careless or dangerous cycling. That comes with fines of up to Â£2,500. Baroness McIntosh's call for a law change come after updates to the Highway Code in January which included a hierarchy of road users designed to protecting vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists. Lady McIntosh questioned why Rule 149 of the code, requiring motorists to ""exercise proper control of your vehicle at all times"" and banning use of a mobile phone while driving, did not apply to cyclists and other road users. To illustrate her point, she said she had recently been walking to the Houses of Parliament and as she was crossing the road, she suddenly became aware of a cyclist travelling towards her using a mobile phone, ""one hand bicycling, one hand on the mobile phone, on the wrong side of the road"". She added: ""I wasn't clear whether he was going to stop or not."" Walking and biking prioritised in new Highway Code When and where can I ride an e-scooter legally? The mechanics hacking e-scooter speed restrictions She said some cyclists and riders of e-scooters and e-bikes and were using mobile phones ""inappropriately"" and challenged the Department for Transport on why it had not addressed the issue. The former minister said e-scooters were ""even more of a concern"" with some people left feeling ""absolutely terrorised"" by those using them ""irresponsibly"". Of course, the use of e-scooters is totally illegal on most public roads anyway - whether or nor the owner is using a mobile phone simultaneously. They can only legitimately be used in one of the areasthat is operating an official rental scheme, as part of on ongoing government trial. Lady McIntosh urged the government to ""create criminal offences relating to dangerous, careless and inconsiderate cycling for those users of pedal bikes, electronically assisted bikes and e-scooters"". Lady McIntosh said she had a close encounter with a cyclist using a mobile phone while she was crossing the road near the Houses of Parliament Transport minister Baroness Vere of Norbiton said existing laws already banned cyclists and e-scooter riders from using mobile phones. She said: ""It is not a specific offence to cycle and use a mobile phone or headphones, but cyclists and e-bike riders can be prosecuted by the police for careless and dangerous cycling with maximum fines of Â£1,000 and Â£2,500 respectively."" She said later that the regulations in the government's current e-scooter trial already state that is an offence to use a handheld mobile phone while operating one. Rule-breakers could be fined and get six penalty points, she added. Walking and biking prioritised in new Highway Code When and where can I ride an e-scooter legally?

"182 Hitachi trains were withdrawn from service due to cracks Industry standards should be reviewed after fatigue and corrosion led to high-speed trains being withdrawn from service, the rail regulator has found. Cracks were found in more than 180 Hitachi trains being used by Great Western Railway (GWR) and London North Eastern Railway (LNER) last year. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said the damage was partly due to the trains being corroded by salt in the air. Hitachi Rail said it took ""appropriate action to prioritise safety"". In May 2021, the withdrawal of the damaged Hitachi Class 800 and 385 series trainsled to a week of delays and cancellations for travellers. Affected operators were Great Western Railway, London North Eastern Railway, TransPennine Express and Hull Trains. Cracks were also found after examination of ScotRail's Class 385 and Southeastern's Class 395 trains. Train cracks caused by fatigue and corrosion Train disruption to continue after cracks found High-speed trains withdrawn over crack fears The ORR investigation found the design of the trains complied with existing standards but that corrosion cracks were found on lifting points - which allow carriages to be raised during maintenance work - resulting from the use of a particular type of aluminium, which was corroded by salt in the air. It said fatigue cracking was caused by the ""trains experiencing greater loads from train movement than allowed for in the original design"". It added: ""It is not yet known for certain why this happened, although potential factors include wheel wear and track design."" The trains first entered service in 2017. The ORR recommended further work was carried out to identify the reasons for cracks developing in the rolling stock. It said it had been assured of ""no safety failures and trains have performed as specified"" since they returned to service. Ian Prosser, ORR's chief inspector of railways, said Hitachi Rail and other operators had put in place ""robust plans to make sure the right safety issues are being managed"". ""Our review provides a clearer picture of the issue and we will continue our oversight to ensure work moves forward to agree the permanent solution and our recommendations are acted on,"" he added. ""It is important that the whole industry works together to learn lessons from what has happened."" Hitachi Rail has proposed a plan to replace and modify affected parts to be completed over six years in order to minimise the number of trains out of service at one time. In a statement, the company said the report confirmed ""all Hitachi trains meet relevant standards and that we took the appropriate action to prioritise safety and maintain train availability"". ""The proposed engineering solutions outlined in the report are currently being reviewed by all partners,"" it added. ""We are working together to finalise the plan for their implementation, while always prioritising safety and train availability to support consistent passenger services."" By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent When the cracks were discovered it caused chaos with Great Western Railway reduced to running just three intercity trains for a time. Tens of thousands of people found they could not travel. Now we are told it will take up to six years to put right. And the precise solution to the hairline cracks still hasn't been agreed. What we do know is that Hitachi will rent space at Eastleigh Works in Hampshire, and take trains out of service one at a time to fix them - it won't be cheap. For now, Great Western Railway says it has enough trains available to match its timetable, and passengers should not be affected.

"A glowing review of a cuddly toy is all very well, but not much help when the product it is next to is headphones Headphones on Amazon from some third-party sellers had misleading reviews for different products like cuddly toys and umbrellas, Which? found. In an investigation, the consumer watchdog discovered that nine out of 10 of the top-rated headphones on the site earlier this year had glowing reviews for a range of unrelated products. Amazon said that it had taken action on the listings and sellers in question. The UK government is investigating the issue of fake reviews. Reviews on products sold on Amazon and other online marketplaces play a big part in persuading consumers to buy one item over another. A beach umbrella comes with a glowing review but has nothing to do with headphones Which? found that some sellers were using loopholes in review merging, which can artificially inflate how high up in listings products are seen by customers. Merging reviews on Amazon can be legitimate, and is useful for sellers who want to manage a catalogue of very similar products - such as the same product but in a different colour. But using such reviews for unrelated products is against Amazon's terms and conditions, because it can make something look more popular than it is. Which? focused on just one category - Bluetooth-enabled headphones - and followed the reviews for the top 10 products over the course of a month, from February to March this year. Nine out of 10 of the top 10 in-ear headphones carried reviews for completely unrelated products Most of the brands were not household names and were all sold by more than one seller, so Which? was unable to determine whether the brands themselves were implicated in any wrongdoing. None of the sellers contacted by Which? replied to its requests for comment. The most highly-rated product boasted five stars, carried an ""Amazon's Choice"" stamp of approval and came with 40 glowing reviews. But none of the reviews actually related to the headphones themselves - instead they were for cuddly toys. Another headphone listing had 863 reviews for a personalised jigsaw puzzle, while a third had 1,386 reviews for beach umbrellas Next to the other products on the list, Which? found more completely unrelated reviews, for souvenir mugs, razor blades, and an extension cable. Some, but not all of the reviews, came with pictures of the other products. Only one of the headphones on the list, made by one of the best-known audio electronics firm Bose, showed no evidence of review merging. But its headphones were ranked only eighth best out of the 10 investigated. Which? director of policy Rocio Concha said: ""Unscrupulous businesses are exploiting weaknesses with Amazon's review system, leaving shoppers at risk of buying products boosted by thousands of bogus five-star reviews."" It was, she added, more evidence that the Competition and Markets Authority's ongoing fake reviews investigation was vitally needed to ""protect people from these unfair practices"". Buyer Alistair Soames found a review for a shower curtain next to earbuds In response, Amazon said: ""We have now taken appropriate enforcement action against the product listings and sellers in question. ""We have clear guardrails in place to prevent products from being incorrectly grouped, either due to human error or abuse. ""Our proactive measures detect and block the vast majority of abuse in our store automatically: however, we are disappointed when bad actors evade our system and we will continue to innovate and invest in our tools and processes."" Although Which? only looked at headphones, it said it had also seen the issue across other categories, such as smartphone chargers. And the watchdog also found evidence of review hijacking, where sellers have their reviews stolen by others. Doing this is relatively easy to do, experts told Which? Sellers simply find dormant listings and retop them with their own product name. Which? was first alerted to the issue by buyer Alistair Soames, who complained to the watchdog that he had been shopping for earbuds on Amazon, and noticed that some of the reviews for them were for shower curtains and kitchen knives. ""I read the reviews and many were absolute nonsense. It was the pictures that gave it away  - I saw a shower curtain and thought 'hang on a second, what has that got to do with headphones?'""

"Rishi Sunak said it was wrong for people to criticise his wife Akshata Murty Chancellor Rishi Sunak is facing calls to ""come clean"" on his family's financial affairs after it emerged his wife benefits from a tax-saving scheme. Akshata Murty has non-dom status, meaning she does not have to pay UK tax on income earned abroad. Ms Murty earns money from shares in an Indian software giant founded by her billionaire father. Her spokeswoman said she paid all tax due in the UK - but Labour called for ""complete transparency"". Under the rules, people can be granted non-dom status if they live in the UK but intend to return to their home country. Ms Murty is an Indian citizen and has retained family ties to India. The BBC understands she has said she would eventually like to return there.

"Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova works in academia and business The US has imposed sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including his daughters. The list also includes the family of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,externaland major banks. The measures follow new revelations of atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine, including images of bodies of civilians scattered on the streets of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv. Russia says, without evidence, the images are staged by Kyiv officials. Even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha, Mr Putin on Wednesday described the event as a ""crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime"". Referring to the Bucha murders, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday: ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes."" ""Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,"" Mr Biden added. The US said that Mr Putin's daughters, Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, were being put under sanctions ""for being the adult children of Putin, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked"". Who are Putin's daughters? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The announcement described Ms Tikhonova as ""a tech executive whose work supports the GoR [Russian government] and defense industry"". Her sister, Ms Vorontsova, it went on, ""leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin"". Asked why the US was targeting Mr Putin's daughters, a senior Biden administration official said the US thought they could be in control of some of their father's assets. ""We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,"" the official said. ""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them."" The US sanctions announced by the White House include: economic measures to ban new investment in Russia severe financial sanctions on Russia's largest private bank, Alfa Bank, and its largest financial institution, Sberbank sanctions on critical major state-owned enterprises sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members Meanwhile the UK has announcedfurther sanctions against eight oligarchs and Russian banks, including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow. The European Union is also debating cutting off Russian coal imports as concern over alleged war crimes increases. Before the new raft of sanctions was announced in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he could not ""tolerate any indecisiveness"". Speaking to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, he said there was still a need to convince some in Europe who believe ""war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses"" to back tougher sanctions. He added that ""Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine"", with Ukraine's foreign minister arguing on Twitter that an embargo on gas and oil was needed to truly impact Russia's ability to finance the war. Volodymyr Zelensky urged more action when speaking to Irish lawmakers on Wednesday Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, separately acknowledged on Wednesday that the one billion euros ($1.09bn; Â£833m) Europe spent on Russian energy every day put into sharp perspective the billion euros given to Ukraine in military assistance since the start of the invasion. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine FACT CHECKING:Fact-checking Russian claims about Bucha killings WAR CRIMES:Could Putin be prosecuted? WATCH:Ambulance crew on the front line READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Some European member states, including Germany, are heavily reliant on Russian energy and had been reluctant to directly target the sector. However, in a first, theEuropean Commission proposed a potential ban on imports of Russian coal on Tuesday, which must be agreed by all 27 members. Europe buys around â¬4bn ($4.4bn; Â£3.3bn) worth of coal from Moscow every year. Sentiment appeared to change after evidence of Russian war crimes emerged, with French President Emmanuel Macron joining calls for a ban on coal earlier this week. The ban was suggested ahead of a range of sanctions set to be announced in coordination with the US and other G7 nations. EU officials say sanctions on Russian imports of coal and oil are definitely being considered European member states are also expected to impose a ""full transaction ban"" on four Russian banks and ban a range of other Russian and Belarusian imports, including wood, cement, seafood and liquor, worth â¬5.5 billion ($6bn; Â£4.59bn). And Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said she intends to close EU ports to Russian vessels and ban Russian and Belarusian road transport operators from the region. Ms Von der Leyen accused Russia of ""waging a cruel and ruthless war"" against Ukrainian civilians and said the EU must ""sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point"". But Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday evening criticized the EU's proposed sanctions package, calling it a ""feeble response"" which is ""an invitation for more atrocities."" ""Coal, four banksâ¦a ban on ports and borders (with exceptions) is not really an adequate sanctions package to the massacres that are being uncovered,"" Mr Landsbergis wrote on Twitter.

"Residents of Bucha said Russian soldiers killed civilians outside their homes without provocation Attacks on civilians by Russian forces in the Ukrainian town of Bucha do not ""look far short of genocide"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. The UK has announced further sanctions against eight oligarchs and Russian banks, including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow. Dozens of people have been found dead in the town - including some in a mass grave - after Russia's withdrawal. Moscow denied involvement and described reports as fake news. The Foreign Office announced its latest sanctions following the reports of attacks on civilians, and these include ending all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of the year as well as action against strategic industries. The latest sanctions come in step with those imposed by the US, which has alsoimposed sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin's two daughters. Ahead of the new sanctions being announced, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm afraid when you look at what's happening in Bucha, the revelations that we are seeing from what Putin has done in Ukraine doesn't look far short of genocide to me. ""It is no wonder people are responding in the way that they are. I have no doubt that the international community, Britain very much in the front rank, will be moving again in lockstep to impose more sanctions and more penalties on Vladimir Putin's regime."" Could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? An execution-style killing on a street in Bucha Bucha satellite image contradicts Russian claims What is genocide? As part of its sanctions response, the UK has pledged to stop importing Russian oil by the end of the year, while the EU is reducing its imports of Russian gas by two-thirds. Mr Johnson praised the ""enormous strides"" the EU is taken to reduce dependence on Russian gas. At a working dinner in Brussels on Wednesday evening Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to tell Nato colleagues the ""age of engagement with Russia is over"". She is expected to say there is ""no time for false comfort"" and that Russia is not retreating but regrouping to push harder in the east of Ukraine. Ms Truss is expected to urge allies to arm Ukraine quickly and decisively, and to rethink its support for countries ""caught in the web of Russian influence"", such as Georgia and Moldova. As part of sanctions imposed on Russia all new outward investment to the country has been banned, while imports of Russian iron and steel products will be banned. Among those added to the sanctions list is Viatcheslav Kantor, the largest shareholder of fertilizer company Acron,whose donations funded a new unit at a London hospital used by the royal family,external. The Edward VII Hospital accepted a donation from the Kantor Charitable Foundation to fund the Kantor Medical Centre. Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) talks to billionaire, businessman and owner of Acron Group Viatcheslav Kantor (L) while visiting the Acron plant in 2016 The other oligarchs added to the sanctions list include: Andrey Guryev - known close associate of Vladimir Putin and founder of fertiliser firm PhosAgro Sergey Kogogin, director of Kamaz, which manufactures trucks including for the military Sergey Sergeyevich Ivanov, president of the world's largest diamond producer Alrosa Leonid Mikhelson,  founder, and chief executive of Russian natural gas producer Novatek Andrey Akimov, chief executive of Russia's third largest bank Gazprombank Aleksander Dyukov, chief executive of Russia's third largest and majority state-owned oil producer GazpromNeft Boris Borisovich Rotenberg, son of the co-owner of Russia's largest gas pipeline producer SGM. Ms Truss said the latest wave of sanctions would decimate Mr Putin's ""war machine"" and show the Russian elite could not wash their hands of the atrocities committed on his orders. Sanctions are penalties imposed by countries intended to stop aggression, or punish breaches of international law, and often involve financial curbs. Those taken by the UK so far include freezing assets, excluding Russian banks from the UK financial system, banning some exports to Russia, restricting visas for wealthy investors and banning flights. By the end of the year, the UK has said it will also phase out Russian oil imports. Along with the EU and US, it has frozen the assets of more than 1,000 individuals and companies, including politicians andwealthy business leaders thought to be close to the Kremlin. Asset freezes prevent anyone in the UK or any UK company from dealing with any funds or resources that are owned or held by the designated person, and prevent resources being provided to or for the benefit of that person. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had called for ""even tougher sanctions"" following the ""horrific, harrowing images"" of civilian deaths in Bucha. He said we have to give Ukraine ""every support we can"" and said the international community must be clear ""that these war crimes will end up with those responsible being hunted down"". The deliberate targeting of civilians, as has been alleged by residents of Bucha, is a war crime under the Geneva Convention. But for a massacre to be considered genocide, the law also requires proof of the intent to destroy a particular national, ethnic, racial or religious group - whether entirely or in part. The Genocide Convention, introduced after the Nazi Holocaust during World War Two, requires the 152 nations who are signatories to ""prevent and to punish"" genocide where it occurs.

"Assistant Chief Constable Jennifer Mattinson said there are opportunities to provide a more consistent level of service A police force is ""not effectively safeguarding children"", a watchdog has said. Staffordshire Police needs to do more to give a consistently good service for all children and some investigations are confused,a report says,external. The force was criticised for its handling of some missing children cases with inspectors saying it takes too long to recognise risks and respond. The force said it was committed to making improvements. The inspection, by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS)  in September, found, overall, the force's arrangements ""aren't consistently providing a good enough response to effectively safeguard children"". Staffordshire Police said it is committed to making improvements Investigations into sexting offences among children are also ""sometimes confused"", the report said, with evidence of investigations being given to officers who do not have the right training. Officers do not always seize devices containing the images, which means they cannot be used for evidence or to help identify other victims., it added. HMICFRS has issued a series of recommendations including the force recognise missing children are particularly vulnerable, share information about online child abuse promptly and that officers speak to children and use that information to make decisions about their welfare. Inspectors said Staffordshire Police sometimes takes too long to recognise risks and respond to cases of missing children Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary Wendy Williams said the force has some areas of effective practice in child protection and it does understand the benefits of working closely with other local safeguarding organisations. ""However, Staffordshire Police urgently needs to make fundamental changes to improve many of its child protection arrangements and practices. ""While officers and staff who manage demanding child abuse cases are doing their best, some don't have enough knowledge or understanding of good child protection practice."" Staffordshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Jennifer Mattinson said: ""Work is very much underway to address the concerns raised and it has been for some time."" She said new and refreshed training is being delivered to staff, with the force reviewed processes and procedures around missing children and technology being upgraded.

"The cap on passenger numbers at London Luton Airport would rise to 19 million under the proposals The government is to hold an inquiry into Luton Airport's expansion plans that were approved by a council. Luton Borough Councilbacked the airport's plans for growthin December. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has cited concerns over climate change targets and policies for enhancing the natural environment among its reasons. London Luton Airport said it was ""disappointed by the decision"", but opponents welcomed the intervention. The council, whose companyLuton Risingowns the UK's fifth busiest airport, said the government's decision was ""in line with due process"". Luton Borough Council was told in a letter: ""To consider all the relevant aspects of the proposed development, the secretary of state [Michael Gove] has decided to hold a local inquiry."" Airport plans for 1m more passengers approved Council loans airport a further Â£119m Luton Airport delays plans for second terminal The plans approved by the council would enable the site to handle 19 million people a year - up from 18 million. Amendments to the currentnoise contours,external, which measure how many people are affected by noise from the airport, were also approved by the authority. Responding to the government's decision, a council spokesman said: ""The Secretary of State had already signalled his wish to consider reviewing the application so this development is in line with due process."" Opponents of the expansion have expressed their joy at the decision to hold an inquiry. Andrew Lambourne, from anti-noise group LADACAN, said it was a ""fantastic decision"". The ""call-in"" of the plans was also supported by Bim Afolami, Conservative MP for Hitchin and Harpenden,who last year said the approval decision""completely ignores the environmental and cross-boundary impact"". The government has the power to call in planning applications that local authorities approve and make the final decision. This usually happens in cases where the decision may have wider effects beyond the immediate locality or potentially conflict with national policy. In a statement, London Luton Airport Operations, which runs the airport, said it respected the secretary of state's request. ""The government understands that airports are an important enabler of wider economic growth, and for LLA to play its part it's important we can maximise our potential,"" it said. ""Our plan enables us to do that byâ¯putting the airport on the best possibleâ¯footing for a long-term recovery that supports the local economy and the creation of jobs following the worst crisis our industry has ever faced.""

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"". Russia has previously said that 1,351 soldiers have been killed. The full death toll is not known, but a Nato official has been quoted in the US media as saying between 7,000 and 15,000, and there are similar US estimates. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been speaking
to reporters after todayâs meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Belgium. âThere is a greater determination than ever to stand with
Ukraine,â he said, and to inflict âeven greater costsâ on Russia for its
invasion. He also said for every Bucha - a city in which Russia has been accused of committing war crimes - there were likely to be more places in which atrocities were happening. Blinken also welcomed the earlier vote to suspend Russia
from the UN Human Rights Council, saying: âToday, a wrong was righted.â Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the news that Russia has been suspended from the UN's Human Rights Council. Kulebasaid,external: ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history."" More now on that vote moments ago to suspend Russia from the UNâs
Human Rights Council during a session in New York. Ninety-three countries voted
in favour of the move, 24 against, and there were 58 abstentions. Among the countries who supported the suspension were the
US, EU nations, the UK, and of course Ukraine itself. China, Syria, and Belarus were among those who voted against the motion. And India, Egypt, and South Africa were among the nations
which abstained. You can see the full list here,external.  The General Assembly of the United Nations has just voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council during a session in New York. It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraineâs ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of âhorrificâ abuses â raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russiaâs own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba speaking at the Nato meeting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberghas statedthat allies are âready to do moreâ to provide military equipment and support to Ukraine. But Ukraineâs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at a press conference earlier at Nato HQ in Brussels, said that help was needed in âdays not weeksâ if it was to avoid coming too late. Articulating the severity of the situation, Kuleba compared the unfolding fighting in the Donbas region to the Second World War. â[It] will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations... the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.â He said this would ânot be a local operationâ based on current observations of Russian preparations. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours - and the outcome of this battle will be decided on the battlefield,"" he added. The Donbas is Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. The term refers to two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian-backed separatists declared ""republics"" in parts of the regions in 2014 and Russian forces have captured more territory since Vladimir Putin's invasion began in late February. Russian forces executed civilians in various locations in the Kyiv region, according to new testimonypublished by Amnesty International.,external The human rights organisation interviewed more than 20 people from towns and villages near the capital, some were witnesses to, or had direct knowledge of, the violence committed, it says. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" says Amnesty International Secretary General AgnÃ¨s Callamard. ""Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" In one account given, a woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty two Russian soldiers entered her house on 9 March, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. With Russian forces retreating from the north of Ukraine, disturbing
stories of life under occupation have been emerging. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen has
been told of Russian troops using villagers as human shields against Ukrainian
counter-attacks. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces have committed
atrocities, and sought to point the finger of blame elsewhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9999856
"Putin's daughter Katerina Tikhonova works in academia and business The US has imposed sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, including his daughters. The list also includes the family of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov,externaland major banks. The measures follow new revelations of atrocities by Russian troops in Ukraine, including images of bodies of civilians scattered on the streets of Bucha, near the capital Kyiv. Russia says, without evidence, the images are staged by Kyiv officials. Even though satellite images have shown the civilians were killed when Russians were in control of Bucha, Mr Putin on Wednesday described the event as a ""crude and cynical provocation by the Kyiv regime"". Referring to the Bucha murders, US President Joe Biden said on Wednesday: ""There's nothing less happening than major war crimes."" ""Responsible nations have to come together to hold these perpetrators accountable,"" Mr Biden added. The US said that Mr Putin's daughters, Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, were being put under sanctions ""for being the adult children of Putin, a person whose property and interests in property are blocked"". Who are Putin's daughters? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The announcement described Ms Tikhonova as ""a tech executive whose work supports the GoR [Russian government] and defense industry"". Her sister, Ms Vorontsova, it went on, ""leads state-funded programs that have received billions of dollars from the Kremlin toward genetics research and are personally overseen by Putin"". Asked why the US was targeting Mr Putin's daughters, a senior Biden administration official said the US thought they could be in control of some of their father's assets. ""We have reason to believe that Putin, and many of his cronies, and the oligarchs, hide their wealth, hide their assets, with family members that place their assets and their wealth in the US financial system, and also many other parts of the world,"" the official said. ""We believe that many of Putin's assets are hidden with family members, and that's why we're targeting them."" The US sanctions announced by the White House include: economic measures to ban new investment in Russia severe financial sanctions on Russia's largest private bank, Alfa Bank, and its largest financial institution, Sberbank sanctions on critical major state-owned enterprises sanctions on Russian government officials and their family members Meanwhile the UK has announcedfurther sanctions against eight oligarchs and Russian banks, including the country's largest, Sberbank, and Credit Bank of Moscow. The European Union is also debating cutting off Russian coal imports as concern over alleged war crimes increases. Before the new raft of sanctions was announced in Washington, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he could not ""tolerate any indecisiveness"". Speaking to the Irish parliament on Wednesday, he said there was still a need to convince some in Europe who believe ""war and war crimes are not as horrific as financial losses"" to back tougher sanctions. He added that ""Russian oil cannot feed the Russian military machine"", with Ukraine's foreign minister arguing on Twitter that an embargo on gas and oil was needed to truly impact Russia's ability to finance the war. Volodymyr Zelensky urged more action when speaking to Irish lawmakers on Wednesday Josep Borrell, the EU's chief diplomat, separately acknowledged on Wednesday that the one billion euros ($1.09bn; Â£833m) Europe spent on Russian energy every day put into sharp perspective the billion euros given to Ukraine in military assistance since the start of the invasion.

WATCH:Ambulance crew on the front line READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Some European member states, including Germany, are heavily reliant on Russian energy and had been reluctant to directly target the sector. However, in a first, theEuropean Commission proposed a potential ban on imports of Russian coal on Tuesday, which must be agreed by all 27 members. Europe buys around â¬4bn ($4.4bn; Â£3.3bn) worth of coal from Moscow every year. Sentiment appeared to change after evidence of Russian war crimes emerged, with French President Emmanuel Macron joining calls for a ban on coal earlier this week. The ban was suggested ahead of a range of sanctions set to be announced in coordination with the US and other G7 nations. EU officials say sanctions on Russian imports of coal and oil are definitely being considered European member states are also expected to impose a ""full transaction ban"" on four Russian banks and ban a range of other Russian and Belarusian imports, including wood, cement, seafood and liquor, worth â¬5.5 billion ($6bn; Â£4.59bn). And Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said she intends to close EU ports to Russian vessels and ban Russian and Belarusian road transport operators from the region. Ms Von der Leyen accused Russia of ""waging a cruel and ruthless war"" against Ukrainian civilians and said the EU must ""sustain utmost pressure on Putin and the Russian government at this critical point"". But Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis on Tuesday evening criticized the EU's proposed sanctions package, calling it a ""feeble response"" which is ""an invitation for more atrocities."" ""Coal, four banksâ¦a ban on ports and borders (with exceptions) is not really an adequate sanctions package to the massacres that are being uncovered,"" Mr Landsbergis wrote on Twitter.
