"Displaced civilians have set up makeshift camps near the border with Jordan At least 270,000 people have fled their homes in south-western Syria since the military launched an assault on rebel-held areas two weeks ago, the UN says. Many of those displaced by the fighting in Deraa and Quneitra provinces have headed towards the borders with Jordan and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. But neither country has said it will allow an influx of refugees, sparking fears of a humanitarian crisis. Government forces have been advancing with the help of Russian air strikes. Over the weekend, more than a dozen towns and villages reportedly agreed to surrender and accept President Bashar al-Assad's rule. More than 130 civilians have been killed since hostilities escalated, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Why is there a war in Syria? War crimes committed in Syria battle - UN Deraa and Quneitra had been relatively calm for almost a year because of a ""de-escalation"" agreement brokered by the US and Jordan, which support the opposition, and Russia, a staunch ally of the government. But Mr Assad set his sights on regaining full control of the provinces after defeating rebels in the Eastern Ghouta region outside the capital Damascus in April. Control of south-western Syria (27 June 2018) UN officials said on Monday that more than a third of the population living in rebel-held south-western Syria had fled their homes in response to the government's intense air, artillery and rocket strikes as well as clashes on the ground. ""We were expecting the number of displaced in southern Syria to reach 200,000, but it has already exceeded 270,000 people in record time,"" Mohammad Hawari, a spokesman for the UN Refugee Agency in Jordan, told AFP news agency. Up to 70,000 of the displaced are reportedly gathered near the closed Nassib border crossing with Jordan, where many families are being forced to live in makeshift shelters or out in the open, without basic supplies. Those living in the camps near the Jordanian border in searing heat ""We lost our children, our houses, our places to take shelter,"" one woman at a camp told AFP news agency on Sunday. ""We are sitting on the ground. We have no water to wash our hands. We have no water to drink, no food to eat."" The high number of displaced people has also increased the pressure on hospitals in border communities, which medics say have been repeatedly targeted by Syrian government and Russian air strikes since the government offensive began. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in Deraa,externaland urged neighbouring countries to provide safe passage to those wishing to flee the violence. Syrian government forces have made significant gains, retaking several towns and villages Jordan has kept its border closed and said it could not cope with taking in any more than the 660,000 registered refugees it already hosts, while Israel has said it will not allow Syrians to cross into its territory. After meeting UN officials on Monday, Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said it had been delivering aid to crossings with Syria, but that there had been issues getting permission from Damascus to transport it over the border. ""We believe that it is in nobody's interest to have Syrians depart their country,"" he said. ""There is no shortage of [aid] supplies. The question is just to get it across."" Mr Safadi also said he would hold talks with his Russian counterpart in Moscow on Tuesday, which he hoped would ""take us more steps forward to contain this crisis and prevent more destruction"". Jordan's government said it was delivering containers of aid to Syrian border crossings Russia has opened negotiations with rebel factions on a wider ceasefire deal on behalf of the government. But several rebel commanders have rejected a proposal that they lay down their arms in return for guarantees of safety. The Israeli military has also stepped up its humanitarian efforts. On Friday, it took in six injured Syrians, including four young children, for emergency medical treatment. It also supplied tents, food, baby formula, medical equipment, clothing and shoes to camps in the Golan Heights demilitarised zone. ""We will continue to defend our borders. We will extend humanitarian assistance to the extent of our abilities. We will not allow entry into our territory,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting on Sunday.

"Chancellor Merkel had been duelling with erstwhile ally Horst Seehofer (R) German Chancellor Angela Merkel has reached a deal on immigration to end a row which threatened to break up her four-month-old coalition government. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who leads her Bavarian CSU allies, has now dropped his threat to resign. Mrs Merkel agreed to tighten controls at the Austrian border to stop people who have applied for asylum in other EU countries from entering Germany. Transit centres will be set up to hold them until they can be sent back. Mrs Merkel described the deal as a good compromise after tough negotiation. But her centre-left Social Democrat (SPD) partners in the coalition voiced scepticism. Their spokesman on migration, Aziz Bozkurt, told the daily newspaper Die Welt that ""transit centres are in no way covered by the coalition agreement"". The SPD rejected a proposal for such centres in 2015, when the migrant numbers entering Bavaria from Austria were far higher than now. BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill writes: Angela Merkel has quelled the mutiny that threatened to destroy her coalition government. And, it seems, pacified her rebellious interior minister, who was still raging as he went into last-ditch emergency talks last night. Horst Seehofer, who also leads Mrs Merkel's Bavarian coalition partners, had snarled that he wasn't going to be thrown out by the woman he had put in power. Read Jenny Hill's analysis in full here. Mr Seehofer's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) is the Bavarian sister party of Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU). The CDU-CSU deal speaks of a ""new border regime"" in Bavaria. The Austrian government says it is seeking clarification of that, and it is preparing measures to protect its southern borders with Italy and Slovenia. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor By Laurence Peter, BBC News The deal raises various questions about fair treatment of asylum seekers, as well as questions about the functioning of Schengen -the EU's passport-free travel across internal borders. The idea of the new transit centres appears similar to the transit regime at airports, where travellers do not actually enter the country. But in many cases it may not be easy for Germany to identify which irregular migrants have already registered in another EU country. So how long will they have to stay in a transit centre? Such centres may well need tight security, to keep out people-smugglers and other criminals. Would such a closed regime encourage abuse of human rights, or turn them into prisons? There is much wrangling over EU asylum policy; it is being revised, so there are currently legal grey areas. Because of that, Mrs Merkel is making bilateral deals with EU partners. For example, Germany and Austria are both in the Schengen zone and, under its rules, they reimposed temporary border controls because of ""continuous secondary movements"" of migrants. That is, migrants who moved to Central Europe from the country where they first arrived. On Friday,the EU agreed to set up voluntary ""controlled centres"",externalacross the EU, to separate refugees - those entitled to international protection - from other migrants. Germany could argue that the planned transit centres comply with that deal. But the language used is vague, lacking detail; governments appear to be doing political quick fixes. Passau in Bavaria was on the frontline of Europe's 2015 migrant crisis Mr Seehofer had threatened unilaterally to empower border police to turn away migrants who had registered previously in another EU country. Mrs Merkel opposed any such unilateral action - she insisted on agreement with EU partners. Under her controversial open-door policy in 2015, more than one million migrants - many of them fleeing the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - entered Germany. Under the new deal, transit centres will screen migrants and send back those registered elsewhere - provided Germany has a bilateral agreement with the country concerned. That is a more regulated procedure than what Mr Seehofer had demanded. If there is no such bilateral agreement, a migrant will go back into Austria. But it is not clear whether Austria's screening procedures will mirror Germany's. Mrs Merkel says Greece and Spain have agreed to take back migrants stopped at the Bavarian-Austrian border who are proven to have entered their countries first. But Italy - where most irregular migrants arrive - does not want to take back migrants who reach Germany. The divisions within the German government reflect a bigger split in the EU over migration. The Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland - the Visegrad Group - refuse to accept any migrants from other EU countries.

"Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman is on trial at the Old Bailey A man accused of plotting to kill Theresa May has told the Old Bailey his alleged plans, including an attack from the edge of space, were a fantasy. Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, a 20-year-old originally from Walsall, denies preparing acts of terrorism last year. Speaking at the start of his defence, Mr Rahman said he faked support for attacks when he spoke online to a man. That man - who Mr Rahman thought was a commander from the Islamic State (IS) group - was an undercover officer. Earlier in the trial, the jury saw a secretly recorded video of Mr Rahman meeting an undercover officer, who was posing as an IS organiser, and asking for a bomb and suicide vest so that he could fight his way into Downing Street to kill the prime minister. On Monday, Mr Rahman told the jury his life had been turned upside down when he was arrested for sending a sexually explicit text message. He said that, after being thrown out of home, he was desperate to leave the UK. Mr Rahman was also grieving for an uncle who had died fighting alongside IS in Syria. He told the court: ""My uncle had said that if you join a sleeper cell, Islamic State will pay for your accommodation. ""I was desperate. When you're homeless, you're just thinking about a place to stay."" The jury heard that during the first online exchanges with the purported commander, Mr Rahman allegedly hoped to car-bomb Parliament, even though he could not drive. He then said: ""I learned in science, when I was younger, of a kafir [disbeliever] who went into space in a high altitude hot air balloon. ""If you sent hot air balloons above the altitude planes could reach, and have brothers with missiles above, God willing you can drop them."" The undercover officer replied: ""That is a good idea, we never thought about that before."" Ali Bajwa QC, defending, asked his client if any of his ideas were serious. ""I was showing off,"" said Mr Rahman. ""I was mentioning the most extravagant line possible that I could think of. ""It was a fantasy. Just ideas, nothing more. I felt like he was encouraging me. ""Why did you want to be put in a sleeper cell?"" asked Mr Bhajwa. ""So I would have a place to sleep,"" replied Mr Rahman. The trial continues.

"OCR's GCSE version of Romeo and Juliet departed from the text The exam board OCR faces a six-figure fine for an error in last year's GCSE English exam which rewrote Shakespeare. Thepaper confused the family of a key character, Tybalt, in The Bard's Romeo and Juliet, suggesting he is a Montague when in fact he is a Capulet. At the time,students took to Twitter to vent their scorn for the examiners. Now England's exams regulator Ofqualhas announced that it intends to fine OCR Â£175,000,externalas the error meant the paper was ""not fit for purpose"". The question asked students: ""How does Shakespeare present the ways in which Tybalt's hatred of the Capulets influences the outcome of the play?"" But, in fact, Tybalt is Juliet's cousin and so a Capulet himself, so the question should have referred to his hatred of the Montagues. Immediately after the exam, the board apologised, promising no candidates would lose out - but head teachers said the error was ""serious"" and would have caused stress and concern to candidates, undermining their confidence during a high-stakes exam. The paper required candidates to answer one of two Romeo and Juliet questions. Students complained the error had distracted them and led them to waste time on a question the board later admitted was ""unanswerable"". Ofqual's investigation confirmed candidates' confusion. ""Some started a response to the question as written, then crossed out that response and began a response to the question as if it had referenced hatred of the Montagues,"" says the report. ""Some started a response to question four, then stopped and completed a response to Question five,"" it adds. Govia Thameslink provides taxis to get pupils to GCSE exams The 'myth' of the visual learner How do the new 9-1 GCSE grades work? A total of 14,261 students sat the paper in May 2017. Of these,  up to 5,000 answered questions on the play, split equally between the two questions, the investigation found. The report says the mistake ""was introduced during the process of setting the assessment"" and the board ""did not identify or remedy the error"" before the exam. ""As a result, Ofqual considers OCR failed when it set the assessment to ensure the content of that assessment was fit for purpose."" The report says the error was ""likely to have a serious adverse impact on public confidence in qualifications"", particularly because it happened during the first year of examinations of the new tougher GCSEs. The report says that although OCR acted to mitigate the effects of the error on 2,735 candidates, some of these, namely those who had focused their revision on Romeo and Juliet and had expected to do particularly well on this section, may still have lost out. OCR says it has no plans to contest the fine. In a statement, a  spokeswoman again apologised to students, teachers and parents, adding that the board had revised its ""system of checks, based on extensive research, with the aim of improving the quality of our question papers"".

"Jodie Whittaker is the first female actor to play Doctor Who The BBC has asked a US court to compel a California-based website to produce records which could identify who leaked footage of the next Doctor Who series. A 53-second clip featuring the new Doctor Jodie Whittaker and two still images of the actor were shared via Tapatalk a week ago. BBC Studios said it takes ""theft and illegal distribution of our content extremely seriously"". The BBC has filed an application with the California Federal Court. Tapatalk is not accused of any wrongdoing, and users who upload copyrighted materials violate its terms and conditions. A spokesman added that BBC Studios ""will strive to protect our programme-makers, audiences and licence fee payers from any breaches of security - ensuring Doctor Who fans enjoy the final and fully completed version of the episode when it premieres"". BBC Studios began an investigation as soon as it was made aware of the unauthorised leak. It is understood the unfinished clip had temporary music and had not gone through the process which determines the final visual look of the scene. That may help investigators identify the part of the production chain where the leak originated before it was uploaded using Tapatalk. This video can not be played Jodie Whittaker: ""It feels incredibly epic, and the ambition is wonderful"" It also appears that a small number of individuals on a different online platform, Discord, which is often used by gaming communities, had seen and discussed the short scene almost a week before it leaked publicly. BBC Studios moved quickly to ensure the Tapatalk link was disabled and to remove the clip from social media platforms and video sharing sites. Some fans online have speculated that the BBC may have planned to show a finished version of the clip at San Diego Comic-Con. Jodie Whittaker and other members of the cast and crew are due to make an appearance at the convention later this month. It is not the first time that Doctor Who material has appeared online earlier than planned. In 2014BBC Worldwide apologisedafter scripts and footage from the series were accidentally placed on a publicly accessible server. And in 2005 an individual whoallegedly leaked the first episode,externalof the revived drama was sacked following an investigation. Jodie Whittaker is the first female actor to play the Doctor and her first series of 10 episodes is due to be broadcast in the autumn.

"Alesha MacPhail was reported missing on Monday morning The body of a missing schoolgirl has been found on the Isle of Bute. A member of the public discovered a child's body in woodland at about 09:00 on Monday and police believe it is six-year-old Alesha MacPhail who was reported missing two-and-a-half hours earlier. An investigation has begun and detectives are treating the death as unexplained. The body was discovered in the grounds of a former hotel on Ardbeg Road. Police guard a cordon at the house where Alesha was believed to have been staying Det Supt Stuart Houston from Police Scotland's major investigation teams said: ""This death of a six-year-old child has shocked the tight-knit community of Rothesay and it is imperative that we find out what has happened. ""This investigation is at its very early stages however I am appealing for information in order to piece together Alesha's last known movements. ""We know that once the alarm was raised about her being missing, there were a number of local people who assisted with the search. ""I would like to speak to anyone who was involved in that searchÂ who has not yet been spoken to by the police. This is to ensure that everyone that was in the vicinity of Ardbeg Road at the time Â is traced as they may have critical information which could assist with the investigation."" Houses have been sealed off in Ardbeg He also wanted to reassure the people of Rothesay: ""I must reiterate that this death is still being treated as unexplained at this time, however, I would like to reassure the public that this type of incident is rare,"" he said. ""I understand that there are real concerns in the community, however, please be assured that a team of detectives are working on this investigation to ascertain the circumstances leading up to death of this young child. Specially trained officers are supporting the family during this incredibly difficult time. ""If anyone has any information please contact police with that information. You might think it is insignificant, however, please let us be the judge of that, and contact us immediately."" The schoolgirl was staying in a house in Ardbeg Road before she disappeared John Morrison, a local property developer, was shocked at the news. He told the BBC: ""When I came out here about three hours ago, first I saw the police barriers about 500 yards back on the road. ""When I went down into my site I got a phone call from my partner telling me a wee girl had been missing and she had been found dead. It was a horrible shock. ""Then just after that more police started to come, men in the white suits, and a van full of police who I take it had been searching earlier. ""The rumour was she had been found in the Kyles Hydro Estate which is over at the back."" The police presence increased after the body was found Mr Morrison said the community had been affected by what happened: ""Terrible, terrible. We are going to know the family or someone connected with them,"" he said. ""It brings it right home, it is such a shock. I feel so sorry for the family at this moment in time."" Well-wishers have started to leave flowers near the police cordon. The police spokeswoman said: ""At around 06:25, police were informed a six-year-old girl was missing. ""A search was undertaken to try and locate the child. ""At around 09:00 the body of a young female child was discovered in the grounds of an old hotel.

"Ava-May Littleboy, aged three, was thrown from an inflatable trampoline at Gorleston beach A three-year-old girl thrown from an inflatable trampoline on a beach died from a head injury, a post-mortem examination has found. Witnesses described how people tried to catch Ava-May Littleboy when the inflatable ""exploded"" on Gorleston beach, Norfolk on Sunday. Ava-May, who died in hospital, had been at the beach with members of her family. Her family, from Suffolk, said she could ""light up the darkest rooms"". In a statement, they added: ""She was not your ordinary little girl. Anyone that met her would not want to forget her."" Ava-May Littleboy was thrown from the blue trampoline, pictured to the right Norfolk Police said a Home Office post-mortem examination took place on Monday and found Ava-May had died of a head injury, but that further investigation would take place to confirm this. A police spokesman said the cordon in the area would remain in place while specialists examine the scene and the inflatable play equipment. Are children safe on bouncy inflatables? Reality Check: What are the rules on bouncy castles? Zoe Dye, who was on the beach at the time with her daughter, said: ""Literally, it was just screams from everyone on the beach. It was almost like slow motion. [The] poor little girl was in the air. ""No-one could do anything. People were trying their hardest to catch her and she just dropped."" Ava-May's family has set up a fundraising campaign to raise money for a bench to go on the playing field near their home in Somersham. Speaking to the BBC, her grandmother Angela Littleboy said she ""loved to be outside and play"". ""She was her own little character, she was cheeky, funny, the best leg-hugger ever,"" she said. ""She loved everything, loved everybody, everyone was her best friend. She was a beautiful and bright little girl."" Mrs Littleboy added that the family was still ""very numb"" after Ava-May's death but was ""absolutely overwhelmed"" by the love and support shown by others. The online appeal has raised more than Â£8,000. This video can not be played Witnesses said the inflatable exploded and threw the girl into the air Downing Street has described the incident as a ""terrible accident and a tragic loss of life"". The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""The HSE [Health and Safety Executive] are looking into it, they are the right people to do so. ""We need to wait for that investigation to be completed."" In 2016,a seven-year-old girl died when a bouncy castle broke free from its mooringsin high winds in Harlow. Following Ava-May's death,there have been calls for a temporary ban on bouncy castles and inflatables in public areas. Harlow MP Robert Halfon wants an ""urgent investigation"" into their regulation. He said: ""There should be a temporary ban on bouncy castles and inflatables in public areas until we can ensure they are safe. ""These are two tragic deaths of two beautiful little children in the space of a few years and there needs to be an urgent investigation in the regulation and inspection regimes. ""You cannot risk a tragedy like this happening again."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The owner of the play equipment on Gorleston's Lower Esplanade, Curt Johnson, said: ""We are in complete shock and send our deepest condolences to the family. ""We are in bits and totally devastated; we can't sleep, can't eat, feel sick to the core."" Teddy bears and flowers have been left beside the perimeter fence which surrounds the play area. One message read: ""Taken too soon. Thinking of all your family. Such a sad loss. Sleep tight angel."" People have been leaving tributes on the beach Supt Roger Wiltshire, of Norfolk Police, said it was too early to speculate whether the hot weather was the cause of the explosion. ""We've got experts from all around the country coming to help us with all aspects of this investigation,"" he said. ""I'm a dad myself and you just can't imagine what they would be going through. ""You come to a seaside town like Great Yarmouth and Gorleston for a day out... and as a dad, we've spent many hours standing by a bouncy castle watching the kids jump up and down."" The HSE said it would be providing ""specialist assistance"" to the investigation, which is being led by the police and Great Yarmouth Borough Council.

"Despite being (possibly) the world's cuddliest creature, the super-sweet koala is also one of the unluckiest animals on the planet. Australia's most famous tree hugger has been ravaged by sexually transmitted disease, attacks from dogs, being hit by cars and habitat loss. Chlamydia has spread fast in koalas, causing infertility and blindness. But scientists saydecoding the genome,externalshould lead to an effective vaccine for the STD. Australia pledges cash to save koalas Australian zoo welcomes rare white koala Koala survives 16km ride on car axle In fact, researchers say they've been amazed by the information that's been hidden in the marsupial's DNA. While they didn't find a gene for cuteness, they've worked out how koalas can survive solely on a diet of eucalyptus - which poisons most other creatures that consume it. Genes that are switched on in the koala's ""cast-iron livers"" appear to be responsible for the ability to detoxify the leaves. This video can not be played Koala Chlamydia vaccine possible with DNA study Their DNA also equips them with powerful senses of smell and taste that allow them to sniff out the leaves with the most water in them; koalas will eat only those with at least 55% water content. However, one of the great hopes from this five-year gene project is that scientists will be able to develop a vaccine against chlamydia, something which is present in the vast majority of the species. Chlamydia is a horrid infection in koalas. In addition to blindness and infertility, koalas endure something called ""dirty tail"", a painful inflammation of the urinary tract that often results in the animal's death. Researchers have tested vaccines in the past but say the new information will speed up the process. ""The genome absolutely brings a vaccine closer,"" lead author Prof Rebecca Johnson from the Australian Museum Research Institute told BBC News. ""It's really critical information to continue the development of a chlamydial vaccine."" ""If you think about the advances that have been made in human medicine following the sequencing of the genome, we're at the point in humans where you can sequence an individual and tailor-make the medicine based on their genome. ""That's now the position we are in for koalas, having all that information at our fingertips."" Prof Rebecca Johnson from the Australian Museum Research Institute has led the five-year project to sequence the koala genome Koalas are recognised as an iconic species around the world - not just in Australia. There is a great deal of anxiety about the survival of the koala because of its biological uniqueness, as a symbol for preservation and also because of their value as a tourist attraction (they're worth around A$1.5bn). Experts say there are around 329,000 koalas alive in Australia today, but this is just a fraction of the population that existed in the middle of the 19th century. Demand for their furs saw millions killed between 1870 and the late 1920s. Since then, they have been classed as ""vulnerable"" by the Australian government. The clearing of woodland habitats that koalas favour to make way for settlements, collisions with road vehicles and increased stress from climate change are among the pressures that arise from human activity. A genome is the biological set of instructions required to make you, me and every living thing, including koalas. It is written in a chemical code called DNA. Genes are short sections of this DNA which serve as the templates for proteins. Humans have around 20,000 genes, but the koala genome is slightly larger. The genome contains all the information needed to build a person, including obvious traits such as their hair and eye colour. The koala is also a test case for the use of genetic information as a means of conserving species. As well as helping scientists develop new vaccines for diseases like chlamydia, understanding the koala's genetic make-up will allow researchers to compare different populations. This could perhaps help them move some creatures to prevent inbreeding and assist them with developing more effective immune systems against major threats. Yes and no. Female koalas are highly promiscuous, while males spend a lot of their (few) waking hours fighting with others for the right to mate. Most males have scars from their battles on their arms, faces and ears. Koalas also inherit chlamydia, catching it while they are developing in their mum's pouch. The most common and deadly strain of chlamydia that affects koalas is different to the one that hits humans. Despite the urban myth thatmembers of One Direction had contracted the illness,externalfrom the animals during a photo shoot in Australia, there are no documented cases of humans catching chlamydia from the cuddly critters. The are one of the main contenders for the title. The creatures have developed hard cartilage along their back. Over time, this becomes a groove that lets them wedge their bottoms into the fork of a tree. Which is just as well, since Koalas sleep for up to 19 hours a day. They spend the rest of the time eating, and about four minutes a day travelling! The researchers have learned how baby koalas survive being born without an immune system. The youngsters are born after just 35 days gestation and are roughly the size of a kidney bean. They gain protection against infections through their mother's milk. Genes allow koala mums to fine-tune milk protein production for different stages of development during the six months the baby will spend in her pouch. You can find koalas in eucalyptus forests all along Australia's Great Dividing Range which runs along the whole of the east coast of Australia with populations in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In Queensland, you can hold a koala, but in New South Wales you can only pat them. Outside Australia you'll find koalas in zoos in places as diverse as San Diego, Budapest and Edinburgh. The scientists also say that having advanced genetic information will benefit long term conservation efforts. Koala numbers are set to shrink considerably in the next few years. ""Some populations are set to decline up to 50% in the next three koala generations, which is only 20 years,"" says Prof Rebecca Johnson. The team members hope that the genetic information can be used to move koala populations around, helping them resist disease and avoid inbreeding. They might look fluffy and cute, but they have been known to bite and have sharp claws. ""You probably want to stay away from them and admire them from afar,"" says Prof Johnson. ""I wouldn't want to pick a wild one up under any circumstances. I don't think they'll thank you for it.""

"Thomas Abell was one of the first firefighters to arrive at the building on the night of the fire A firefighter has told how he persuaded a man not to attempt an ""impossible"" climb down the outside of Grenfell Tower to escape the fire. Thomas Abell noticed a resident in an upper level flat who had tied bed-sheets together which he was going to use to rappel down the building. He shouted to the man until he was satisfied he was not going to exit via the window, an inquiry heard. Mr Abell has since met the man, Oluwaseun Talabi, who ran to safety. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire The Grenfell Inquiry podcast: Firefighters O'Beirne and Abell Mr Abell said climbing down the building would have been ""an impossible and deadly task"". ""I was concerned for this male's safety, and I also did not want other residents to follow this male's example of trying to rappel his way down the side of the building,"" he wrote in a statement published at the public inquiry. ""At one point this male was on the window sill of his apartment. ""I shouted as loudly as I could, I instructed him to stay where he was and not to try and exit the building via the window."" Mr Talabipreviously told the BBC how he was preparing to climb down from the 14th flooron the makeshift rope of tied-together bed-sheets, with his four-year-old daughter on his back. He later ran to safety through the stairwell. This video can not be played Oluwaseun Talabi describes his escape in a BBC interview two weeks after the fire Mr Abell also described how he helped rescue two men from a fifth-floor window using a ladder, which members of the public helped carry. In his statement, he wrote how he ""coached"" one of the men on to the ladder. He said: ""Understandably this took a bit of time as it was a daunting experience for the male, but slowly he managed to climb on the ladder and descended."" Justin O'Beirne, another firefighter, told the inquiry he was on the fifth floor of the tower and, by looking through a letterbox, saw the fire had spread to that floor.

"Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman is on trial at the Old Bailey A man accused of plotting to kill Theresa May has told the Old Bailey his alleged plans, including an attack from the edge of space, were a fantasy. Naa'imur Zakariyah Rahman, a 20-year-old originally from Walsall, denies preparing acts of terrorism last year. Speaking at the start of his defence, Mr Rahman said he faked support for attacks when he spoke online to a man. That man - who Mr Rahman thought was a commander from the Islamic State (IS) group - was an undercover officer. Earlier in the trial, the jury saw a secretly recorded video of Mr Rahman meeting an undercover officer, who was posing as an IS organiser, and asking for a bomb and suicide vest so that he could fight his way into Downing Street to kill the prime minister. On Monday, Mr Rahman told the jury his life had been turned upside down when he was arrested for sending a sexually explicit text message. He said that, after being thrown out of home, he was desperate to leave the UK. Mr Rahman was also grieving for an uncle who had died fighting alongside IS in Syria. He told the court: ""My uncle had said that if you join a sleeper cell, Islamic State will pay for your accommodation. ""I was desperate. When you're homeless, you're just thinking about a place to stay."" The jury heard that during the first online exchanges with the purported commander, Mr Rahman allegedly hoped to car-bomb Parliament, even though he could not drive. He then said: ""I learned in science, when I was younger, of a kafir [disbeliever] who went into space in a high altitude hot air balloon. ""If you sent hot air balloons above the altitude planes could reach, and have brothers with missiles above, God willing you can drop them."" The undercover officer replied: ""That is a good idea, we never thought about that before."" Ali Bajwa QC, defending, asked his client if any of his ideas were serious. ""I was showing off,"" said Mr Rahman. ""I was mentioning the most extravagant line possible that I could think of. ""It was a fantasy. Just ideas, nothing more. I felt like he was encouraging me. ""Why did you want to be put in a sleeper cell?"" asked Mr Bhajwa. ""So I would have a place to sleep,"" replied Mr Rahman. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Neymar's theatrics spark ridicule The headline read: 'Neymar has charmed Brazil, but annoyed the whole world'. That was how Brazilian newspaper Globo put it, capturing some of the mood around a man who once again combined the sublime and ridiculous like perhaps only he can. Neymar, the world's most expensive player, is arguably the last big global superstar left in this World Cup after exits for Argentina's Lionel Messi and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo. But for all his good performances - and on Monday he was once again vital inBrazil's 2-0 victory over Mexico in the last 16- there is still a sense that he remains widely unpopular among neutrals. His contribution was at times brilliant. There were stepovers, jinks into space, the clever backheel that set Brazil moving for the opening goal which he put away himself. There was also the petulance and the play-acting that, depending on your opinion, is either a cynical way to gain a minor advantage or reprehensible behaviour that erodes the values of football. It was bizarre to see how the game came to a standstill when Neymar orchestrated a major flashpoint with under 20 minutes to play. Listen to the latest World Cup Daily podcast This video can not be played Highlights: Brazil 2-0 Mexico When Mexico full-back Miguel Layun gently stepped on the Brazilian's ankle, Neymar began to wail and writhe as if it was a stamp, waving his arms to communicate great pain. It sucked everybody in: his team-mates, the Mexico players, the referee, his assistant, the fourth official, everyone became involved as the situation escalated. I turned to the German journalist next to me and he said: ""It's Neymar."" The bottom line for Neymar and Brazil of course is that they are through to the last eight to play Belgium on Friday at 19:00 BST. And the 26-year-old Paris St-Germain forward was voted Fifa's official man of the match. The winner of that award is always put up for interview. He was about to reply to a question about the incident with Layun when Brazil manager Tite interrupted and said: ""They stepped on him. I saw it on the screen."" Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio said: ""It is a shame for football, we wasted a lot of time because of one player"" Neymar then added: ""Look, I think it's more an attempt to undermine me than anything else. ""I don't care much for criticism, or praise, because it can influence your attitude. In the last two matches I didn't talk to the press because I didn't want to. ""I just have to play, help my team-mates, help my team."" As forMexico's manager Juan Carlos Osorio,he said after the game: ""It's a shame for all football. It's a negative example for the game, it's a charade."" Former Aston Villa striker Dion Dublin said on BBC Radio 5 live: ""I'm embarrassed for Neymar. ""He is one of the world's greatest players but when he rolls about on the floor, I just don't get it. Come on young man, you're better than that, get on with the game."" This video can not be played World Cup 2018: The good, the bad, and the Neymar Neymar is clearly one of the world's very best. Just consider some of the stats around his performances so far here in Russia. At this World Cup so far Neymar has: Attempted the most shots (23) and shots on target (12) Created the most clear goalscoring chances (16) Attempted the most dribbles 40 And suffered the most fouls (23) By sweeping in the opening goal against Mexico, he scored the sixth World Cup goal of his career. To reach that total he has required 38 attempts on goal. It took Messi 67 shots and Ronaldo 74 to reach the same tally. And yet on theBBC Sport player rater,he was awarded the lowest score of anyone on the pitch - 4.76. This despite scoring the opener and playing a big role in setting up the second for Roberto Firmino. There is so much reaction to Neymar: positive and negative. He has almost 100 million Instagram followers and a post immediately after the match had one million likes within 15 minutes of it being appearing. But another image has been shared extensively on Twitter since it first surfaced in reaction to Brazil's opening group game, a1-1 draw with Switzerlandin which Neymar reacted to a challenge by rolling dramatically on the floor. Eight numbered photos of the forward writhing around in apparent agony are accompanied by a caption that reads: How do you feel on the Neymar scale? Fans of Brazil - and fans of Neymar - will undoubtedly have their own scale by which to judge him. What will matter most to them is his ability to define games on the biggest stages. Perhaps his temperament is just an unavoidable by-product of his talent, or perhaps it works in symbiosis. In Brazil's second group match, a2-0 win over Costa Rica,we saw another bizarre insight into his inner workings. It happened when the referee, trying to defuse some tension, placed his hand on Neymar's arm. Neymar swiped the hand away and appeared to say: ""Don't touch me."" After that match, a victory secured by two injury-time goals, including one he scored himself, Neymar was extremely emotional and he broke down in tears. Was it the stress? The relief? The emotion of having moved closer to the World Cup's latter stages? Perhaps it was a combination that includes some influence of what happened four years ago, when Brazil were so devastatingly crushed by Germany on home soil in the semi-finals. Neymar himself was absent from that7-1 defeat- having been injured by a bad challenge from Juan Camilo Zuniga in a quarter-final victory over Colombia. That is the round that Brazil have now reached again - for the seventh consecutive tournament they are in the last eight. What happens next for this team will depend to a large extent on its star player and whether he can find his very best, however he goes about it.

"This video can not be played The making of England's Kane Club legend. England captain. World Cup Golden Boot winner? With 108 goals in 153 Premier League games, Harry Kane has firmly established himself as one of the division's leading strikers. Now, handed the armband by manager Gareth Southgate, the 24-year-old has set his sights on firing his country to glory on the global stage. He is already this World Cup's leading scorer with five goals from two games, and will be the player England look to for inspiration when they face Colombia in the last 16 on Tuesday. From being rejected by Arsenal and Watford as a youngster to learning his trade on loan in the Football League, the Tottenham player has earned his spot in the limelight. Those who know him best tell BBC Sport how he did it. Harry Kane with older brother Charlie and, right, with David Beckham and now fiancee Katie Goodland When a six-year-old Harry Kane arrived for trials with Ridgeway Rovers in 1999, the youth side - who a generation earlier had produced David Beckham - thought they had found themselves a new goalkeeper. Dave Bricknell, former Ridgeway Rovers coach and now Tottenham scout:""We're doing a little shooting session, and I ask for a lad who can go in goal. ""This little boy puts his hand up and says: 'I'll go in goal.' We give him some gloves, and he performs heroics - makes some fantastic saves. He's tipping it round the post, tipping a couple over the bar. ""I'm thinking this is great, we've got a goalkeeper. And then this woman came up to me and said he's better on the pitch. ""We put him on pitch and he smacked goals in left, right and centre. So he ends up being our centre-forward."" Kane and his Ridgeway Rovers team-mates' goalscoring exploits were recorded in a notebook Kane's prolific form for Ridgeway Rovers and his Waltham Forest district side caught the attention of professional scouts. Arsenal initially snapped up the youngster but decided not to keep him, while Watford also passed up the opportunity to sign Kane. Trevor Bailey, Kane's manager at Waltham Forest:""Harry could have done nothing all game, but if that chance came up it was in the onion bag. ""He was always on the move up front. When he got a chance, guaranteed four out of five he was going to score or set someone up."" Bricknell:""Even when he was six, Harry could hit the ball like a 10 or 11-year-old. He could strike it clean, with both feet, he didn't worry which side it was coming to him. ""He could see a pass, he could play. He had good touch, but his main attribute was he had major confidence in himself. ""He would score lots of goals, but if it went wide he wouldn't worry about it - he'd just go and get his next chance and try to score again. ""He had a couple of seasons and the scouts started turning up. Arsenal took a couple of our boys in, and he got signed as an under-nine."" Alex Welsh, former academy coach at Arsenal:""I first met Harry in the academy and he was a very competent goalkeeper, but his real desire was to score goals. ""I am absolutely convinced that is the reason why he is such a clinical striker - he intuitively knows what the goalkeeper doesn't like. ""He shoots early when the goalkeeper's not set, he shoots around players, through legs, all the things a goalkeeper hates."" Bricknell:""I believe he was second top-scorer at Arsenal behind Benik Afobe, and then for some reason they decided at 11 years of age that they didn't want him anymore."" PE teacher Mark Leadon said Kane was a ""real team player"" and ""wasn't one to keep the ball if a pass was on"" Kane attended Larkswood Primary Academy before moving to Chingford Foundation School, where he was inevitably the star of the football team. But, as a dedicated student, Kane impressed his teachers across the board. Mark Leadon, Kane's PE teacher:""Aged 11 Harry was technically very gifted, with a great first touch, and a very clever player. He always knew where to go, right from an early stage. ""He was also a very good cricketer - he opened the bowling from year seven to 10 and batted at four or five. But he loved football. He was never a prima donna, and he would always put a shift in. Some students think they're better than others, but not him. ""What came through more than anything else was his determination to succeed. That work ethic was clear. Even as a youngster, you could see he was driven through not just sports but all other subjects. ""He was a model student. He excelled at sport, but any teacher in any subject would not have a bad word about Harry. He was very conscientious. Across the board he was a very dedicated boy."" Luke Robinson, Kane's childhood friend and team-mate:""The only thing on his mind was football, and his family were behind him. ""We used to have a laugh, a couple of games of Fifa, but he was always driven. He'd always keep himself to himself. ""He loved David Beckham, he came in with the Mohican, everyone was laughing but he loved it. He loved football, 24/7, he lived and breathed football. ""You get to 15, 16 and you've got girls, drinks, partying - you'd see Harry jogging around the park, doing his exercise, playing football, watching football, just studying the whole game."" Kane joined Tottenham as an 11-year-old and signed professional terms on his 16th birthday in 2009 It was Tottenham Hotspur who offered Kane hope after his earlier disappointments, but the future England captain was by no means the pick of the bunch for his age group. However, at school level he was already showing the signs of maturity and leadership that have come to the fore in Russia just under a decade later. Alex Inglethorpe, former Tottenham youth-team coach:""When I joined Spurs as under-18 coach, Harry was 13. Part of my remit was to work with the under-14s, so every Wednesday evening we'd get together. ""I'd like to say he was the gold medallist in the group and we'd all spotted he was going to be the fantastic player, but I'd be lying. He probably wasn't even on the podium. ""He had a lovely technique - an ability to pass and receive and shoot - but if there was something that endeared him to you it was that he was very, very low maintenance. ""He had a lot of growth to come. He was quietly unassuming and had a desire to improve. He had attributes more around character and technique."" Leadon:""By Year 11 we managed his time more. Because we knew he was going to sign for Tottenham, we only played him in the big games - County Cup, Essex and London cups. ""We played without him in the Borough Cup, but we got to the final and were going to play our strongest team with Harry. ""He came to us and said he didn't think it was right, please could he be sub, because the guy in his place had done really well."" Kane's desire to learn and improve endeared him to the Tottenham academy staff and he signed scholarship terms with the club on his 16th birthday in July 2009. Inglethorpe:""It became fairly evident when Harry became a scholar he was someone who could finish. He wasn't great with his head and wasn't great on his left side, but he was his own best coach. ""He was wonderfully demanding to coach because he always wanted to stay out and do extra. ""It was always 'come on, five more' or 'just a few more finishes'. My role was a very easy one: it was to get the ball out of the bushes and start again. ""We just had to keep giving him opportunities to get good at what he needed - to get better at heading, get better on his left side. That obsession to improve is undoubtedly his greatest strength. ""It was probably around 16 he started having an impact on the youth team. We trusted him to come off the bench and have an impact - anywhere from right wing, number 10, centre-forward, sometimes in midfield."" Kane scored five goals during an 18-game loan spell at Leyton Orient in 2011 Having established himself as one of the most important players in Spurs' Under-18s side, and twice being named on the bench for the first team in cup games, the club's youth staff, including then under-21 coach Tim Sherwood, decided the next step for Kane was to gain experience on loan. League One Leyton Orient would be the young striker's first destination. The 17-year-old was handed his professional debut in January 2011 at Rochdale, coming on for veteran striker Scott McGleish. Kane would score five times in nine starts. McGleish:""Harry was not like other Premier League players, where you feel they're going to come in 'Billy Big Time'. He wanted the experience of learning what I call men's football. ""He could play the 18s and the 21s, but he wanted to learn - and from the word go he was ready to fight for his place. In training, he was willing to learn from everybody, and even more importantly willing to just knuckle down and work hard. ""You could see in training and subsequently the matches he had ability and a desire to go further, but you're still looking like a young 17-year-old: very slight, still needing to physically develop, not the quickest but technically excellent. ""He was ready to take the step down, to play in League One where it is a little bit more physical rather than technical."" Kane was named Millwall's young player of the season With a spell of first-team football under his belt, Kane was given his chance at Tottenham. The 18-year-old missed a penalty against Hearts on his debut at White Hart Lane, but played six times in the Europa League before Christmas and eventually got off the mark against Shamrock Rovers. Spurs opted to send the teenager out on loan again in January 2012, to Championship strugglers Millwall. Kane's nine goals helped save Kenny Jackett's side from relegation. Former Millwall defender Alan Dunne:""I've seen a lot of players come to the Den and freeze, because within five minutes they're being called names they've never heard before and they can't cope with that pressure. ""But it didn't faze him - he was a focused lad, he was confident in his ability. It was a challenge to him, and a challenge he rose to. ""Harry realised at Millwall you need to have a little bit of aggression in you, have a little bit of pride and show you want to wear the shirt."" Sherwood:""I used to watch Harry a lot at Millwall, and it was an intimidating atmosphere. I remember overhearing one of our scouts come and talk to Harry Redknapp - who was Spurs manager at the time - and say: 'We need to get Harry Kane out of Millwall, it's no good for him there.' ""I went straight in and said: 'This is the perfect atmosphere for him. We don't want him to be in a comfortable environment, we want him to be playing under pressure all of the time.'"" Harry Kane and future England team-mate Jamie Vardy on the substitutes' bench for Leicester during the 2012-13 Championship season After making his Premier League debut for Tottenham in August 2012, Kane was sent on loan again. The 19-year-old only made three appearances in the top flight for Norwich because of injury, so after a brief spell back at Spurs he joined Championship promotion hopefuls Leicester. Dunne:""Leicester came to the Den. We were winning 1-0. I remember Kane coming on and I thought, 'right, this could be trouble'. ""I jogged over for a whisper in his ear. 'Harry, you go near that ball and I'm gonna smash youâ¦' ""He didn't really look at me. He didn't even shrug his shoulders. I kept trying to wind him up and wind him up and I couldn't get anything from him."" Kane, and future England team-mate Jamie Vardy, found starts limited at Leicester with Chris Wood and David Nugent Nigel Pearson's first-choice strike partnership. But that summer he was picked for England's Under-20 World Cup squad, drawing comparisons with former Tottenham and England forward Teddy Sheringham. Former England Under-20 coach Peter Taylor:""The impression I got was firstly what a nice boy you are, and secondly that you're not going to have regrets at the end of your career, because you're going to give it everything you have to be a player. ""I've dealt with League One and League Two players, and you might have to keep reminding them about things. Harry you only had to tell once. He's a very intelligent player. ""He would enjoy every training session, but only if it had reason. Teddy Sheringham used to be like that. 'Why are we doing this?' Harry thought about every session. ""I would be amazed if he didn't finish every season and say: 'Right, what did I do well, what could I have done better?'"" Kane scored the first of his 108 Premier League goals for Tottenham in a win over Sunderland in April 2014 After four loan spells in three seasons, Kane spent the entire 2013-14 campaign with Tottenham. But it was not until April, after Andre Villas-Boas had been sacked and replaced by Sherwood, that a 20-year-old Kane was handed his first Premier League start for Spurs, scoring his first top-flight goal in the process against Sunderland and also netting in the following two games against West Brom and Fulham. Sherwood:""It didn't feel a gamble at all to give Harry that start. It was almost overdue to be honest. ""Roberto Soldado was in front of him in the team, and nobody wanted Roberto to do well more than me - but every single day in training Harry was outperforming him. ""After probably three weeks, I decided I had to make that change and I had to bring Harry into the team. He didn't let me down. ""Harry wanted to get the top, and nothing was going to stop him achieving that because of the ability, desire and mentality he possesses. ""He needed to work on sharpening his feet up around the box, so we spent a lot of time doing sessions where he had to move his feet a little bit quicker, open the space and shoot off both sides. ""But he also had that knack of being aware of players around him, and the intelligence to slide people in. He could see a pass and he could execute it. ""I was the biggest believer Harry Kane ever had, because I used to think he was a mix between Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer. It's a big accolade, but I think it's the right one."" The rest is history in the making... Kane scored 21 top-flight goals the following season - earning his first England call-up in March 2015 - adding 25 and 29 in the next two campaigns to claim successive Premier League Golden Boot awards, and netting 30 times last time out. Five years ago he was sitting on the bench for Leicester in the Championship, now Kane leads his country into the last 16 of the World Cup. Bricknell:""It didn't really work out at Norwich or Leicester, but it didn't affect his confidence. He came back to Spurs, played a couple of games, missed a penalty - some kids would crumble. He's shown tremendous resolve to get where he is today."" Inglethorpe:""I'm not a believer in it all being natural. I believe in working talent, and Harry is a working talent. It's like any skill; if you're determined to acquire it, you will. ""He is someone who has realised if you want to score a volume of goals, you have to be able to score with right foot, left foot, one on one, outside the box, inside the box, with your head. He's taught himself to do that - and he's still as obsessive now as he was then."" Tottenham and England team-mate Danny Rose:""I see him every day. I get to see how hard he works. It's going to be very exciting to see the records he's going to break, not only in this competition but in the Premier League, and he deserves everything he gets."" Robinson:""We used to play in the playground and everyone wanted to be David Beckham.

"Rescue workers have deployed drilling machinery to try and create a new access point to the cave Last Saturday, 12 young boys went to explore a cave with their coach after football practice in northern Thailand. Their bikes were found abandoned at the entrance and shortly after, heavy rain sent torrents of water through the cave. Over the past week, rescuers have been mounting an increasingly desperate search, in the hope the group are alive deep inside the cave but trapped by floodwaters. Here's what the operation, in the jungle-covered hills around Chiang Rai, involves: Thai navy divers have been trying to access the deepest caverns of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, the fourth longest in Thailand. Four top British cave divers, along with some US military personnel, also joined the efforts. A Facebook photo shows the coach with what is thought to be his football team The divers are swimming through tiny spaces and cannot risk going too far into flooded passages or they risk running out of air. The search has been frustrated by rushing water and near darkness inside the cave. Debris and mud leaves divers with almost no visibility; they can only see a few centimetres in front of them. It's been described as like swimming through cold coffee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Powerful industrial water pumps, put in place to reduce the water level inside the cave, have struggled to combat relentless rains. With the entrance flooded, pumping was halted on Thursday and divers forced to stop their search intermittently. Rescue efforts shifted to finding other ways to access - and reduce water in - the cave. 'Come home': Thailand clings to hope for lost boys What you need to do to survive underground That has involved drilling through rock to drain water, so the divers could resume the search - although the thickness of the cave's wall has made this difficult. Another option would be to drill into the cave to create a new route to try to reach the boys. But finding an area on the densely jungle-covered and muddy mountainside for the heavy machinery required, while ensuring surrounding rock does not collapse, makes the idea of drilling a hole to access the cave an impractical one. Other technology has aided the massive human search effort which includes the military, police and hundreds of volunteers. Drones equipped with thermal cameras have been flown over Tham Luang to detect possible access points. An underwater robot was deployed to send information back on the water depth and condition of the cave. No technology exists to scan for people deep underground. There are plans to send cameras down to try to work out the next step and potentially to make contact with the missing group. The animals have helped survey teams investigate the area above the cave complex, which is several kilometres long, searching for possible ways in. The dogs were brought to the site after smelling clothing belonging to the missing children, news agency AFP reported. Soldiers carried large hoses into the cave in an effort to drain rising flood waters Relatives of the missing have camped outside the cave since they went missing on 23 June. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha arrived at the site to speak with them on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dozens of ""survival boxes"" containing food, maps and mobile phones were to be sent into the cave on Friday, according to the police. They plan to drop the boxes into any openings they find in the limestone rock on the mountains above the caves, and, if they do not find the missing boys, to float them on underground rivers in the hope they might reach them. A police team was able to descend one such hole, discovered by two of the British caving team, and discovered a large chamber, which may take them into part of the cave complex Police Col Kraiboon Sotsong told reporters the boxes contained a message telling whoever found it to float the box back out. ""The note says: 'If received, then reply and show on the map where you are. Everybody will quickly help."" Thailand has deployed more than 1,000 people - including soldiers, divers and special forces - to search for the team When they are found, the operation to get the group out of the cave will be long. Experts say it could take weeks, if they are found alive, to bring them to safety. Heavy rains at this time of year mean long passages might well remain continuously flooded for months. Earlier in the week local officials said rescue teams were preparing to train the boys and their coach to use scuba gear, in case they had to dive out through flooded areas of the cave. But navigating their way out would be incredibly difficult and it's more likely food and supplies would be sent in while work continued to find another entrance.

"After nine days, the group of boys and their coach have finally been found After nine days trapped in darkness in a cave in Thailand, 12 boys and their football coach have been found alive. Two British divers found all 13 safe in a cavern in the Tham Luang cave system in the northern Chiang Rai province. But the issue now is to get them all out of the cave with rising waters and mud hindering access and the trapped group's health a major concern. The army saysthe group might have to wait in the cave for up to four months for floods to recede. So what are the options to free the youngsters and their coach? This video can not be played Finding the Thai cave boys and getting them out Missing Thai boys found alive in caves What to do to survive underground ""The option to bring them out by diving is the quickest but it's also the most dangerous,"" Anmar Mirza, national co-ordinator of the US Cave Rescue Commission, told the BBC. Thai navy divers, three top British cave divers and US military personnel all attempted to find the boys. In total, more than 1,000 people have been involved in the operation, including teams from China, Myanmar, Laos and Australia. Oxygen tanks were prepared for divers outside the cave complex These skilled professional divers still needed several hours to get to the trapped group from the entrance, through tiny, debris-strewn passages and aided by round-the-clock water pumping efforts to try to clear the flood waters. And these boys are not trained divers. Edd Sorenson, regional co-ordinator in Florida for the International Underwater Cave Rescue and Recovery Organisation, told the BBC the diving option is ""extremely dangerous and hazardous"", saying he would consider it ""an absolute last resort"". ""Having somebody in zero visibility that's not familiar with... that kind of extreme conditions, it's real easy and very likely that they would panic, and either kill themselves and/ or the rescuers."" Authorities have tried to drill holes in the cave walls to help drain some of the flood water - although the thick rock has hampered efforts. There have also been suggestions that drilling could be another way to get to the boys, and to help them out. But to even begin the process, new roads would need to be built up above the caves to accommodate the heavy drilling equipment needed to break through the rock. Authorities have tried to drill holes to let out flood waters On top of that, Mr Mirza explains you would need to have conducted a survey of the caves and to know them back to front before you could start drilling - otherwise there would be little chance of digging a hole in the correct place for the boys and their coach. ""It sounds easy but it's actually very difficult,"" he says. ""It's a needle in a haystack problem."" In a press conference, Chiang Rai governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said they would continue to drain water out of the cave while sending doctors and nurses in to check the health of the boys and their coach. ""If the doctors say their physical condition is strong enough to be moved, they will take them out from the cave,"" he said. But Mr Mirza says their health is a serious concern. ""After nine days without food, you have to watch their food intake,"" he says. Authorities have set up a temporary hospital near the cave entrance in preparation to handle the trapped team People deprived of food can suffer ill-health effects if not properly reintroduced to food - sometimes as severe as heart failure or comas. Mr Mirza says if the group are on high ground, safe from flooding, and can be resupplied there that might be a good option for now. Their ill-health ""significantly compromises the rescue effort,"" he says. Mr Sorenson agrees. ""I think they would be better off bringing in food, water, filtration systems, oxygen if the air space needs it and requires it"", he says. ""They have lights and hope now, so I think waiting it out, as long as they can get supplies in there to make them comfortable and warm and fed and hydrated.""

"Could Belgium's World Cup run bring unity to a divided nation? Language is an essential part of playing football. Coaches give instructions to players and teammates talk to each other on the pitch. How, one may wonder, does Belgium's multilingual team communicate? Sources say the players speak neither Dutch nor French but English in the changing room, to avoid the perception of favouring one language over another. They also speak English on the pitch, much to the surprise of many in the UK press during their game with England on Thursday night. A majority of Belgians are Dutch-speakers who live in the Flemish north. Most of the rest speak French, and there is a small German-speaking community. This divide can be seen in the mother tongues of the Belgian national team's star players. Manchester City's playmaker Kevin De Bruyne is a Dutch-speaker from Ghent in the Flemish region, while Chelsea attacker Eden Hazard is a French-speaker from the Walloon region. Spain's Roberto Martinez now manages the linguistically diverse Belgian national team The issue of language and the Belgium football team has come up before. In a 2014 news conference, defender Thomas Vermaelen and Axel Witsel spoke different languages, Vermaelen in Dutch and Witsel in French. A spokesman for the Belgian Football Association told the New York Times that they ""organise interviews separately for the French and Flemish speakers"". In many countries, this might be regarded as bizarre, but in Belgium, everything is divided along language lines - from political parties to schools, magazines and newspapers. The country also has a large number of migrants who speak neither Dutch nor French as a native language and so English can be used to integrate them too. In fact, the ethnic diversity of the team - several players are from migrant families - gives it an interesting mix of languages, and a wide range of linguistic ability. Antwerp-born striker Romelu Lukaku is famous for his fluency in six - Dutch, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese and Swahili - and team captain Vincent Kompany speaks five. But some of the French-speaking players are monolingual - they don't even speak Dutch. Critical window for learning a language The benefits of being bilingual Francophone Marouane Fellaini, now of Manchester United, was once described by ITV commentator Phil Neville as the worst English-speaker he'd ever come across. But despite almost all the players understanding French, ""English is often perceived as a 'safe middle ground'"", Dutch-speaking Belgian BBC journalist Suzanne Vanhooymissen says. ""By using English as a common language, organisations, and indeed the Belgian national team, cannot be accused of favouring either Dutch or French over the other and opening up simmering linguistic divides."" Switzerland is another multilingual country playing in this year's tournament. At home, four languages - German, French, Italian and Romansch - are spoken. Former defender Ramon Vega played for a multilingual Swiss team Ramon Vega played for the Swiss national team between 1993 and 2001. He says the language issue had proven divisive amongst players: ""The German, French and Italian guys all sat at separate tables for lunch and dinner."" ""Roy Hodgson [Switzerland's former coach] gave his team talks in French but would speak the language of that player when trying to get his message across to them,"" Vega says. ""Everyone understood each other but to be sure your message got across, you'd try to switch to that person's language."" But Belgian sensitivities mean that such an approach would be unwise for the Red Devils, as the national team is known. ""All Swiss language communities accept the notion of the Swiss nation, which is defined plurally,"" says nationalism expert Klaus-Jurgen Nagel of Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University. ""But this is not the case in Belgium where the narrative of the nation is contested. In Flanders, a lot of people define [themselves] in the first place as members of the Flemish nation, rather than as Belgians."" How do you start a country? Are cities the new countries? Growing up in a multilingual environment was advantageous to Ramon Vega, though. ""Having all these languages around me was useful when I moved to a new country as it taught me the valuable skills of patience and persistence,"" he recalls. ""When I came to London, I found it very difficult to understand some of my teammates' Cockney accents though."" How do you start a country?

"The Hollywood producer has pleaded not guilty to the first set of charges against him Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein is facing fresh sexual assault charges. They involve a third woman in a case dating back to 2006, prosecutors say. The film producer, aged 66, faces life in prison over the charges - one count of criminal sexual act and two of predatory sexual assault. Mr Weinstein had already been charged with rape and other sexual crimes in May against two women. He pleaded not guilty to those charges. Also, he has previously said via his lawyer that he has never had non-consensual sex. The new charges are punishable by a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum of life imprisonment. ""This indictment is the result of the extraordinary courage exhibited by the survivors who have come forward,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance  said in a statement. ""Our investigation continues."" Who has accused Weinstein of what? What has #MeToo actually changed? He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of either of the first offences relating to the first two women. The identity of one of the women whose accusations prompted the charges has been confirmed by her lawyer.

"The Hollywood producer has pleaded not guilty to the first set of charges against him Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein is facing fresh sexual assault charges. They involve a third woman in a case dating back to 2006, prosecutors say. The film producer, aged 66, faces life in prison over the charges - one count of criminal sexual act and two of predatory sexual assault. Mr Weinstein had already been charged with rape and other sexual crimes in May against two women. He pleaded not guilty to those charges. Also, he has previously said via his lawyer that he has never had non-consensual sex. The new charges are punishable by a minimum sentence of 10 years and a maximum of life imprisonment. ""This indictment is the result of the extraordinary courage exhibited by the survivors who have come forward,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance  said in a statement. ""Our investigation continues."" Who has accused Weinstein of what? What has #MeToo actually changed? He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of either of the first offences relating to the first two women. The identity of one of the women whose accusations prompted the charges has been confirmed by her lawyer.

"Despite being (possibly) the world's cuddliest creature, the super-sweet koala is also one of the unluckiest animals on the planet. Australia's most famous tree hugger has been ravaged by sexually transmitted disease, attacks from dogs, being hit by cars and habitat loss. Chlamydia has spread fast in koalas, causing infertility and blindness. But scientists saydecoding the genome,externalshould lead to an effective vaccine for the STD. Australia pledges cash to save koalas Australian zoo welcomes rare white koala Koala survives 16km ride on car axle In fact, researchers say they've been amazed by the information that's been hidden in the marsupial's DNA. While they didn't find a gene for cuteness, they've worked out how koalas can survive solely on a diet of eucalyptus - which poisons most other creatures that consume it. Genes that are switched on in the koala's ""cast-iron livers"" appear to be responsible for the ability to detoxify the leaves. This video can not be played Koala Chlamydia vaccine possible with DNA study Their DNA also equips them with powerful senses of smell and taste that allow them to sniff out the leaves with the most water in them; koalas will eat only those with at least 55% water content. However, one of the great hopes from this five-year gene project is that scientists will be able to develop a vaccine against chlamydia, something which is present in the vast majority of the species. Chlamydia is a horrid infection in koalas. In addition to blindness and infertility, koalas endure something called ""dirty tail"", a painful inflammation of the urinary tract that often results in the animal's death. Researchers have tested vaccines in the past but say the new information will speed up the process. ""The genome absolutely brings a vaccine closer,"" lead author Prof Rebecca Johnson from the Australian Museum Research Institute told BBC News. ""It's really critical information to continue the development of a chlamydial vaccine."" ""If you think about the advances that have been made in human medicine following the sequencing of the genome, we're at the point in humans where you can sequence an individual and tailor-make the medicine based on their genome. ""That's now the position we are in for koalas, having all that information at our fingertips."" Prof Rebecca Johnson from the Australian Museum Research Institute has led the five-year project to sequence the koala genome Koalas are recognised as an iconic species around the world - not just in Australia. There is a great deal of anxiety about the survival of the koala because of its biological uniqueness, as a symbol for preservation and also because of their value as a tourist attraction (they're worth around A$1.5bn). Experts say there are around 329,000 koalas alive in Australia today, but this is just a fraction of the population that existed in the middle of the 19th century. Demand for their furs saw millions killed between 1870 and the late 1920s. Since then, they have been classed as ""vulnerable"" by the Australian government. The clearing of woodland habitats that koalas favour to make way for settlements, collisions with road vehicles and increased stress from climate change are among the pressures that arise from human activity. A genome is the biological set of instructions required to make you, me and every living thing, including koalas. It is written in a chemical code called DNA. Genes are short sections of this DNA which serve as the templates for proteins. Humans have around 20,000 genes, but the koala genome is slightly larger. The genome contains all the information needed to build a person, including obvious traits such as their hair and eye colour. The koala is also a test case for the use of genetic information as a means of conserving species. As well as helping scientists develop new vaccines for diseases like chlamydia, understanding the koala's genetic make-up will allow researchers to compare different populations. This could perhaps help them move some creatures to prevent inbreeding and assist them with developing more effective immune systems against major threats. Yes and no. Female koalas are highly promiscuous, while males spend a lot of their (few) waking hours fighting with others for the right to mate. Most males have scars from their battles on their arms, faces and ears. Koalas also inherit chlamydia, catching it while they are developing in their mum's pouch. The most common and deadly strain of chlamydia that affects koalas is different to the one that hits humans. Despite the urban myth thatmembers of One Direction had contracted the illness,externalfrom the animals during a photo shoot in Australia, there are no documented cases of humans catching chlamydia from the cuddly critters. The are one of the main contenders for the title. The creatures have developed hard cartilage along their back. Over time, this becomes a groove that lets them wedge their bottoms into the fork of a tree. Which is just as well, since Koalas sleep for up to 19 hours a day. They spend the rest of the time eating, and about four minutes a day travelling! The researchers have learned how baby koalas survive being born without an immune system. The youngsters are born after just 35 days gestation and are roughly the size of a kidney bean. They gain protection against infections through their mother's milk. Genes allow koala mums to fine-tune milk protein production for different stages of development during the six months the baby will spend in her pouch. You can find koalas in eucalyptus forests all along Australia's Great Dividing Range which runs along the whole of the east coast of Australia with populations in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. In Queensland, you can hold a koala, but in New South Wales you can only pat them. Outside Australia you'll find koalas in zoos in places as diverse as San Diego, Budapest and Edinburgh. The scientists also say that having advanced genetic information will benefit long term conservation efforts. Koala numbers are set to shrink considerably in the next few years. ""Some populations are set to decline up to 50% in the next three koala generations, which is only 20 years,"" says Prof Rebecca Johnson. The team members hope that the genetic information can be used to move koala populations around, helping them resist disease and avoid inbreeding. They might look fluffy and cute, but they have been known to bite and have sharp claws. ""You probably want to stay away from them and admire them from afar,"" says Prof Johnson. ""I wouldn't want to pick a wild one up under any circumstances. I don't think they'll thank you for it.""

"Social media users have been sharing artwork showing their support for the boys Twelve young footballers and their coach have been trapped inside a cave in Thailand's Chiang Rai province for nearly a week. They went missing after apparently setting out to explore the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, accompanied by their 25-year-old coach. The huge search for the missing group - thought to have been cut off by rising floodwater - has gripped the country. Now Thais are turning to social media in an outpouring of support and hope. A hashtag, which translates to ""the strangers we want to meet the most"" is being used to convey the nation's concern for the group of boys, aged between 11 and 16. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played May: Brexit means Brexit does mean Brexit A new plan for post-Brexit customs arrangements will be a ""significant step forward"", a Downing Street source has promised. The proposal, to be presented to ministers on Friday, will offer ""the best of both worlds"" - an independent trade policy and friction-free trade, the source added. But no details have yet been revealed about how it will work. Ministers have so far failed to agree what type of customs model to pursue. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? Reality Check: The government's customs options Friday's Chequers summit, which will be followed by a White Paper setting out more details, is aimed at finalising the UK's preferred path which can then be put to the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some ministers appeared not to have been involved in drawing up the new proposal, which is being called a ""third way"" after two previous proposals divided opinion. Earlier, government divisions were underlined when Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson intervened in defence of Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had been accused by two other foreign office ministers of ""threatening"" Theresa May over Brexit.

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what the future relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. Key things that have yet to be agreed are how the two sides will trade with each other in years to come - and how to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which is a member of the EU. Before reaching agreement with the EU, Mrs May needs to resolve splits within her cabinet on the shape of Brexit. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The immediate problem with the ""new plan"" is whether or not it really exists. Because while Number 10 says it does, ask other people in government and they are not quite so sure. Ministers who you might have thought would be aware of the detail like - oh, you might imagine - the Brexit secretary had not agreed the lines, before Number 10 made their intervention. And it's said tonight that the reason he has not been involved in agreeing the ""new plan"" is because it does not actually exist yet. The customs decision expected in some parts of government therefore is what has been anticipated for some time as ""max fac plus"" - a souped up version of the proposal that originally won the day in the Brexit subcommittee what feels like a lifetime ago - with, you assume, a long lead-in time while the technology is made to work. Baffled? Quite possibly so. But it's perhaps only safe to say that four days before ministers are expected to actually make some final decisions, all is not precisely as you might have expected. Read the rest of Laura's blog Earlier, she urged the EU to consider her blueprint for future relations ""seriously"" as she updated MPs on last week's Brussels summit.

"This video can not be played May: Brexit means Brexit does mean Brexit A new plan for post-Brexit customs arrangements will be a ""significant step forward"", a Downing Street source has promised. The proposal, to be presented to ministers on Friday, will offer ""the best of both worlds"" - an independent trade policy and friction-free trade, the source added. But no details have yet been revealed about how it will work. Ministers have so far failed to agree what type of customs model to pursue. Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? Reality Check: The government's customs options Friday's Chequers summit, which will be followed by a White Paper setting out more details, is aimed at finalising the UK's preferred path which can then be put to the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some ministers appeared not to have been involved in drawing up the new proposal, which is being called a ""third way"" after two previous proposals divided opinion. Earlier, government divisions were underlined when Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson intervened in defence of Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had been accused by two other foreign office ministers of ""threatening"" Theresa May over Brexit.

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what the future relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. Key things that have yet to be agreed are how the two sides will trade with each other in years to come - and how to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which is a member of the EU. Before reaching agreement with the EU, Mrs May needs to resolve splits within her cabinet on the shape of Brexit. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The immediate problem with the ""new plan"" is whether or not it really exists. Because while Number 10 says it does, ask other people in government and they are not quite so sure. Ministers who you might have thought would be aware of the detail like - oh, you might imagine - the Brexit secretary had not agreed the lines, before Number 10 made their intervention. And it's said tonight that the reason he has not been involved in agreeing the ""new plan"" is because it does not actually exist yet. The customs decision expected in some parts of government therefore is what has been anticipated for some time as ""max fac plus"" - a souped up version of the proposal that originally won the day in the Brexit subcommittee what feels like a lifetime ago - with, you assume, a long lead-in time while the technology is made to work. Baffled? Quite possibly so. But it's perhaps only safe to say that four days before ministers are expected to actually make some final decisions, all is not precisely as you might have expected.

"Ofcom has received more than 2,500 complaints over a video shown to Dani Dyer on Love Island Ofcom has received more than 2,500 complaints over Sunday night's episode of Love Island. The complaints are directly related to a scene where Dani Dyer is shown a misleading video of boyfriend Jack Fincham. The couple were put in separate villas, after the boys and girls were split up as part of a plot twist. It was revealed in the clip that an ex-partner of Fincham's was in the new villa with him. Dyer was seen crying in the beach hut after seeing the video of Fincham A spokeswoman for Ofcom confirmed that there had been 2,525 complaints in total relating to Dani being shown the video of Jack. She added: ""We are considering these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."" The number of complaints is irrelevant - Ofcom will investigate if it considers a broadcaster or service provider may have breached its codes. ITV2 declined to comment on the complaints. Should Love Island surgery ads be banned? Dyer 'didn't want' daughter on Love Island Love Island's Adam sparks abuse warning Dyer, who has been paired up with Fincham since the beginning of the series, burst into tears as she watched the video of Fincham react with shock at seeing his ex, Ellie Jones, arrive. Although he did not give an overtly positive response to Jones's arrival or make any mention of any romantic intentions towards her, Dyer was visibly distressed. Viewers were shown Dyer's full reaction. She said: ""It always happens to me, as soon as I'm happy with someone, something happens to me, it's like I'm not allowed to be happy. ""Imagine it's some girl that he's been recently seeing, he clearly has feelings if he was seeing her and now she's in here."" Speaking in the beach hut to camera, she said: ""Jack looked so shocked in the video, saying 'oh my god, oh my god' - all right mate, do you want to say 'oh my god' one more time? ""I just knew it was too good to be true."" Fincham told fellow islander Adam Collard that he was in ""love"" with Dyer on Sunday's episode However, the clip has been criticised by viewers for being misleading. In Friday's episode, Fincham was seen taking his bedding outside into the villa garden after refusing to share a bed with one of the new female contestants. He also spoke on the show about how much he ""loved"" Danny Dyer's daughter and how he missed being with her, having been in a couple with her since the show started three weeks ago. Neither of these incidents were shown to Dyer. Jack and Dani were reunited on Monday evening's episode Monday's episode saw more fall out from the video, as Dyer worried about what had happened with Fincham and his ex in the other villa. However, at the end of the episode when the villas combined, it was revealed that Fincham had stayed loyal to Dyer and the pair re-coupled, with much relief from the other islanders. It was not without some jealousy from Dyer as ex Ellie Jones entered the villa paired with another islander. Dyer and Jones saw each other for the first time and will meet face to face in Tuesday's episode. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Rescue workers have deployed drilling machinery to try and create a new access point to the cave Last Saturday, 12 young boys went to explore a cave with their coach after football practice in northern Thailand. Their bikes were found abandoned at the entrance and shortly after, heavy rain sent torrents of water through the cave. Over the past week, rescuers have been mounting an increasingly desperate search, in the hope the group are alive deep inside the cave but trapped by floodwaters. Here's what the operation, in the jungle-covered hills around Chiang Rai, involves: Thai navy divers have been trying to access the deepest caverns of the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, the fourth longest in Thailand. Four top British cave divers, along with some US military personnel, also joined the efforts. A Facebook photo shows the coach with what is thought to be his football team The divers are swimming through tiny spaces and cannot risk going too far into flooded passages or they risk running out of air. The search has been frustrated by rushing water and near darkness inside the cave. Debris and mud leaves divers with almost no visibility; they can only see a few centimetres in front of them. It's been described as like swimming through cold coffee. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Powerful industrial water pumps, put in place to reduce the water level inside the cave, have struggled to combat relentless rains. With the entrance flooded, pumping was halted on Thursday and divers forced to stop their search intermittently. Rescue efforts shifted to finding other ways to access - and reduce water in - the cave. 'Come home': Thailand clings to hope for lost boys What you need to do to survive underground That has involved drilling through rock to drain water, so the divers could resume the search - although the thickness of the cave's wall has made this difficult. Another option would be to drill into the cave to create a new route to try to reach the boys. But finding an area on the densely jungle-covered and muddy mountainside for the heavy machinery required, while ensuring surrounding rock does not collapse, makes the idea of drilling a hole to access the cave an impractical one. Other technology has aided the massive human search effort which includes the military, police and hundreds of volunteers. Drones equipped with thermal cameras have been flown over Tham Luang to detect possible access points. An underwater robot was deployed to send information back on the water depth and condition of the cave. No technology exists to scan for people deep underground. There are plans to send cameras down to try to work out the next step and potentially to make contact with the missing group. The animals have helped survey teams investigate the area above the cave complex, which is several kilometres long, searching for possible ways in. The dogs were brought to the site after smelling clothing belonging to the missing children, news agency AFP reported. Soldiers carried large hoses into the cave in an effort to drain rising flood waters Relatives of the missing have camped outside the cave since they went missing on 23 June. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha arrived at the site to speak with them on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dozens of ""survival boxes"" containing food, maps and mobile phones were to be sent into the cave on Friday, according to the police. They plan to drop the boxes into any openings they find in the limestone rock on the mountains above the caves, and, if they do not find the missing boys, to float them on underground rivers in the hope they might reach them. A police team was able to descend one such hole, discovered by two of the British caving team, and discovered a large chamber, which may take them into part of the cave complex Police Col Kraiboon Sotsong told reporters the boxes contained a message telling whoever found it to float the box back out. ""The note says: 'If received, then reply and show on the map where you are. Everybody will quickly help."" Thailand has deployed more than 1,000 people - including soldiers, divers and special forces - to search for the team When they are found, the operation to get the group out of the cave will be long. Experts say it could take weeks, if they are found alive, to bring them to safety. Heavy rains at this time of year mean long passages might well remain continuously flooded for months. Earlier in the week local officials said rescue teams were preparing to train the boys and their coach to use scuba gear, in case they had to dive out through flooded areas of the cave. But navigating their way out would be incredibly difficult and it's more likely food and supplies would be sent in while work continued to find another entrance.

"UK Brexit Secretary David Davis and Chief EU Negotiator Michel Barnier say they both want a deal There's a lot of discussion at the moment about a 'no deal' Brexit. What does that actually mean? It seems to mean slightly different things to different people. But in the current context it basically means that there would be no formal agreement reached during the negotiations between the UK and the EU, which are taking place under the terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. These are the negotiations that are led by David Davis for the UK and Michel Barnier for the EU - the fifth round of talks is being held in Brussels this week. Even if there is no deal under Article 50, there would still have to be some kind of formal relationship between the UK and the EU in the long term - for trade, security and every other aspect of bilateral ties. But if the Article 50 process fails there is very little time to work on alternative strategies before  Brexit in March 2019. This is an important question because the timing is critical. One scenario, being pushed by some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, is that if the current negotiations make no progress - and the EU refuses to move on to talk about a future trade deal - the UK should announce that it will pursue a 'no deal' Brexit instead. Leave supporters believe that would free the UK from all EU structures in one fell swoop. If such a decision were to be made in, say, March 2018 there would still be a year before the UK is due to leave the EU. That's very little time to prepare for such a massive change, but it would be better than nothing. A more worrying scenario for many business leaders, and millions of citizens who are caught up in the Brexit process, is that something could go wrong at the very last minute - perhaps a deal that has been tentatively agreed but is subsequently rejected by one side or the other. Then the UK could crash out of the EU with neither side fully prepared for the consequences. This is the 'cliff edge' that gives many people in business and politics sleepless nights - a chaotic Brexit that would benefit no one. Yes they are - on both sides of the Channel. The UK government has been careful to say that it is not seeking a 'no deal' outcome, but that it has to be prepared for all eventualities. The Prime Minister has tried to move away from an emphasis on her initial message that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but when pushed she continues to defend that stance. So there is a combination here of prudent planning behind the scenes, and public statements which aim to have an impact on the negotiations - trying to hurry things up by warning of possible alternatives. For the EU, the President of the European Council Donald Tusk has been very clear, arguing that no deal would be the worst deal of all. ""A no-deal scenario would be bad for everyone,"" he said earlier this year, ""but above all for the UK."" Contingency planning is also happening elsewhere in the EU, though - within both governments and the business community. The Federation of German Industries (BDI) said last week that it was setting up a task force of major companies to make provisions for the ""serious case of a very hard exit."" Anything else, it said, would be naÃ¯ve. If the two-year Article 50 process came to an end with no agreement, the UK would leave the EU on 29 March 2019 with no deal in place. Again, much would then depend on how long both sides have had to prepare for this. The consequences of 'no deal' would affect almost every aspect of life, and it is impossible to say exactly how events would unfold.  But here are a few examples: Money:With no agreement in place, according to aHouse of Lords report,externalthere would be no legal obligation for the UK to make any payment as part of a financial settlement. That would leave a huge hole in the EU budget. It would save the UK money in this instance, but it would antagonise the rest of the EU and further sour relations. Legal action, possibly via the International Court of Justice in The Hague, could not be ruled out. Citizens:Without a deal or other residency rights, the entitlement of EU nationals to reside in the UK, or of UK nationals to reside elsewhere in the EU, could technically disappear overnight. In theory, they could become third country nationals, subject to domestic immigration rules. Given the fact that this would affect more than three million EU citizens in the UK, and nearly a million UK citizens in the EU, it could well be that individual EU countries would try to strike deals with the UK to guarantee citizens' rights. Common sense should prevail, but that cannot be guaranteed. Trade:With no new trade agreement with the EU, the rules of the World Trade Organisation would apply. Tariffs would be imposed on goods that the UK sends to the EU, and on goods the EU sends to the UK. It would not be the frictionless trade - certainly to begin with - that the government hopes to promote. Tariffs on many industrial products would be 2-3%, but on cars they would be 10% and on many agricultural products between 20% and 40%. The trade in services would also suffer if nothing was agreed in advance. Under a pure 'no deal' scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each individual country. The financial services industry would be particularly vulnerable, and it accounts for a significant slice of the UK economy. Again it is worth emphasising that all these restrictions would apply to EU businesses wanting to trade in the UK as well. 'No deal' is not a one-way street. Without any deal, and with no transition period negotiated, the UK would be free to sign trade agreements around the world as soon as it could finalise them. How might it try to go about this? There are a few pointershere. Customs:A government White Paper on customs, published yesterday, sets out options for a 'no deal' scenario in more detail. A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal. Traders would need to present goods to HM Revenue and Customs ""inland as much as possible"" to avoid congestion at ports, and consignments would need to be pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible. The White Paper promises to minimise disruption for business and travellers - but to give some idea of the scale of the challenge, HMRC estimates that about 130,000 businesses that export to the EU would be dealing with customs for the first time. 'No deal' is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper hints at how disruptive it could be. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would, in particular, be a huge concern, with serious ramifications for the Northern Ireland peace process. Regulations:With no deal of any kind in place, the UK would suddenly cease to be a member of dozens of regulatory agencies that govern many aspects of daily life. In time, it would need to replace all of them with agencies of its own. Thousands of new employees would need to be recruited and trained - a process which should have already started if there were to be any chance of it being completed before Brexit. EU bodies that regulate the aviation industry and the pharmaceutical industry are often cited as prime examples. One of the main concerns associated with a 'cliff edge' Brexit is that there would be no time to put new measures in place, even if plenty of contingency planning had been done. In theory - under a worst case scenario - that could mean that planes would be grounded temporarily, and drugs could not be imported. But again, the hope would be that common sense would prevail, and that some kind of interim arrangements would be made to keep things moving. It would be in the interests of neither the UK nor the EU for chaos to ensue.

"This video can not be played Juncker: May will resolve Brexit splits ""The last call""... ""we cannot wait any more""... ""huge and serious"" gaps. European leaders can repeat the same message, louder and louder. But this EU summit's instructions to Theresa May may as well have been shouted into an empty cupboard. Because they know what she knows - that the past 24 hours of Brexit conversations are not nearly as important as the next seven days of discussions at home between Number 10 and the rest of the government. 'Last call' for Brexit deal, Tusk warns May warns EU: Put citizens' safety first And after more than two years, this time next week ministers should be nearing the conclusion of their country retreat at Chequers. It's there that the prime minister hopes to find resolution in her team on a more detailed offer to the rest of the EU - easing, if not removing, all the contradictions in the Tories' positions. Any pretence that the cabinet agrees is long gone. The government's promised publication of their choices within days, which if comprehensive and detailed as promised, will mark a big step forward, and in theory allow progress towards a final deal. But if the eventual Brexit white paper is flimsy - still a list of tentative options - patience in Brussels may finally run out. Sources suggest that if there is no clarity from the UK next week, all that will be available to Britain is a simple free trade deal. For many months, Theresa May has held the ring while inside her party brawls over Brexit have raged. If she can't end the fight, by picking a winning side or forcing a persuasive compromise, the EU may call time. In the next seven days the prime minister has hurdles she must clear to secure her future.

"There are more women in Parliament than ever before - but still less than a third of total MPs Political parties should be required to publish details of their election candidates by gender to highlight the ""shameful"" gap in numbers between men and women, campaigners are arguing. The Centenary Action Group, which wants equal representation in Parliament, said a lack of information meant it was harder to hold parties to account. They say ministers are able to force compliance under the 2010 Equality Act. Ministers have expressed concern about the ""regulatory burden"" involved. A record number of women, 208 in total, were elected to Parliament last year, up from 191 in 2015. However, they still only make up 32% of the total number of 650 MPs.

Hear her: Why I got into politics Election 2017: Record number of female MPs First female Sikh MP is elected The Commons Women's and Equalities Committee has recommended that parties should be fined if they fail to ensure at least 45% of their general election candidates are female. The Centenary Action Group said action was needed on the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act - which gave many women over the age 30 the vote for the first time. Requiring parties to publish basic demographic information about their candidates would be an ""invaluable resource"" to monitor progress towards gender equality in politics and to promote ""positive competition"". While the 2010 Equality Act gives ministers the power to require parties to publish demographic details of candidates elected at UK and devolved elections, as well as those who were unsuccessful, the provisions have never come into force. Campaigners say it would be simple for Parliament to approve the specific extra regulations needed for this to happen with ministerial backing - and that this should also be extended to council elections.

"Brexiteer Michael Gove objects to the customs partnership favoured by Theresa May Environment Secretary Michael Gove physically ripped up a report on Theresa May's preferred option for a new customs partnership with the EU. He was said to have been ""livid"" as he felt the government document downplayed his objections to the proposal. It comes amid cabinet splits over the future shape of Brexit, which Mrs May hopes to resolve on Friday. European Council president Donald Tusk has said the UK must agree its position and""lay its cards on the table"". The government has talked publicly abouttwo potential options for its customs relationship with the European Union after Brexit. One, a customs partnership, would mean the UK applies the EU's own tariffs and rules of origin to all goods arriving in the country, intended for the EU. The other, known as maximum facilitation or max-fac, aims to employ new technology to remove the need for physical customs checks where possible. Two groups of cabinet members were looking at each of the plans. The document in question, prepared by civil servants, was supposed to represent the views of a group of cabinet members looking at the customs partnership, including Mr Gove. Why is the customs union important? Laura Kuenssberg: All eyes on cabinet discussion Surge in Britons getting EU nationality The Sun reported Mr Gove ""physically ripped it up to show he wasn't prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions"". BBC political correspondent Matt Cole said representatives for Mr Gove had confirmed the paper's claims. Mr Gove was unhappy because it didn't ""reflect his views that a customs partnership would be too bureaucratic and make it harder for Britain to do business"", our correspondent said. Theresa May will convene her cabinet at Chequers on Friday By Matt Cole, BBC political correspondent This outburst of anger - and, crucially, the fact it has become public - is another sign that Cabinet discipline has broken down. The question around Westminster is has Theresa May lost control and, if so, is that irrevocable? In recent days Boris Johnson has beencriticised by colleagueslike Greg Clark and Matthew Hancock for using an expletive to summarise his views about business and Brexit. That was followed by anotherCabinet member Liz Truss sayingit ""wasn't macho"" for people like the defence secretary to publicly demand extra cash. This stuff is normally hidden behind the cloak of collective cabinet responsibility. So, with Michael Gove now happy for it to be known he's ""livid"" about a report by a sub-committee of a sub-committee (yes, that's right), it's only adding to the sense that the prime minister is a ring master whose whip crack is being ignored. It came as Mrs May attended an important summit at which Mr Tusk issued a ""last call"" to the UK to agree its position if a Brexit deal is to be done in time. Mr Tusk said the most difficult issues remained unresolved and quick progress was needed if agreement was to be reached by October. Mrs May and her cabinet are due to meet at Chequers next Friday as they look to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. The UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"", the prime minister has said. Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said Mr Gove's ""temper tantrum"" showed ""deep divides within the cabinet"" and the ""petulance of Brexiteers who can sense their lies are being exposed"". He said the cabinet ""need to act less like toddlers and more like senior ministers negotiating one of the most important deals in UK history"".

"There are more women in Parliament than ever before - but still less than a third of total MPs Political parties should be required to publish details of their election candidates by gender to highlight the ""shameful"" gap in numbers between men and women, campaigners are arguing. The Centenary Action Group, which wants equal representation in Parliament, said a lack of information meant it was harder to hold parties to account. They say ministers are able to force compliance under the 2010 Equality Act. Ministers have expressed concern about the ""regulatory burden"" involved. A record number of women, 208 in total, were elected to Parliament last year, up from 191 in 2015. However, they still only make up 32% of the total number of 650 MPs. According to BBC research, 41% of Labour candidates at the 2017 general election were women, compared with 33% for the SNP, 30% for the Liberal Democrats and 29% for the Conservatives. Hear her: Why I got into politics Election 2017: Record number of female MPs First female Sikh MP is elected The Commons Women's and Equalities Committee has recommended that parties should be fined if they fail to ensure at least 45% of their general election candidates are female. The Centenary Action Group said action was needed on the 100th anniversary of the 1918 Representation of the People Act - which gave many women over the age 30 the vote for the first time. Requiring parties to publish basic demographic information about their candidates would be an ""invaluable resource"" to monitor progress towards gender equality in politics and to promote ""positive competition"". While the 2010 Equality Act gives ministers the power to require parties to publish demographic details of candidates elected at UK and devolved elections, as well as those who were unsuccessful, the provisions have never come into force. Campaigners say it would be simple for Parliament to approve the specific extra regulations needed for this to happen with ministerial backing - and that this should also be extended to council elections. ""Our Parliament trails many others in the world for women's representation,"" said Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society. ""We cannot create a modern, inclusive, gender equal Parliament unless we do the basics and capture data on the diversity of candidates."" The Electoral Reform Society, which is backing the campaign, said the ""legislation is ready and there is widespread support for this change to be made"". ""The sooner it is enacted, the sooner the UK's shameful political gender gap can be bridged,"" said Jess Garland, its director of policy and research. Dr Rosie Campbell, Professor of Politics at the University of Birkbeck who has extensively researched the make-up of parliamentary candidates, said it would help all concerned if the data was readily available. ""It would be a much more efficient way of getting this information into the public domain,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. ""I certainly think they ought to do it and a little bit of a stick to persuade them would be a good idea."" She also told the programme that the cost of trying to become an MP was a ""significant barrier"" to many women wanting to enter public life which needed to be addressed. BBC Woman's Hour: Getting into politics BBC Woman's Hour poll: Women in public life Research published last month by academics from the University of Birkbeck and University College London's Constitution Unit into candidate selection in 2015 and 2017 found some women had spent up as much as Â£50,000 trying to get chosen by their respective political parties. One candidate said they had lost Â£9,000 of their own money in travel and housing costs after basing themselves in the constituency they hoped to represent. Dr Campbell said the figures were likely to be much higher in fiercely contested ""safe seats"", reflecting the lengths to which potential candidates were prepared to go, including by taking time off work. According to the Representative Audit of Britain, the mean average election expense incurred by male and female candidates in 2015 was Â£3,093 for Conservatives and Â£2,179 for Labour candidates.

"Ofcom has received more than 2,500 complaints over a video shown to Dani Dyer on Love Island Ofcom has received more than 2,500 complaints over Sunday night's episode of Love Island. The complaints are directly related to a scene where Dani Dyer is shown a misleading video of boyfriend Jack Fincham. The couple were put in separate villas, after the boys and girls were split up as part of a plot twist. It was revealed in the clip that an ex-partner of Fincham's was in the new villa with him. Dyer was seen crying in the beach hut after seeing the video of Fincham A spokeswoman for Ofcom confirmed that there had been 2,525 complaints in total relating to Dani being shown the video of Jack. She added: ""We are considering these complaints against our broadcasting rules, before deciding whether or not to investigate."" The number of complaints is irrelevant - Ofcom will investigate if it considers a broadcaster or service provider may have breached its codes. ITV2 declined to comment on the complaints. Should Love Island surgery ads be banned? Dyer 'didn't want' daughter on Love Island Love Island's Adam sparks abuse warning Dyer, who has been paired up with Fincham since the beginning of the series, burst into tears as she watched the video of Fincham react with shock at seeing his ex, Ellie Jones, arrive. Although he did not give an overtly positive response to Jones's arrival or make any mention of any romantic intentions towards her, Dyer was visibly distressed. Viewers were shown Dyer's full reaction. She said: ""It always happens to me, as soon as I'm happy with someone, something happens to me, it's like I'm not allowed to be happy. ""Imagine it's some girl that he's been recently seeing, he clearly has feelings if he was seeing her and now she's in here."" Speaking in the beach hut to camera, she said: ""Jack looked so shocked in the video, saying 'oh my god, oh my god' - all right mate, do you want to say 'oh my god' one more time? ""I just knew it was too good to be true."" Fincham told fellow islander Adam Collard that he was in ""love"" with Dyer on Sunday's episode However, the clip has been criticised by viewers for being misleading. In Friday's episode, Fincham was seen taking his bedding outside into the villa garden after refusing to share a bed with one of the new female contestants. He also spoke on the show about how much he ""loved"" Danny Dyer's daughter and how he missed being with her, having been in a couple with her since the show started three weeks ago. Neither of these incidents were shown to Dyer. Jack and Dani were reunited on Monday evening's episode Monday's episode saw more fall out from the video, as Dyer worried about what had happened with Fincham and his ex in the other villa. However, at the end of the episode when the villas combined, it was revealed that Fincham had stayed loyal to Dyer and the pair re-coupled, with much relief from the other islanders. It was not without some jealousy from Dyer as ex Ellie Jones entered the villa paired with another islander. Dyer and Jones saw each other for the first time and will meet face to face in Tuesday's episode. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"More than 7,000 UK High Street estate agents are showing signs of financial distress as they face fewer sales and online competition, a study has found. The report - from accountancy firm Moore Stephens - suggests that some 27% of agents are struggling to survive. One of the main reasons is a long-term decline in property sales. Between 2014 and 2017 the number of transactions in London dropped by 20%, while sales across the UK have fallen by 1% in the past year. The number of estate agents in difficulty has risen sharply from last year, when just under 5,000 were found to be in trouble. As well as a drop-off in the number of house sales, Moore Stephens said the growth of online agents such as Purplebricks and Emoov had been a factor. ""Insolvencies of High Street estate agents are increasing as online competitors continue to chip away at their sales and undermine commission rates,"" said Chris Marsden, restructuring partner at Moore Stephens. ""Some areas in the UK appear to have an excess capacity of estate agents, which could mean there is not enough business to spread around as property transactions stagnate."" He also said that plans to ban letting fees to tenants - expected to come in early next year - could dent profits even more. Since 1 May, the UK's largest chain of estate agents, Countrywide, has seen its share price fall by more than 60%. It has issued two profit warnings in the past 12 months. Rival chain Foxtons has also had problems, reporting a 15% decline in revenues during the first quarter of 2018, and its share price has fallen by nearly 25% since the start of May. Countrywide shares take a dive Foxtons hit by property slump In comparison, shares in Purplebricks, the online agent that charges a flat fee for agreeing to sell a home - rather than a commission - have fallen by 8.2% On Monday, Purplebricks announced further expansion in North America with the purchase of an online estate agent in Canada. Purplebricks already has operations in Australia and the US. House price growth has been moderating since March 2016, when it peaked at an annual rate of 8.3%. In the year to April 2018, that figure had more than halved to 3.9%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.

"Angela Merkel (left) and Horst Seehofer (right) will hold crisis talks later on Monday Germany's interior minister plans to hold last-ditch talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel after threatening to quit in protest at her migration policy. Horst Seehofer heads Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), a key party in Mrs Merkel's coalition. He argues that police should turn away migrants at the Bavarian border if they have sought asylum elsewhere. But Mrs Merkel is sticking to an EU-wide deal. The Merkel-Seehofer crisis talks are set for 17:00 in Berlin (15:00 GMT). A compromise looks unlikely, the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin reports. She says Mr Seehofer might have overplayed his hand by issuing his ultimatum, only for Mrs Merkel to return from Brussels with an EU-wide strategy and bilateral agreements with more than 10 countries. The risk for Mrs Merkel is that Mr Seehofer ends the CSU's alliance with her Christian Democrats (CDU), leaving her without a parliamentary majority. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Could the migration crisis finish the EU? The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - also in the ruling coalition - broadly back her position. Opinion polls suggest that, in the event of a fresh election, the SPD would not profit from the CDU-CSU rift over migration. But SPD leader Andrea Nahles warned that ""my patience has worn thin"". ""We want a humanitarian, but also realistic, migration policy,"" she told a news conference on Monday. On Sunday evening, the CDU passed a resolution supporting Mrs Merkel's position on migration. CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the party believed a European solution was necessary. Then reports emerged from the CSU that Mr Seehofer had offered to step down both as party leader and interior minister. Mr Seehofer complained during a meeting of top CSU officials that he had held a ""conversation with no effect"" with Mrs Merkel on Saturday, when they discussed a new EU deal on migration, sources said. Passau in Bavaria was on the frontline of Europe's 2015 migrant crisis Senior figures immediately tried to persuade Mr Seehofer not to quit, including CSU parliamentary group chief Alexander Dobrindt. ""This is a decision that I just cannot accept,"" Mr Dobrindt was quoted as saying. In the early hours of Monday, the party leader then announced he had agreed to hold final talks with the CDU as a ""concession"" in the interest of the country and the coalition. The CSU could put forward a new candidate for interior minister if Mr Seehofer does quit, keeping the ruling coalition intact The CSU could end its alliance with the CDU, but then the Greens or Free Democrats (FDP) could do a deal to join the ruling coalition Mrs Merkel could carry on weaker, with a minority government She could quit as chancellor She could call a confidence vote in the Bundestag, which could trigger fresh elections. Yes. The CDU-CSU alliance has lasted for decades, but it could break up over this, at a critical time for both parties. Bavarian state elections will be held in October, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is a threat to both parties. The AfD surged into the German parliament (Bundestag) for the first time last year, winning 94 seats. Its success was based on strident anti-immigration rhetoric, attacking Mrs Merkel's decision to let in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016. However, opinion polls have suggested that Bavarians are more satisfied with Mrs Merkel than with the CSU leader, weakening Mr Seehofer's position. A new poll from RTL/n-TV suggests that CSU support has fallen 4.5% in Bavaria since the 2017 elections, to 34%. Nationally the party would be down to 5% - the threshold for entering the Bundestag - rather than 6.2% before. The CDU is marginally down nationally to 26%, the poll indicates. Mrs Merkel stayed up with EU leaders until dawn on Friday to clinch a new deal on migrants. She said Greece and Spain had agreed to take back migrants stopped at the Bavarian-Austrian border who are proven to have entered their countries first -  a move she hoped would allay Mr Seehofer's concerns. ""The sum of all we've agreed is equivalent to what the CSU wants - that's my personal view, but the CSU have to decide for themselves,"" she said. However, Italy - where most irregular migrants arrive - does not want to take back migrants who reach Germany. The divisions within the German government over the issue are also being played out in other EU countries, and three countries later said they were not part of the German deal: the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.

During their career the Bay City Rollers sold 120 million records, finding success in the UK, US, Australia and Japan. They were mobbed by teenage girls dressed in the band's trademark wide trousers, skinny shirts and obligatory tartan. But at the height of their success in 1976 - the year the group cracked the US and hit the top of the Billboard charts with Saturday Night - Longmuir quit the band. In 2015, he told aBBC Scotland documentarythat the pressure was taking its toll. ""I was getting depressed. I couldn't take it anymore,"" he said. The band finally split in 1978 but bitter legal battles about money dragged on for years. Alan Longmuir (second from left) quit the band at the height of their success The band were responsible for ""Rollermania"" in the mid 1970s. The bass-player joined a one-off concert of the Bay City Rollers at the Edinburgh Hogmanay in 1999. He also returned to the stage in 2014 to appear in a show based on his life - And I Ran With The Gang - at the Edinburgh Fringe, which featured some of the band's biggest hits. He told BBC Scotland that he credited those shows with reigniting his love of performing, ahead of a series of reunion gigs in 2015 and 2016. And I Ran With The Gang was due to return to the festival this August.

"Alesha MacPhail was reported missing on Monday morning The body of a missing schoolgirl has been found on the Isle of Bute. A member of the public discovered a child's body in woodland at about 09:00 on Monday and police believe it is six-year-old Alesha MacPhail who was reported missing two-and-a-half hours earlier. An investigation has begun and detectives are treating the death as unexplained. The body was discovered in the grounds of a former hotel on Ardbeg Road. Police guard a cordon at the house where Alesha was believed to have been staying Det Supt Stuart Houston from Police Scotland's major investigation teams said: ""This death of a six-year-old child has shocked the tight-knit community of Rothesay and it is imperative that we find out what has happened. ""This investigation is at its very early stages however I am appealing for information in order to piece together Alesha's last known movements. ""We know that once the alarm was raised about her being missing, there were a number of local people who assisted with the search. ""I would like to speak to anyone who was involved in that searchÂ who has not yet been spoken to by the police. This is to ensure that everyone that was in the vicinity of Ardbeg Road at the time Â is traced as they may have critical information which could assist with the investigation."" Houses have been sealed off in Ardbeg He also wanted to reassure the people of Rothesay: ""I must reiterate that this death is still being treated as unexplained at this time, however, I would like to reassure the public that this type of incident is rare,"" he said. ""I understand that there are real concerns in the community, however, please be assured that a team of detectives are working on this investigation to ascertain the circumstances leading up to death of this young child. Specially trained officers are supporting the family during this incredibly difficult time. ""If anyone has any information please contact police with that information. You might think it is insignificant, however, please let us be the judge of that, and contact us immediately."" The schoolgirl was staying in a house in Ardbeg Road before she disappeared John Morrison, a local property developer, was shocked at the news. He told the BBC: ""When I came out here about three hours ago, first I saw the police barriers about 500 yards back on the road. ""When I went down into my site I got a phone call from my partner telling me a wee girl had been missing and she had been found dead. It was a horrible shock. ""Then just after that more police started to come, men in the white suits, and a van full of police who I take it had been searching earlier. ""The rumour was she had been found in the Kyles Hydro Estate which is over at the back."" The police presence increased after the body was found Mr Morrison said the community had been affected by what happened: ""Terrible, terrible. We are going to know the family or someone connected with them,"" he said. ""It brings it right home, it is such a shock. I feel so sorry for the family at this moment in time."" Well-wishers have started to leave flowers near the police cordon. The police spokeswoman said: ""At around 06:25, police were informed a six-year-old girl was missing. ""A search was undertaken to try and locate the child. ""At around 09:00 the body of a young female child was discovered in the grounds of an old hotel.

"Tesco says it is planning a ""strategic alliance"" with French retail giant Carrefour, as the two try to use their joint buying power to cut costs and offer lower prices to customers. The two plan a ""strategic relationship"",externalwhen dealing with global suppliers, and the tie-up will also mean sharing their own-brand products. The move comes as retailers face an increasingly competitive environment. Tesco is the UK's largest retailer while Carrefour is Europe's largest. Last year, Tesco - which employs 440,000 people - reported profits of Â£1.3bn with sales of Â£57.5bn. Carrefour operates 12,300 stores across more than 30 countries, employing about 375,000 people worldwide. Last year, it had sales of â¬88.2bn (Â£78bn). The two have been talking for two years and, although no formal agreement has yet been signed, they said they were hoping to confirm a deal in the next two months. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: ""By working together and making the most of our collective product expertise and sourcing capability, we will be able to serve our customers even better, further improving choice, quality and value."" The grocery sector is currently going through a period of rapid change. Tesco itself recently completed the purchase of wholesaler Booker, and in April, Sainsbury's said that it was in advanced talks to buy Asda from US retail giant Walmart. The traditional big four UK supermarket chains - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - have faced increasing competition from the rapidly-expanding budget chains Lidl and Aldi over the past few years, and there is now the added threat of internet giant Amazon moving into the sector. Last year, Amazon bought upmarket grocer Whole Foods. In the UK, Amazon offers food sales through its Amazon Fresh service, although currently that is still focused on Greater London and parts of the South East. Emma Simpson, business correspondent This tie up would have been unthinkable a decade ago, given the past rivalry of these two supermarket giants, but these days they're both under pressure from the increasing competition. Aldi and Lidl have vast operations and sales across Europe. This gives them huge buying power with suppliers. With their no-frills stores and limited, mostly own-branded, product range, their business model makes it very difficult for the big, traditional retailers to match their prices. It's not the first alliance of its kind. There are a number of big buying groups in Europe. For instance, Morrisons is part of the AMS Sourcing group which enables it to buy some own branded products with other companies. Sainsbury's and Asda also want to buy better together, securing better terms from suppliers, with their mega merger. All the big traditional supermarkets are trying to cut costs and improve profitability as they adapt to an array of pressures and changes which are reshaping the industry. Tesco will be hoping this move will improve its offer. ""Another price war is now looming in the UK supermarket sector,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The latest Tesco partnership looks like a direct response to the threat posed by the proposed merger of Sainsbury's and Asda, who will have access to the global buying power of Walmart as a result."" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData, noted that a key focus of the tie-up ""is to reduce prices on own-brand products, and this is more of a direct response to Aldi and Lidl, whose offers are heavily weighted towards own-brand"". Own-brand ranges give supermarkets greater control and the potential for higher margins, he added. Across the British supermarket sector there is a shift towards more own-label products, suggesting the big brands will have to fight harder for shelf-space. The potential squeeze on suppliers is a big worry for FoodDrinkEurope, the trade organisation for Europe's food and drinks suppliers. ""Buying alliances have a detrimental effect on the whole food supply chain,"" said FoodDrinkEurope's director general, Mella Frewen. ""They increase the buying power of the retailers in the alliance thus putting the manufacturing industry, and other suppliers, under increasing price pressure. ""On top of the recent Sainsbury's-Asda alliance, this will have a huge impact on the balance of power along the food chain, to the detriment of all suppliers, regardless of size."" The chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, said some small businesses would be worried about Tesco's planned deal. ""Small suppliers that supply to Tesco need assurances that they will still be treated fairly and correctly in any large operation that now emerges."" he said. Tesco's performance has steadily improved since 2014, when it posted the worst results in its history with a record pre-tax loss of Â£6.4bn. It recently recorded its 10th consecutive quarter of rising sales and said its growth plans were on track. In January, Carrefour announced a major transformation plan that involved making cost cuts of â¬2bn by 2020, and investing â¬2.8bn in e-commerce by 2022.

"This video can not be played Five things you need to know about AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador - known as ""Amlo"" Left-wing candidate AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has claimed victory in Mexico's presidential election, saying ""profound change"" is coming. The ex-Mexico City mayor, known by his initials Amlo, is projected to win about 53%. His rivals have conceded in a crushing defeat for the main parties. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador's key pledge has been to tackle the ""evil"" of corruption. He has also been highly critical of President Donald Trump and ties with the US will now be closely watched. Relations with Washington have been hugely strained, with Mr Trump strongly criticising Mexico over trade and migration. Mr Trump has sent a tweet of congratulations. Late on Sunday, the 64-year-old promised to respect civil liberties and said he was ""not looking to construct a dictatorship, either open or hidden"". Who is AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador? The five big issues facing Amlo Some opponents have expressed fears that his leftist and populist policies could damage the already sluggish economy and turn Mexico into ""another Venezuela"",which is suffering a deep economic crisis and rampant inflation. Hailing a ""historic night"", Mr LÃ³pez Obrador called on all Mexicans to reconcile and repeated his campaign pledge to review energy contracts for signs of corruption. ""Corruption is... the result of a decadent political regime. We are absolutely convinced that this evil is the main cause of social and economic inequality, and also that corruption is to blame for the violence in our country,"" he said. He has insisted that no-one involved in corruption will be spared, not even those he calls ""brothers-in-arms"". On combating Mexico's record levels of violence, much of it related to drug cartels, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said he would have daily meetings with his security cabinet, which under him, he said, would be under a ""unified command"". Sunday's election followed one of Mexico's deadliest campaigns in decades with more than 130 political candidates and party workers killed. This video can not be played How should Mexico's new president deal with Trump? During the campaign Mr LÃ³pez Obrador had often used confrontational language when referring to Mr Trump, but struck a more conciliatory note in his victory speech, saying he would seek ""friendly relations"". How the vote was seen in one of the most violent cities A guide to Mexico's drug cartels Five reasons this election matters He also tried to reassure the business sector, saying there would be no nationalisation and that he would respect private business. He also said his government would be fiscally disciplined and taxes would not be raised. On social policies, he said he would double pensions for the elderly upon taking office on 1 December as a first step to reducing Mexico's disparate income levels. Born to a family of shopkeepers on 13 November 1953 in the rural community of TepetitÃ¡n, in southern Tabasco state Known popularly as Amlo, which is an acronym using the full initials of his name Elected Mexico City mayor in 2000 After losing the presidential elections in 2006 and 2012, he ran again this time under a three-party coalition led by the leftist National Regeneration Movement party (Morena) he founded in 2014 The self-styled anti-establishment figure has now ended the dominance of the PRI and PAN parties he called the ""mafia of power"" LÃ³pez Obrador, a winner at last The latest figures from the Mexican electoral institute,externalshow Mr LÃ³pez Obrador has won more than double the votes of his nearest challenger. It is the widest victory since the 1980s. Ricardo Anaya, candidate for the conservative National Action Party (PAN), looked set to be runner-up to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador. ""I recognise his triumph, I express my congratulations, and I wish him the greatest success for the good of Mexico,"" Mr Anaya said. Ruling party candidate JosÃ© Antonio Meade, who lies in third place according to initial results, told supporters that he wished the winner ""the greatest success"". Mr Meade's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has dominated Mexican politics for much of the past century but has slumped in popularity. The electoral institute figures put official turnout at 62.7%. As well as a new president, 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress were elected, in addition to state and local officials. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador's coalition is set to have a majority in the lower house and possibly the Senate. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador had been the candidate most critical of Mr Trump and had said he would make the US president ""see reason"", branding his anti-immigrant policies ""irresponsible"" and ""racist"".

Mr Trump has riled Mexico by saying he will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and build a wall along the US-Mexico border. His hardline stance on migration - particularly the separation of migrant families at the US border - has brought widespread condemnation. Some 2,000 children remain separated from their migrant parents, despite Mr Trump agreeing to curtail the policy.

"It could take two weeks before supplies of carbon dioxide return to normal, the British Meat Processors Association has warned. CO2 is used to kill farm animals before processing and in packaging to keep meat fresh but is in short supply. A plant in Billingham, County Durham restarted on Monday. But BMPA chief executive Nick Allen said its members had been told it could take a fortnight for supplies to ""return to normal"". Mr Allen told the BBC's Today programme: ""It has been one of the frustrations right the way through this crisis that the communication from the producers of CO2 hasn't been very clear."" CO2 shortage: Why it matters Warburton's shuts crumpet plants due to CO2 shortage He said this lack of clarity meant it was ""so difficult to plan when you don't know actually what's going to happen"". Last week, Quality Pork Limited, which operates Scotland's biggest abattoir at Brechin, had to close and ship some of the 6,000 pigs that pass through the site down to its meat processing partner, Tulip, in England to prevent overcrowding on farms. As well as the meat industry, CO2 is also used to put the bubbles in carbonated drinks. Over the weekend,Asda said it was limiting the amount of fizzy soft drinks people could buy online. It has restricted shoppers to six bottles or multipacks of soft drinks online. Have you noticed a shortage of food and drink at your supermarket? Is there less choice of beer at your local pub? Please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,externalwith your stories. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, which represents large restaurant and pub chains across the country, said: ""We are expecting the situation to get better this week when a major plant comes back online. However, she added: ""It is true that throughout the supply chain we're on to emergency stores of CO2 and if that plant doesn't come back online very quickly, we will be having severe shortages throughout the supply chain."" Mark O'Neill of The Beer and Gas Man, who provides CO2 to about 750 customers in the West Midlands, says that the company had to stop delivering supplies last Tuesday. ""We've just been bombarded with phone calls,"" he says. ""With the hot weather and the World Cup it is the perfect storm. All the pubs are busier using a lot more gas and there's just none to go around."" Mr O'Neill says that businesses are so desperate for CO2 that they are willing to drive hundreds of miles - and pay any price - for the gas. He says: ""We've had phone calls from people in Brighton, Wales and Altringham who are willing to drive to the Midlands to pick up one or two bottles and offered to pay whatever I wanted to charge but we obviously couldn't because we're completely out of stock."" Warburton's, which is the UK's largest producer of crumpets, was forced to halt production at two of its four plants last week because of the shortage. It uses CO2 in its packages to give them longer shelf life and prevent mould. A spokeswoman for Warburton's said: ""We are under the impression that supplies are supposed to coming on today."" However, she said the bakery firm did not know for sure when supplies of CO2 would reach its plants. The BMPA's Mr Allen said that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will hold a meeting of the Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group on Monday where government departments, industry and trade associations ""will pool their information"".

"Will Riches was arrested in 2016 for alleged fraud at the Police Federation A former vice-chairman of the Police Federation is to face a gross misconduct hearing following an investigation into an alleged fraud. Will Riches, a Met Police constable, was arrested in 2016 along with two other policemen and a retired officer. The inquiry focused on the transfer of Â£1m to a charitable account of which Mr Riches was a trustee. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has ruled he should face gross misconduct proceedings. The Crown Prosecution Service had decided in May there was ""insufficient evidence"" to bring charges against the officer. However, the police watchdog said he should face proceedings which could lead to his dismissal over ""allegations concerning the information the officer gave to the Constables Central Committee, a part of the Police Federation of England and Wales."" The IOPC added that ""there is no indication or allegation that the officer personally benefitted financially in any way."" The Met said the officer had been on ""restricted duties"" since his arrest in March 2016 and ""a gross misconduct investigation is currently being carried out by the Directorate of Professional Standards"". The three others who were also arrested have been told they ""have no case to answer,"" the IOPC said.

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Poland 0-3 Colombia highlights Four years ago, Colombia swept aside the cobwebs of 16 years watching the tournament on television to storm to a best World Cup finish. Four straight victories before a 2-1 defeat by hosts Brazil on a tempestuous night in Fortaleza meant Jose Pekerman's side exited with their heads held high. James Rodriguez had arrived at the tournament with many English speakers not even knowing how to pronounce his name. He departed as an international star. Six goals from midfield meant 'Hamez' lifted the Golden Boot as top goalscorer; his exquisite strike against Uruguay was judged the tournament's best goal. The Colombia number 10 was clearly the team's standout performer, but he was also joined by a supporting cast that helped 'Los Cafeteros' ('the Coffee Growers') serve up some of the finest football seen at the tournament. Four years on, Colombia's football no longer drips with the same energy and vibrancy. Both through qualifying and for most of this World Cup so far, Colombia have been staid, erratic and unconvincing. With Rodriguez persistently dogged by a calf strain, Colombia have struggled to assert their authority on this tournament. Only in the crushing 3-0 win over Poland have they turned on the style. Rodriguez, of course, was man of the match in that game following two sublime assists. Listen to the latest World Cup Daily podcast Colombia beat Senegal 1-0 to secure last-16 tie Against Senegal, his forced substitution after just 31 minutes has left 50 million Colombians fretting aboutthe fitness of their team's starbefore Tuesday's last-16 tie against England at Spartak Stadium in Moscow. Now Pekerman, a wily Argentine, faces a huge call - whether to risk Rodriguez and maintain his favoured 4-2-3-1 formation, or consider losing a creative midfielder in order to secure control in the middle. Whatever the tactical shape, their style will remain the same: to launch quick transitions and unsettle England's back three down the channels, while ensuring left-footed playmaker Juan Fernando Quintero pulls the strings from midfield in providing the service for captain Radamel Falcao. Will Jose Pekerman risk his injured star man against England? In just over seven games at the Brazil and Russia World Cups, Rodriguez has struck six goals and provided four assists. Aged 26, he's already his country's joint third all-time top scorer with 21 goals. Colombia's hopes of advancing to the quarter-finals clearly rest heavily on getting him fit and ready before Tuesday. No player has ever been so influential for the South Americans at a World Cup. But they are not a one-man team in the same way Argentina's form is tied to the genius of Lionel Messi, or even Portugal with Cristiano Ronaldo. In particular, England should be worried by the team's other attacking options. Juan Cuadradoran riot against Poland,because he was playing against a back three that gifted him the space to get behind Maciej Rybus. Using his pace and nimble footwork, the former Chelsea winger wreaked havoc in the penalty area. Against Senegal, it was a different story. ""We tried to involve Cuadrado as much as possible,"" said Pekerman. ""But we couldn't find him due to Senegal's tactics."" Cuadrado had been smothered, and he was increasingly forced to drop back and make runs from deep. Against England, he will again be up against a back three, and most likely marked by a converted winger in Ashley Young. Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate has been warned. While Cuadrado is all speed and tricks, Quintero is the team's brains. Blessed with sublime vision, there are few players at this year's World Cup as technically gifted as Quintero. He is so good Pekerman shifted Rodriguez from his favoured number 10 role to a position out on the left wing to accommodate both talents. England must also pay particular attention to the 25-year-old's quality from dead-ball situations. With 6ft 5in centre-back Yerry Mina having already roared home two ferocious headers from Quintero's pin-point deliveries this tournament, Southgate's men will have to remain organised and switched on at all times. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina has long been his country's hero - and has pulled off some wonderful saves at key moments in Russia. But while he remains an excellent shot-stopper, there are holes in his game England can exploit. From both crosses and corners, Ospina looks far from assured under high balls into the box. Against physical teams that get on top of him, he can be put under severe pressure. No country has scored more goals from set-pieces than England at this tournament, so this could be a major advantage for Southgate's men. Will Falcao's body hold out against a physical England team? At the opposite end of the field is talismanic striker Radamel Falcao. England did not see the best of the 32-year-old during his two-year spell in the Premier League, but 'El Tigre' has since bounced back, and is again his country's indisputable number nine. But Falcao's injury-ravaged body is increasingly creaking, and having already clocked up three games in nine days at this tournament, it remains to be seen whether he will be at his clinical best. Colombia's defence can also be got at. Despite keeping consecutive clean sheets for the first time in World Cup history, there have still been plenty of nervous moments - particularly against Senegal - to concern Pekerman. Mina and Davinson Sanchez will form the backbone of Colombia's defence for years to come. They are both young, blessed with pace and playing at two of the world's top clubs - Barcelona and Tottenham respectively. But they are yet to forge a deep understanding of working together, and their high defensive line can be exploited. The general view in the Colombian media after England were confirmed as their opponents in the last 16 was 'at least it wasn't Belgium'. Colombia's expectations were always to get out of the group stage and try to emulate the achievements of four years ago by reaching the quarter-finals. ""England are the favourites,"" said former Aston Villa midfielder Carlos Sanchez. ""They are the ones who invented the game and they also have some top-quality players."" That is the view still shared by most Colombians - England perhaps have the edge, but Colombia stand a good chance and the draw could have been far crueller. Colombia icon Carlos Valderrama believes there is nothing between the two sides. ""It will be very tight,"" he said. ""In fact, it will be so close that a penalty or a free-kick will be the difference; Colombia will have to make their opportunities count."" Yet one issue - Rodriguez's injury - has left many worried. ""We have a huge problem,"" said Gabriel Meluk, the sports editor for Colombia's main newspaper El Tiempo. ""Because the only player England fear is James Rodriguez and he probably won't be available. That's a massive blow.""

"Women are facing a ""glaring"" gender pension gap owing to career breaks to raise children and lower pay, an investment company has said. Young women aged in their late 20s or early 30s faced an 11% smaller pension pot than men by the time they retired, Fidelity International said. It said women faced a penalty because of motherhood and caring commitments. But it also accepted that the industry was partly at fault for failing to engage women. ""We have to recognise where we have failed as an industry,"" Fidelity International's investment director, Maike Currie, told the BBC News website. She said jargon and a lack of prominent women in the industry had contributed to lower investment by women than men, but accepted that a history of mis-selling in the industry had also had an impact. How to be a mum and still get a decent pension A pension of Â£18,000 - or Â£1,000? The auto enrolment dilemma For many women in their 20s, pensions have fallen on the priority list as they face up to more pressing financial concerns such as insecure work and the cost of renting a home. It has often been said that the only people aged in their 20s who think about pensions are those who sell them. ""A lack of time, confidence, access to the right information, industry jargon and not knowing where to start are just some of the obstacles that stop many women from thinking that investment is for them,""  Ms Currie said in Fidelity International's Financial Power of Women report. ""Until these hindrances are removed, or at the very least addressed, we cannot unlock women's financial power."" The first challenge, she suggested, was to explain to female workers that a workplace pension included a contribution from an employer that was part of their pay and was ""free money"". At present, thepension auto-enrolment schememeans employers must enrol staff aged 22 and over and earning above Â£10,000 into a pension. Ms Currie said that a ""failure"" in this system meant that that some women who worked part-time were not earning enough to qualify for these automatic pension contributions. A DWP spokesperson said pension provision for women was improving: ""Our pension reforms are setting millions of women on the path to a secure retirement and helping to address the historic gender divide in pensions income. ""The introduction of automatic enrolment has seen the number of women in the private sector without a workplace pension halved."" The report suggests that, using projections and allowing for the rising cost of living, a typical 25 to 34-year-old woman's pension pot would be worth Â£126,784 by the time she reaches a state pension age of 68. However, her male counterpart could expect a pension pot of Â£142,836. The primary reason for this was a ""motherhood penalty"", caused by earning less and taking time away from work to bring up children, and a ""good daughter penalty"" that came from career breaks or part-time work owing to looking after sick or elderly parents. As a result. the amount going into pension savings would fall or stop during these periods. Fidelity International, which sells pensions and investment products, said that women tended to choose safer cash savings over more risky, but potentially more lucrative investment products. During a decade of low interest rates, there has been little return from cash savings. Ms Currie said this was, in part, owing to a lack of high-profile female fund managers in the industry who could attract women and create products that appealed to women's life and financial needs.

During their career the Bay City Rollers sold 120 million records, finding success in the UK, US, Australia and Japan. They were mobbed by teenage girls dressed in the band's trademark wide trousers, skinny shirts and obligatory tartan. But at the height of their success in 1976 - the year the group cracked the US and hit the top of the Billboard charts with Saturday Night - Longmuir quit the band. In 2015, he told aBBC Scotland documentarythat the pressure was taking its toll. ""I was getting depressed. I couldn't take it anymore,"" he said. The band finally split in 1978 but bitter legal battles about money dragged on for years.

The bass-player joined a one-off concert of the Bay City Rollers at the Edinburgh Hogmanay in 1999. He also returned to the stage in 2014 to appear in a show based on his life - And I Ran With The Gang - at the Edinburgh Fringe, which featured some of the band's biggest hits. He told BBC Scotland that he credited those shows with reigniting his love of performing, ahead of a series of reunion gigs in 2015 and 2016. And I Ran With The Gang was due to return to the festival this August.

"There are 135,000 EU students in UK universities - with their status to remain unchanged for at least another year EU students at universities in England, Wales and Scotland will continue to be treated the same as home students in the first intake after Brexit. Education Secretary Damian Hinds says EU students starting in autumn 2019 will pay the same tuition fees as English students and their access to support will be unchanged. This status will last for the duration of their degree courses. Mr Hinds said he wanted to provide ""clarity and certainty"". The Scottish government hasalready made a similar commitment to EU students starting in Scottish universities in autumn 2019- which will mean they will continue to pay no tuition fees. The Welsh government also announced on Monday that EU students starting courses in Wales in 2019 would be treated as home students. For universities, worried about their student numbers and finances, it means there will be no ""cliff edge"" for recruitment from the EU immediately after Brexit in March 2019. It might also be seen as a conciliatory gesture, ahead of negotiations in which the UK's universities hope to maintain access to a share of 100bn euros (Â£89bn) of EU research funding. Should I stay or should I go? EU academics consider their post-Brexit future Where can UK students study for free? The education secretary also repeatedthe prime minister's promise that tuition fees in England will be frozen at Â£9,250while a review is being carried out. But theinterest rate on fees will continue to rise in the autumn to 6.3%. There are about 135,000 EU students in UK universities and vice-chancellors recently called for ""urgent clarification"" about the status of EU students who might apply for courses beginning in autumn 2019. So far there is no long-term decision or reciprocal deal on how UK students in the EU, or EU students in the UK, will be treated post-Brexit. If EU students were to be classified as overseas students, their fees would be much higher which could deter them from studying in the UK. UK universities are waiting to find out about future access to EU research funding It would also be likely to make it more expensive for UK students in EU universities, such as in the Netherlands. But the education secretary has announced a guarantee for EU students applying to universities in England for 2019-20, that they will continue to have ""home fee status"" beyond the UK's departure from the EU. This stretches out funding until the summer of 2023 for those on three-year degree courses. For those applying from the EU in following years, the level of fee is likely to depend on wider Brexit negotiations. EU students in the UK are most concentrated in Russell Group universities, London institutions and in Scotland. At University College London there are more than 4,400 EU students - almost 10% of its total. The University of Edinburgh has 3,600 EU students, about 11% of its total. The London School of Economics has almost 2,000 EU students, representing almost 18% of its students. Cambridge has more than 2,500 EU students, about 13%. Top 10 UK universities with the highest proportion of EU students University of Aberdeen London School of Economics Imperial College London Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh School of Oriental and African Studies, London University of the Arts, London University of Cambridge University of Essex King's College London Edinburgh Napier and University College London Universities UK warned the government in June that it was a ""matter of urgency"" that students from the EU should be given information on future fee levels, otherwise it would put at risk their ""great economic and academic value"". The government has now provided this reassurance for at least the first year after Brexit. ""Students from the EU make an important contribution to the universities sector and it is a testament to our system that so many students from abroad choose to come and study here,"" said Mr Hinds. ""Today we are providing clarity and certainty on their fees for the duration of their courses."" Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said it would provide ""much needed clarity for EU students and for universities"".

"It could take two weeks before supplies of carbon dioxide return to normal, the British Meat Processors Association has warned. CO2 is used to kill farm animals before processing and in packaging to keep meat fresh but is in short supply. A plant in Billingham, County Durham restarted on Monday. But BMPA chief executive Nick Allen said its members had been told it could take a fortnight for supplies to ""return to normal"". Mr Allen told the BBC's Today programme: ""It has been one of the frustrations right the way through this crisis that the communication from the producers of CO2 hasn't been very clear."" CO2 shortage: Why it matters Warburton's shuts crumpet plants due to CO2 shortage He said this lack of clarity meant it was ""so difficult to plan when you don't know actually what's going to happen"". Last week, Quality Pork Limited, which operates Scotland's biggest abattoir at Brechin, had to close and ship some of the 6,000 pigs that pass through the site down to its meat processing partner, Tulip, in England to prevent overcrowding on farms. As well as the meat industry, CO2 is also used to put the bubbles in carbonated drinks. Over the weekend,Asda said it was limiting the amount of fizzy soft drinks people could buy online. It has restricted shoppers to six bottles or multipacks of soft drinks online. Have you noticed a shortage of food and drink at your supermarket? Is there less choice of beer at your local pub? Please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,externalwith your stories. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, which represents large restaurant and pub chains across the country, said: ""We are expecting the situation to get better this week when a major plant comes back online. However, she added: ""It is true that throughout the supply chain we're on to emergency stores of CO2 and if that plant doesn't come back online very quickly, we will be having severe shortages throughout the supply chain."" Mark O'Neill of The Beer and Gas Man, who provides CO2 to about 750 customers in the West Midlands, says that the company had to stop delivering supplies last Tuesday. ""We've just been bombarded with phone calls,"" he says. ""With the hot weather and the World Cup it is the perfect storm. All the pubs are busier using a lot more gas and there's just none to go around."" Mr O'Neill says that businesses are so desperate for CO2 that they are willing to drive hundreds of miles - and pay any price - for the gas. He says: ""We've had phone calls from people in Brighton, Wales and Altringham who are willing to drive to the Midlands to pick up one or two bottles and offered to pay whatever I wanted to charge but we obviously couldn't because we're completely out of stock."" Warburton's, which is the UK's largest producer of crumpets, was forced to halt production at two of its four plants last week because of the shortage. It uses CO2 in its packages to give them longer shelf life and prevent mould. A spokeswoman for Warburton's said: ""We are under the impression that supplies are supposed to coming on today."" However, she said the bakery firm did not know for sure when supplies of CO2 would reach its plants. The BMPA's Mr Allen said that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will hold a meeting of the Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group on Monday where government departments, industry and trade associations ""will pool their information"".

"Tesco says it is planning a ""strategic alliance"" with French retail giant Carrefour, as the two try to use their joint buying power to cut costs and offer lower prices to customers. The two plan a ""strategic relationship"",externalwhen dealing with global suppliers, and the tie-up will also mean sharing their own-brand products. The move comes as retailers face an increasingly competitive environment. Tesco is the UK's largest retailer while Carrefour is Europe's largest. Last year, Tesco - which employs 440,000 people - reported profits of Â£1.3bn with sales of Â£57.5bn. Carrefour operates 12,300 stores across more than 30 countries, employing about 375,000 people worldwide. Last year, it had sales of â¬88.2bn (Â£78bn). The two have been talking for two years and, although no formal agreement has yet been signed, they said they were hoping to confirm a deal in the next two months. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: ""By working together and making the most of our collective product expertise and sourcing capability, we will be able to serve our customers even better, further improving choice, quality and value."" The grocery sector is currently going through a period of rapid change. Tesco itself recently completed the purchase of wholesaler Booker, and in April, Sainsbury's said that it was in advanced talks to buy Asda from US retail giant Walmart. The traditional big four UK supermarket chains - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - have faced increasing competition from the rapidly-expanding budget chains Lidl and Aldi over the past few years, and there is now the added threat of internet giant Amazon moving into the sector. Last year, Amazon bought upmarket grocer Whole Foods. In the UK, Amazon offers food sales through its Amazon Fresh service, although currently that is still focused on Greater London and parts of the South East. Emma Simpson, business correspondent This tie up would have been unthinkable a decade ago, given the past rivalry of these two supermarket giants, but these days they're both under pressure from the increasing competition. Aldi and Lidl have vast operations and sales across Europe. This gives them huge buying power with suppliers. With their no-frills stores and limited, mostly own-branded, product range, their business model makes it very difficult for the big, traditional retailers to match their prices. It's not the first alliance of its kind. There are a number of big buying groups in Europe. For instance, Morrisons is part of the AMS Sourcing group which enables it to buy some own branded products with other companies. Sainsbury's and Asda also want to buy better together, securing better terms from suppliers, with their mega merger. All the big traditional supermarkets are trying to cut costs and improve profitability as they adapt to an array of pressures and changes which are reshaping the industry. Tesco will be hoping this move will improve its offer. ""Another price war is now looming in the UK supermarket sector,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The latest Tesco partnership looks like a direct response to the threat posed by the proposed merger of Sainsbury's and Asda, who will have access to the global buying power of Walmart as a result."" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData, noted that a key focus of the tie-up ""is to reduce prices on own-brand products, and this is more of a direct response to Aldi and Lidl, whose offers are heavily weighted towards own-brand"". Own-brand ranges give supermarkets greater control and the potential for higher margins, he added. Across the British supermarket sector there is a shift towards more own-label products, suggesting the big brands will have to fight harder for shelf-space. The potential squeeze on suppliers is a big worry for FoodDrinkEurope, the trade organisation for Europe's food and drinks suppliers. ""Buying alliances have a detrimental effect on the whole food supply chain,"" said FoodDrinkEurope's director general, Mella Frewen. ""They increase the buying power of the retailers in the alliance thus putting the manufacturing industry, and other suppliers, under increasing price pressure. ""On top of the recent Sainsbury's-Asda alliance, this will have a huge impact on the balance of power along the food chain, to the detriment of all suppliers, regardless of size."" The chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, said some small businesses would be worried about Tesco's planned deal. ""Small suppliers that supply to Tesco need assurances that they will still be treated fairly and correctly in any large operation that now emerges."" he said. Tesco's performance has steadily improved since 2014, when it posted the worst results in its history with a record pre-tax loss of Â£6.4bn.

The Winter Hill blaze, near a major TV transmitter, is smouldering in pockets and it is feared the moorland blaze may burn for another week. Mark Scott, assistant team leader at Bolton Mountain Rescue Team, said six sq miles (16 sq km) of the moors had been burnt. He said: ""We have dealt with a number of moorland fires over the years but nothing on the scale of this. This dwarfs anything we have seen before by a huge measure."" A 22-year-old man, from Bolton, arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life has been released under investigation. Lancashire Police said it was continuing to investigate the cause of the fire. Firefighters have been drafted from across England The fire comes as crews from across the country, along withthe Army, combat a blaze 30 miles away at Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester, which started a week ago. Along with the Winter Hill fire, it has covered the region in smoke and ash. Speaking in the Commons about the fire at Saddleworth Moor Stalybridge MP Jonathan Reynolds said he was ""surprised"" no meeting of the government's emergency committee Cobra was held in the wake of the moorland fires. But Minister of State for Policing and the Fire Service, Nick Hurd, told MPs the moorland fires near Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester and across the border in Lancashire at Winter Hill, near Bolton, ""remain major incidents"" and the government was ""fully engaged"". Lancashire Wildlife Trust said a separate ""devastating"" fire on Saturday destroyed a large part of a nature reserve in St Anne's, Lancashire. Allow Twitter content?

There is also a large grassfire burningin the Staffordshire Moorlands. Gary Keary, chairman of the Fire Brigades Union in the North West, said crews were being pushed ""to their limits"" and claimed fire services were having to rely on donations for basic supplies such as sun cream and water. He said: ""Our firefighters have been working in difficult conditions to keep the fire from spreading and have done an amazing job,"" but added ""it is deeply saddening that we have had to reach for the begging bowl"". After a couple of minutes at the top of Winter Hill, my eyes were streaming and I was covered with ash. The charred ground was giving off heat and dense clouds of smoke as the wind swirled and changed direction, conditions which crew manager Stu Hall, of Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue, said were a particular challenge. ""I think we are making an impact but it keeps breaking out in different places,"" he said. Looking out across the blackened moorland, the scale of the fire hits you - the helicopter dropping water appears tiny in this huge landscape. Back down the hill in nearby Horwich, you could be forgiven for thinking the fire had gone out, as the smoke dissipated into the hot clear sky - but the smell of smoke on my shirt and my stinging eyes tell a different story. BBC Health: The dangers of smoke inhalation People in nearby areas have been asked to keep doors and windows closed. Police have also repeated their advice for people to stay away after aman collapsed from smoke inhalation,externalwhen he ignored police cordon tape.

""Our firefighters are tired but optimistic that we continue to make good progress,"" he said. Dave Keelan, assistant chief fire officer with GMFRS, said the service had the challenge of two major incidents as firefighters are still dealing with moorland fires in Tameside. ""I cannot praise my firefighters enough, they have done a fantastic job,"" he said. Mr Keelan also thanked the firefighters from other parts of England and Wales who have been on duty.

"Scientists have taken early steps towards developing an artificial ovary that could lead to improved fertility preservation treatments. The technique is aimed at helping women at risk of becoming infertile, such as those who receive chemotherapy. The Danish scientists removed parts of the ovary and altered them so they could potentially be transplanted later when the woman wants to conceive. Experts say the work is ""exciting"" but human testing is still needed. Woman has baby using ovary frozen as child Baby born from frozen ovary in UK first Ovarian transplants are 'safe option' Treatments for cancer, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can often damage the ovaries and leave women infertile. One way women can preserve their chances of conceiving is with an ovarian tissue transplant, where all or part of the ovary is removed and frozen before it is damaged so that it can be used at a later date. This is the only fertility preservation treatment available for girls who have not started ovulating. But there is a small risk that in those with cancer the ovarian tissue may contain cancerous cells, raising the chances of the illness returning when the transplant takes place. This risk, although ""very low"", means women with certain forms of cancer, such as leukaemia and those originating in the womb, are unlikely to be offered the transplant. To eliminate that risk, scientists from the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, took ovarian follicles and ovarian tissue from patients due to have cancer treatment. They then removed the cancerous cells from the ovarian tissue, leaving behind a ""scaffold"" made up of proteins and collagen. Scientists were then able to grow the ovarian follicles on this engineered scaffold of ovarian tissue. This artificial ovary was then transplanted into mice, where it was able to support the survival and growth of the ovarian cells. Experts said the ""exciting"" technique needed to be tested in humans. But they said it might have advantages over other fertility treatments. Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said the ovarian tissue transplants potentially contained thousands of eggs that would enable women to get pregnant ""naturally"", as opposed to IVF where an egg is fertilised in a laboratory and then returned to the womb. Dr Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midlands Fertility Services, said another advantage of ovarian tissue transplants is that they could enable women to restart their periods after damaging treatments, preventing the need for hormone replacement therapy. The treatment will need to be tested in humans first - a development expected to take place in the next three to four years. The research is being presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.

"Angela Merkel (left) and Horst Seehofer (right) will hold crisis talks later on Monday Germany's interior minister plans to hold last-ditch talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel after threatening to quit in protest at her migration policy. Horst Seehofer heads Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), a key party in Mrs Merkel's coalition. He argues that police should turn away migrants at the Bavarian border if they have sought asylum elsewhere. But Mrs Merkel is sticking to an EU-wide deal. The Merkel-Seehofer crisis talks are set for 17:00 in Berlin (15:00 GMT). A compromise looks unlikely, the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin reports. She says Mr Seehofer might have overplayed his hand by issuing his ultimatum, only for Mrs Merkel to return from Brussels with an EU-wide strategy and bilateral agreements with more than 10 countries. The risk for Mrs Merkel is that Mr Seehofer ends the CSU's alliance with her Christian Democrats (CDU), leaving her without a parliamentary majority. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Chancellor Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Could the migration crisis finish the EU? The centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - also in the ruling coalition - broadly back her position. Opinion polls suggest that, in the event of a fresh election, the SPD would not profit from the CDU-CSU rift over migration. But SPD leader Andrea Nahles warned that ""my patience has worn thin"". ""We want a humanitarian, but also realistic, migration policy,"" she told a news conference on Monday. On Sunday evening, the CDU passed a resolution supporting Mrs Merkel's position on migration. CDU General Secretary Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the party believed a European solution was necessary. Then reports emerged from the CSU that Mr Seehofer had offered to step down both as party leader and interior minister. Mr Seehofer complained during a meeting of top CSU officials that he had held a ""conversation with no effect"" with Mrs Merkel on Saturday, when they discussed a new EU deal on migration, sources said. Passau in Bavaria was on the frontline of Europe's 2015 migrant crisis Senior figures immediately tried to persuade Mr Seehofer not to quit, including CSU parliamentary group chief Alexander Dobrindt. ""This is a decision that I just cannot accept,"" Mr Dobrindt was quoted as saying. In the early hours of Monday, the party leader then announced he had agreed to hold final talks with the CDU as a ""concession"" in the interest of the country and the coalition. The CSU could put forward a new candidate for interior minister if Mr Seehofer does quit, keeping the ruling coalition intact The CSU could end its alliance with the CDU, but then the Greens or Free Democrats (FDP) could do a deal to join the ruling coalition Mrs Merkel could carry on weaker, with a minority government She could quit as chancellor She could call a confidence vote in the Bundestag, which could trigger fresh elections. Yes. The CDU-CSU alliance has lasted for decades, but it could break up over this, at a critical time for both parties. Bavarian state elections will be held in October, and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is a threat to both parties. The AfD surged into the German parliament (Bundestag) for the first time last year, winning 94 seats. Its success was based on strident anti-immigration rhetoric, attacking Mrs Merkel's decision to let in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016. However, opinion polls have suggested that Bavarians are more satisfied with Mrs Merkel than with the CSU leader, weakening Mr Seehofer's position. A new poll from RTL/n-TV suggests that CSU support has fallen 4.5% in Bavaria since the 2017 elections, to 34%. Nationally the party would be down to 5% - the threshold for entering the Bundestag - rather than 6.2% before. The CDU is marginally down nationally to 26%, the poll indicates. Mrs Merkel stayed up with EU leaders until dawn on Friday to clinch a new deal on migrants. She said Greece and Spain had agreed to take back migrants stopped at the Bavarian-Austrian border who are proven to have entered their countries first -  a move she hoped would allay Mr Seehofer's concerns. ""The sum of all we've agreed is equivalent to what the CSU wants - that's my personal view, but the CSU have to decide for themselves,"" she said. However, Italy - where most irregular migrants arrive - does not want to take back migrants who reach Germany. The divisions within the German government over the issue are also being played out in other EU countries, and three countries later said they were not part of the German deal: the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland.

"This video can not be played Five things you need to know about AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador - known as ""Amlo"" Left-wing candidate AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has claimed victory in Mexico's presidential election, saying ""profound change"" is coming. The ex-Mexico City mayor, known by his initials Amlo, is projected to win about 53%. His rivals have conceded in a crushing defeat for the main parties. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador's key pledge has been to tackle the ""evil"" of corruption. He has also been highly critical of President Donald Trump and ties with the US will now be closely watched. Relations with Washington have been hugely strained, with Mr Trump strongly criticising Mexico over trade and migration. Mr Trump has sent a tweet of congratulations. Late on Sunday, the 64-year-old promised to respect civil liberties and said he was ""not looking to construct a dictatorship, either open or hidden"". Who is AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador? The five big issues facing Amlo Some opponents have expressed fears that his leftist and populist policies could damage the already sluggish economy and turn Mexico into ""another Venezuela"",which is suffering a deep economic crisis and rampant inflation. Hailing a ""historic night"", Mr LÃ³pez Obrador called on all Mexicans to reconcile and repeated his campaign pledge to review energy contracts for signs of corruption. ""Corruption is... the result of a decadent political regime. We are absolutely convinced that this evil is the main cause of social and economic inequality, and also that corruption is to blame for the violence in our country,"" he said. He has insisted that no-one involved in corruption will be spared, not even those he calls ""brothers-in-arms"". On combating Mexico's record levels of violence, much of it related to drug cartels, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said he would have daily meetings with his security cabinet, which under him, he said, would be under a ""unified command"". Sunday's election followed one of Mexico's deadliest campaigns in decades with more than 130 political candidates and party workers killed. This video can not be played How should Mexico's new president deal with Trump? During the campaign Mr LÃ³pez Obrador had often used confrontational language when referring to Mr Trump, but struck a more conciliatory note in his victory speech, saying he would seek ""friendly relations"". How the vote was seen in one of the most violent cities A guide to Mexico's drug cartels Five reasons this election matters He also tried to reassure the business sector, saying there would be no nationalisation and that he would respect private business. He also said his government would be fiscally disciplined and taxes would not be raised. On social policies, he said he would double pensions for the elderly upon taking office on 1 December as a first step to reducing Mexico's disparate income levels. Born to a family of shopkeepers on 13 November 1953 in the rural community of TepetitÃ¡n, in southern Tabasco state Known popularly as Amlo, which is an acronym using the full initials of his name Elected Mexico City mayor in 2000 After losing the presidential elections in 2006 and 2012, he ran again this time under a three-party coalition led by the leftist National Regeneration Movement party (Morena) he founded in 2014 The self-styled anti-establishment figure has now ended the dominance of the PRI and PAN parties he called the ""mafia of power"" LÃ³pez Obrador, a winner at last The latest figures from the Mexican electoral institute,externalshow Mr LÃ³pez Obrador has won more than double the votes of his nearest challenger. It is the widest victory since the 1980s. Ricardo Anaya, candidate for the conservative National Action Party (PAN), looked set to be runner-up to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador. ""I recognise his triumph, I express my congratulations, and I wish him the greatest success for the good of Mexico,"" Mr Anaya said. Ruling party candidate JosÃ© Antonio Meade, who lies in third place according to initial results, told supporters that he wished the winner ""the greatest success"". Mr Meade's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has dominated Mexican politics for much of the past century but has slumped in popularity. The electoral institute figures put official turnout at 62.7%. As well as a new president, 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress were elected, in addition to state and local officials. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador's coalition is set to have a majority in the lower house and possibly the Senate. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador had been the candidate most critical of Mr Trump and had said he would make the US president ""see reason"", branding his anti-immigrant policies ""irresponsible"" and ""racist"".

Mr Trump has riled Mexico by saying he will renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and build a wall along the US-Mexico border. His hardline stance on migration - particularly the separation of migrant families at the US border - has brought widespread condemnation. Some 2,000 children remain separated from their migrant parents, despite Mr Trump agreeing to curtail the policy. In his victory speech, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said: ""We will pursue a relationship of friendship and co-operation with the United States, always rooted in mutual respect and in the defence of our fellow Mexicans who live and work honourably in that country.""

Reality Check: The government's customs options Friday's Chequers summit, which will be followed by a White Paper setting out more details, is aimed at finalising the UK's preferred path which can then be put to the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some ministers appeared not to have been involved in drawing up the new proposal, which is being called a ""third way"" after two previous proposals divided opinion. Earlier, government divisions were underlined when Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson intervened in defence of Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had been accused by two other foreign office ministers of ""threatening"" Theresa May over Brexit.

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what the future relationship between the UK and the EU will look like. Key things that have yet to be agreed are how the two sides will trade with each other in years to come - and how to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which is a member of the EU. Before reaching agreement with the EU, Mrs May needs to resolve splits within her cabinet on the shape of Brexit. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The immediate problem with the ""new plan"" is whether or not it really exists. Because while Number 10 says it does, ask other people in government and they are not quite so sure. Ministers who you might have thought would be aware of the detail like - oh, you might imagine - the Brexit secretary had not agreed the lines, before Number 10 made their intervention. And it's said tonight that the reason he has not been involved in agreeing the ""new plan"" is because it does not actually exist yet. The customs decision expected in some parts of government therefore is what has been anticipated for some time as ""max fac plus"" - a souped up version of the proposal that originally won the day in the Brexit subcommittee what feels like a lifetime ago - with, you assume, a long lead-in time while the technology is made to work. Baffled? Quite possibly so. But it's perhaps only safe to say that four days before ministers are expected to actually make some final decisions, all is not precisely as you might have expected. Read the rest of Laura's blog Earlier, she urged the EU to consider her blueprint for future relations ""seriously"" as she updated MPs on last week's Brussels summit. Pressed to give more detail of her plans as she took questions in the Commons, Mrs May said she hoped her vision for the UK's future relations would address the ""real differences"" on the issue of the Irish border. ""The EU and its member states will want to consider our proposals seriously,"" she said. ""We both need to show flexibility to build the deep relationship after we have left that is in the interests of both our peoples."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the cabinet was irrevocably split between different Tory factions. But Mrs May rejected calls to ""pick a side"" between Remainers and Brexiteers, saying: ""I have picked the side of the British people and these are the ones for whom I will deliver."" She is also due to have talks in Berlin with German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of the Chequers meeting. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming Mrs May hopes to resolve cabinet splits on Brexit at a meeting this week Sources in both the European Council and the European Commission deny they have seen a draft of the UK's Brexit White Paper. Officials in Brussels predict it will mostly be a compilation of existing British positions - ""a best of"" is how one described it. Theresa May ""hinted"" at the publication of the document when she addressed EU leaders at their summit last week but she did not elaborate on its contents. Ministers from the remaining 27 member states are planning to respond to the White Paper at a meeting of the General Affairs Council on 20 July. EU officials expect to be going through the document until the end of July. The government has so far talked publicly about two potential customs options. One, a customs partnership, would mean the UK applies the EU's own tariffs and rules of origin to all goods arriving in the country and then hands over what was owed for goods that subsequently end up in the EU. The other, known as maximum facilitation or max-fac, aimed to employ new technology to remove the need for physical customs checks where possible. Brexit: All you need to know It is understood both options have been deemed practically or politically undeliverable and a third option is on the table, believed to involve ""alignment"" with the EU in regulations covering trade in goods but a looser relationship for services. Writing in the Daily Telegraph earlier, Mr Rees-Mogg said,externalhe and other members of the 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs he leads, known as the European Research Group, would reject a deal that did not amount to a clean break with the EU. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? Mr Rees-Mogg said a deal which restricted the UK's ability to make trade agreements with other nations or control migration could not be accepted and Mrs May ""must stick to her righteous cause and deliver what she has said she would"". But, speaking in the Commons, pro-EU MP Anna Soubry said the public were tired of what she said were continual ""fudges"" on key questions and urged Mrs May to stamp her authority once and for all. And her colleague Nicky Morgan said Mrs May ""would not be thanked for the mess we will end up in"" if the government did not prioritise the needs of the economy in a ""pragmatic, sensible, flexible"" Brexit. The Democratic Unionist Party, whose support Theresa May needs to have a majority in key Commons votes, said it would not support any deal which did not give the UK full control over its borders. ""We don't give blank cheques to anybody,"" its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said after meeting the PM for an hour in Downing Street. ""We want to see a proper Brexit which fulfils the referendum result but we have been very clear that it has to be on the basis of the whole of the UK leaving the EU as one."" He accused Dublin and other European capitals of trying to ""bully"" the UK and using the issue of the Northern Irish border to ""create an outcome which is to their liking"", adding ""they won't succeed in that"".

"This video can not be played James Brokenshire tells Andrew Marr he is confident his colleagues can agree a Brexit stance A cabinet minister says he is ""confident"" his colleagues will settle their differences over Brexit at a crunch summit at Chequers on Friday. James Brokenshire said there were ""strong views"" on both sides but predicted the away-day would yield a ""clear direction"" from the UK. Ministers are under increasing pressure to spell out what type of relationship with the EU the UK should pursue. EU chiefs demanded clarity from the UK at last week's Brussels summit. Theresa May has promised more details in a White Paper that will be published after Friday's cabinet get-together at her official country residence. 'Livid' Gove rips up EU customs report Kuenssberg: All eyes on Chequers 'Last call' for Brexit deal, EU warns The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and negotiations are taking place on what their future relationship will look like. But there is disagreement on the UK side about what sort of trading relationship to pursue with the EU, and how closely aligned they should be in years to come. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Brokenshire, the secretary of state for local government and housing, said: ""I think there's no doubt that there are strong views on either side and that's what I would expect as we lead into the discussions on Friday. ""But, equally, I remain confident that we will come out from that meeting with that clear direction, the White Paper that will follow, and actually setting out our vision for our future with our EU partners."" After Brexit day in March 2019, a temporary transition period is planned until the end of 2020 to allow an ""orderly withdrawal"" for the UK. Business Secretary Greg Clark did not rule out an extension to this arrangement, telling Sky News the government had to be ""guided by the evidence"" and avoid ""frictions"" at the border. He said the government would assess how long a new customs system would take to put in place, adding that ""it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence"". Ministers have yet to agree on how to replace the UK's membership of the EU customs union - on Saturday it was revealed Environment Secretary Michael Gove had physically torn apart a report on Theresa May's preferred ""partnership"" arrangement. Brexiteer Conservative MPs have said they will not accept any extension to the transition phase. More than 30 have signed a letter to Mrs May urging her to face down people trying to ""undermine"" the 2016 vote to leave the EU. Their other demands include not replicating the EU's customs union and an end to the free movement of EU citizens. ""Our departure must be absolute,"" the MPs say. ""We must not remain entangled with the EU's institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation.  Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm."" EU leaders have called on Theresa May to spell out her Brexit vision in detail Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, who delivered the letter to the PM, tweeted: ""We must be clear to those in the cabinet and on the back benches, we will not sit back & allow a small minority to dominate."" Eurosceptic former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said Theresa May ""probably doesn't need letters... to tell her what to do"". He added: ""I just think we simply have to get behind her and say, 'let's get her over there and tell the European Union they need to do a trade agreement with us and do it pretty quickly'."" But pro-EU Labour MP Alison McGovern said there was a ""serious"" price attached to the government's negotiating red lines like leaving the EU's single market and customs union. And she said the Chequers meeting was vital. ""We now need to know what it is the cabinet is trying to achieve - so this cannot be more important."" There are also Brexit divisions within the Labour Party, with Jeremy Corbyn urged by some of his MPs to back staying in the EU's single market or support another referendum on the final deal. Campaigners for a so-called ""People's Vote"" have published a survey of members of Unite - the trade union that is Labour's biggest donor - where a majority were in favour of a second referendum. Of almost 1,000 polled by YouGov, 57% backed a second referendum compared with 34% who were against, while respondents believed, by a margin of by a margin of 58% to 21%, that leaving the single market would make Britain worse off. The People's Vote campaign said its survey provided ""clear evidence that workers are turning decisively against the bad Brexit deal emerging from political machinations in Westminster and botched negotiations in Brussels"". Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""It's not our policy to have a second referendum - it's our policy to respect the result of the referendum but to have serious negotiations with the EU to gain a customs union and access to the single market to protect jobs in this country."" He added that one of the reasons people voted to leave the EU was because of the UK's ""deeply unequal society where many former industrial areas lose out very badly because they haven't had the investment they need"".

"This video can not be played Five things you need to know about AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador - known as ""Amlo"" Left-wing candidate AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has claimed victory in Mexico's presidential election, saying ""profound change"" is coming. The ex-Mexico City mayor, known by his initials Amlo, is projected to win about 53%. His rivals have conceded in a crushing defeat for the main parties. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador's key pledge has been to tackle the ""evil"" of corruption. He has also been highly critical of President Donald Trump and ties with the US will now be closely watched. Relations with Washington have been hugely strained, with Mr Trump strongly criticising Mexico over trade and migration. Mr Trump has sent a tweet of congratulations. Late on Sunday, the 64-year-old promised to respect civil liberties and said he was ""not looking to construct a dictatorship, either open or hidden"". Who is AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador? The five big issues facing Amlo Some opponents have expressed fears that his leftist and populist policies could damage the already sluggish economy and turn Mexico into ""another Venezuela"",which is suffering a deep economic crisis and rampant inflation. Hailing a ""historic night"", Mr LÃ³pez Obrador called on all Mexicans to reconcile and repeated his campaign pledge to review energy contracts for signs of corruption. ""Corruption is... the result of a decadent political regime. We are absolutely convinced that this evil is the main cause of social and economic inequality, and also that corruption is to blame for the violence in our country,"" he said. He has insisted that no-one involved in corruption will be spared, not even those he calls ""brothers-in-arms"". On combating Mexico's record levels of violence, much of it related to drug cartels, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said he would have daily meetings with his security cabinet, which under him, he said, would be under a ""unified command"". Sunday's election followed one of Mexico's deadliest campaigns in decades with more than 130 political candidates and party workers killed. This video can not be played How should Mexico's new president deal with Trump? During the campaign Mr LÃ³pez Obrador had often used confrontational language when referring to Mr Trump, but struck a more conciliatory note in his victory speech, saying he would seek ""friendly relations"". How the vote was seen in one of the most violent cities A guide to Mexico's drug cartels Five reasons this election matters He also tried to reassure the business sector, saying there would be no nationalisation and that he would respect private business. He also said his government would be fiscally disciplined and taxes would not be raised. On social policies, he said he would double pensions for the elderly upon taking office on 1 December as a first step to reducing Mexico's disparate income levels. Born to a family of shopkeepers on 13 November 1953 in the rural community of TepetitÃ¡n, in southern Tabasco state Known popularly as Amlo, which is an acronym using the full initials of his name Elected Mexico City mayor in 2000 After losing the presidential elections in 2006 and 2012, he ran again this time under a three-party coalition led by the leftist National Regeneration Movement party (Morena) he founded in 2014 The self-styled anti-establishment figure has now ended the dominance of the PRI and PAN parties he called the ""mafia of power"" LÃ³pez Obrador, a winner at last The latest figures from the Mexican electoral institute,externalshow Mr LÃ³pez Obrador has won more than double the votes of his nearest challenger. It is the widest victory since the 1980s. Ricardo Anaya, candidate for the conservative National Action Party (PAN), looked set to be runner-up to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador. ""I recognise his triumph, I express my congratulations, and I wish him the greatest success for the good of Mexico,"" Mr Anaya said. Ruling party candidate JosÃ© Antonio Meade, who lies in third place according to initial results, told supporters that he wished the winner ""the greatest success"". Mr Meade's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has dominated Mexican politics for much of the past century but has slumped in popularity. The electoral institute figures put official turnout at 62.7%. As well as a new president, 128 senators and 500 deputies in Congress were elected, in addition to state and local officials. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador's coalition is set to have a majority in the lower house and possibly the Senate. Mr LÃ³pez Obrador had been the candidate most critical of Mr Trump and had said he would make the US president ""see reason"", branding his anti-immigrant policies ""irresponsible"" and ""racist"".

Some 2,000 children remain separated from their migrant parents, despite Mr Trump agreeing to curtail the policy.

"There are 135,000 EU students in UK universities - with their status to remain unchanged for at least another year EU students at universities in England, Wales and Scotland will continue to be treated the same as home students in the first intake after Brexit. Education Secretary Damian Hinds says EU students starting in autumn 2019 will pay the same tuition fees as English students and their access to support will be unchanged. This status will last for the duration of their degree courses. Mr Hinds said he wanted to provide ""clarity and certainty"". The Scottish government hasalready made a similar commitment to EU students starting in Scottish universities in autumn 2019- which will mean they will continue to pay no tuition fees. The Welsh government also announced on Monday that EU students starting courses in Wales in 2019 would be treated as home students. For universities, worried about their student numbers and finances, it means there will be no ""cliff edge"" for recruitment from the EU immediately after Brexit in March 2019. It might also be seen as a conciliatory gesture, ahead of negotiations in which the UK's universities hope to maintain access to a share of 100bn euros (Â£89bn) of EU research funding. Should I stay or should I go? EU academics consider their post-Brexit future Where can UK students study for free? The education secretary also repeatedthe prime minister's promise that tuition fees in England will be frozen at Â£9,250while a review is being carried out. But theinterest rate on fees will continue to rise in the autumn to 6.3%. There are about 135,000 EU students in UK universities and vice-chancellors recently called for ""urgent clarification"" about the status of EU students who might apply for courses beginning in autumn 2019. So far there is no long-term decision or reciprocal deal on how UK students in the EU, or EU students in the UK, will be treated post-Brexit. If EU students were to be classified as overseas students, their fees would be much higher which could deter them from studying in the UK. UK universities are waiting to find out about future access to EU research funding It would also be likely to make it more expensive for UK students in EU universities, such as in the Netherlands. But the education secretary has announced a guarantee for EU students applying to universities in England for 2019-20, that they will continue to have ""home fee status"" beyond the UK's departure from the EU. This stretches out funding until the summer of 2023 for those on three-year degree courses. For those applying from the EU in following years, the level of fee is likely to depend on wider Brexit negotiations. EU students in the UK are most concentrated in Russell Group universities, London institutions and in Scotland. At University College London there are more than 4,400 EU students - almost 10% of its total. The University of Edinburgh has 3,600 EU students, about 11% of its total. The London School of Economics has almost 2,000 EU students, representing almost 18% of its students. Cambridge has more than 2,500 EU students, about 13%. Top 10 UK universities with the highest proportion of EU students University of Aberdeen London School of Economics Imperial College London Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh School of Oriental and African Studies, London University of the Arts, London University of Cambridge University of Essex King's College London Edinburgh Napier and University College London Universities UK warned the government in June that it was a ""matter of urgency"" that students from the EU should be given information on future fee levels, otherwise it would put at risk their ""great economic and academic value"". The government has now provided this reassurance for at least the first year after Brexit. ""Students from the EU make an important contribution to the universities sector and it is a testament to our system that so many students from abroad choose to come and study here,"" said Mr Hinds. ""Today we are providing clarity and certainty on their fees for the duration of their courses."" Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said it would provide ""much needed clarity for EU students and for universities"".

"This is the second prison break pulled off by Redoine Faid (pictured in 2010) A notorious gangster is on the run after escaping by helicopter from a prison in the Paris region. Redoine Faid was helped by three heavily-armed men with assault rifles. Two gunmen in balaclavas used smoke bombs and angle-grinders to break into the visitors' room where Faid was talking to his brother. A third man in the prison courtyard guarded the helicopter and its pilot - a flying instructor whom the men had taken hostage. The helicopter flew to the nearby Gonesse area, where it was found by local police. Faid, 46, has been serving a 25-year sentence for a failed robbery during which a police officer was killed. This is the armed robber's second prison break: in 2013, he escaped after seizing four guards as human shields and blowing several doors off with dynamite. He staged that escape less than half an hour after arriving at a prison in northern France, and spent six weeks on the run. The escape helicopter was found in Gonesse, north of Paris Faid escaped from the Sud-Francilien prison outside Paris Nearly 3,000 French police have been drafted into the manhunt, a police source told AFP. ""Everything is being done to locate the fugitive,"" an interior ministry official said. France's Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet, who travelled to the Sud-Francilien prison in RÃ©au on Sunday evening, called it ""a spectacular escape"". ""It was an extremely well-prepared commando unit that may have used drones to survey the area beforehand,"" she said. The prison courtyard where the helicopter landed was the only area not protected by anti-aircraft netting. Prison union representative Martial Delabroye said that was because inmates do not use it, ""except to leave the prison"". Nobody was injured during the jailbreak, which happened at around 11:20 (09:20 GMT) on Sunday. The captured pilot was released, and later taken to hospital suffering from shock. Faid's accomplices had taken the flying instructor hostage at a small flying club in Fontenay-TrÃ©signy, where he was waiting for a student, and ordered him to fly to the prison. Faid initially got out of the helicopter and into a black Renault Megane which was seen heading for the A1 motorway. That getaway car was later found burnt out at a shopping centre car park in Aulnay-sous-Bois, a Paris suburb. Early on Sunday afternoon, the fugitive was said to have swapped to a white van. Born in 1972, Faid grew up in a notoriously rough part of Paris. In the 1990s, he ran a gang involved in armed robbery and extortion in the French capital. He has said his lifestyle was inspired by Hollywood gangster films, including the Al Pacino thriller Scarface. He is devoted to US director Michael Mann's stylised crime thrillers, especially 1995 gangster film Heat. He once approached Mann at a Paris film festival and told him: ""You were my technical adviser."" Faid claimed to have watched the film dozens of times to hone his skills as a bank robber. Forensic police investigate the black car abandoned by Redoine Faid at a shopping centre car park In 2009, Faid wrote a book about his experiences of growing up in Paris's crime-ridden suburbs and graduating into a life of law-breaking. He claimed to have turned his back on criminality, but a year later was involved in the failed robbery which earned him a prison stretch in RÃ©au, in the Seine-et-Marne region. French police have nicknamed the gangster ""L'Ãcrivain"" - ""the writer"" - in a nod to his autobiography and subsequent media tour. One of Faid's most recent prison supervisors said he was never in conflict with guards, but that ""we must always be wary"". ""In the corner of his mind, he never lost the idea of escaping. Behind all his manners - he is very polite - he always hid his game,"" the supervisor said. Faid's cycle of imprisonment and escape began with his arrest in 1998 on multiple counts of armed robbery and bank theft. In 2009 he was freed on parole, swearing that he was a changed man - but by 2011, he had breached his terms of release and was back behind bars. In 2017, Faid was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment for his 2013 jailbreak from SÃ©quedin prison, outside Lille. He was also given 18 years for masterminding a 2010 robbery in which a young policewoman, AurÃ©lie Fouquet, was killed. Faid mounted a failed appeal, and in April 2018 was given a heavier sentence of 25 years for the botched robbery. He was serving that term at the time of his latest escape. The fugitive is not the first to escape a French jail by helicopter. In 2001, three armed robbers fled a prison in Draguignan, southern France,external, after an accomplice hijacked a helicopter from an airfield in nearby St Tropez. Two years later, inmates accused of running an international drugs ring escaped a remand centre near Aix-en-Provence,externalby similar means.
