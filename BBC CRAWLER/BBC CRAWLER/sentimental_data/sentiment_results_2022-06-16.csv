"Free Covid tests and Â£500 isolation payments for those eligible are set to end in Wales In a couple of weeks isolation support payments, free Covid tests and extra sick pay for social care workers are due to end in Wales. The Welsh government said the vaccine programme had made it possible to ""learn to live safely alongside coronavirus"". Under new plans to cope with the virus in the long term, ill people will be asked to stay at home ""where possible"". But with many grappling with soaring living costs, how realistic is this? From tradespeople who cannot work from home to people with health conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, there is concern at what the changes will mean. Rules on masks and self-isolation end in Wales Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What's the guidance if I have Covid now? Professor Richard Stanton, a virologist from Cardiff University, believes large-scale Covid isolation has come to an end. ""We can't really expect people to stay at home if they can't test for Covid, if [the Welsh government] haven't got the money to support them to do that,"" he toldBBC Wales Live. Professor Richard Stanton says he thinks a new wave of Omicron is likely Prof Stanton thinks a new wave of the omicron variant is likely and although it will not be comparable to the height of the pandemic, it does bring risks. ""The big risks right now are that a significant proportion of people who catch the virus may go on to get long Covid... or they may well spread it to vulnerable relatives who may get sick with it,"" Prof Stanton added. He believes the best way to mitigate the spread of Covid is to focus on ventilation in workplaces and on public transport. Emma Watkins said she could not afford to stay home if she was ill Care assistant Emma Watkins recently moved to Plymouth with her partner and is expecting a baby. Ms Watkins, from Port Talbot, said she would have to go to work if she felt unwell as she could not survive on statutory sick pay. ""I literally can't afford to get ill because I'm still paying old debts off,"" she said. ""I know it's a bit hard to say but if I'm ill I still need to go in, and obviously we've got PPE and masks and all that."" Ms Watkins would be worried about putting others at risk but said if she did not pay her rent she would be homeless. ""I'd need to be on my death bed not to go in to work because I genuinely can't afford it,"" she said. ""I was on sick a couple of years back when I broke my foot and I had to take my cast off just to go back to work to get my bills sorted because I was having letters left, right and centre off debt collectors."" Angelo Sperandeo, a window and door fitter from Cardiff, said considering whether to go to work in the future if he felt unwell would pose a difficult decision because he cannot work from home. Angelo Sperandeo is unable to work from home and would be forced to go to work while ill ""I'd personally go to work because I'd have no choice really. I'd obviously be thinking of people I'd be in contact with,"" he said. ""You just try and get on with life as best you can but it's always at the back of your mind."" Alex Osborne, from Caerphilly, has multiple sclerosis (MS) and a weakened immune system. Despite having had Covid vaccinations, she said it was unlikely to give her protection because of the regular MS treatment she has. Alex Osborne wants free Covid tests to be made available to immunosuppressed people ""It brings an extra level of worry now,"" said Ms Osborne. ""People might not have any symptoms but I still ask people to check before I invite them into my house. ""If people can no longer do that for me and people like me, that's our safety net that we were using to feel comfortable meeting peopleâ¦ and now it's kind of being removed from us."" Ms Osborne said she wanted free Covid tests to be made available to immunosuppressed people so they can give them to people they are spending time with. David Bailey, chair of the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said scrapping free testing would create a ""two-tier system"" where those unable to pay are ""forced to gamble on the health of themselves and others"". ""Along with free testing for people with symptoms, it is therefore crucial that governments continue to advise symptomatic people to isolate,"" he said. Stacey Rodd, an NHS administrator from Cardiff, said she would probably stay away from the workplace if she felt ill. Stacey Rodd says she has the luxury of being able to work from home, but not everybody does ""I've got the luxury of being able to work from home. Other people haven't, my other half can't, he works in a shop and if he's not there the shop doesn't run,"" she said. ""It's making that call and just being sensible really. There are still vulnerable people about."" The Wales TUC (Trades Union Congress) said the advice to stay home if possible was ""not practical"" for tens of thousands of workers in Wales. Its general secretary, Shavannah Taj, wants the UK government to increase statutory sick pay and the Welsh government to reverse the planned scrapping of enhanced sick pay for social care workers brought in during the pandemic. Wales TUC general secretary Shavannah Taj says some workers will be stuck between a ""rock and a hard place"" ""There's a cost of living emergency, people have no choice at the moment,"" she said. ""You're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Let's learn something from the pandemic, let's do better."" The Welsh government said: ""Thanks to the success of our vaccine programme and the way people across Wales have helped to keep each other safe over the last two years, we are now able to move beyond the emergency response to the pandemic and learn to live safely alongside coronavirus. ""Whilst we have gradually and carefully moved away from the legal protections, we are keeping guidance in place to help people manage the virus. This includes the recommendation to stay at home if you are sick to stop the illness spreading. ""We have set out our plans for testing and we will keep this under review."" The UK government said: ""It is up to employers to determine their sick pay policies and many employers choose to pay more than the minimum level of statutory sick pay. ""The welfare system provides a strong financial safety net to those who are unwell for longer periods or disabled.""

"This video can not be played 'This isn't tough coaching and slight mistreatment' - reaction to the Whyte Review Warning: This article contains some description of graphic injuries and abuse. Issues of physical and emotional abuse within gymnastics in Britain were ""systemic"", an independent investigation has found. The Whyte Review, co-commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, was released on Thursday and found gymnast wellbeing and welfare ""has not been at the centre of British Gymnastics' culture"". Athletes were made to train on injuries, punished for needing the toilet, sat on by coaches, shouted and sworn at and had their bags searched for food. The review said the difficulties now facing British Gymnastics, the sport's national governing body, are ""borne of inadequate practice and procedure"", and reflect a culture which was the product of ""the way in which people behaved and were allowed to behave"". 'This was child abuse' - gymnasts react to report 'Gymnastics abuse again shows darker side of sport' The Sports Desk podcast: Will this be a turning point for welfare in sport? There was a sense, it added, that British Gymnastics had ""not only failed to prevent or limit such behaviours but had condoned some of them in the pursuit of national and international competitive success"". The former chief executive of British Gymnastics, Jane Allen,who retired in December 2020, was criticised in the report for a ""lack of leadership"" and an ""organisational failure to appreciate the central importance of athlete welfare"". In a statement, she said she was ""deeply sorry I didn't do more for everyone - especially the athletes - to feel supported, able to speak up and heard"". The Whyte Review was commissioned in 2020 following allegations of abuse and mistreatment within gymnastics in Britain. UK Sport and Sport England said they ""welcomed"" the report and ""accepted and endorsed"" its recommendations - adding gymnastics' continued funding will ""depend on its new leadership teams making significant changes to the sport"" in the timeline set out in the Whyte Review. British Gymnastics said it wanted to ""wholeheartedly apologise"" to gymnasts who had suffered and that it would ""not shy away from doing what is needed"". In addition to her 17 recommendations, Anne Whyte QC said a sports ombudsman would be ""an obvious step in the right direction"". She also stipulated that the British Gymnastics board publish details of its progress in complying with her recommendations at six, 12 and 24-month intervals, with the expectation that ""most if not all of them"" are implemented within two years. In the report, Whyte said: ""I hope that the findings in this report will allow the gymnast community to feel that the failures of the past have been publicly recognised and enable the sport to move forward and make positive changes."" She added: ""I am confident that the sport of gymnastics is already undergoing change for the good."" Welsh Gymnastics appoints safeguarding adviser The review, which focused on the period from August 2008 to August 2020, received more than 400 submissions, including 133 from current and former gymnasts, and conducted 190 interviews. Of those 400-plus submissions: More than 40% described physically abusive behaviour towards gymnasts by coaches, including physical chastisement, inappropriate training on injury, overstretching to the point of distress and withholding food, water and access to the toilet. More than 50% reported an element of emotional abuse by coaches, such as swearing, name calling, use of belittling language and gaslighting. Some 30 submissions included allegations of sexual abuse, such as sexual assault, sexual remarks, inappropriate touching and kissing as a punishment. More than 25% included reference to excessive weight management. The review states the ""vast majority"" of reports about physically and emotionally abusive behaviour related to female gymnasts, and such behaviour was more prevalent at the elite end of the sport. On weight management, it said ""the tyranny of the scales was coach-led and quite unnecessary"". No individual coaches were named in the report, in which Whyte said the scale of emotional abuse was ""far larger than British Gymnastics had appreciated"". During the 12-year period covered by the review - during which British Gymnastics received more than Â£38m in UK Sport funding - the governing body received approximately 3,800 complaints. The review also pointed to the recruitment of coaches from, or from countries influenced by, the former Soviet Union, whose ""technical skill and experience was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities"". Anecdotes from submissions include: One former elite gymnast described being made to stand on the beam for two hours because she was frightened to attempt a skill. Some gymnasts were strapped to bars for extended periods of time while others were made to climb the rope because they needed the toilet or exceeded a break time. One gymnast was deliberately dropped from equipment and dragged across the gym floor by their arms, while others were pressured to train on injuries, including broken bones. One gymnast recalls at the age of seven being sat on by a coach, while a parent reported two coaches at once pushing their child's legs down into a split. An international competitor recalled their coach sitting on a gymnast's back, forcing their hips into the floor and then lifting up their knee. Verbal comments made to gymnasts included that they were ""a waste of space"", ""a joke"" and ""pathetic"" - while in relation to excessive weight management, comments included ""you look like a whale"", ""you look like you have a beer belly"", and ""your thighs are disgusting"". Some coaches went to damaging length to control what gymnasts ate and weighed. Gymnasts had their weights publicly announced, were told to send photographs to prove they had lost weight, and had their lunch packs and bags searched for food. Gymnasts would hide food, including in ceiling tiles, and were told ""not to eat grapes"" because ""they are the highest-fat fruit"". As a result, a ""significant"" number of gymnasts developed dysfunctional relationships with food, weight and body image, and reports of purging were not uncommon in the submissions. Whyte said the ""unacceptable culture"" described in the report ""will not be fully eradicated until the national and international leadership within the sport publicly recognise its existence"". Recommendations to British Gymnastics focus on four key areas: safeguarding and welfare, complaints handling, standards and educations, and governance and oversight. The recommendations include: All club owners and managers should have mandatory safeguarding training, and high-performance gymnasts should have access to an independent disclosure service and dedicated welfare officer outside their club. British Gymnastics must have a fit-for-purpose case management system that covers number and nature of complaints, and must ensure all welfare-related complaints about employed coaches are independently investigated. The organisation should appoint a director of education and increase its direct contact with registered clubs. British Gymnastics must appoint independent board members with relevant expertise. A joint statement from UK Sport and Sport England said: ""The gymnasts' experiences shared in this review are harrowing and distressing to read. No-one in sport should ever be subjected to such abuse. ""We want to publicly acknowledge and thank all of those who were courageous in coming forward. Your voices are heard. You have played a vital part in fundamentally shaping the future of gymnastics in Britain, to help make it safe and inclusive for future generations to come. ""Duty of care to athletes and participants is the responsibility of national governing bodies. British Gymnastics clearly fell short of this. ""At this time, our intention is to continue to fund British Gymnastics, as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now. ""However, we are clear that continued funding for British Gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport, to the timelines set out in the report's recommendations."" British Gymnastics' chief executive Sarah Powell, who has been in the post since October, said gymnasts' experiences as detailed in the review were ""not acceptable"" and she found the report ""emotional"" reading. She said it was a ""watershed moment"" for not just gymnastics, but safeguarding across all sports. ""Gymnastics will be different because of the bravery of the gymnasts who stood up,"" she said. In a statement, she said: ""British Gymnastics accepts all of the recommendations and key findings. We will not shy away from doing what is needed. ""I want to wholeheartedly apologise to the gymnasts who have suffered as a result of us not working to the standards we set ourselves. We are sorry."" She added: ""Let me be clear; there is no place for abuse of any kind in our sport and coaching standards of the past will not be those of the future. ""We will build a new culture and ensure the gymnast's voice is at the heart of all we do. We will change gymnastics for the better."" UK Sport and Sport England commissioned the independent review - led by Anne Whyte QC - in July 2020 after allegations of mistreatment in gymnastics. The review formally began the following month. The review assessed whether: Gymnasts' wellbeing and welfare is (and has been) at the centre of the culture of British Gymnastics, its registered clubs and member coaches and if not, why not. Safeguarding concerns and complaints have been dealt with appropriately in the sport of gymnastics and if not, why not. Gymnasts, or their parents, carers or guardians, have felt unable to raise complaints with appropriate authorities and if so, why. The review also investigated the ""nature and volume of complaints received by British Gymnastics"", the governing body's approach to resolving the complaints, and its culture and practices. The Whyte Review report did not mention individual coaches or athletes. July 2020:Nicole Pavieris among a number of gymnasts to make the first allegations of a ""culture of fear"" within the ""mentally and emotionally abusive"" sport of gymnastics. OlympiansBecky and Ellie Downiesay abusive behaviour in gymnastics training became ""ingrained"" and ""completely normalised"", while then-British Gymnastics chief executive Jane Allen says she is ""appalled and ashamed"" by the allegations. Olympic bronze medallistAmy Tinklercriticises British Gymnastics for the time it has taken to investigate a formal complaint she made in 2019. A helpline is launched by the NSPCC and British Athletes Commission to support gymnasts. It receives more than 120 calls in its first five weeks. August 2020:The Whyte Review is formally started.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury said it was a ""source of shame"" the Church had profited from the slave trade The Archbishop of Canterbury has apologised after research showed the Church of England's investment fund has links to the slave trade. The investigation, initiated by the Church Commissioners, a charity managing the Church's investment portfolio, revealed that for more than 100 years the fund invested large sums of money in a company responsible for transporting slaves. The fund, known in the 18th century as Queen Anne's Bounty, has now developed into a Â£10.1bn investment trust. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he was ""deeply sorry for the links"". Welby criticises delay in removing slavery plaque Welby tells Church not to use NDAs amid racism row Clergy speak out over 'racism in Church of England' Queen Anne's Bounty was formed in 1704 to help support poor clergy. An examination of its accounts in 1739 showed Â£204,000 (estimated to be worth Â£443m today) had been invested in the South Sea Company. The South Sea Company had an exclusive contract to transport slaves from Africa to Spanish colonies in South America for more than 30 years from the 1710s. It shipped tens of thousands of slaves, with the research suggesting that an estimated 15% of them died en route. Church investments in the South Sea Company continued well into the 19th century. The archbishop said: ""This abominable trade took men, women and children created in God's image and stripped them of their dignity and freedom. ""The fact that some within the Church actively supported and profited from it is a source of shame. ""It is only by facing this painful reality that we can take steps towards genuine healing and reconciliation - the path that Jesus Christ calls us to walk."" On the one hand, the Church of England has celebrated its hand in helping bring about an end to slavery, citing the role played by Anglican Evangelical, William Wilberforce. On the other, it has had to acknowledge more and more the extent to which it profited from slavery. In recent years, the Church has apologised for dozens of its clergymen having been revealed to have owned slaves. It has said sorry because its missionary organisation, The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, owned a plantation in Barbados, branding its slaves across the chest with the word SOCIETY. Now by its own research, it has acknowledged that for decades its investment fund poured almost all its money - aside from what it used to buy land - into a company that had a monopoly on transporting slaves to South America. With more than half of the worldwide Anglican communion now based in Africa, these admissions will be made all the more uncomfortable. The Church of England initiated this investigation with a view to being more open about its historic dealings and says a group will now be convened to decide what its response should be. But a spokesperson would not be drawn on whether that meant more than further statements and prayers, or whether it would include discussions about financial reparations. The research also found that the fund received numerous contributions from individuals linked to, or who profited from, transatlantic slavery and the plantation economy. The archbishop added: ""I pray for those affected by this news and hope that we may work together to discern a new way forward."" The Bishop of Birmingham, the Right Reverend David Urquhart, a member of the Church Commissioners' board and chair of the group overseeing the research, said the body would use the knowledge learned from the investigation to ensure its was at the ""forefront of responsible investment globally"".

"Should Wales move away from sheep, wet weather and rugby motifs? Wales needs a rebrand in order to get away from ""sheep, wet weather and... rugby,"" tourism industry bosses have said. Zip World director Sean Taylor made the plea while saying the country should instead promote adventure tourism, food and drink and heritage sites. Focusing on culture and Welsh would also attract visitors, other bosses told the Welsh Affairs Committee. Mr Taylor told MPs he thought Wales got ""overshadowed quite a bit"". He added: ""You've got the Royal Family down in London, you've got tartan and Loch Ness in Scotland and in Ireland you've got Guinness. ""If you look at the brand in Wales it is fairly weak compared to the Irish brand and the Scottish brand in particular. ""I think we definitely need to get away from sheep, wet weather and - even as a president of my local rugby club - rugby as well, because football has come to the fore now."" Wales tourism tax 'will turn people away' Tax hikes make holiday lets in Wales 'unviable' Popular Snowdonia car park will be pre-book Other suggestions from tourism bosses included more use of the country's Welsh name Cymru, rather than the English version Wales. ""The language needs to be weaponised as an advantage, not a threat,"" Mr Taylor added. ""I feel like there's often negative connotations about the language. But our international and English visitors love the use of the Welsh language. ""We get school groups from England and by the time they leave they can say 'bore da', 'prynhawn da', 'croeso'. They love it, they embrace it."" Adventure tourism, such as that on offer in Snowdonia National Park, should be highlighted more, industry leaders say Zip World now has five locations in Wales, including Penrhyn Quarry, described as the fastest zip line in the world. Portmeirion Cymru's Ian Roberts said tourists who come to their Italian influenced tourist village near Porthmadog, enjoy hearing Welsh being spoken, hearing that it is vibrant and alive. ""We've always put a strong emphasis on the culture, tradition and the language. Over 90% of the people who work in Portmeirion speak Welsh,"" he said. ""We think it could be used more, including the use of the term Cymru other than Wales,"" he added. The business leaders, who included Paul Lewin from Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railway and Penderyn Distillery chief executive Stephen Davies called on the Welsh government to increase its tourism budget. A spokeswoman for the Welsh government said: ""Wales is known as a nation that offers world-leading adventure, creative culture, a thriving language and outstanding protected landscapes. ""The focus of the Cymru Wales brand is on marketing Wales' standout strengths as a country, and showcasing them to people across the world."" Paul Lewin from FFestiniog and Welsh Highland Railway wants the message to focus more on ""the wonderful scenery"" They want better communication about Wales' identity and why people should visit. The calls come as the latest figures on overseas visitors to Wales show the impact of the Covid pandemic. There was an 89% drop in overseas visitors staying overnight in Wales in 2021, compared to 2019. There were 116,000 overnight visits to Wales, according to the International Passenger Survey figures, published by ONS. Meanwhile, Cardiff was the 17th in the top 20 towns and cities in the UK, outside London, for visits by foreign tourists, with 35,000 overnight stays. This was below Coventry, Luton and Nottingham, but above Sheffield, Chester and Bath. Manchester was top, overtaking Edinburgh for the first time. Mr Lewin, who manages the UK's longest heritage railway, said: ""What is common to all the tourist attractions in Wales is the setting. It is the wonderful environment, the wonderful scenery and how accessible it is compared to many other places."" Penderyn's Mr Davies, who exports Welsh single malt whisky to over 40 countries, said he did not get the sense Wales was ""selling itself"". ""There's a huge opportunity to improve communication with visitors that do come into Wales, because they've come here, they've made the effort. Let's keep them here or bring them back.""

"Like many Ukrainians trying to leave Russian-occupied areas, Andriy was forced to go through a process called filtration Ukrainians who want to leave cities under Russian occupation cannot do so without undergoing a terrifying process known as filtration. Phones are searched, social media accounts scoured. Anything deemed incriminating can lead to beatings, civilians say, and many are forcefully sent to Russia. Andriy watched anxiously as Russian soldiers connected his mobile to their computer, trying to restore some files. Andriy, a 28-year-old marketing officer, was attempting to leave Mariupol. He had deleted everything he thought a Russian soldier could use against him, such as text messages discussing Russia's invasion of Ukraine or photos of the devastation in his city caused by weeks of relentless shelling. But the internet in Mariupol, a once bustling port in southern Ukraine, had been cut off as part of the siege imposed by Russia, and Andriy had not been able to take down some of his posts on social media. He remembered the first days of the war, when he had shared some anti-Russian messages and speeches from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. ""I'm screwed,"" he thought. The soldiers, Andriy said, already had their focus on him. On that day in early May, when he first joined the queues for filtration in Bezimenne, a small village to the east of Mariupol, one of the Russians noticed his beard. The soldier, Andriy said, instantly assumed it was a sign that he was a fighter with the Azov regiment, a former militia in the city which once had links with the far right. ""Is it you and your brigade killing our guys?,"" Andriy was asked. He replied he had never served in the army, he started working directly after graduating, but ""they didn't want to hear it"". As the soldiers went through his phone, they turned to his political views, and asked his opinion of Zelensky. Andriy, cautiously, said Zelensky was ""okay"", and one of the soldiers wanted to know what he meant by that. Andriy told him Zelensky was just another president, not very different from those who had come before, and that in fact, he was not very interested in politics. ""Well,"" the soldier replied, ""you should just say you aren't interested in politics."" They kept Andriy's phone and told him to wait outside. He met his grandmother, mother and aunt, who had arrived with him and had already been given a document that allowed them to leave. A few minutes later, Andriy said, he was ordered to go to a tent where members of Russia's security service, the FSB, were carrying out further checks. Five officers were sitting behind a desk, three wearing balaclavas. They showed Andriy a video he had shared on Instagram of a speech Zelensky had given, from 1 March. With it was a caption written by Andriy: ""A president we can be proud of. Go home with your warship!"" One of the officers took the lead. ""You told us you're neutral to politics, but you support the Nazi government,"" Andriy recalled being told. ""He hit me in the throat. He basically started the beating."" Andriy said the soldiers found out he had shared speeches of President Zelensky after connecting his phone to their computer Like Andriy, Dmytro had his phone confiscated at a checkpoint as he tried to leave Mariupol in late March. Dmytro, a 34-year-old history teacher, said the soldiers came across the word ""ruscist"", a play on ""Russia"" and ""fascist"", in a message to a friend. The soldiers, Dmytro told me, slapped and kicked him, and ""everything [happened] because I used that word."" Dmytro said he was taken, with four other people, to a police station in the village of Nikolsky, also a filtration point. ""The highest-ranking officer punched me four times in the face,"" he said. ""It seemed to be part of the procedure"". His interrogators said teachers like him were spreading pro-Ukrainian propaganda. They also asked what he thought about ""the events of 2014"", the year that Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and started supporting pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. He replied that the conflict was known as the Russo-Ukrainian war. ""They said Russia was not involved, and asked me whether I agreed that it was, in fact, a Ukrainian civil war."" The officers checked his phone again, and this time found a photo of a book which had the letter H in its title. ""We got you!"" the soldiers told Dmytro. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, claims his war in Ukraine is an effort to ""de-Nazify"" the country, and the soldiers, Dmytro said, believed he was reading books about Hitler. The next morning, Dmytro was transferred with two women to a prison in Starobesheve, a separatist-controlled village in Donetsk. He counted 24 people in the four-bunk cell. After four days and another detailed interrogation, he was finally released, and eventually reached Ukrainian-held territory. Weeks later, he still does not know what happened to his cell mates. Back inside the tent in Bezimenne, Andriy noticed two other people with their hands tied behind them, who had been left in a corner while the officers paid attention to him. ""They started to beat me way harder,"" Andriy told me, ""everywhere"". At one point, after a blow to the stomach, he felt as if he was about to faint. He managed to sit on a chair. ""I wondered what would be better,"" he said, ""to lose consciousness and fall down or tolerate the pain further."" At least, Andriy thought, he had not been taken somewhere else, away from his family. Ukrainian officials say thousands of people are believed to have been sent to detention centres and camps set up in Russian-controlled areas during filtration. In almost all cases, their relatives do not know where they are being held, or why. ""I [was] very angry about everything,"" Andriy said, ""but, at the same time, I know it could've been much worse."" His mother tried to get into the tent, but was stopped by the officers. ""She was very nervous. She later said they had told her that my 're-education' had started,"" Andriy said, ""and that she shouldn't be worried."" His ordeal, he told me, continued for two and a half hours. He was even forced to make a video saying ""Glory to the Russian army!"", a mockery of ""Slava Ukraini!"", the Ukrainian slogan. The final question, Andriy said, was whether he had ""understood his mistakes"", and ""I obviously answered yes"". As he was being released, officers brought in another man, who had previously served in Ukraine's military and had several tattoos. ""They immediately pushed him to the ground and started to beat him,"" Andriy said. ""They didn't even talk to him."" ""I even try to justify the process somehow. Try to convince myself there's some logic,"" Andriy said about filtration Ukrainian authorities say Russian forces and Russian-backed separatists have carried out filtration in occupied territories as an attempt to establish residents' possible links with the military, law enforcement and even local government, as the invading forces try to restore services and infrastructure. Men of fighting age are particularly targeted, checked for bruises that could suggest recent use of weapons, such as on the fingers and shoulders. Strip searches are common, witnesses say, including for women. Oleksandra Matviychuk, the head of the Center for Civil Liberties, a Kyiv-based human rights group, said the process, even when not violent, was ""inhuman"". ""There's no military need for this... They're trying to occupy the country with a tool I call 'immense pain of civilian people'. You ask: 'Why so much cruelty? For what?'"" Maksym, a 48-year-old steelworker, said he was forced to strip naked while officers in Bezimenne checked even the seams of his clothes. He was asked whether he was from the Azov regiment or was a Nazi sympathiser - he denied being either - and why he wanted to leave Mariupol. ""I said, 'Actually, it's you who are on Ukrainian soil.'"" One of the officers, who he said were all Russian, reacted by hitting Maksym with the gun butt in his chest. He fell. ""I leaned my head on the ground, holding my ribs. I couldn't get up,"" he said. ""It was very painful to breathe."" He was taken to what he described as a ""cage"", where others were being held. He noticed that one man, a weightlifter, had a tattoo of Poseidon, the Greek god, with a trident. The soldiers, Maksym said, thought it was the Ukrainian coat of arms. ""He explained it to them but they didn't understand."" Those detained in the ""cage"" were given no water or food, and had to urinate in a corner in front of everyone, Maksym told me. At one point, exhausted, he tried to sleep on the ground. An officer came in and kicked him in the back, forcing him to stand. People would be taken to be interrogated and, when they returned, ""you saw the person had been beaten,"" Maksym said. He witnessed a woman in her 40s lying in pain, apparently after being hit in the stomach. A man, who seemed to be around 50, had a bleeding lip and red bruises on his neck. Maksym believed he had been strangled. No-one in the ""cage"" asked or said anything to each other. They were afraid that FSB officers could be disguised as prisoners. After about four or five hours, Maksym was released and allowed to leave Mariupol. Days later, he reached safety in Ukrainian-controlled territory, and went to a hospital to treat the persistent pain in his chest. The diagnosis: four broken ribs. Yuriy Belousov, who leads the Department of War at the Ukrainian general prosecutor's office, said his team had received allegations of torture and even killings during filtration. ""[It seems to be] a Russian policy which was designed in advance, and pretty well prepared,"" he told me. ""It's definitely not just a single case or [something] done by a local military guy."" He acknowledged it was difficult to verify the cases, or estimate the scale of the violence. The Ukrainian authorities are unable to carry out investigations in occupied territories and most victims remain reluctant to share their stories, concerned that relatives in Mariupol could be targeted if their identity is exposed. Vadym, 43, who used to work at a state-owned company in Mariupol, said he was tortured in Bezimenne in March. Separatist soldiers had questioned his wife after finding out she had ""liked"" the Ukrainian army page on Facebook, and restoring a receipt on her phone of a donation she had made to them. ""I tried to stand up for her,"" he said, ""but was knocked down."" He got up, but was beaten once more. A pattern, he said, that happened again and again. When Russian soldiers realised where he worked, they took Vadym to a different building. There, Vadym said, separatist soldiers asked him ""stupid things"" and started to beat him. ""They used electricity. I almost died. I fell and choked on my dental fillings, which had come out from my teeth,"" Vadym said. He vomited and fainted. ""They were furious. When I recovered consciousness, they told me to clean everything up and continued to give me electric shocks."" The torture, Vadym said, only stopped after Russian officers intervened. They carried out another round of questioning before finally freeing him. As Vadym left the building, he saw a young woman, who had been identified during the process as a court clerk, being carried out. ""A plastic bag was put on her head, and her hands were tied,"" Vadym said. ""Her mother was on her knees, begging for her daughter not to be taken away."" Vadym's release came with a condition: he would have to go to Russia. About 1.2 million people in Ukraine, including thousands of Mariupol residents, have been sent to Russia against their will since the invasion began in February, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia denies it is carrying out a mass deportation, which would constitute a war crime under international humanitarian law, and says it is simply helping those who want to go. Ukraine rejects this claim. Some of those sent to Russia have managed to escape to other countries and even return to Ukraine. How many, remains unclear. Vadym, with the help of his friends, moved to another European country - he did not want to reveal the exact location. He had lost some of his vision, he told me, and doctors said this was a result of head injuries from the beating. ""I feel better now, but rehabilitation will take a long time."" I asked him what he thought about filtration. ""They separate families. People are being disappeared,"" he said. ""It's pure terror."" Russia's defence ministry did not respond to several requests for comment on the allegations. The Russian government has previously denied it is carrying out war crimes in Ukraine. Andriy said his mother was told by a Russian soldier that he was going through ""re-education"" Andriy and his family have now settled in Germany, after also having been forced to go to Russia. Looking back, he believes the occupying forces seemed to be using filtration to show their ""absolute power"". Soldiers, he said, acted as if it was a ""type of entertainment"", something to ""satisfy their own ego"". I told him about another Ukrainian I had met, a 60-year-old retired engineer called Viktoriia. A soldier found out she had added a Ukrainian flag to her profile photo on Facebook, she said, and the message ""Ukraine above all."" He pointed his gun at her, she told me, and threatened: ""I'll put you in the basement until you rot!"" He then kicked her. Viktoriia struggled to understand why he had acted like that. ""What did I do? What right did they have?"" Andriy said he could not explain such behaviour. ""I even try to justify the process somehow. Try to convince myself there's some logic."" But, he said, ""there's no logic"".

"A deep-cover Russian spy tried to infiltrate the International Criminal Court (ICC), the security service of the Netherlands says. The man used the name Viktor Muller Ferreira and pretended to be Brazilian but was refused entry as he arrived to start work in the Netherlands. Authorities say his real name is Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov and he is a spy for the GRU - Russian military intelligence. The man is said to have spent years building a fake identity, before applying for an internship at the ICC in The Hague. The Dutch security agency, the AIVD, said if he had been successful in taking up the position and infiltrate the organisation, he could have done real damage. ""The threat posed by this intelligence officer is deemed potentially very high,"" it said in a statement. To those who knew him, Viktor Muller Ferreira was a Brazilian with an interest in international affairs. But in reality, the AIVD said, he was a particular type of Russian spy known as an ""illegal"". Russian intelligence uses the name to differentiate such officers from ""legal"" spies who are posing undercover as diplomats. Many countries use spies pretending to be ordinary people but Russia has long specialised in a type of deep-cover illegal agent who takes on an entirely different nationality. These spies pretend to be American, British, Canadian or - in the case of Ferreira  - Brazilian to allow them to move in circles where Russians would be met with suspicion and therefore find it harder to operate. Why Russia's military intelligence force is feared What is the International Criminal Court? The AIVD has published an extraordinary document believed to be written by Cherkasov around 2010, in which he outlines his fake identity, likely to remind him of his own cover story. ""I am Viktor Muller Ferreira,"" it begins. The discovery of such a document suggests a remarkable degree of sloppiness by the spy. Over four pages it goes through his family story. ""My farther (sic) came across as a very friendly and open person, but to my surprise I discovered that I blamed him for the deaths of my mother and my aunt and all the difficulties and humiliations I had to suffer in my life,"" one line reads. He also made a reference to having to go to Ireland for the funeral of his father. It can take between five and 10 years for an illegal agent to be trained and build their cover. Given the challenges, there are not thought to be many out there - perhaps less than 30 from the GRU, according to Western estimates. Dutch security agency AIVD said if the spy had been successful in infiltrating the ICC, he could have done real damage Russian intelligence has long targeted the ICC, and Ferreira is understood to have begun pushing for an internship late last year. The court's importance has grown since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. On 3 March the ICC prosecutor openedan investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanityin Ukraine. The ICC offers some 200 unpaid internships which give candidates the opportunity to ""gain exposure to the day-to-day working environment of the ICC, and to put their knowledge and experience into practise under the supervision of working professionals."" The position would have provided him with valuable access. ""If the intelligence officer had succeeded in commencing employment with the ICC, he would have been able to gather intelligence there and to look for (or recruit) sources, and arrange to have access to the ICC's digital systems,"" the AIVD said in a statement. That way he would have been able to provide a significant contribution to the intelligence that the GRU is seeking. He might also have been able to influence criminal proceedings of the ICC."" Applying was a risk for a deep-cover spy, but it's one his bosses in Moscow must have felt was worth taking. Illegals are notoriously hard to find - he is not thought to have been spotted by the ICC - and Dutch authorities did not say how he was identified. Ukraine: The spy war within the war Behind the spiesâ attempts to stop the war Social media profiles reviewed by the BBC and which are believed to belong to Ferreira reveal an extensive list of friends - including a number of international students from two institutions which he appears to have attended - Johns Hopkins University in the US and Trinity College, in Dublin, Ireland. Those friends have gone on to work everywhere from investment bank Goldman Sachs to think tanks and federal regulatory agencies in Washington DC. They will not have known he was a Russian spy. ""He had some accent which I couldn't place. But it wasn't Russian,"" an academic who taught him told the BBC. Ferreira is thought to have applied to the ICC as early as September 2020 but the application may have been delayed due to Covid. ""Brazil is underrepresented in ICC, so that might be my chance!,"" Ferreira said at one point. One profile says Ferreira moved to Washington DC in August 2018 and a record shows him graduating from Johns Hopkins in 2020. Postings on social media reveal an eclectic mix of views including some which are mildly critical of Russia, which could be interpreted as an attempt to continue to build his cover. In one case, his account appears to have even posted a report from the Bellingcat investigative group about uncovering identities online used by the GRU, a rather unusual move for someone who now stands accused of being an undercover GRU operative himself. His cover now blown though, his future as a deep-cover spy will be over.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury said it was a ""source of shame"" the Church had profited from the slave trade The Archbishop of Canterbury has apologised after research showed the Church of England's investment fund has links to the slave trade. The investigation, initiated by the Church Commissioners, a charity managing the Church's investment portfolio, revealed that for more than 100 years the fund invested large sums of money in a company responsible for transporting slaves. The fund, known in the 18th century as Queen Anne's Bounty, has now developed into a Â£10.1bn investment trust. The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he was ""deeply sorry for the links"". Welby criticises delay in removing slavery plaque Welby tells Church not to use NDAs amid racism row Clergy speak out over 'racism in Church of England' Queen Anne's Bounty was formed in 1704 to help support poor clergy. An examination of its accounts in 1739 showed Â£204,000 (estimated to be worth Â£443m today) had been invested in the South Sea Company. The South Sea Company had an exclusive contract to transport slaves from Africa to Spanish colonies in South America for more than 30 years from the 1710s. It shipped tens of thousands of slaves, with the research suggesting that an estimated 15% of them died en route. Church investments in the South Sea Company continued well into the 19th century. The archbishop said: ""This abominable trade took men, women and children created in God's image and stripped them of their dignity and freedom. ""The fact that some within the Church actively supported and profited from it is a source of shame. ""It is only by facing this painful reality that we can take steps towards genuine healing and reconciliation - the path that Jesus Christ calls us to walk."" On the one hand, the Church of England has celebrated its hand in helping bring about an end to slavery, citing the role played by Anglican Evangelical, William Wilberforce. On the other, it has had to acknowledge more and more the extent to which it profited from slavery. In recent years, the Church has apologised for dozens of its clergymen having been revealed to have owned slaves. It has said sorry because its missionary organisation, The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, owned a plantation in Barbados, branding its slaves across the chest with the word SOCIETY. Now by its own research, it has acknowledged that for decades its investment fund poured almost all its money - aside from what it used to buy land - into a company that had a monopoly on transporting slaves to South America. With more than half of the worldwide Anglican communion now based in Africa, these admissions will be made all the more uncomfortable. The Church of England initiated this investigation with a view to being more open about its historic dealings and says a group will now be convened to decide what its response should be. But a spokesperson would not be drawn on whether that meant more than further statements and prayers, or whether it would include discussions about financial reparations. The research also found that the fund received numerous contributions from individuals linked to, or who profited from, transatlantic slavery and the plantation economy. The archbishop added: ""I pray for those affected by this news and hope that we may work together to discern a new way forward.""

"Delays unloading ambulances at busy hospitals are causing serious harm to patients, a safety watchdog is warning. TheHealthcare Safety Investigation Branch,externalhas been investigating how the long waits are delaying 999 emergency response times across England. Kenneth Shadbolt, 94, waited more than five hours for an ambulance after a bad fall - an accident that proved fatal. Logs show that in his final 999 call he asked: ""Can you please tell them to hurry up or I shall be dead."" The BBC has been given permission from the coroner to view detailed evidence into his recent death. Ken Shadbolt had been in good shape for his age. A retired factory worker and carpenter, he lived alone in a semi-detached house in the market town of Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, and could often be spotted cycling around the local housing estate on his electric trike. On the night of Wednesday, 23 March 2022, he called one of his five sons for a chat before turning in for the night. Just before 03:00, he got out of bed to go the bathroom and fell, hitting a wardrobe before collapsing on the floor. He had hurt his hip - how badly he didn't know - and couldn't get up. He could reach his mobile on his bedside, though, and dialled 999 for help. The BBC has seen transcripts of the three separate phone calls he made to South Western Ambulance Service that night. The first was short and factual, covering the basic details of his injury. He seemed calm and lucid but made clear he was in pain and needed an ambulance. He was told by the call handler not to try to move unless he felt in danger and assured that help was ""being arranged"". ""How long will it be?"" he asked. ""I don't know, unfortunately, [but] we will try to get someone there as soon as we can,"" came the reply. He then spoke to one of his sons who offered to drive up that night from the other side of the country. Ken said he thought an ambulance was on the way, and not to worry. Internal call logs seen by the BBC show that at this point Ken was triaged as a category two emergency, meaning paramedics should arrive in 18 minutes, on average. That didn't happen. About 15 minutes later, he called 999 for a second time. It was clear by now that he was starting to worry. He said he couldn't move his right leg and talked about an injury to his shoulder as he'd hit the floor. He was worried about his mobile phone, saying the battery ""won't last forever"". ""When I rang up 999 I thought I would get some treatment straight away,"" he told the next person on the line. ""It is still down as an emergency response,"" the call handler replied. ""We are extremely busy at the moment but we are working on getting that help to you as quickly as we possibly can, ok?"" An internal ambulance service log seen by the BBC shows that South Western Ambulance Service was indeed busy that night. It talks about ""high demand"" in the Gloucester area, with more than 60 patients waiting for help, some for more than eight hours. But something else was going on at the same time. The local A&E was very full, so paramedics arriving outside the emergency department were unable to unload their sick patients straight away. The ambulance service log warns there were ""long delays with unloading at GRH [Gloucestershire Royal Hospital]"" that night. Data seen by the BBC shows that 75% of ambulances were delayed for at least half an hour at Gloucester or its sister hospital in Cheltenham on 24 March, with 54% having to wait for more than an hour. That handover should be completed in under 15 minutes. If paramedics are queuing outside A&E, then they are not able to get back on the road and quickly pick up the next patient who needs help. A doctor's report into Ken's case specifically refers to ""a lack of ambulances available"" that night. Ambulances waiting to unload patients at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on 13 June, 2022. Another hour passed before he made his third and final call to 999. It was clear now that he was in serious pain. He felt ""terrible sick"" and said his ""breathing is going too"". ""I need an ambulance because I'm going to fade away quite quickly,"" he said. The same reply came back: ""The ambulance service is just under a lot of pressure at the moment... we are doing our best. ""I appreciate that you've been stuck for quite some time, Ken... we've not forgotten about you at all."" Later in the call he said he was cold and could not reach his duvet. He'd already tried phoning one of his neighbours but could not get through, and said they ""might be away"". He was told by the 999 call handler to ""try to stay still"". ""Can you please tell them to hurry up or I shall be dead,"" he said. ""Send me the undertaker, that would be the best bet."" He put the phone down for the last time. Kenneth Shadbolt's son Jerry says his father must have felt abandoned An ambulance finally got to Kenneth Shadbolt's house at 08:10 that morning, four hours after that final call. By then one of his sons had contacted a neighbour, who found him unconscious on his bedroom floor. He arrived at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital at 09:59, and was handed over to the trauma team. A doctor phoned the family and told them to come straight away and explained that his injuries were not survivable. Ken died at 14:21 that afternoon, with the cause of death given as a ""very large subdural haematoma"" or bleed on the brain. His son Jerry Shadbolt said: ""The doctors were saying his injuries were non-survivable but would they have been non-survivable if he'd arrived at hospital four hours earlier? I'd like an answer to that question. ""He was on his own and he knew he was on his own. He must have felt abandoned and alone on his bedroom floor. That's the most troubling part of it for me."" Jenny Winslade, executive director of quality and clinical care for the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, offered her ""sincere condolences"" to the family and friends of Mr Shadbolt. She said delays handing over patients to A&E, and busy hospitals, meant it was ""taking us too long to get an ambulance to patients"". ""This is a risk which we recognise is unacceptable,"" she said. ""We continue to work on a daily basis with our partners to ensure our crews can get back out on the road as quickly as possible, to respond to other 999 calls."" Prof Mark Pietroni, medical director and acting chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said local and national health systems were ""under intense pressure"" and continued to face significant challenges ""in response to unrelenting demand"". The trust said that, currently, 240 hospital patients - out of a total of 837 beds for patients - were waiting for support to go home or be moved to other locations in the community. Doctors and paramedics have become increasingly concerned about long ambulance wait times across the UK this year. In England as a whole, the average response for a category two emergency, such as a heart attack or stroke, was almost 40 minutes in May - more than twice as long as the 18-minute target. Last month, Dr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine,described the situation as ""more serious than we've ever seen it"". She said the problem is often caused by delays discharging patients from hospital wards into a care setting, which then creates a bottleneck in A&E, leaving no space for new patients arriving by ambulance. The BBC has spoken to people who have spent hours waiting outside emergency departments this year, sometimes transferred between different ambulance vehicles because there is no room to treat them in the hospital itself. The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) says the delays are causing harm to patients, including some deaths. Its final report will be published later this year, but the interim findings - released on Thursday - show that staff who have witnessed harm to patients and their families are traumatised. ""Harm is happening on a daily basis,"" said the HSIB's national investigator Neil Alexander. He referred to patients deteriorating in ambulances while waiting for treatment in emergency departments, and patients getting infections in hospital because they were staying there too long. ""And we are no longer using the word 'risk' in this investigation, because risk is being realised and is now harm,"" Mr Alexander said. The government said it would carefully consider the HSIB's report and would ""respond in due course"". ""The NHS has allocated Â£150m of additional funding to address pressures on ambulance services, with the number of ambulance and support staff increasing by almost 40% since February 2010,"" said a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care. ""We have also established a national taskforce to identify ways to reduce delayed discharges and ensure patients are only in hospital for as long as they need to be.""

"Australia's energy minister has urged households in New South Wales - a state that includes the country's biggest city Sydney - to switch off their lights in the face of an energy crisis. Chris Bowen says people should not use electricity for two hours every evening if they ""have a choice"". However, he added he was ""confident"" that blackouts could be avoided. It comes after Australia's main wholesale electricity market was suspended because of a surge in prices. Mr Bowen asked people living in New South Wales to conserve as much power as possible. ""If you have a choice about when to run certain items, don't run them from 6 to 8 [in the evening],"" he said during a televised media conference in Canberra. Australia is one of the world's biggest exporters of coal and liquefied natural gas but has been struggling with a power crisis since last month. Three quarters of the country's electricity is still generated using coal. It has long been accused of not doing enough to cut its emissions by investing in renewables. In recent weeks, Australia has felt the impact of disruptions to coal supplies, outages at several coal-fired power plants and soaring global energy prices. Australia signs new carbon emissions target Flooding earlier this year hit some coal mines in New South Wales and Queensland, while technical issues have cut production at two mines that supply the market's biggest coal-fired station in New South Wales. Around a quarter of Australia's coal-fired electricity generating capacity is currently out of service due to unexpected outages and scheduled maintenance. Some electricity producers have seen their costs soar as global coal and gas prices have jumped due to sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, demand for energy has jumped amid a cold snap and as Australia's economy opens up after Covid-19 restrictions were eased. All of this has helped drive up power prices on the wholesale market to above the A$300 (Â£173; $210) per megawatt hour price cap set by the market's regulator, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). However, that cap was below the cost of production for several generators, who decided to withhold capacity. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Wednesday, Aemo took the unprecedented step of suspending the market and said it would set prices directly and compensate generators for the shortfall. It also asked consumers in New South Wales to ""temporarily reduce their energy usage"". Aemo has not given a timeline on when the suspension would be lifted. Itsaid in a statement,external, ""The price cap will remain until cumulative wholesale electricity prices fall below the cumulative price threshold."" ""Aemo, as the national power system operator, will continue to monitor the situation and provide further updates should conditions change,"" it added. On Thursday, Australia's biggest electricity producer AGL Energy said it expected to be able to supply more power to businesses and consumers in the coming days. It has three units that have been out of service at its coal-fired plant in Bayswater, New South Wales. They are among several planned and unplanned outages that have helped cause the power crisis. AGL said that one of the units should return to service on Thursday, while another will come back online by Saturday. Meanwhile, Australia's new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the crisis would be raised at a meeting with state premiers which starts on Thursday. Lynne Chester, an energy expert from the University of Sydney, told the BBC that policymakers have been aware of the risks of ageing generators for decades. ""The sector's regulators and policy makers have ignored the escalating capacity constraints of aging generation assets, fired by fossil fuels, that dominate the sector,"" Prof Chester said.

"This video can not be played 'This isn't tough coaching and slight mistreatment' - reaction to the Whyte Review Warning: This article contains some description of graphic injuries and abuse. Issues of physical and emotional abuse within gymnastics in Britain were ""systemic"", an independent investigation has found. The Whyte Review, co-commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, was released on Thursday and found gymnast wellbeing and welfare ""has not been at the centre of British Gymnastics' culture"". Athletes were made to train on injuries, punished for needing the toilet, sat on by coaches, shouted and sworn at and had their bags searched for food. The review said the difficulties now facing British Gymnastics, the sport's national governing body, are ""borne of inadequate practice and procedure"", and reflect a culture which was the product of ""the way in which people behaved and were allowed to behave"". 'This was child abuse' - gymnasts react to report 'Gymnastics abuse again shows darker side of sport' The Sports Desk podcast: Will this be a turning point for welfare in sport? There was a sense, it added, that British Gymnastics had ""not only failed to prevent or limit such behaviours but had condoned some of them in the pursuit of national and international competitive success"". The former chief executive of British Gymnastics, Jane Allen,who retired in December 2020, was criticised in the report for a ""lack of leadership"" and an ""organisational failure to appreciate the central importance of athlete welfare"". In a statement, she said she was ""deeply sorry I didn't do more for everyone - especially the athletes - to feel supported, able to speak up and heard"". The Whyte Review was commissioned in 2020 following allegations of abuse and mistreatment within gymnastics in Britain. UK Sport and Sport England said they ""welcomed"" the report and ""accepted and endorsed"" its recommendations - adding gymnastics' continued funding will ""depend on its new leadership teams making significant changes to the sport"" in the timeline set out in the Whyte Review. British Gymnastics said it wanted to ""wholeheartedly apologise"" to gymnasts who had suffered and that it would ""not shy away from doing what is needed"". In addition to her 17 recommendations, Anne Whyte QC said a sports ombudsman would be ""an obvious step in the right direction"". She also stipulated that the British Gymnastics board publish details of its progress in complying with her recommendations at six, 12 and 24-month intervals, with the expectation that ""most if not all of them"" are implemented within two years. In the report, Whyte said: ""I hope that the findings in this report will allow the gymnast community to feel that the failures of the past have been publicly recognised and enable the sport to move forward and make positive changes."" She added: ""I am confident that the sport of gymnastics is already undergoing change for the good."" Welsh Gymnastics appoints safeguarding adviser The review, which focused on the period from August 2008 to August 2020, received more than 400 submissions, including 133 from current and former gymnasts, and conducted 190 interviews. Of those 400-plus submissions: More than 40% described physically abusive behaviour towards gymnasts by coaches, including physical chastisement, inappropriate training on injury, overstretching to the point of distress and withholding food, water and access to the toilet. More than 50% reported an element of emotional abuse by coaches, such as swearing, name calling, use of belittling language and gaslighting. Some 30 submissions included allegations of sexual abuse, such as sexual assault, sexual remarks, inappropriate touching and kissing as a punishment. More than 25% included reference to excessive weight management. The review states the ""vast majority"" of reports about physically and emotionally abusive behaviour related to female gymnasts, and such behaviour was more prevalent at the elite end of the sport. On weight management, it said ""the tyranny of the scales was coach-led and quite unnecessary"". No individual coaches were named in the report, in which Whyte said the scale of emotional abuse was ""far larger than British Gymnastics had appreciated"". During the 12-year period covered by the review - during which British Gymnastics received more than Â£38m in UK Sport funding - the governing body received approximately 3,800 complaints. The review also pointed to the recruitment of coaches from, or from countries influenced by, the former Soviet Union, whose ""technical skill and experience was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities"". Anecdotes from submissions include: One former elite gymnast described being made to stand on the beam for two hours because she was frightened to attempt a skill. Some gymnasts were strapped to bars for extended periods of time while others were made to climb the rope because they needed the toilet or exceeded a break time. One gymnast was deliberately dropped from equipment and dragged across the gym floor by their arms, while others were pressured to train on injuries, including broken bones. One gymnast recalls at the age of seven being sat on by a coach, while a parent reported two coaches at once pushing their child's legs down into a split. An international competitor recalled their coach sitting on a gymnast's back, forcing their hips into the floor and then lifting up their knee. Verbal comments made to gymnasts included that they were ""a waste of space"", ""a joke"" and ""pathetic"" - while in relation to excessive weight management, comments included ""you look like a whale"", ""you look like you have a beer belly"", and ""your thighs are disgusting"". Some coaches went to damaging length to control what gymnasts ate and weighed. Gymnasts had their weights publicly announced, were told to send photographs to prove they had lost weight, and had their lunch packs and bags searched for food. Gymnasts would hide food, including in ceiling tiles, and were told ""not to eat grapes"" because ""they are the highest-fat fruit"". As a result, a ""significant"" number of gymnasts developed dysfunctional relationships with food, weight and body image, and reports of purging were not uncommon in the submissions. Whyte said the ""unacceptable culture"" described in the report ""will not be fully eradicated until the national and international leadership within the sport publicly recognise its existence"". Recommendations to British Gymnastics focus on four key areas: safeguarding and welfare, complaints handling, standards and educations, and governance and oversight. The recommendations include: All club owners and managers should have mandatory safeguarding training, and high-performance gymnasts should have access to an independent disclosure service and dedicated welfare officer outside their club. British Gymnastics must have a fit-for-purpose case management system that covers number and nature of complaints, and must ensure all welfare-related complaints about employed coaches are independently investigated. The organisation should appoint a director of education and increase its direct contact with registered clubs. British Gymnastics must appoint independent board members with relevant expertise. A joint statement from UK Sport and Sport England said: ""The gymnasts' experiences shared in this review are harrowing and distressing to read. No-one in sport should ever be subjected to such abuse. ""We want to publicly acknowledge and thank all of those who were courageous in coming forward. Your voices are heard. You have played a vital part in fundamentally shaping the future of gymnastics in Britain, to help make it safe and inclusive for future generations to come. ""Duty of care to athletes and participants is the responsibility of national governing bodies. British Gymnastics clearly fell short of this. ""At this time, our intention is to continue to fund British Gymnastics, as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now. ""However, we are clear that continued funding for British Gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport, to the timelines set out in the report's recommendations."" British Gymnastics' chief executive Sarah Powell, who has been in the post since October, said gymnasts' experiences as detailed in the review were ""not acceptable"" and she found the report ""emotional"" reading. She said it was a ""watershed moment"" for not just gymnastics, but safeguarding across all sports. ""Gymnastics will be different because of the bravery of the gymnasts who stood up,"" she said. In a statement, she said: ""British Gymnastics accepts all of the recommendations and key findings. We will not shy away from doing what is needed. ""I want to wholeheartedly apologise to the gymnasts who have suffered as a result of us not working to the standards we set ourselves. We are sorry."" She added: ""Let me be clear; there is no place for abuse of any kind in our sport and coaching standards of the past will not be those of the future. ""We will build a new culture and ensure the gymnast's voice is at the heart of all we do. We will change gymnastics for the better."" UK Sport and Sport England commissioned the independent review - led by Anne Whyte QC - in July 2020 after allegations of mistreatment in gymnastics. The review formally began the following month. The review assessed whether: Gymnasts' wellbeing and welfare is (and has been) at the centre of the culture of British Gymnastics, its registered clubs and member coaches and if not, why not. Safeguarding concerns and complaints have been dealt with appropriately in the sport of gymnastics and if not, why not. Gymnasts, or their parents, carers or guardians, have felt unable to raise complaints with appropriate authorities and if so, why. The review also investigated the ""nature and volume of complaints received by British Gymnastics"", the governing body's approach to resolving the complaints, and its culture and practices. The Whyte Review report did not mention individual coaches or athletes. July 2020:Nicole Pavieris among a number of gymnasts to make the first allegations of a ""culture of fear"" within the ""mentally and emotionally abusive"" sport of gymnastics. OlympiansBecky and Ellie Downiesay abusive behaviour in gymnastics training became ""ingrained"" and ""completely normalised"", while then-British Gymnastics chief executive Jane Allen says she is ""appalled and ashamed"" by the allegations. Olympic bronze medallistAmy Tinklercriticises British Gymnastics for the time it has taken to investigate a formal complaint she made in 2019. A helpline is launched by the NSPCC and British Athletes Commission to support gymnasts. It receives more than 120 calls in its first five weeks. August 2020:The Whyte Review is formally started.

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

This video can not be played EU leaders support Ukraine's membership bid European Union leaders have publicly backed Ukraine's ""immediate"" candidate status to join the bloc, following Russia's invasion of the country. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.3044904e-12

"Delays unloading ambulances at busy hospitals are causing serious harm to patients, a safety watchdog is warning. TheHealthcare Safety Investigation Branch,externalhas been investigating how the long waits are delaying 999 emergency response times across England. Kenneth Shadbolt, 94, waited more than five hours for an ambulance after a bad fall - an accident that proved fatal. Logs show that in his final 999 call he asked: ""Can you please tell them to hurry up or I shall be dead."" The BBC has been given permission from the coroner to view detailed evidence into his recent death. Ken Shadbolt had been in good shape for his age. A retired factory worker and carpenter, he lived alone in a semi-detached house in the market town of Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, and could often be spotted cycling around the local housing estate on his electric trike. On the night of Wednesday, 23 March 2022, he called one of his five sons for a chat before turning in for the night. Just before 03:00, he got out of bed to go the bathroom and fell, hitting a wardrobe before collapsing on the floor. He had hurt his hip - how badly he didn't know - and couldn't get up. He could reach his mobile on his bedside, though, and dialled 999 for help. The BBC has seen transcripts of the three separate phone calls he made to South Western Ambulance Service that night. The first was short and factual, covering the basic details of his injury. He seemed calm and lucid but made clear he was in pain and needed an ambulance. He was told by the call handler not to try to move unless he felt in danger and assured that help was ""being arranged"". ""How long will it be?"" he asked. ""I don't know, unfortunately, [but] we will try to get someone there as soon as we can,"" came the reply. He then spoke to one of his sons who offered to drive up that night from the other side of the country. Ken said he thought an ambulance was on the way, and not to worry. Internal call logs seen by the BBC show that at this point Ken was triaged as a category two emergency, meaning paramedics should arrive in 18 minutes, on average. That didn't happen. About 15 minutes later, he called 999 for a second time. It was clear by now that he was starting to worry. He said he couldn't move his right leg and talked about an injury to his shoulder as he'd hit the floor. He was worried about his mobile phone, saying the battery ""won't last forever"". ""When I rang up 999 I thought I would get some treatment straight away,"" he told the next person on the line. ""It is still down as an emergency response,"" the call handler replied. ""We are extremely busy at the moment but we are working on getting that help to you as quickly as we possibly can, ok?"" An internal ambulance service log seen by the BBC shows that South Western Ambulance Service was indeed busy that night. It talks about ""high demand"" in the Gloucester area, with more than 60 patients waiting for help, some for more than eight hours. But something else was going on at the same time. The local A&E was very full, so paramedics arriving outside the emergency department were unable to unload their sick patients straight away. The ambulance service log warns there were ""long delays with unloading at GRH [Gloucestershire Royal Hospital]"" that night. Data seen by the BBC shows that 75% of ambulances were delayed for at least half an hour at Gloucester or its sister hospital in Cheltenham on 24 March, with 54% having to wait for more than an hour. That handover should be completed in under 15 minutes. If paramedics are queuing outside A&E, then they are not able to get back on the road and quickly pick up the next patient who needs help. A doctor's report into Ken's case specifically refers to ""a lack of ambulances available"" that night. Ambulances waiting to unload patients at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on 13 June, 2022. Another hour passed before he made his third and final call to 999. It was clear now that he was in serious pain. He felt ""terrible sick"" and said his ""breathing is going too"". ""I need an ambulance because I'm going to fade away quite quickly,"" he said. The same reply came back: ""The ambulance service is just under a lot of pressure at the moment... we are doing our best. ""I appreciate that you've been stuck for quite some time, Ken... we've not forgotten about you at all."" Later in the call he said he was cold and could not reach his duvet. He'd already tried phoning one of his neighbours but could not get through, and said they ""might be away"". He was told by the 999 call handler to ""try to stay still"". ""Can you please tell them to hurry up or I shall be dead,"" he said. ""Send me the undertaker, that would be the best bet."" He put the phone down for the last time. Kenneth Shadbolt's son Jerry says his father must have felt abandoned An ambulance finally got to Kenneth Shadbolt's house at 08:10 that morning, four hours after that final call. By then one of his sons had contacted a neighbour, who found him unconscious on his bedroom floor. He arrived at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital at 09:59, and was handed over to the trauma team. A doctor phoned the family and told them to come straight away and explained that his injuries were not survivable. Ken died at 14:21 that afternoon, with the cause of death given as a ""very large subdural haematoma"" or bleed on the brain. His son Jerry Shadbolt said: ""The doctors were saying his injuries were non-survivable but would they have been non-survivable if he'd arrived at hospital four hours earlier? I'd like an answer to that question. ""He was on his own and he knew he was on his own. He must have felt abandoned and alone on his bedroom floor. That's the most troubling part of it for me."" Jenny Winslade, executive director of quality and clinical care for the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, offered her ""sincere condolences"" to the family and friends of Mr Shadbolt. She said delays handing over patients to A&E, and busy hospitals, meant it was ""taking us too long to get an ambulance to patients"". ""This is a risk which we recognise is unacceptable,"" she said. ""We continue to work on a daily basis with our partners to ensure our crews can get back out on the road as quickly as possible, to respond to other 999 calls."" Prof Mark Pietroni, medical director and acting chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said local and national health systems were ""under intense pressure"" and continued to face significant challenges ""in response to unrelenting demand"". The trust said that, currently, 240 hospital patients - out of a total of 837 beds for patients - were waiting for support to go home or be moved to other locations in the community. Doctors and paramedics have become increasingly concerned about long ambulance wait times across the UK this year. In England as a whole, the average response for a category two emergency, such as a heart attack or stroke, was almost 40 minutes in May - more than twice as long as the 18-minute target. Last month, Dr Katherine Henderson, an A&E consultant and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine,described the situation as ""more serious than we've ever seen it"". She said the problem is often caused by delays discharging patients from hospital wards into a care setting, which then creates a bottleneck in A&E, leaving no space for new patients arriving by ambulance. The BBC has spoken to people who have spent hours waiting outside emergency departments this year, sometimes transferred between different ambulance vehicles because there is no room to treat them in the hospital itself. The Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) says the delays are causing harm to patients, including some deaths. Its final report will be published later this year, but the interim findings - released on Thursday - show that staff who have witnessed harm to patients and their families are traumatised. ""Harm is happening on a daily basis,"" said the HSIB's national investigator Neil Alexander. He referred to patients deteriorating in ambulances while waiting for treatment in emergency departments, and patients getting infections in hospital because they were staying there too long. ""And we are no longer using the word 'risk' in this investigation, because risk is being realised and is now harm,"" Mr Alexander said. The government said it would carefully consider the HSIB's report and would ""respond in due course"". ""The NHS has allocated Â£150m of additional funding to address pressures on ambulance services, with the number of ambulance and support staff increasing by almost 40% since February 2010,"" said a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care. ""We have also established a national taskforce to identify ways to reduce delayed discharges and ensure patients are only in hospital for as long as they need to be.""

"A woman uses a fan to cool a child during the recent heatwave in India Two weeks of climate talks in Germany have ended in acrimony between rich and poor countries over cash for climate damage. Developing countries say they are reeling from climate change caused by richer countries' emissions over hundreds of years. They hoped to get compensation onto the official agenda for discussions by world leaders in November. But here in Bonn they couldn't get the US and the European Union to agree. ""The climate emergency is fast becoming a catastrophe,"" said Conrod Hunte, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). ""Yet within these walls the process feels out of step with reality, the pace feels too slow,"" he told delegates at the end of the meeting. Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties Green energy 'stagnates' as fossil fuels dominate Huge methane emission from Russian coal mine People being rescued from floods in China Developing nations say they need money to deal with the impacts of climate change, because they suffer the effects more than richer nations and have less financial capacity to cope. They argue that the climate change they are experiencing has been caused by carbon emitted by richer countries as they developed their economies. They say that Europe and the US have a responsibility now to compensate them for this. The US and Europe don't agree. They fear that if they pay for historic emissions it could put their countries on the hook for billions of dollars for decades or even centuries to come. The issue is termed ""loss and damage,external"" and has become a running sore in these negotiations. At last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow, island states and developing countries agreed to prioritise cuts to carbon emissions on the back of promises that richer nations would finally set up a compensation process this year. It was a compromise they hoped would pay off. But despite two weeks of discussions here in Bonn, they have been unable to get the issue of a funding facility on the agenda for the COP27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November. ""The compromise was based on an understanding that countries would be willing to start talking and taking decisions on dealing with how to get that finance flowing for loss and damage,"" said Alex Scott from E3G, an environmental think tank. ""And we haven't seen that come to fruition here. Instead, we've seen a workshop set up to talk about how we can fix some of the problems."" The EU in particular has come in for heavy criticism. ""The EU consistently blocked discussions on finance for loss and damage in Bonn,"" said Harjeet Singh, from the Climate Action Network International. ""The last two weeks exposed its hypocritical stance, with major countries like Germany sourcing new fossil fuels abroad while denying support to developing countries facing devastation from climate-induced superstorms and rising seas."" Firefighting in Spain Many participants from poorer regions of the world brought their own personal testimony of the impacts of climate change. ""We are already living with loss and damages for the last 25 years,"" said Adriana Vasquez Rodriquez from La Ruta del Clima, a Costa Rican environmental group. ""We have families who have lost their houses, their crops, their lives, and no-one is paying for that, we are running out of resources, and at the same time, we are depending on debt."" Bridging the divide between rich and poor on this issue will not be easy. While the question of a financial facility will now not be on the official discussions at COP27 in Egypt, developing countries are certain to continue to insist that their voices be heard on this question.

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

This video can not be played EU leaders support Ukraine's membership bid European Union leaders have publicly backed Ukraine's ""immediate"" candidate status to join the bloc, following Russia's invasion of the country. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,9.786264e-10
"This video can not be played 'This isn't tough coaching and slight mistreatment' - reaction to the Whyte Review Warning: This article contains some description of graphic injuries and abuse. Issues of physical and emotional abuse within gymnastics in Britain were ""systemic"", an independent investigation has found. The Whyte Review, co-commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, was released on Thursday and found gymnast wellbeing and welfare ""has not been at the centre of British Gymnastics' culture"". Athletes were made to train on injuries, punished for needing the toilet, sat on by coaches, shouted and sworn at and had their bags searched for food. The review said the difficulties now facing British Gymnastics, the sport's national governing body, are ""borne of inadequate practice and procedure"", and reflect a culture which was the product of ""the way in which people behaved and were allowed to behave"". 'This was child abuse' - gymnasts react to report 'Gymnastics abuse again shows darker side of sport' The Sports Desk podcast: Will this be a turning point for welfare in sport? There was a sense, it added, that British Gymnastics had ""not only failed to prevent or limit such behaviours but had condoned some of them in the pursuit of national and international competitive success"". The former chief executive of British Gymnastics, Jane Allen,who retired in December 2020, was criticised in the report for a ""lack of leadership"" and an ""organisational failure to appreciate the central importance of athlete welfare"". In a statement, she said she was ""deeply sorry I didn't do more for everyone - especially the athletes - to feel supported, able to speak up and heard"". The Whyte Review was commissioned in 2020 following allegations of abuse and mistreatment within gymnastics in Britain. UK Sport and Sport England said they ""welcomed"" the report and ""accepted and endorsed"" its recommendations - adding gymnastics' continued funding will ""depend on its new leadership teams making significant changes to the sport"" in the timeline set out in the Whyte Review. British Gymnastics said it wanted to ""wholeheartedly apologise"" to gymnasts who had suffered and that it would ""not shy away from doing what is needed"". In addition to her 17 recommendations, Anne Whyte QC said a sports ombudsman would be ""an obvious step in the right direction"". She also stipulated that the British Gymnastics board publish details of its progress in complying with her recommendations at six, 12 and 24-month intervals, with the expectation that ""most if not all of them"" are implemented within two years. In the report, Whyte said: ""I hope that the findings in this report will allow the gymnast community to feel that the failures of the past have been publicly recognised and enable the sport to move forward and make positive changes."" She added: ""I am confident that the sport of gymnastics is already undergoing change for the good."" Welsh Gymnastics appoints safeguarding adviser The review, which focused on the period from August 2008 to August 2020, received more than 400 submissions, including 133 from current and former gymnasts, and conducted 190 interviews. Of those 400-plus submissions: More than 40% described physically abusive behaviour towards gymnasts by coaches, including physical chastisement, inappropriate training on injury, overstretching to the point of distress and withholding food, water and access to the toilet. More than 50% reported an element of emotional abuse by coaches, such as swearing, name calling, use of belittling language and gaslighting. Some 30 submissions included allegations of sexual abuse, such as sexual assault, sexual remarks, inappropriate touching and kissing as a punishment. More than 25% included reference to excessive weight management. The review states the ""vast majority"" of reports about physically and emotionally abusive behaviour related to female gymnasts, and such behaviour was more prevalent at the elite end of the sport. On weight management, it said ""the tyranny of the scales was coach-led and quite unnecessary"". No individual coaches were named in the report, in which Whyte said the scale of emotional abuse was ""far larger than British Gymnastics had appreciated"". During the 12-year period covered by the review - during which British Gymnastics received more than Â£38m in UK Sport funding - the governing body received approximately 3,800 complaints. The review also pointed to the recruitment of coaches from, or from countries influenced by, the former Soviet Union, whose ""technical skill and experience was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities"". Anecdotes from submissions include: One former elite gymnast described being made to stand on the beam for two hours because she was frightened to attempt a skill. Some gymnasts were strapped to bars for extended periods of time while others were made to climb the rope because they needed the toilet or exceeded a break time. One gymnast was deliberately dropped from equipment and dragged across the gym floor by their arms, while others were pressured to train on injuries, including broken bones. One gymnast recalls at the age of seven being sat on by a coach, while a parent reported two coaches at once pushing their child's legs down into a split. An international competitor recalled their coach sitting on a gymnast's back, forcing their hips into the floor and then lifting up their knee. Verbal comments made to gymnasts included that they were ""a waste of space"", ""a joke"" and ""pathetic"" - while in relation to excessive weight management, comments included ""you look like a whale"", ""you look like you have a beer belly"", and ""your thighs are disgusting"". Some coaches went to damaging length to control what gymnasts ate and weighed. Gymnasts had their weights publicly announced, were told to send photographs to prove they had lost weight, and had their lunch packs and bags searched for food. Gymnasts would hide food, including in ceiling tiles, and were told ""not to eat grapes"" because ""they are the highest-fat fruit"". As a result, a ""significant"" number of gymnasts developed dysfunctional relationships with food, weight and body image, and reports of purging were not uncommon in the submissions. Whyte said the ""unacceptable culture"" described in the report ""will not be fully eradicated until the national and international leadership within the sport publicly recognise its existence"". Recommendations to British Gymnastics focus on four key areas: safeguarding and welfare, complaints handling, standards and educations, and governance and oversight. The recommendations include: All club owners and managers should have mandatory safeguarding training, and high-performance gymnasts should have access to an independent disclosure service and dedicated welfare officer outside their club. British Gymnastics must have a fit-for-purpose case management system that covers number and nature of complaints, and must ensure all welfare-related complaints about employed coaches are independently investigated. The organisation should appoint a director of education and increase its direct contact with registered clubs. British Gymnastics must appoint independent board members with relevant expertise. A joint statement from UK Sport and Sport England said: ""The gymnasts' experiences shared in this review are harrowing and distressing to read. No-one in sport should ever be subjected to such abuse. ""We want to publicly acknowledge and thank all of those who were courageous in coming forward. Your voices are heard. You have played a vital part in fundamentally shaping the future of gymnastics in Britain, to help make it safe and inclusive for future generations to come. ""Duty of care to athletes and participants is the responsibility of national governing bodies. British Gymnastics clearly fell short of this. ""At this time, our intention is to continue to fund British Gymnastics, as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now. ""However, we are clear that continued funding for British Gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport, to the timelines set out in the report's recommendations."" British Gymnastics' chief executive Sarah Powell, who has been in the post since October, said gymnasts' experiences as detailed in the review were ""not acceptable"" and she found the report ""emotional"" reading. She said it was a ""watershed moment"" for not just gymnastics, but safeguarding across all sports. ""Gymnastics will be different because of the bravery of the gymnasts who stood up,"" she said. In a statement, she said: ""British Gymnastics accepts all of the recommendations and key findings. We will not shy away from doing what is needed. ""I want to wholeheartedly apologise to the gymnasts who have suffered as a result of us not working to the standards we set ourselves. We are sorry."" She added: ""Let me be clear; there is no place for abuse of any kind in our sport and coaching standards of the past will not be those of the future. ""We will build a new culture and ensure the gymnast's voice is at the heart of all we do. We will change gymnastics for the better."" UK Sport and Sport England commissioned the independent review - led by Anne Whyte QC - in July 2020 after allegations of mistreatment in gymnastics. The review formally began the following month. The review assessed whether: Gymnasts' wellbeing and welfare is (and has been) at the centre of the culture of British Gymnastics, its registered clubs and member coaches and if not, why not. Safeguarding concerns and complaints have been dealt with appropriately in the sport of gymnastics and if not, why not. Gymnasts, or their parents, carers or guardians, have felt unable to raise complaints with appropriate authorities and if so, why. The review also investigated the ""nature and volume of complaints received by British Gymnastics"", the governing body's approach to resolving the complaints, and its culture and practices. The Whyte Review report did not mention individual coaches or athletes. July 2020:Nicole Pavieris among a number of gymnasts to make the first allegations of a ""culture of fear"" within the ""mentally and emotionally abusive"" sport of gymnastics. OlympiansBecky and Ellie Downiesay abusive behaviour in gymnastics training became ""ingrained"" and ""completely normalised"", while then-British Gymnastics chief executive Jane Allen says she is ""appalled and ashamed"" by the allegations. Olympic bronze medallistAmy Tinklercriticises British Gymnastics for the time it has taken to investigate a formal complaint she made in 2019. A helpline is launched by the NSPCC and British Athletes Commission to support gymnasts. It receives more than 120 calls in its first five weeks. August 2020:The Whyte Review is formally started. Pavier's former coach,Claire Barbieri, is suspended, while British Gymnastics' head national coachAmanda Reddinsteps aside after allegations are made against her. Both denied the allegations made against them. Olympic bronze medallistNile Wilsonalleges gymnasts are ""treated like pieces of meat"".

"This video can not be played 'This isn't tough coaching and slight mistreatment' - reaction to the Whyte Review Warning: This article contains some description of graphic injuries and abuse. Issues of physical and emotional abuse within gymnastics in Britain were ""systemic"", an independent investigation has found. The Whyte Review, co-commissioned by UK Sport and Sport England, was released on Thursday and found gymnast wellbeing and welfare ""has not been at the centre of British Gymnastics' culture"". Athletes were made to train on injuries, punished for needing the toilet, sat on by coaches, shouted and sworn at and had their bags searched for food. The review said the difficulties now facing British Gymnastics, the sport's national governing body, are ""borne of inadequate practice and procedure"", and reflect a culture which was the product of ""the way in which people behaved and were allowed to behave"". 'This was child abuse' - gymnasts react to report 'Gymnastics abuse again shows darker side of sport' The Sports Desk podcast: Will this be a turning point for welfare in sport? There was a sense, it added, that British Gymnastics had ""not only failed to prevent or limit such behaviours but had condoned some of them in the pursuit of national and international competitive success"". The former chief executive of British Gymnastics, Jane Allen,who retired in December 2020, was criticised in the report for a ""lack of leadership"" and an ""organisational failure to appreciate the central importance of athlete welfare"". In a statement, she said she was ""deeply sorry I didn't do more for everyone - especially the athletes - to feel supported, able to speak up and heard"". The Whyte Review was commissioned in 2020 following allegations of abuse and mistreatment within gymnastics in Britain. UK Sport and Sport England said they ""welcomed"" the report and ""accepted and endorsed"" its recommendations - adding gymnastics' continued funding will ""depend on its new leadership teams making significant changes to the sport"" in the timeline set out in the Whyte Review. British Gymnastics said it wanted to ""wholeheartedly apologise"" to gymnasts who had suffered and that it would ""not shy away from doing what is needed"". In addition to her 17 recommendations, Anne Whyte QC said a sports ombudsman would be ""an obvious step in the right direction"". She also stipulated that the British Gymnastics board publish details of its progress in complying with her recommendations at six, 12 and 24-month intervals, with the expectation that ""most if not all of them"" are implemented within two years. In the report, Whyte said: ""I hope that the findings in this report will allow the gymnast community to feel that the failures of the past have been publicly recognised and enable the sport to move forward and make positive changes."" She added: ""I am confident that the sport of gymnastics is already undergoing change for the good."" Welsh Gymnastics appoints safeguarding adviser The review, which focused on the period from August 2008 to August 2020, received more than 400 submissions, including 133 from current and former gymnasts, and conducted 190 interviews. Of those 400-plus submissions: More than 40% described physically abusive behaviour towards gymnasts by coaches, including physical chastisement, inappropriate training on injury, overstretching to the point of distress and withholding food, water and access to the toilet. More than 50% reported an element of emotional abuse by coaches, such as swearing, name calling, use of belittling language and gaslighting. Some 30 submissions included allegations of sexual abuse, such as sexual assault, sexual remarks, inappropriate touching and kissing as a punishment. More than 25% included reference to excessive weight management. The review states the ""vast majority"" of reports about physically and emotionally abusive behaviour related to female gymnasts, and such behaviour was more prevalent at the elite end of the sport. On weight management, it said ""the tyranny of the scales was coach-led and quite unnecessary"". No individual coaches were named in the report, in which Whyte said the scale of emotional abuse was ""far larger than British Gymnastics had appreciated"". During the 12-year period covered by the review - during which British Gymnastics received more than Â£38m in UK Sport funding - the governing body received approximately 3,800 complaints. The review also pointed to the recruitment of coaches from, or from countries influenced by, the former Soviet Union, whose ""technical skill and experience was sometimes accompanied by an attitude to the gymnast which was autocratic and dismissive and left athletes feeling like commodities"". Anecdotes from submissions include: One former elite gymnast described being made to stand on the beam for two hours because she was frightened to attempt a skill. Some gymnasts were strapped to bars for extended periods of time while others were made to climb the rope because they needed the toilet or exceeded a break time. One gymnast was deliberately dropped from equipment and dragged across the gym floor by their arms, while others were pressured to train on injuries, including broken bones. One gymnast recalls at the age of seven being sat on by a coach, while a parent reported two coaches at once pushing their child's legs down into a split. An international competitor recalled their coach sitting on a gymnast's back, forcing their hips into the floor and then lifting up their knee. Verbal comments made to gymnasts included that they were ""a waste of space"", ""a joke"" and ""pathetic"" - while in relation to excessive weight management, comments included ""you look like a whale"", ""you look like you have a beer belly"", and ""your thighs are disgusting"". Some coaches went to damaging length to control what gymnasts ate and weighed. Gymnasts had their weights publicly announced, were told to send photographs to prove they had lost weight, and had their lunch packs and bags searched for food. Gymnasts would hide food, including in ceiling tiles, and were told ""not to eat grapes"" because ""they are the highest-fat fruit"". As a result, a ""significant"" number of gymnasts developed dysfunctional relationships with food, weight and body image, and reports of purging were not uncommon in the submissions. Whyte said the ""unacceptable culture"" described in the report ""will not be fully eradicated until the national and international leadership within the sport publicly recognise its existence"". Recommendations to British Gymnastics focus on four key areas: safeguarding and welfare, complaints handling, standards and educations, and governance and oversight. The recommendations include: All club owners and managers should have mandatory safeguarding training, and high-performance gymnasts should have access to an independent disclosure service and dedicated welfare officer outside their club. British Gymnastics must have a fit-for-purpose case management system that covers number and nature of complaints, and must ensure all welfare-related complaints about employed coaches are independently investigated. The organisation should appoint a director of education and increase its direct contact with registered clubs. British Gymnastics must appoint independent board members with relevant expertise. A joint statement from UK Sport and Sport England said: ""The gymnasts' experiences shared in this review are harrowing and distressing to read. No-one in sport should ever be subjected to such abuse. ""We want to publicly acknowledge and thank all of those who were courageous in coming forward. Your voices are heard. You have played a vital part in fundamentally shaping the future of gymnastics in Britain, to help make it safe and inclusive for future generations to come. ""Duty of care to athletes and participants is the responsibility of national governing bodies. British Gymnastics clearly fell short of this. ""At this time, our intention is to continue to fund British Gymnastics, as we believe that withdrawing funding would not only prevent them from implementing the vital changes outlined in the report but also negatively impact on the support to and wellbeing of gymnasts now. ""However, we are clear that continued funding for British Gymnastics will depend on its new leadership team making significant changes to the sport, to the timelines set out in the report's recommendations."" British Gymnastics' chief executive Sarah Powell, who has been in the post since October, said gymnasts' experiences as detailed in the review were ""not acceptable"" and she found the report ""emotional"" reading. She said it was a ""watershed moment"" for not just gymnastics, but safeguarding across all sports. ""Gymnastics will be different because of the bravery of the gymnasts who stood up,"" she said. In a statement, she said: ""British Gymnastics accepts all of the recommendations and key findings. We will not shy away from doing what is needed. ""I want to wholeheartedly apologise to the gymnasts who have suffered as a result of us not working to the standards we set ourselves. We are sorry."" She added: ""Let me be clear; there is no place for abuse of any kind in our sport and coaching standards of the past will not be those of the future. ""We will build a new culture and ensure the gymnast's voice is at the heart of all we do. We will change gymnastics for the better."" UK Sport and Sport England commissioned the independent review - led by Anne Whyte QC - in July 2020 after allegations of mistreatment in gymnastics. The review formally began the following month. The review assessed whether: Gymnasts' wellbeing and welfare is (and has been) at the centre of the culture of British Gymnastics, its registered clubs and member coaches and if not, why not. Safeguarding concerns and complaints have been dealt with appropriately in the sport of gymnastics and if not, why not. Gymnasts, or their parents, carers or guardians, have felt unable to raise complaints with appropriate authorities and if so, why. The review also investigated the ""nature and volume of complaints received by British Gymnastics"", the governing body's approach to resolving the complaints, and its culture and practices. The Whyte Review report did not mention individual coaches or athletes. July 2020:Nicole Pavieris among a number of gymnasts to make the first allegations of a ""culture of fear"" within the ""mentally and emotionally abusive"" sport of gymnastics. OlympiansBecky and Ellie Downiesay abusive behaviour in gymnastics training became ""ingrained"" and ""completely normalised"", while then-British Gymnastics chief executive Jane Allen says she is ""appalled and ashamed"" by the allegations. Olympic bronze medallistAmy Tinklercriticises British Gymnastics for the time it has taken to investigate a formal complaint she made in 2019. A helpline is launched by the NSPCC and British Athletes Commission to support gymnasts. It receives more than 120 calls in its first five weeks. August 2020:The Whyte Review is formally started. Pavier's former coach,Claire Barbieri, is suspended, while British Gymnastics' head national coachAmanda Reddinsteps aside after allegations are made against her. Both denied the allegations made against them. Olympic bronze medallistNile Wilsonalleges gymnasts are ""treated like pieces of meat"". September 2020:Two further coaches -Helen Potter and Rory Weavers- are temporarily suspended pending investigation. Both denied the allegations made against them. Their temporary suspension has since been lifted. October 2020:British Gymnastics chief executiveAllen announces she will retirein December. November 2020:British Gymnastics sets up an independent complaints process to oversee allegations of mistreatment by athletes. February 2021:A group of 17 start legal action against British Gymnastics. A further 20 later join the group claim. June 2021:Sarah Powell is named British Gymnastics chief executive, and says she is ""under no illusions about the scale of change needed"" to improve the culture at the organisation. August 2021:British Gymnastics chairman Mike Darcey apologises to the gymnastics community for failing to act on allegations of mistreatment. April 2022:BBC Sport reveals leading coachLiz Kincaidwas pulled from Great Britain's coaching squad just weeks before the Tokyo Olympics after a serious allegation was made against her. She denied wrongdoing. May 2022:National head coachReddin steps downfrom her position with immediate effect.

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

This video can not be played EU leaders support Ukraine's membership bid European Union leaders have publicly backed Ukraine's ""immediate"" candidate status to join the bloc, following Russia's invasion of the country. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.80409634
"Like many Ukrainians trying to leave Russian-occupied areas, Andriy was forced to go through a process called filtration Ukrainians who want to leave cities under Russian occupation cannot do so without undergoing a terrifying process known as filtration. Phones are searched, social media accounts scoured. Anything deemed incriminating can lead to beatings, civilians say, and many are forcefully sent to Russia. Andriy watched anxiously as Russian soldiers connected his mobile to their computer, trying to restore some files. Andriy, a 28-year-old marketing officer, was attempting to leave Mariupol. He had deleted everything he thought a Russian soldier could use against him, such as text messages discussing Russia's invasion of Ukraine or photos of the devastation in his city caused by weeks of relentless shelling. But the internet in Mariupol, a once bustling port in southern Ukraine, had been cut off as part of the siege imposed by Russia, and Andriy had not been able to take down some of his posts on social media. He remembered the first days of the war, when he had shared some anti-Russian messages and speeches from the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. ""I'm screwed,"" he thought. The soldiers, Andriy said, already had their focus on him. On that day in early May, when he first joined the queues for filtration in Bezimenne, a small village to the east of Mariupol, one of the Russians noticed his beard. The soldier, Andriy said, instantly assumed it was a sign that he was a fighter with the Azov regiment, a former militia in the city which once had links with the far right. ""Is it you and your brigade killing our guys?,"" Andriy was asked. He replied he had never served in the army, he started working directly after graduating, but ""they didn't want to hear it"". As the soldiers went through his phone, they turned to his political views, and asked his opinion of Zelensky. Andriy, cautiously, said Zelensky was ""okay"", and one of the soldiers wanted to know what he meant by that. Andriy told him Zelensky was just another president, not very different from those who had come before, and that in fact, he was not very interested in politics. ""Well,"" the soldier replied, ""you should just say you aren't interested in politics."" They kept Andriy's phone and told him to wait outside. He met his grandmother, mother and aunt, who had arrived with him and had already been given a document that allowed them to leave. A few minutes later, Andriy said, he was ordered to go to a tent where members of Russia's security service, the FSB, were carrying out further checks. Five officers were sitting behind a desk, three wearing balaclavas. They showed Andriy a video he had shared on Instagram of a speech Zelensky had given, from 1 March. With it was a caption written by Andriy: ""A president we can be proud of. Go home with your warship!"" One of the officers took the lead. ""You told us you're neutral to politics, but you support the Nazi government,"" Andriy recalled being told. ""He hit me in the throat. He basically started the beating."" Andriy said the soldiers found out he had shared speeches of President Zelensky after connecting his phone to their computer Like Andriy, Dmytro had his phone confiscated at a checkpoint as he tried to leave Mariupol in late March. Dmytro, a 34-year-old history teacher, said the soldiers came across the word ""ruscist"", a play on ""Russia"" and ""fascist"", in a message to a friend. The soldiers, Dmytro told me, slapped and kicked him, and ""everything [happened] because I used that word."" Dmytro said he was taken, with four other people, to a police station in the village of Nikolsky, also a filtration point. ""The highest-ranking officer punched me four times in the face,"" he said. ""It seemed to be part of the procedure"". His interrogators said teachers like him were spreading pro-Ukrainian propaganda. They also asked what he thought about ""the events of 2014"", the year that Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and started supporting pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. He replied that the conflict was known as the Russo-Ukrainian war. ""They said Russia was not involved, and asked me whether I agreed that it was, in fact, a Ukrainian civil war."" The officers checked his phone again, and this time found a photo of a book which had the letter H in its title. ""We got you!"" the soldiers told Dmytro. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, claims his war in Ukraine is an effort to ""de-Nazify"" the country, and the soldiers, Dmytro said, believed he was reading books about Hitler. The next morning, Dmytro was transferred with two women to a prison in Starobesheve, a separatist-controlled village in Donetsk. He counted 24 people in the four-bunk cell. After four days and another detailed interrogation, he was finally released, and eventually reached Ukrainian-held territory. Weeks later, he still does not know what happened to his cell mates. Back inside the tent in Bezimenne, Andriy noticed two other people with their hands tied behind them, who had been left in a corner while the officers paid attention to him. ""They started to beat me way harder,"" Andriy told me, ""everywhere"". At one point, after a blow to the stomach, he felt as if he was about to faint. He managed to sit on a chair. ""I wondered what would be better,"" he said, ""to lose consciousness and fall down or tolerate the pain further."" At least, Andriy thought, he had not been taken somewhere else, away from his family. Ukrainian officials say thousands of people are believed to have been sent to detention centres and camps set up in Russian-controlled areas during filtration. In almost all cases, their relatives do not know where they are being held, or why. ""I [was] very angry about everything,"" Andriy said, ""but, at the same time, I know it could've been much worse."" His mother tried to get into the tent, but was stopped by the officers. ""She was very nervous. She later said they had told her that my 're-education' had started,"" Andriy said, ""and that she shouldn't be worried."" His ordeal, he told me, continued for two and a half hours. He was even forced to make a video saying ""Glory to the Russian army!"", a mockery of ""Slava Ukraini!"", the Ukrainian slogan. The final question, Andriy said, was whether he had ""understood his mistakes"", and ""I obviously answered yes"". As he was being released, officers brought in another man, who had previously served in Ukraine's military and had several tattoos. ""They immediately pushed him to the ground and started to beat him,"" Andriy said. ""They didn't even talk to him."" ""I even try to justify the process somehow. Try to convince myself there's some logic,"" Andriy said about filtration Ukrainian authorities say Russian forces and Russian-backed separatists have carried out filtration in occupied territories as an attempt to establish residents' possible links with the military, law enforcement and even local government, as the invading forces try to restore services and infrastructure. Men of fighting age are particularly targeted, checked for bruises that could suggest recent use of weapons, such as on the fingers and shoulders. Strip searches are common, witnesses say, including for women. Oleksandra Matviychuk, the head of the Center for Civil Liberties, a Kyiv-based human rights group, said the process, even when not violent, was ""inhuman"". ""There's no military need for this... They're trying to occupy the country with a tool I call 'immense pain of civilian people'. You ask: 'Why so much cruelty? For what?'"" Maksym, a 48-year-old steelworker, said he was forced to strip naked while officers in Bezimenne checked even the seams of his clothes. He was asked whether he was from the Azov regiment or was a Nazi sympathiser - he denied being either - and why he wanted to leave Mariupol. ""I said, 'Actually, it's you who are on Ukrainian soil.'"" One of the officers, who he said were all Russian, reacted by hitting Maksym with the gun butt in his chest. He fell. ""I leaned my head on the ground, holding my ribs. I couldn't get up,"" he said. ""It was very painful to breathe."" He was taken to what he described as a ""cage"", where others were being held. He noticed that one man, a weightlifter, had a tattoo of Poseidon, the Greek god, with a trident. The soldiers, Maksym said, thought it was the Ukrainian coat of arms. ""He explained it to them but they didn't understand."" Those detained in the ""cage"" were given no water or food, and had to urinate in a corner in front of everyone, Maksym told me. At one point, exhausted, he tried to sleep on the ground. An officer came in and kicked him in the back, forcing him to stand. People would be taken to be interrogated and, when they returned, ""you saw the person had been beaten,"" Maksym said. He witnessed a woman in her 40s lying in pain, apparently after being hit in the stomach. A man, who seemed to be around 50, had a bleeding lip and red bruises on his neck. Maksym believed he had been strangled. No-one in the ""cage"" asked or said anything to each other. They were afraid that FSB officers could be disguised as prisoners. After about four or five hours, Maksym was released and allowed to leave Mariupol. Days later, he reached safety in Ukrainian-controlled territory, and went to a hospital to treat the persistent pain in his chest. The diagnosis: four broken ribs. Yuriy Belousov, who leads the Department of War at the Ukrainian general prosecutor's office, said his team had received allegations of torture and even killings during filtration. ""[It seems to be] a Russian policy which was designed in advance, and pretty well prepared,"" he told me. ""It's definitely not just a single case or [something] done by a local military guy."" He acknowledged it was difficult to verify the cases, or estimate the scale of the violence. The Ukrainian authorities are unable to carry out investigations in occupied territories and most victims remain reluctant to share their stories, concerned that relatives in Mariupol could be targeted if their identity is exposed. Vadym, 43, who used to work at a state-owned company in Mariupol, said he was tortured in Bezimenne in March. Separatist soldiers had questioned his wife after finding out she had ""liked"" the Ukrainian army page on Facebook, and restoring a receipt on her phone of a donation she had made to them. ""I tried to stand up for her,"" he said, ""but was knocked down."" He got up, but was beaten once more. A pattern, he said, that happened again and again. When Russian soldiers realised where he worked, they took Vadym to a different building. There, Vadym said, separatist soldiers asked him ""stupid things"" and started to beat him. ""They used electricity. I almost died. I fell and choked on my dental fillings, which had come out from my teeth,"" Vadym said. He vomited and fainted. ""They were furious. When I recovered consciousness, they told me to clean everything up and continued to give me electric shocks."" The torture, Vadym said, only stopped after Russian officers intervened. They carried out another round of questioning before finally freeing him. As Vadym left the building, he saw a young woman, who had been identified during the process as a court clerk, being carried out. ""A plastic bag was put on her head, and her hands were tied,"" Vadym said. ""Her mother was on her knees, begging for her daughter not to be taken away."" Vadym's release came with a condition: he would have to go to Russia. About 1.2 million people in Ukraine, including thousands of Mariupol residents, have been sent to Russia against their will since the invasion began in February, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia denies it is carrying out a mass deportation, which would constitute a war crime under international humanitarian law, and says it is simply helping those who want to go. Ukraine rejects this claim. Some of those sent to Russia have managed to escape to other countries and even return to Ukraine. How many, remains unclear. Vadym, with the help of his friends, moved to another European country - he did not want to reveal the exact location. He had lost some of his vision, he told me, and doctors said this was a result of head injuries from the beating. ""I feel better now, but rehabilitation will take a long time."" I asked him what he thought about filtration. ""They separate families. People are being disappeared,"" he said. ""It's pure terror."" Russia's defence ministry did not respond to several requests for comment on the allegations. The Russian government has previously denied it is carrying out war crimes in Ukraine. Andriy said his mother was told by a Russian soldier that he was going through ""re-education"" Andriy and his family have now settled in Germany, after also having been forced to go to Russia. Looking back, he believes the occupying forces seemed to be using filtration to show their ""absolute power"". Soldiers, he said, acted as if it was a ""type of entertainment"", something to ""satisfy their own ego"". I told him about another Ukrainian I had met, a 60-year-old retired engineer called Viktoriia. A soldier found out she had added a Ukrainian flag to her profile photo on Facebook, she said, and the message ""Ukraine above all."" He pointed his gun at her, she told me, and threatened: ""I'll put you in the basement until you rot!"" He then kicked her. Viktoriia struggled to understand why he had acted like that. ""What did I do? What right did they have?"" Andriy said he could not explain such behaviour. ""I even try to justify the process somehow. Try to convince myself there's some logic."" But, he said, ""there's no logic"".

"Pembrokeshire, along with Gwynedd, already has a 100% council tax premium on second homes Are tax hikes and rule changes in Wales already seeing more second home owners sell their properties? Some estate agents say there are signs of that, but others say not enough is being done to ensure local people can afford homes. All councils in Wales will be able to set council tax premiums of up to 300% on second homes from April 2023. The Welsh government said it was committed to using ""immediate and radical"" action to tackle injustices. Tax hikes will make holiday lets unviable - owners What's Wales' problem with second homes? Welsh second homes may face 300% council tax hikes The changes, included in a Labour-Plaid Cymru co-operation agreement, are part of an effort to make it easier for people to afford homes where they grew up. Ian Wyn-Jones, an estate agent based in north Wales, said that over the last couple of months it was clear ""changes have come, and they're working"". Estate agent Ian Wyn-Jones says the changes are already making a noticeable difference ""We're here in Cwm y Glo near Llanberis today, where the vendor is selling the property clearly because of the new regulation,"" he said. ""The people who are buying it are local first-time buyers, so in a way it's ticking all the boxes."" But he does not see the changes having an impact in the so-called second home ""honey pots"". ""Places like Abersoch, Trearddur Bay, Rhosneigr and Harlech - were not going to see any changes there,"" he said. ""The people there, they're not going to be fussed because the prices there are ranging from Â£1m up to Â£4m for a four or five-bedroom house."" This second home in Cwm y Glo, near Llanberis, was being sold to a local first-time buyer But Mr Wyn-Jones said he believed any changes should help manage the holiday let market, not push it away, as it was an important part of the local economy. ""Every single house that's let as a holiday home, there's a little community around each one. You've got your cleaners, your marketing team, you've got everything."" According to government body Stats Wales, there were a total of 23,974 second homes in Wales subject to council tax in 2022, as well as 22,140 empty homes. Under new rules, councils will be allowed to decide which level of council tax premium is appropriate for their local circumstances, up to 300%. The current maximum is 100%. This does not necessarily mean all councils will make an increase, or that they will increase the premium to the maximum permissible. Some councils are already charging higher levies, including 100% in Gwynedd and Pembrokeshire, which have the largest number of second homes - 3,746 and 3,794 respectively this year. The criteria for self-catering accommodation being liable for business rates instead of council tax will also change. At the moment properties available to let for a minimum of 140 days in any 12-month period, and actually let for at least 70 days, pay rates not council tax. Under the changes properties must be available to let for at least 252 days, and actually let for at least 182 days to qualify. Owain Llywelyn, spokesperson for the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors in Wales, said the council tax increase was just ""one small step"" to address the second homes issue, and that more action was needed. ""There are many other potential measures that that could be enacted,"" he said. ""One of which is perhaps a change in the land tax transaction level from 4% to 8%."" He also suggested a council tax multiplier of up to 10 times for some properties, in addition to implementing rules ensuring only people living within about 35 miles of a property can purchase it. Rhys Tudur, of the Hawl i fyw Adra (right to live at home) campaign, also believes further steps are needed. Rhys Tudur says stricter measures are needed He said: ""I hope the changes will make a degree of difference but I don't foresee they'll make as much of a difference as we'd hope. ""They must put in more strict measures, such as a second home tax which is implemented when a home is purchased, and in addition there should be a cap on the number of second homes in each given community. ""The government has consulted upon these measures but they've yet to act upon them, and they should do so soon."" Welsh ministers are encouraging councils to put any extra money raised from higher taxes into increasing the amount of affordable housing. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said the ""intended impact is to reduce the demand for second homes"" and is ""not intended as a money raising exercise by councils"". ""The council tax premiums can form part of a package that also includes planning measures and steps to reduce the number of self-catering properties being switched to business rates instead of council tax,"" a spokesperson added. The Welsh government said: ""We are committed to taking immediate and radical action using the planning, property and taxation systems to tackle the injustices in the current housing market, including the negative impact that second homes and unaffordable housing can have, and will soon have a package of proposals to tackle the various problems this presents.""

"Should Wales move away from sheep, wet weather and rugby motifs? Wales needs a rebrand in order to get away from ""sheep, wet weather and... rugby,"" tourism industry bosses have said. Zip World director Sean Taylor made the plea while saying the country should instead promote adventure tourism, food and drink and heritage sites. Focusing on culture and Welsh would also attract visitors, other bosses told the Welsh Affairs Committee. Mr Taylor told MPs he thought Wales got ""overshadowed quite a bit"". He added: ""You've got the Royal Family down in London, you've got tartan and Loch Ness in Scotland and in Ireland you've got Guinness. ""If you look at the brand in Wales it is fairly weak compared to the Irish brand and the Scottish brand in particular. ""I think we definitely need to get away from sheep, wet weather and - even as a president of my local rugby club - rugby as well, because football has come to the fore now."" Wales tourism tax 'will turn people away' Tax hikes make holiday lets in Wales 'unviable' Popular Snowdonia car park will be pre-book Other suggestions from tourism bosses included more use of the country's Welsh name Cymru, rather than the English version Wales. ""The language needs to be weaponised as an advantage, not a threat,"" Mr Taylor added. ""I feel like there's often negative connotations about the language. But our international and English visitors love the use of the Welsh language. ""We get school groups from England and by the time they leave they can say 'bore da', 'prynhawn da', 'croeso'. They love it, they embrace it."" Adventure tourism, such as that on offer in Snowdonia National Park, should be highlighted more, industry leaders say Zip World now has five locations in Wales, including Penrhyn Quarry, described as the fastest zip line in the world. Portmeirion Cymru's Ian Roberts said tourists who come to their Italian influenced tourist village near Porthmadog, enjoy hearing Welsh being spoken, hearing that it is vibrant and alive. ""We've always put a strong emphasis on the culture, tradition and the language. Over 90% of the people who work in Portmeirion speak Welsh,"" he said. ""We think it could be used more, including the use of the term Cymru other than Wales,"" he added. The business leaders, who included Paul Lewin from Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railway and Penderyn Distillery chief executive Stephen Davies called on the Welsh government to increase its tourism budget. A spokeswoman for the Welsh government said: ""Wales is known as a nation that offers world-leading adventure, creative culture, a thriving language and outstanding protected landscapes. ""The focus of the Cymru Wales brand is on marketing Wales' standout strengths as a country, and showcasing them to people across the world."" Paul Lewin from FFestiniog and Welsh Highland Railway wants the message to focus more on ""the wonderful scenery"" They want better communication about Wales' identity and why people should visit. The calls come as the latest figures on overseas visitors to Wales show the impact of the Covid pandemic. There was an 89% drop in overseas visitors staying overnight in Wales in 2021, compared to 2019. There were 116,000 overnight visits to Wales, according to the International Passenger Survey figures, published by ONS. Meanwhile, Cardiff was the 17th in the top 20 towns and cities in the UK, outside London, for visits by foreign tourists, with 35,000 overnight stays. This was below Coventry, Luton and Nottingham, but above Sheffield, Chester and Bath. Manchester was top, overtaking Edinburgh for the first time. Mr Lewin, who manages the UK's longest heritage railway, said: ""What is common to all the tourist attractions in Wales is the setting. It is the wonderful environment, the wonderful scenery and how accessible it is compared to many other places."" Penderyn's Mr Davies, who exports Welsh single malt whisky to over 40 countries, said he did not get the sense Wales was ""selling itself"". ""There's a huge opportunity to improve communication with visitors that do come into Wales, because they've come here, they've made the effort. Let's keep them here or bring them back.""

"A woman uses a fan to cool a child during the recent heatwave in India Two weeks of climate talks in Germany have ended in acrimony between rich and poor countries over cash for climate damage. Developing countries say they are reeling from climate change caused by richer countries' emissions over hundreds of years. They hoped to get compensation onto the official agenda for discussions by world leaders in November. But here in Bonn they couldn't get the US and the European Union to agree. ""The climate emergency is fast becoming a catastrophe,"" said Conrod Hunte, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). ""Yet within these walls the process feels out of step with reality, the pace feels too slow,"" he told delegates at the end of the meeting. Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties Green energy 'stagnates' as fossil fuels dominate Huge methane emission from Russian coal mine People being rescued from floods in China Developing nations say they need money to deal with the impacts of climate change, because they suffer the effects more than richer nations and have less financial capacity to cope. They argue that the climate change they are experiencing has been caused by carbon emitted by richer countries as they developed their economies. They say that Europe and the US have a responsibility now to compensate them for this. The US and Europe don't agree. They fear that if they pay for historic emissions it could put their countries on the hook for billions of dollars for decades or even centuries to come. The issue is termed ""loss and damage,external"" and has become a running sore in these negotiations. At last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow, island states and developing countries agreed to prioritise cuts to carbon emissions on the back of promises that richer nations would finally set up a compensation process this year. It was a compromise they hoped would pay off. But despite two weeks of discussions here in Bonn, they have been unable to get the issue of a funding facility on the agenda for the COP27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November. ""The compromise was based on an understanding that countries would be willing to start talking and taking decisions on dealing with how to get that finance flowing for loss and damage,"" said Alex Scott from E3G, an environmental think tank. ""And we haven't seen that come to fruition here. Instead, we've seen a workshop set up to talk about how we can fix some of the problems."" The EU in particular has come in for heavy criticism. ""The EU consistently blocked discussions on finance for loss and damage in Bonn,"" said Harjeet Singh, from the Climate Action Network International. ""The last two weeks exposed its hypocritical stance, with major countries like Germany sourcing new fossil fuels abroad while denying support to developing countries facing devastation from climate-induced superstorms and rising seas."" Firefighting in Spain Many participants from poorer regions of the world brought their own personal testimony of the impacts of climate change. ""We are already living with loss and damages for the last 25 years,"" said Adriana Vasquez Rodriquez from La Ruta del Clima, a Costa Rican environmental group. ""We have families who have lost their houses, their crops, their lives, and no-one is paying for that, we are running out of resources, and at the same time, we are depending on debt."" Bridging the divide between rich and poor on this issue will not be easy. While the question of a financial facility will now not be on the official discussions at COP27 in Egypt, developing countries are certain to continue to insist that their voices be heard on this question.

"The star's last album was released in 2016 BeyoncÃ© has announced what appears to be her first solo album in six years, Renaissance, due out on 29 July. It will be the follow-up to 2016's Lemonade, a meditation on black identity and marital infidelity that toppedmultiple end-of-year lists. Fans had been waiting for the news ever since BeyoncÃ©deleted her social media profile pictures last week,external. She put them out of their misery on Thursday morning, by sharing the words ""act i â¦ RENAISSANCE"" on her accounts. Streaming sites including Spotify and Apple Music swiftly posted artwork for the record, offering fans the chance to pre-save the release. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Tidal, the company owned by BeyoncÃ©'s husband Jay-Z, also shared the information but, crucially, it will not carry the album as an exclusive. Lemonade, by contrast, was a Tidal exclusive for three years. BeyoncÃ©'s joint album with Jay-Z, Everything Is Love, was an exclusive for just two days in 2018. Now the relationship has been severed, a recognition that the streaming service - which has about a 2% market share - cannot deliver the numbers BeyoncÃ© needs to dominate the charts. Alisting on Apple Music,externalsuggests that Renaissance will contain 16 songs. It is not clear whether the title ""Act i"" means this will be the first of a multiple-album project, or whether the 16 tracks will be released in multiple parts. BeyoncÃ©'s charitable foundation BeyGOOD, tipped fans off that something was coming earlier this week, when it shared a montage of album covers to celebrate Black History Month in the US. Hidden amongst the records was an image of a gloved hand pointing to the Brandy album B7 - the codename BeyoncÃ©'s latest record had been given by her followers. Last year, the 40-year-old confirmed to Harper's Bazaar that she had begun working on new music. ""With all the isolation and injustice over the past year, I think we are all ready to escape, travel, love, and laugh again,"" she said. ""I feel a renaissance emerging, and I want to be part of nurturing that escape in any way possible. I've been in the studio for a year and a half."" She also discussed her habit of collaborating with dozens of people to construct songs; refining and shaping the music in her own image. ""Sometimes it takes a year for me to personally search through thousands of sounds to find just the right kick or snare. One chorus can have up to 200 stacked harmonies,"" she said. ""Still, there's nothing like the amount of love, passion, and healing that I feel in the recording studio. After 31 years, it feels just as exciting as it did when I was nine years old. Yes, the music is coming!"" BeyoncÃ©'s last major project was the 2018 ""Homecoming"" concert at Coachella The star launched her career as part of the R&B girl group Destiny's Child in 1997, before going solo in 2003. With hits like Crazy In Love, Single Ladies and Hold Up, she is one of the most successful and influential recording artists of her generation. Over the course of her career she has won 28 Grammy awards and 79 nominations, more than any other female musician. In the six years since her last album, she has curated a soundtrack for Disney's Lion King remake and staged an historic performance at the 2018 Coachella Music Festival, which celebrated the culture of historically black colleges and universities in the US. The concert was immortalised in a Netflix special, Homecoming, which itself won a Grammy for best music film.

"Prices in the UK went up by 2.5% in the 12 months to December. It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for three months in a row. The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and cut them twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%. Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 but is Â£1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%. The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, withvinyl records and air fryersadded in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure is called theConsumer Prices Index (CPI),external, and the latest figure is published every month. CPIwas 2.5% in the year to December 2024, down from 2.6% in the 12 months to November. It marked the first fall in the inflation rate for three months. This was largely as a result of hotel prices falling, and tobacco costs increasing by less than in December 2023. Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years. However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine. It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices. UK inflation rise - what does it mean for me? When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high. The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals. Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment. The Bank of England cut rates twice in 2024 - to 5% in August, and againto 4.75% in November. As expected,it held rates at 4.75% at its December meeting. The Bank also considersother measures,external, such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates. Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.2% in December, down from 3.5% in the year to November. After the Budget at the end of October, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - includingan increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers- would lift inflation slightly as businesses passed on their increased costs through higher prices. Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Bailey said the path for rates would likely be ""downward from here"" but warned cuts would be gradual. After the December meeting, he said ""a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right"", but added ""with the heightened uncertainty in the economy, we can't commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year."" The next interest rate decision is on Thursday 6 February. Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper?

Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.2%, up from 4.8% between July and September.

The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2.4% in December 2024, up from 2.2% in November. In June, the European Central Bank (ECB)cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%,the first fall in five years. It has since cut rates three times:to 3.5% in September, to 3.25% in October and to 3% in December,external. US inflationrose to 2.9% in December 2024, the third consecutive monthly increase. At its September meeting,the US central bank lowered rates for the first time in four years, cutting its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to between 4.75% and 5%. The cut was larger than many analysts had predicted. In November, the Federal Reserve announced a further cut,taking the key rate to between 4.5% and 4.75%.

"Prices in the UK have already risen by 9% over the last year - the highest rate of inflation for 40 years. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has told MPs he is unable to stop inflation reaching 10%, whilewarning of an ""apocalyptic"" rise in global food prices. But how long is inflation likely to remain this high, and what can the government do to fight back? A 9% annual rate of inflation means - in the most basic terms - that if a loaf of bread cost Â£1 this time last year, it now costs Â£1.09. But inflation is spread unevenly across sectors in the economy - so while some prices have grown a little or stayed the same, others have rocketed upwards. This is because inflation is being driven by the rising costs of fuel and food, and some product supply chains are more affected than others. A 54% increase in the energy price cap has caused almost three-quarters of the jump in inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics. Over the winter, demand for oil and gas shot up as industries in Asia returned to full capacity after the pandemic and began consuming more energy. Russia's invasion of Ukraineput further pressure on energy prices as countries around the world scrambled to find alternatives to Russian oil and gas. Meanwhile, Ukrainian farms have been left unattended - and its wheat exports have been disrupted - putting pressure on global food supplies. ""Inflation is mostly driven by labour market shortages and supply chain disruptions,"" says Prof Riccardo Crescenzi, an economist at the London School of Economics. These are made worse in the UK by significant uncertainty over trade and investment conditions, and restrictions on international labour mobility in a variety of key sectors, he says. Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world The Bank of England expects the UK's energy price cap to rise again in October, which will push inflation up to 10% this autumn. Despite this, it says that the ""current high rates of inflation are not likely to last"". It forecasts inflation will peak this winter - then come down to be close to 2% in about two years. Not all economists are so sure. Historically, when inflation has risen above 9% it has taken years, not months, to recover. Maria Demertzis, an economist at Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank, says as long as the war in Ukraine continues, and there are concerns about where the UK will get its oil and gas from, ""that's going to put a lot of pressure on prices."" To combat the effects of inflation, companies are offering higher wages to workers. But to pay for this, they often have to raise the prices of their own products and services, which fuels further inflation. This creates what economists call an inflationary spiral. ""Inflation is likely to remain a problem in 2023 because its root causes are unlikely to change in the near future"" says Prof Crescenzi. What will it take to get inflation under control? By raising interest rates, the Bank of England can make borrowing more expensive - encouraging people to save instead of spend. It also means some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. So far, this hasn't reversed inflation, but central banks argue that without such measures, inflation would be rising faster. The Labour Party is calling for a one-offwindfall taxon oil and gas firms to help households cope with higher bills. BP's underlying profit more than doubled to Â£4.9bn in the first quarter of 2022, while Shell's profits almost tripled to over Â£7bn - both helped by the rising price of energy. Labour say a windfall tax would raise Â£1.2bn but the government argues that such a tax could discourage crucial investments that would eventually bring down energy costs and so make the UK less sensitive to global oil and gas prices. Governments can also give direct support to households by giving cash handouts, and placing caps on energy prices. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said ""we cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we can."" France Announced a one-off â¬100 (Â£84) payment to the 5.8 million households that already receive energy vouchers, last year. Since then, it has reduced taxes on electricity and capped rises in energy bills to 4%. These measures are estimated to have cost up to â¬15.5bn (Â£13bn). Italy It is raising taxes on energy companies that have seen profits rise thanks to surging prices. Also announced a â¬14bn fuel subsidy and investment plan - allowing families to keep their fuel bills similar to 2021 levels, while also investing in renewable energy. Germany It has already brought in subsidies for low-income households and is now spending an extra â¬15bn - on fuel subsidies through cutting petrol and diesel taxes, providing people with one-off â¬300 pay outs, extra child support payments and public transport discounts. The total cost for these measures is about â¬30bn.

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99978954

Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case.

The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit.

actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in

not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to

government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become

visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at

Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case.

the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next

weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions.

In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at

President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said.

"This video can not be played Watch: Lord Geidt talks to parliamentary committee about resignation rumours two days before quitting The government has published a letter from Boris Johnson's former ethics adviser Lord Geidt who resigned suddenly without explanation. Lord Geidt was known to be unhappy with the prime minister's handling of Partygate and had suggested he may have broken the ministerial code. In his letter, he says he had been asked to consider another matter that could have breached the code. Downing Street has also published the PM's reply to Lord Geidt. A friend of Lord Geidt told the BBC they feel ""deeply saddened that such an honourable and dedicated public servant has been put in a position where he feels forced to resign"". Lord Geidt quit over ministerial code 'affront' Boris Johnson's ethics adviser Lord Geidt quits Chris Mason on why the PM's ethics adviser quit PM's Partygate fine may have broken code, MPs told This video can not be played Letters to and from Boris Johnson's former ethics adviser Lord Geidt ""will speak for themselves"", says Michael Ellis. The government announced it would publish the letters minutes before minister Michael Ellis was called to the Commons to face an urgent question on the subject. Labour shadow minister Fleur Anderson said the prime minister had ""driven both of his own hand-picked ethics advisers to resign in despair"" and added that, without reform, the position was an ""unworkable"". William Wragg - Conservative MP and critic of the prime minister - asked how long it would take to find a new ethics adviser, noting that last time the recruitment process took five months. Mr Ellis said the Government was ""disappointed"" by the resignation but added that the letters from both men would ""speak for themselves"". In recent days Lord Geidt had expressed frustration over the handling of the Partygate row. He said it was reasonable to suggest the prime minister may have breached the ministerial code by breaking Covid lockdown laws.

"Regular eye testing is important for diabetics Diabetes patients have been warned that non-attendance at eye-test appointments puts them at greater risk of developing unnecessary sight loss. The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) has described the attendance rates at clinics in Northern Ireland as ""alarmingly low"" . It said 20% to 40% of patients were not showing up for their appointments on any given day. On Saturday afternoons that figure can be even higher. Prof Tunde Peto, clinical lead for the NI Diabetic Eye Screening Programme, said the most common of many complications caused by diabetes was diabetic eye disease. Diabetes can cause cataracts early on but it can also affect the retina at the back of the eye, ""which will eventually lead to sight loss if not treated on time,"" Prof Peto explained. ""Diabetic retinopathy causes no symptoms until it can be just about too late to treat,"" she said. The good news is that, if the disease is caught early enough through screening, treatments are available. Prof Tunde Peto says the diabetic eye disease doesn't show symptoms until it has already developed Ian Catlin from Ballymoney has experienced sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy. He has had Type 1 diabetes since childhood and became aware of problems with his eyesight in his mid-30s. ""Probably when I was about 33, I started having problems and it's been slowly getting worse,"" he said. ""I'm totally blind in the left eye and I'm losing the vision in right eye slowly."" Mr Catlin explained that the blood vessels at the back of his eye burst due to the high level of blood sugars. ""I'm a joiner by trade and I can't do that anymore,"" the County Antrim man said, adding that he's lucky to have his wife and children to help him cope. Ian Catlin says some people don't attend eye clinics because of fear of the unknown Mr Catlin said he put off asking for medical help because of the fear of what he would be told. ""I did eventually go, but you're scared and you put your head in the sand,"" he said. Diabetes patients are sent a number of reminders of their appointments, including letters and day-before texts, Prof Peto explained. She said appointment slots that could have been used by another patient are lost if someone doesn't turn up. There are about 115,000 people with diabetes in Northern Ireland and that figure is increasing by 5% to 7% annually. The eye screening programme has put on evening and weekend clinics to help deal with the numbers. ""People usually prioritise things that give them symptoms and because eye disease doesn't give symptoms until it's really late, sometimes people don't appreciate that they should be coming,"" said Prof Peto. ""If you absolutely cannot come then please cancel on time so we can give the appointment to someone else,"" she added. Mr Catlin advised people who receive appointments to overcome their fears. ""Go. You need to go and you need to find if there are any abnormalities,"" he said. ""You can catch it and you can stop any severe problems happening.""

"Australia's energy minister has urged households in New South Wales - a state that includes the country's biggest city Sydney - to switch off their lights in the face of an energy crisis. Chris Bowen says people should not use electricity for two hours every evening if they ""have a choice"". However, he added he was ""confident"" that blackouts could be avoided. It comes after Australia's main wholesale electricity market was suspended because of a surge in prices. Mr Bowen asked people living in New South Wales to conserve as much power as possible. ""If you have a choice about when to run certain items, don't run them from 6 to 8 [in the evening],"" he said during a televised media conference in Canberra. Australia is one of the world's biggest exporters of coal and liquefied natural gas but has been struggling with a power crisis since last month. Three quarters of the country's electricity is still generated using coal. It has long been accused of not doing enough to cut its emissions by investing in renewables. In recent weeks, Australia has felt the impact of disruptions to coal supplies, outages at several coal-fired power plants and soaring global energy prices. Australia signs new carbon emissions target Flooding earlier this year hit some coal mines in New South Wales and Queensland, while technical issues have cut production at two mines that supply the market's biggest coal-fired station in New South Wales. Around a quarter of Australia's coal-fired electricity generating capacity is currently out of service due to unexpected outages and scheduled maintenance. Some electricity producers have seen their costs soar as global coal and gas prices have jumped due to sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, demand for energy has jumped amid a cold snap and as Australia's economy opens up after Covid-19 restrictions were eased. All of this has helped drive up power prices on the wholesale market to above the A$300 (Â£173; $210) per megawatt hour price cap set by the market's regulator, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). However, that cap was below the cost of production for several generators, who decided to withhold capacity. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Wednesday, Aemo took the unprecedented step of suspending the market and said it would set prices directly and compensate generators for the shortfall. It also asked consumers in New South Wales to ""temporarily reduce their energy usage"". Aemo has not given a timeline on when the suspension would be lifted. Itsaid in a statement,external, ""The price cap will remain until cumulative wholesale electricity prices fall below the cumulative price threshold."" ""Aemo, as the national power system operator, will continue to monitor the situation and provide further updates should conditions change,"" it added. On Thursday, Australia's biggest electricity producer AGL Energy said it expected to be able to supply more power to businesses and consumers in the coming days. It has three units that have been out of service at its coal-fired plant in Bayswater, New South Wales. They are among several planned and unplanned outages that have helped cause the power crisis. AGL said that one of the units should return to service on Thursday, while another will come back online by Saturday. Meanwhile, Australia's new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the crisis would be raised at a meeting with state premiers which starts on Thursday. Lynne Chester, an energy expert from the University of Sydney, told the BBC that policymakers have been aware of the risks of ageing generators for decades. ""The sector's regulators and policy makers have ignored the escalating capacity constraints of aging generation assets, fired by fossil fuels, that dominate the sector,"" Prof Chester said.

"The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 1% to 1.25% as it tries to get a handle on soaring inflation The rate rise follows another last month, when rates increased from 0.75% to 1% - they are now at the highest since 2009 Variable rate mortgages will go up by Â£12 a month per Â£100,000 worth of borrowing, says personal finance expert Martin Lewis Raising the interest rate is one way to curb inflation - by making borrowing more expensive and encouraging people to spend less The UK's inflation rate - the increase in prices for goods and services - hit 9% last month, with warnings it could top 10% this year Raising the interest rate makes mortgages and loans more expensive but increases the return on savings Yesterday, the US central bank announced its biggest rate hike in nearly 30 years to tackle surging inflation Edited by Rob Corp That's it for our live coverage of this month's interest rates announcement. Thanks for joining us. The live page writers were Rob Corp, Claire Heald, Catherine Evans and Heather Sharp. There'll be further updates and reaction in our news storyhere. Or if you need to know a bit more, check out our explainer -what are interest rates and how high could they go?. We're about to wrap up our live coverage - so here are the headlines:  The days of interest rates at historic lows now seem to be behind us. Today has seen the fifth consecutive rise since December. Here's how rates have changed. It claims it's prepared to act ""forcefully"" on inflation, but the Bank of England has been accused of lacking teeth, compared with other global institutions. A day after the US Federal Reserve raised rates by the
most since 1994 with a 75 basis-point hike, the BoE has increased its Bank Rate by 25 basis points. ""Once again the BoE looks like the timid cat next to the
Fed's roar against inflation,"" says Chris Beauchamp, chief
market analyst at trading platform IG Group. ""Accompanying comments about being prepared to act
'forcefully' on inflation will do little when the actual
evidence shows the committee remains broadly cautious."" While some have said that today's interest rise doesn't go far enough, others are welcoming it. Inflation is causing ""deep concern"" and is the ""main driver of pessimism"" among business leaders, says Kitty Ussher, chief economist of bosses' group the
Institute of Directors. âWhat the economy now needs is a
sense that inflation has peaked and is starting to fall back. She adds that we're not there yet, but todayâs decision will at least create a sense that ""policy
action is being takenâ. An interest rate rise can be good news for savers, but not this time says Sarah Pennells, consumer finance specialist at insurance company Royal London. ""Our research shows almost a third of people were planning to reduce the amount they were saving,
while a fifth would stop altogether, as a result of the cost of living crisis,"" she says. ""For those who can save, the gap between interest rates and inflation, now at
9%, means savers are continuing to lose value on cash they have in the bank."" She says mortgage borrowers on a variable or tracker rate will be hardest hit. We're getting lots of reaction to the Bank of England's decision to increase interest rates to 1.25%. And some don't think it has gone far enough. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, tells the BBC it's ""hard to be optimistic"" about the current situation. He says not just the UK but the rest of the Western world had ""made the mistake last year of overstimulating the economy"". ""Then when we suffered these supply shocks which had been amplified by the war in Ukraine and Chinese lockdowns, we've had this additional inflation,"" says Pickering. He says people are ""spending through this"" - and the Bank needs to put a stop to it. ""The risk here - and it's a very serious risk - is the only way the Bank of England can now get rid of the inflation is by triggering recession,"" he says. ""Better actually just to get this over and done with - that's why markets are now favouring a steeper path for interest rates in the UK and elsewhere."" Energy and fuel prices are contributing to rising inflation The Bank's decision to raise rates today shows the seriousness of the country's economic situation, Pat
McFadden, Labourâs shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, says. Many families will be worrying about the impact this will have on their household bills.  We need a plan for a stronger, more stable economy, that can weather the short-term issues and fix the foundations for the long-term.â Pat McFadden, Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury The interest rate rise adds an additional pressure for businesses, on top of a weakened economic outlook, soaring cost pressures, and labour shortages, an expert at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says. David Bharier, head of research at the BCC, says it could impact on  smaller businesses which may be reliant on banking or overdraft facilities, such as those buying goods in bulk in an attempt to offset raw material shortages. âThe increase signals the Bankâs intention to tackle inflation but businesses have been raising the alarm about spiralling prices since the start of 2021 and a higher interest rate is unlikely to address many of the global causes of this,"" he adds. Martin Lewis, the personal finance expert behind the Money Saving Expert website, has tweeted about the likely impact if the interest rate rise on our pockets. Lewis reckons people with variable rate mortgages will have to pay Â£12 more a month for each Â£100,000 they've borrowed. On the plus side, he expects that the interest rate paid on savings could rise in the next week - but warns that is not a given. As we've just heard from Andy Verity, it is the fifth time since December that the Bankâs Monetary
Policy Committee has voted to raise the cost of borrowing. Minutes from the Bank of Englandâs latest rate-setting
meeting also reveal that it expects the UK economy will shrink by 0.3% in the
second quarter - between April and June. The bank did not update its outlook for the third quarter
but has previously said it expects GDP to grow between July and September this year. This
would mean that the UK would avoid a recession this year â a recession is
defined as two consecutive quarters of the economy shrinking. However, the bank has previously said it expects GDP to
shrink in the final three months of this year - at a time when which the price cap on
household energy bills is set to increase. The rise in domestic gas and electricity bills will lift the
cost of living to âslightly aboveâ 11% in October, the Bank of England said. It means the rate of inflation will be more than five times
the Bankâs inflation target  - that's 2%. Andy VerityBBC Economics correspondent This is the fifth consecutive rise in interest rates. The Bank started raising them back in December and now they're up at 1.25%. While the interest rate is now at its highest since 2009, that's because they've been so low for so long. The reason for that was the Bank of England trying to support the economy through a decade of weak growth and stagnant living standards. They hadn't felt able to raise rates back to their normal level. And so they've stayed at those emergency lows. It's interesting that they've held back from doing half a percentage point, which was what a lot of people were expecting. UK interest rates have risen further as the Bank of England attempts to stem the pace of rising prices. Interest rates have increased from 1% to 1.25%, the fifth consecutive rise since December last year, putting them at the highest level in 13 years. It comes as finances are being squeezed by the rising cost of living, driven by record fuel and energy prices. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently running at a 40-year high. Read more here. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The Bank of England now expects the economy to be weaker
immediately, with a fall in the economy in this quarter, and for inflation to
be even higher, going above 11% in the autumn when the energy cap resets. It
will flesh out these new forecasts in August. The rise in interest rates to its highest level since February
2009 is intended to stop the global energy price shock becoming entrenched in
the UK. The bankâs spies in every region of the economy say they do not pick up
any sign of a reduction in demand for labour, and wage settlements above 5%. Hence the rise to a rate that would still be considered low by historic
standards, but may prove rather high to an economy, to homeowners and
businesses that has become accustomed to ultra-low rates after the financial
crisis. Three
members of the nine-member committee voted for an even bigger rise of 0.5%, in the
aftermath of the bumper 0.75% rise in rates in the US overnight. The Bank is keeping open a path of further rises. But such is
the economic squeeze and the fear of recession, that some economists predict
that some of these rises could be reversed within a year. It is a very
uncertain time. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee has announced interest rates are rising by 0.25% from 1% to 1.25%. Interest rates are now at their highest level since January 2009. The Bank of England is about to make its announcement on interest rates. Will they go up, down, or stay the same? We'll find out in a couple of minutes, so stay with us. We've just minutes until the Bank of England announces its plan for interest rates. If it raises interest rates, people will have less money to spend and it'll be more expensive to borrow. But if it does nothing, we could see something called a wage price spiral. Sound fun, like a helter-skelter? It isn't. Mel Stride, chair of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, told the BBC the bank was ""slow to work
out that the labour market was going to become as overheated as it has become"". What's a wage price spiral? According to Stride, economists describe a wage price spiral as when ""wages are chasing increasing
prices and being bumped up by increasing wages"". So, in a nutshell, it's when higher wages lead to higher prices, which continues in a loop of further rises, as workers seek even higher wages to cope with even higher prices. Food prices could rise even more - making families skip meals, says the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD). It warns that prices for basic items like dairy, bread and meat could rise by 15% over the summer, causing ""food stress"" for many. Last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded that inflation hit a 40-year-high at 9%, as food price rises gathered pace. The IGD says rising inflation and a decline in real wages (affected by higher prices) could see a family of four increasing their spend on food and groceries from Â£396 per month to Â£439 per month. It's blaming uncontrolled increases in labour costs, trade disruptions caused by Brexit and the weakening of the sterling against other currencies for the rising inflation rate.And the war in Ukraine is also having an effect, with the cost of grain being pushed up by supply problems. It's not just the UK which is dealing with soaring inflation, rising prices are a global issue right now and causing pain for people all over the world. Across the Atlantic, the US central bank yesterday announced its biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years, hiking its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. And it's not expected to stop there, with further rises expected. Figures on Friday showed US inflation rising to 8.6% in May - the fastest pace since 1981. ""It's crazy and it doesn't stop,"" Boston-based chef Ignacio Lopez, who has been watching food prices climb, told us. ""Every week things go up."" Brazil, Canada and Australia have also raised rates, while the European Central Bank has outlined plans to do so later this summer. Read more here. Mervyn King, who served as governor of the Bank of England from 2003-2013, says he expects the Bank to ""surely act"" today by raising rates to tackle rising inflation. Writing in the Spectator he suggests it should have moved faster to raise rates, referring to ""those members of the Monetary Policy Committee who only last year were keen on negative interest rates"". He also says that the UK faces ""a difficult couple of years, reminiscent of the 1970s"", with real living standards set to fall due to tough economic conditions, and that the government needs to be honest about this. Our leaders need to give us a clear narrative explaining why recent events will inevitably lower our national standard of living, how that burden will be shared, why it is important to bring inflation down, and why measures to raise economic growth and reduce regional disparities will take many years to come to fruition but will work only if we make a start now.""

"Asos has warned that full-year profits will fall sharply as cash-strapped customers return more items to the online clothing retailer. The company said that while sales rose in the three months to the end of May, profit had been hit by ""inflationary pressures on consumers"". Asos's chief operating officer Mat Dunn said it was ""too early"" to tell how long this behaviour would continue. But the firm expects adjusted pre-tax profit to fall to between Â£20m to Â£60m. It is far below Asos's prediction in January when it said annual profit was set to reach between Â£110m and Â£140m, and a sharp decline from the previous financial year when it hit Â£193.6m. Asos said the higher rate of returns was adding to warehouse and delivery costs. It said profit would be impacted if it had to cut prices to shift goods. Second hand clothes and the trouble with fast fashion Over the three months to 31 May, Asos said sales rose by 4% to Â£987.9m, driven by the UK and the US and the resolution of supply chain issues which had dogged its performance over the first half of its year. This ""led to an improved stock profile and increased newness and availability"". But Mr Dunn said: ""What is now clear, based on the significant increase in returns rates that we have seen, is that this inflationary pressure is increasingly impacting our customers' shopping behaviour."" Asos's share price plunged by 15% to a 12-year low of 987.5p following the update. Online clothing retailer N Brown also said rising inflation - which reached a a 40-year high in April - had affected consumer confidence since the start of its financial year when its sales fell by 2.1% to Â£165.1m in the first quarter. ""Sales volumes since the start of the financial year have been softer, reflecting various well-documented pressures on consumer confidence, which are showing no signs of abating in the short-term,"" said N Brown's chief executive Steve Johnson. ""As these pressures persist, we expect the trading environment to remain challenging and will, therefore, continue to take actions to mitigate the effects wherever possible."" Meanwhile, Asos announced it had found a replacement chief executive after Nick Beighton resigned last October. Chief commercial officer JosÃ© Antonio Ramos Calamonte is taking on the top job with immediate effect. He joined Asos nearly 18 months ago from Portugal's Salsa Jeans. Asos has also appointed JÃ¸rgen Lindemann as its new chairman. Currently a non-executive director, Mr Lindemann will take over the role from Ian Dyson who will step down on 1 August.

"Food prices will rise quickly this summer due to soaring costs, grocery analysts have predicted. Prices will rise at a rate of 15% as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables, the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) said. More vulnerable people will skip meals, it warned. It also predicted that prices would rise faster for longer than Bank of England estimates. The IGD, which provides analysis to major grocers, said the UK was facing the highest cost of living pressures since the 1970s, mainly down to the Ukraine war. Both Ukraine and Russia are major global grain producers - the countries together account for nearly a third of global wheat exports. So Russia's invasion of Ukraine is pushing up grain prices as countries around the world scramble for the produce. Products that use grains directly, such as bread, and products made of animals that are fed on grain, such as chicken, will rise quickly in price in the summer or autumn, IGD said. Chickens grow quickly, so it will only take weeks for animal-feed price rises to be felt by consumers. Why chicken is getting more and more expensive Five things that are going up in price and why Millions to get first cost-of-living payment from 14 July The squeeze on fuel and energy costs will also push food prices higher, because a lot of agriculture is very energy intensive, it said. Fertiliser prices have also nearly tripled since last year. A lot of foil and wood pulp normally come from Russia, and the war has driven up packaging prices of those materials. Plastic packaging, which is made from oil, is also more expensive. Ukrainian roads, ports and warehouses have been heavily damaged in the war, and so the volume of exports will be reduced ""for years to come"" IGD said, putting pressure on supplies of sunflower oil and wheat. The UK also faces particular problems, it said. Two-thirds of the people on the Seasonal Agricultural Workers scheme were from Ukraine last year, but this year, Ukrainian men between 18 and 60-years-old have been told to stay at home and fight. Gaps are being plugged by workers from further afield, but the new workers need training, and those costs will feed into price rises, IGD said. The UK gets about 40% of its food from outside the country, so it is exposed to global food price rises. And since Brexit, European Union producers are less likely to prioritise UK customers, it said. The Bank of England expects inflation to fall back next year, but IGD said higher inflation could last longer if there are more food export bans or more trade disruption due to new Brexit border arrangements in 2023. The rise in food prices will hit vulnerable families the hardest, IGD chief economist James Walton said. ""Sadly, many households in the UK struggled with food bills before the current inflation event began,"" he said. ""With prices for energy, motor fuel and food rising fast, more households are moving into this vulnerable group."" He said that IGD research had found shoppers increasingly reporting skipping meals, ""especially when there are children in the household"". Mr Walton expected shoppers in general to make money-saving changes to behaviour including eating out less and more at home, planning their menus ahead of time and making fewer spontaneous buys, cooking from scratch and eating up leftovers, shopping around and splitting shops between retailers, and switching from named brands to own-label products. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: ""It's crucial we do everything we can to support the farming sector, that's why we have announced measures to support growers with the availability of fertiliser, and we will be bringing forward 50% of the Basic Payment Scheme [farming subsidy] payment to July. ""We also recognise the food and farming industry is facing labour challenges. ""We have given greater certainty in accessing seasonal migrant labour by extending the Seasonal Workers visa route until the end of 2024. 30,000 visas will be available in 2022, with the potential to increase by 10,000 if there is clear evidence of need.""

"The Bank of England has raised interest rates from 1% to 1.25% as it tries to get a handle on soaring inflation The rate rise follows another last month, when rates increased from 0.75% to 1% - they are now at the highest since 2009 Variable rate mortgages will go up by Â£12 a month per Â£100,000 worth of borrowing, says personal finance expert Martin Lewis Raising the interest rate is one way to curb inflation - by making borrowing more expensive and encouraging people to spend less The UK's inflation rate - the increase in prices for goods and services - hit 9% last month, with warnings it could top 10% this year Raising the interest rate makes mortgages and loans more expensive but increases the return on savings Yesterday, the US central bank announced its biggest rate hike in nearly 30 years to tackle surging inflation Edited by Rob Corp That's it for our live coverage of this month's interest rates announcement. Thanks for joining us. The live page writers were Rob Corp, Claire Heald, Catherine Evans and Heather Sharp. There'll be further updates and reaction in our news storyhere. Or if you need to know a bit more, check out our explainer -what are interest rates and how high could they go?. We're about to wrap up our live coverage - so here are the headlines:  The days of interest rates at historic lows now seem to be behind us. Today has seen the fifth consecutive rise since December. Here's how rates have changed. It claims it's prepared to act ""forcefully"" on inflation, but the Bank of England has been accused of lacking teeth, compared with other global institutions. A day after the US Federal Reserve raised rates by the
most since 1994 with a 75 basis-point hike, the BoE has increased its Bank Rate by 25 basis points. ""Once again the BoE looks like the timid cat next to the
Fed's roar against inflation,"" says Chris Beauchamp, chief
market analyst at trading platform IG Group. ""Accompanying comments about being prepared to act
'forcefully' on inflation will do little when the actual
evidence shows the committee remains broadly cautious."" While some have said that today's interest rise doesn't go far enough, others are welcoming it. Inflation is causing ""deep concern"" and is the ""main driver of pessimism"" among business leaders, says Kitty Ussher, chief economist of bosses' group the
Institute of Directors. âWhat the economy now needs is a
sense that inflation has peaked and is starting to fall back. She adds that we're not there yet, but todayâs decision will at least create a sense that ""policy
action is being takenâ. An interest rate rise can be good news for savers, but not this time says Sarah Pennells, consumer finance specialist at insurance company Royal London. ""Our research shows almost a third of people were planning to reduce the amount they were saving,
while a fifth would stop altogether, as a result of the cost of living crisis,"" she says. ""For those who can save, the gap between interest rates and inflation, now at
9%, means savers are continuing to lose value on cash they have in the bank."" She says mortgage borrowers on a variable or tracker rate will be hardest hit. We're getting lots of reaction to the Bank of England's decision to increase interest rates to 1.25%. And some don't think it has gone far enough. Kallum Pickering, senior economist at Berenberg, tells the BBC it's ""hard to be optimistic"" about the current situation. He says not just the UK but the rest of the Western world had ""made the mistake last year of overstimulating the economy"". ""Then when we suffered these supply shocks which had been amplified by the war in Ukraine and Chinese lockdowns, we've had this additional inflation,"" says Pickering. He says people are ""spending through this"" - and the Bank needs to put a stop to it. ""The risk here - and it's a very serious risk - is the only way the Bank of England can now get rid of the inflation is by triggering recession,"" he says. ""Better actually just to get this over and done with - that's why markets are now favouring a steeper path for interest rates in the UK and elsewhere."" Energy and fuel prices are contributing to rising inflation The Bank's decision to raise rates today shows the seriousness of the country's economic situation, Pat
McFadden, Labourâs shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, says. Many families will be worrying about the impact this will have on their household bills.  We need a plan for a stronger, more stable economy, that can weather the short-term issues and fix the foundations for the long-term.â Pat McFadden, Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury The interest rate rise adds an additional pressure for businesses, on top of a weakened economic outlook, soaring cost pressures, and labour shortages, an expert at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) says. David Bharier, head of research at the BCC, says it could impact on  smaller businesses which may be reliant on banking or overdraft facilities, such as those buying goods in bulk in an attempt to offset raw material shortages. âThe increase signals the Bankâs intention to tackle inflation but businesses have been raising the alarm about spiralling prices since the start of 2021 and a higher interest rate is unlikely to address many of the global causes of this,"" he adds. Martin Lewis, the personal finance expert behind the Money Saving Expert website, has tweeted about the likely impact if the interest rate rise on our pockets. Lewis reckons people with variable rate mortgages will have to pay Â£12 more a month for each Â£100,000 they've borrowed. On the plus side, he expects that the interest rate paid on savings could rise in the next week - but warns that is not a given. As we've just heard from Andy Verity, it is the fifth time since December that the Bankâs Monetary
Policy Committee has voted to raise the cost of borrowing. Minutes from the Bank of Englandâs latest rate-setting
meeting also reveal that it expects the UK economy will shrink by 0.3% in the
second quarter - between April and June. The bank did not update its outlook for the third quarter
but has previously said it expects GDP to grow between July and September this year. This
would mean that the UK would avoid a recession this year â a recession is
defined as two consecutive quarters of the economy shrinking. However, the bank has previously said it expects GDP to
shrink in the final three months of this year - at a time when which the price cap on
household energy bills is set to increase. The rise in domestic gas and electricity bills will lift the
cost of living to âslightly aboveâ 11% in October, the Bank of England said. It means the rate of inflation will be more than five times
the Bankâs inflation target  - that's 2%. Andy VerityBBC Economics correspondent This is the fifth consecutive rise in interest rates. The Bank started raising them back in December and now they're up at 1.25%. While the interest rate is now at its highest since 2009, that's because they've been so low for so long. The reason for that was the Bank of England trying to support the economy through a decade of weak growth and stagnant living standards. They hadn't felt able to raise rates back to their normal level. And so they've stayed at those emergency lows. It's interesting that they've held back from doing half a percentage point, which was what a lot of people were expecting. UK interest rates have risen further as the Bank of England attempts to stem the pace of rising prices. Interest rates have increased from 1% to 1.25%, the fifth consecutive rise since December last year, putting them at the highest level in 13 years. It comes as finances are being squeezed by the rising cost of living, driven by record fuel and energy prices. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently running at a 40-year high. Read more here. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The Bank of England now expects the economy to be weaker
immediately, with a fall in the economy in this quarter, and for inflation to
be even higher, going above 11% in the autumn when the energy cap resets. It
will flesh out these new forecasts in August. The rise in interest rates to its highest level since February
2009 is intended to stop the global energy price shock becoming entrenched in
the UK. The bankâs spies in every region of the economy say they do not pick up
any sign of a reduction in demand for labour, and wage settlements above 5%. Hence the rise to a rate that would still be considered low by historic
standards, but may prove rather high to an economy, to homeowners and
businesses that has become accustomed to ultra-low rates after the financial
crisis. Three
members of the nine-member committee voted for an even bigger rise of 0.5%, in the
aftermath of the bumper 0.75% rise in rates in the US overnight. The Bank is keeping open a path of further rises. But such is
the economic squeeze and the fear of recession, that some economists predict
that some of these rises could be reversed within a year. It is a very
uncertain time. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee has announced interest rates are rising by 0.25% from 1% to 1.25%. Interest rates are now at their highest level since January 2009. The Bank of England is about to make its announcement on interest rates. Will they go up, down, or stay the same? We'll find out in a couple of minutes, so stay with us. We've just minutes until the Bank of England announces its plan for interest rates. If it raises interest rates, people will have less money to spend and it'll be more expensive to borrow. But if it does nothing, we could see something called a wage price spiral. Sound fun, like a helter-skelter? It isn't. Mel Stride, chair of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, told the BBC the bank was ""slow to work
out that the labour market was going to become as overheated as it has become"". What's a wage price spiral? According to Stride, economists describe a wage price spiral as when ""wages are chasing increasing
prices and being bumped up by increasing wages"". So, in a nutshell, it's when higher wages lead to higher prices, which continues in a loop of further rises, as workers seek even higher wages to cope with even higher prices. Food prices could rise even more - making families skip meals, says the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD). It warns that prices for basic items like dairy, bread and meat could rise by 15% over the summer, causing ""food stress"" for many. Last month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded that inflation hit a 40-year-high at 9%, as food price rises gathered pace. The IGD says rising inflation and a decline in real wages (affected by higher prices) could see a family of four increasing their spend on food and groceries from Â£396 per month to Â£439 per month. It's blaming uncontrolled increases in labour costs, trade disruptions caused by Brexit and the weakening of the sterling against other currencies for the rising inflation rate.And the war in Ukraine is also having an effect, with the cost of grain being pushed up by supply problems. It's not just the UK which is dealing with soaring inflation, rising prices are a global issue right now and causing pain for people all over the world. Across the Atlantic, the US central bank yesterday announced its biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years, hiking its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. And it's not expected to stop there, with further rises expected. Figures on Friday showed US inflation rising to 8.6% in May - the fastest pace since 1981. ""It's crazy and it doesn't stop,"" Boston-based chef Ignacio Lopez, who has been watching food prices climb, told us. ""Every week things go up."" Brazil, Canada and Australia have also raised rates, while the European Central Bank has outlined plans to do so later this summer. Read more here. Mervyn King, who served as governor of the Bank of England from 2003-2013, says he expects the Bank to ""surely act"" today by raising rates to tackle rising inflation. Writing in the Spectator he suggests it should have moved faster to raise rates, referring to ""those members of the Monetary Policy Committee who only last year were keen on negative interest rates"". He also says that the UK faces ""a difficult couple of years, reminiscent of the 1970s"", with real living standards set to fall due to tough economic conditions, and that the government needs to be honest about this. Our leaders need to give us a clear narrative explaining why recent events will inevitably lower our national standard of living, how that burden will be shared, why it is important to bring inflation down, and why measures to raise economic growth and reduce regional disparities will take many years to come to fruition but will work only if we make a start now.""

"An unnamed worker says he was beaten by the Taliban for working at the embassy More than 100 men who worked at the British embassy in Afghanistan remain in the country, with some telling the BBC they have been beaten and tortured. The men worked for the global security company, GardaWorld, and many had been in post for more than a decade. Several shared photos of injuries they say were caused by the Taliban. The UK government says it has evacuated more than 15,000 people since last year and is working to bring more to the UK. A spreadsheet listing the names of more than 150 men who worked at the embassy and still live in the country has been seen and verified by BBC Two's Newsnight. One man, who cannot be named to protect his identity, said he was recently beaten by the Taliban because of his previous job as a guard at the embassy. ""I was sitting outside when gunmen approached me, one of [them] attacked me,"" he said. ""They said you were working for the British embassy. They started beating me and they threw me on the ground. They attacked me again and again."" ""They attacked me again and again,"" one man said Another former guard said a militant hit him over the head with the butt of a rifle. He says he was only released after the Taliban was convinced he no longer worked for the British. This week, the UK government said the men would be able to apply to come to the UK from 20 June as part of its Afghan citizens resettlement scheme (ACRS), which is primarily targeted at those who assisted the UK efforts in Afghanistan. It was officially launched in January but application requests can only be submitted from next week. Critics say that is too little, too late. A separate government scheme, the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), aimed to relocate those who were employed directly by the British government, including interpreters who helped British forces. One Afghan who came to the UK earlier this year under ARAP said many of his former colleagues from the embassy were being threatened on a daily basis. He is not being named to protect his family who remain in Afghanistan. ""I feel like the British have been disloyal,"" he said. ""They made a promise - these men worked hard for them and now their lives are at risk. ""I can't sleep or eat without thinking of what they're going through.  They message me constantly asking for help."". How many Afghan refugees has the UK resettled? Father fears for safety of family in Afghanistan Terrified Afghan teachers still hiding from Taliban 'The more we wait, the more in danger we are' This week armed forces minister James Heappey told the Commons 9,500 Afghans have already been successfully relocated to the UK under the ARAP scheme. But he said thousands more still remained in Afghanistan. ""We think we've got about the same to go in terms of the number of people who are eligible,"" he said. The British Embassy in Kabul has suspended operations there since the Taliban takeover The human rights charity, Azadi, works to support and evacuate targeted Afghans. Sarah Magill, the charity's director, said there had been no explanation why it had taken so long to begin the next process. ""Through their inaction the government has caused incalculable trauma,"" she said. ""It is a deeply inhumane way to treat a body of staff entrusted to keep British ministers and civil servants safe."" The government has faced fierce criticism of its handling of the evacuation in Afghanistan last summer, with one group of MPs saying there had been a ""total absence of a plan for evacuating Afghans who supported the UK mission"". At the height of the Taliban takeover the government issued a statement, saying: ""We will help all those Afghan security guards contracted through GardaWorld to protect the embassy. ""They will be granted the right to enter the UK and we are now working through the challenging logistics of getting them out of Kabul."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""Our staff worked tirelessly to evacuate over 15,000 people to safety from Afghanistan within a fortnight in the biggest and fastest emergency in recent history. We are still working hard to assist the people of Afghanistan, having already helped over 4,600 individuals to leave the country since the end of the military evacuation. ""We have opened the Afghanistan Citizen Resettlement Scheme, one of the most ambitious resettlement programmes in the world and the first bespoke scheme in Europe to begin resettling evacuees and individuals."" GardaWorld added: ""Since the closure of the British Embassy in Kabul, we have been working tirelessly with the UK government to ensure the maximum take-up for our Afghan staff on the UK resettlement schemes.""

Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case. You can read our latest story here. Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.00010219894
"This video can not be played Watch: Lord Geidt talks to parliamentary committee about resignation rumours two days before quitting The government has published a letter from Boris Johnson's former ethics adviser Lord Geidt who resigned suddenly without explanation. Lord Geidt was known to be unhappy with the prime minister's handling of Partygate and had suggested he may have broken the ministerial code. In his letter, he says he had been asked to consider another matter that could have breached the code. Downing Street has also published the PM's reply to Lord Geidt. A friend of Lord Geidt told the BBC they feel ""deeply saddened that such an honourable and dedicated public servant has been put in a position where he feels forced to resign"".

The government announced it would publish the letters minutes before minister Michael Ellis was called to the Commons to face an urgent question on the subject. Labour shadow minister Fleur Anderson said the prime minister had ""driven both of his own hand-picked ethics advisers to resign in despair"" and added that, without reform, the position was an ""unworkable"". William Wragg - Conservative MP and critic of the prime minister - asked how long it would take to find a new ethics adviser, noting that last time the recruitment process took five months. Mr Ellis said the Government was ""disappointed"" by the resignation but added that the letters from both men would ""speak for themselves"". In recent days Lord Geidt had expressed frustration over the handling of the Partygate row. He said it was reasonable to suggest the prime minister may have breached the ministerial code by breaking Covid lockdown laws. Lord Geidthas previously been criticalof the prime minister over an investigation into renovations in the Downing Street flat. He is the second ethics adviser to quit under Mr Johnson's premiership. Sir Alex Allan,who resigned from the rolein 2020 after Mr Johnson chose not to accept his finding that Home Secretary Priti Patel had bullied civil servants.

He could also investigate ministers for breaching the code - but only if asked to do so by the prime minister. The code, which outlines the rules ministers must follow, says there is an ""overarching duty"" on them to comply with the law. If the code is broken, ministers are expected to resign. Mr Johnson enjoys a drink at a leaving party in November 2020 Questions have been raised over whether Mr Johnson breached the code after he was fined in April for attending a birthday party in Downing Street in June 2020 - when Covid restrictions were in place. Despite receiving the fine, Mr Johnson said he would not resign and in a letter to Lord Geidt he said there had been ""no intent"" to break Covid regulations.

"A woman uses a fan to cool a child during the recent heatwave in India Two weeks of climate talks in Germany have ended in acrimony between rich and poor countries over cash for climate damage. Developing countries say they are reeling from climate change caused by richer countries' emissions over hundreds of years. They hoped to get compensation onto the official agenda for discussions by world leaders in November. But here in Bonn they couldn't get the US and the European Union to agree. ""The climate emergency is fast becoming a catastrophe,"" said Conrod Hunte, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). ""Yet within these walls the process feels out of step with reality, the pace feels too slow,"" he told delegates at the end of the meeting. Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties Green energy 'stagnates' as fossil fuels dominate Huge methane emission from Russian coal mine People being rescued from floods in China Developing nations say they need money to deal with the impacts of climate change, because they suffer the effects more than richer nations and have less financial capacity to cope. They argue that the climate change they are experiencing has been caused by carbon emitted by richer countries as they developed their economies. They say that Europe and the US have a responsibility now to compensate them for this. The US and Europe don't agree. They fear that if they pay for historic emissions it could put their countries on the hook for billions of dollars for decades or even centuries to come. The issue is termed ""loss and damage,external"" and has become a running sore in these negotiations. At last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow, island states and developing countries agreed to prioritise cuts to carbon emissions on the back of promises that richer nations would finally set up a compensation process this year. It was a compromise they hoped would pay off. But despite two weeks of discussions here in Bonn, they have been unable to get the issue of a funding facility on the agenda for the COP27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November. ""The compromise was based on an understanding that countries would be willing to start talking and taking decisions on dealing with how to get that finance flowing for loss and damage,"" said Alex Scott from E3G, an environmental think tank. ""And we haven't seen that come to fruition here. Instead, we've seen a workshop set up to talk about how we can fix some of the problems."" The EU in particular has come in for heavy criticism. ""The EU consistently blocked discussions on finance for loss and damage in Bonn,"" said Harjeet Singh, from the Climate Action Network International. ""The last two weeks exposed its hypocritical stance, with major countries like Germany sourcing new fossil fuels abroad while denying support to developing countries facing devastation from climate-induced superstorms and rising seas."" Firefighting in Spain Many participants from poorer regions of the world brought their own personal testimony of the impacts of climate change. ""We are already living with loss and damages for the last 25 years,"" said Adriana Vasquez Rodriquez from La Ruta del Clima, a Costa Rican environmental group. ""We have families who have lost their houses, their crops, their lives, and no-one is paying for that, we are running out of resources, and at the same time, we are depending on debt."" Bridging the divide between rich and poor on this issue will not be easy. While the question of a financial facility will now not be on the official discussions at COP27 in Egypt, developing countries are certain to continue to insist that their voices be heard on this question.

"Asos has warned that full-year profits will fall sharply as cash-strapped customers return more items to the online clothing retailer. The company said that while sales rose in the three months to the end of May, profit had been hit by ""inflationary pressures on consumers"". Asos's chief operating officer Mat Dunn said it was ""too early"" to tell how long this behaviour would continue. But the firm expects adjusted pre-tax profit to fall to between Â£20m to Â£60m. It is far below Asos's prediction in January when it said annual profit was set to reach between Â£110m and Â£140m, and a sharp decline from the previous financial year when it hit Â£193.6m. Asos said the higher rate of returns was adding to warehouse and delivery costs. It said profit would be impacted if it had to cut prices to shift goods. Second hand clothes and the trouble with fast fashion Over the three months to 31 May, Asos said sales rose by 4% to Â£987.9m, driven by the UK and the US and the resolution of supply chain issues which had dogged its performance over the first half of its year. This ""led to an improved stock profile and increased newness and availability"". But Mr Dunn said: ""What is now clear, based on the significant increase in returns rates that we have seen, is that this inflationary pressure is increasingly impacting our customers' shopping behaviour."" Asos's share price plunged by 15% to a 12-year low of 987.5p following the update. Online clothing retailer N Brown also said rising inflation - which reached a a 40-year high in April - had affected consumer confidence since the start of its financial year when its sales fell by 2.1% to Â£165.1m in the first quarter. ""Sales volumes since the start of the financial year have been softer, reflecting various well-documented pressures on consumer confidence, which are showing no signs of abating in the short-term,"" said N Brown's chief executive Steve Johnson. ""As these pressures persist, we expect the trading environment to remain challenging and will, therefore, continue to take actions to mitigate the effects wherever possible."" Meanwhile, Asos announced it had found a replacement chief executive after Nick Beighton resigned last October. Chief commercial officer JosÃ© Antonio Ramos Calamonte is taking on the top job with immediate effect. He joined Asos nearly 18 months ago from Portugal's Salsa Jeans. Asos has also appointed JÃ¸rgen Lindemann as its new chairman. Currently a non-executive director, Mr Lindemann will take over the role from Ian Dyson who will step down on 1 August.

"Food prices will rise quickly this summer due to soaring costs, grocery analysts have predicted. Prices will rise at a rate of 15% as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables, the Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) said. More vulnerable people will skip meals, it warned. It also predicted that prices would rise faster for longer than Bank of England estimates. The IGD, which provides analysis to major grocers, said the UK was facing the highest cost of living pressures since the 1970s, mainly down to the Ukraine war. Both Ukraine and Russia are major global grain producers - the countries together account for nearly a third of global wheat exports. So Russia's invasion of Ukraine is pushing up grain prices as countries around the world scramble for the produce. Products that use grains directly, such as bread, and products made of animals that are fed on grain, such as chicken, will rise quickly in price in the summer or autumn, IGD said. Chickens grow quickly, so it will only take weeks for animal-feed price rises to be felt by consumers. Why chicken is getting more and more expensive Five things that are going up in price and why Millions to get first cost-of-living payment from 14 July The squeeze on fuel and energy costs will also push food prices higher, because a lot of agriculture is very energy intensive, it said. Fertiliser prices have also nearly tripled since last year. A lot of foil and wood pulp normally come from Russia, and the war has driven up packaging prices of those materials. Plastic packaging, which is made from oil, is also more expensive. Ukrainian roads, ports and warehouses have been heavily damaged in the war, and so the volume of exports will be reduced ""for years to come"" IGD said, putting pressure on supplies of sunflower oil and wheat. The UK also faces particular problems, it said. Two-thirds of the people on the Seasonal Agricultural Workers scheme were from Ukraine last year, but this year, Ukrainian men between 18 and 60-years-old have been told to stay at home and fight. Gaps are being plugged by workers from further afield, but the new workers need training, and those costs will feed into price rises, IGD said. The UK gets about 40% of its food from outside the country, so it is exposed to global food price rises. And since Brexit, European Union producers are less likely to prioritise UK customers, it said. The Bank of England expects inflation to fall back next year, but IGD said higher inflation could last longer if there are more food export bans or more trade disruption due to new Brexit border arrangements in 2023. The rise in food prices will hit vulnerable families the hardest, IGD chief economist James Walton said. ""Sadly, many households in the UK struggled with food bills before the current inflation event began,"" he said. ""With prices for energy, motor fuel and food rising fast, more households are moving into this vulnerable group."" He said that IGD research had found shoppers increasingly reporting skipping meals, ""especially when there are children in the household"". Mr Walton expected shoppers in general to make money-saving changes to behaviour including eating out less and more at home, planning their menus ahead of time and making fewer spontaneous buys, cooking from scratch and eating up leftovers, shopping around and splitting shops between retailers, and switching from named brands to own-label products. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: ""It's crucial we do everything we can to support the farming sector, that's why we have announced measures to support growers with the availability of fertiliser, and we will be bringing forward 50% of the Basic Payment Scheme [farming subsidy] payment to July. ""We also recognise the food and farming industry is facing labour challenges. ""We have given greater certainty in accessing seasonal migrant labour by extending the Seasonal Workers visa route until the end of 2024. 30,000 visas will be available in 2022, with the potential to increase by 10,000 if there is clear evidence of need.""

"Regular eye testing is important for diabetics Diabetes patients have been warned that non-attendance at eye-test appointments puts them at greater risk of developing unnecessary sight loss. The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) has described the attendance rates at clinics in Northern Ireland as ""alarmingly low"" . It said 20% to 40% of patients were not showing up for their appointments on any given day. On Saturday afternoons that figure can be even higher. Prof Tunde Peto, clinical lead for the NI Diabetic Eye Screening Programme, said the most common of many complications caused by diabetes was diabetic eye disease. Diabetes can cause cataracts early on but it can also affect the retina at the back of the eye, ""which will eventually lead to sight loss if not treated on time,"" Prof Peto explained. ""Diabetic retinopathy causes no symptoms until it can be just about too late to treat,"" she said. The good news is that, if the disease is caught early enough through screening, treatments are available. Prof Tunde Peto says the diabetic eye disease doesn't show symptoms until it has already developed Ian Catlin from Ballymoney has experienced sight loss due to diabetic retinopathy. He has had Type 1 diabetes since childhood and became aware of problems with his eyesight in his mid-30s. ""Probably when I was about 33, I started having problems and it's been slowly getting worse,"" he said. ""I'm totally blind in the left eye and I'm losing the vision in right eye slowly."" Mr Catlin explained that the blood vessels at the back of his eye burst due to the high level of blood sugars. ""I'm a joiner by trade and I can't do that anymore,"" the County Antrim man said, adding that he's lucky to have his wife and children to help him cope. Ian Catlin says some people don't attend eye clinics because of fear of the unknown Mr Catlin said he put off asking for medical help because of the fear of what he would be told. ""I did eventually go, but you're scared and you put your head in the sand,"" he said. Diabetes patients are sent a number of reminders of their appointments, including letters and day-before texts, Prof Peto explained. She said appointment slots that could have been used by another patient are lost if someone doesn't turn up. There are about 115,000 people with diabetes in Northern Ireland and that figure is increasing by 5% to 7% annually. The eye screening programme has put on evening and weekend clinics to help deal with the numbers. ""People usually prioritise things that give them symptoms and because eye disease doesn't give symptoms until it's really late, sometimes people don't appreciate that they should be coming,"" said Prof Peto.

"Pembrokeshire, along with Gwynedd, already has a 100% council tax premium on second homes Are tax hikes and rule changes in Wales already seeing more second home owners sell their properties? Some estate agents say there are signs of that, but others say not enough is being done to ensure local people can afford homes. All councils in Wales will be able to set council tax premiums of up to 300% on second homes from April 2023. The Welsh government said it was committed to using ""immediate and radical"" action to tackle injustices. Tax hikes will make holiday lets unviable - owners What's Wales' problem with second homes? Welsh second homes may face 300% council tax hikes The changes, included in a Labour-Plaid Cymru co-operation agreement, are part of an effort to make it easier for people to afford homes where they grew up. Ian Wyn-Jones, an estate agent based in north Wales, said that over the last couple of months it was clear ""changes have come, and they're working"". Estate agent Ian Wyn-Jones says the changes are already making a noticeable difference ""We're here in Cwm y Glo near Llanberis today, where the vendor is selling the property clearly because of the new regulation,"" he said. ""The people who are buying it are local first-time buyers, so in a way it's ticking all the boxes."" But he does not see the changes having an impact in the so-called second home ""honey pots"". ""Places like Abersoch, Trearddur Bay, Rhosneigr and Harlech - were not going to see any changes there,"" he said. ""The people there, they're not going to be fussed because the prices there are ranging from Â£1m up to Â£4m for a four or five-bedroom house."" This second home in Cwm y Glo, near Llanberis, was being sold to a local first-time buyer But Mr Wyn-Jones said he believed any changes should help manage the holiday let market, not push it away, as it was an important part of the local economy. ""Every single house that's let as a holiday home, there's a little community around each one. You've got your cleaners, your marketing team, you've got everything."" According to government body Stats Wales, there were a total of 23,974 second homes in Wales subject to council tax in 2022, as well as 22,140 empty homes. Under new rules, councils will be allowed to decide which level of council tax premium is appropriate for their local circumstances, up to 300%. The current maximum is 100%. This does not necessarily mean all councils will make an increase, or that they will increase the premium to the maximum permissible. Some councils are already charging higher levies, including 100% in Gwynedd and Pembrokeshire, which have the largest number of second homes - 3,746 and 3,794 respectively this year. The criteria for self-catering accommodation being liable for business rates instead of council tax will also change. At the moment properties available to let for a minimum of 140 days in any 12-month period, and actually let for at least 70 days, pay rates not council tax. Under the changes properties must be available to let for at least 252 days, and actually let for at least 182 days to qualify. Owain Llywelyn, spokesperson for the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors in Wales, said the council tax increase was just ""one small step"" to address the second homes issue, and that more action was needed. ""There are many other potential measures that that could be enacted,"" he said. ""One of which is perhaps a change in the land tax transaction level from 4% to 8%."" He also suggested a council tax multiplier of up to 10 times for some properties, in addition to implementing rules ensuring only people living within about 35 miles of a property can purchase it. Rhys Tudur, of the Hawl i fyw Adra (right to live at home) campaign, also believes further steps are needed. Rhys Tudur says stricter measures are needed He said: ""I hope the changes will make a degree of difference but I don't foresee they'll make as much of a difference as we'd hope. ""They must put in more strict measures, such as a second home tax which is implemented when a home is purchased, and in addition there should be a cap on the number of second homes in each given community. ""The government has consulted upon these measures but they've yet to act upon them, and they should do so soon."" Welsh ministers are encouraging councils to put any extra money raised from higher taxes into increasing the amount of affordable housing. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said the ""intended impact is to reduce the demand for second homes"" and is ""not intended as a money raising exercise by councils"". ""The council tax premiums can form part of a package that also includes planning measures and steps to reduce the number of self-catering properties being switched to business rates instead of council tax,"" a spokesperson added. The Welsh government said: ""We are committed to taking immediate and radical action using the planning, property and taxation systems to tackle the injustices in the current housing market, including the negative impact that second homes and unaffordable housing can have, and will soon have a package of proposals to tackle the various problems this presents.""

"Free Covid tests and Â£500 isolation payments for those eligible are set to end in Wales In a couple of weeks isolation support payments, free Covid tests and extra sick pay for social care workers are due to end in Wales. The Welsh government said the vaccine programme had made it possible to ""learn to live safely alongside coronavirus"". Under new plans to cope with the virus in the long term, ill people will be asked to stay at home ""where possible"". But with many grappling with soaring living costs, how realistic is this? From tradespeople who cannot work from home to people with health conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, there is concern at what the changes will mean. Rules on masks and self-isolation end in Wales Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What's the guidance if I have Covid now? Professor Richard Stanton, a virologist from Cardiff University, believes large-scale Covid isolation has come to an end. ""We can't really expect people to stay at home if they can't test for Covid, if [the Welsh government] haven't got the money to support them to do that,"" he toldBBC Wales Live. Professor Richard Stanton says he thinks a new wave of Omicron is likely Prof Stanton thinks a new wave of the omicron variant is likely and although it will not be comparable to the height of the pandemic, it does bring risks. ""The big risks right now are that a significant proportion of people who catch the virus may go on to get long Covid... or they may well spread it to vulnerable relatives who may get sick with it,"" Prof Stanton added. He believes the best way to mitigate the spread of Covid is to focus on ventilation in workplaces and on public transport. Emma Watkins said she could not afford to stay home if she was ill Care assistant Emma Watkins recently moved to Plymouth with her partner and is expecting a baby. Ms Watkins, from Port Talbot, said she would have to go to work if she felt unwell as she could not survive on statutory sick pay. ""I literally can't afford to get ill because I'm still paying old debts off,"" she said. ""I know it's a bit hard to say but if I'm ill I still need to go in, and obviously we've got PPE and masks and all that."" Ms Watkins would be worried about putting others at risk but said if she did not pay her rent she would be homeless. ""I'd need to be on my death bed not to go in to work because I genuinely can't afford it,"" she said. ""I was on sick a couple of years back when I broke my foot and I had to take my cast off just to go back to work to get my bills sorted because I was having letters left, right and centre off debt collectors."" Angelo Sperandeo, a window and door fitter from Cardiff, said considering whether to go to work in the future if he felt unwell would pose a difficult decision because he cannot work from home. Angelo Sperandeo is unable to work from home and would be forced to go to work while ill ""I'd personally go to work because I'd have no choice really. I'd obviously be thinking of people I'd be in contact with,"" he said. ""You just try and get on with life as best you can but it's always at the back of your mind."" Alex Osborne, from Caerphilly, has multiple sclerosis (MS) and a weakened immune system. Despite having had Covid vaccinations, she said it was unlikely to give her protection because of the regular MS treatment she has. Alex Osborne wants free Covid tests to be made available to immunosuppressed people ""It brings an extra level of worry now,"" said Ms Osborne. ""People might not have any symptoms but I still ask people to check before I invite them into my house. ""If people can no longer do that for me and people like me, that's our safety net that we were using to feel comfortable meeting peopleâ¦ and now it's kind of being removed from us."" Ms Osborne said she wanted free Covid tests to be made available to immunosuppressed people so they can give them to people they are spending time with. David Bailey, chair of the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said scrapping free testing would create a ""two-tier system"" where those unable to pay are ""forced to gamble on the health of themselves and others"". ""Along with free testing for people with symptoms, it is therefore crucial that governments continue to advise symptomatic people to isolate,"" he said. Stacey Rodd, an NHS administrator from Cardiff, said she would probably stay away from the workplace if she felt ill. Stacey Rodd says she has the luxury of being able to work from home, but not everybody does ""I've got the luxury of being able to work from home. Other people haven't, my other half can't, he works in a shop and if he's not there the shop doesn't run,"" she said. ""It's making that call and just being sensible really. There are still vulnerable people about."" The Wales TUC (Trades Union Congress) said the advice to stay home if possible was ""not practical"" for tens of thousands of workers in Wales. Its general secretary, Shavannah Taj, wants the UK government to increase statutory sick pay and the Welsh government to reverse the planned scrapping of enhanced sick pay for social care workers brought in during the pandemic. Wales TUC general secretary Shavannah Taj says some workers will be stuck between a ""rock and a hard place"" ""There's a cost of living emergency, people have no choice at the moment,"" she said. ""You're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Let's learn something from the pandemic, let's do better."" The Welsh government said: ""Thanks to the success of our vaccine programme and the way people across Wales have helped to keep each other safe over the last two years, we are now able to move beyond the emergency response to the pandemic and learn to live safely alongside coronavirus. ""Whilst we have gradually and carefully moved away from the legal protections, we are keeping guidance in place to help people manage the virus. This includes the recommendation to stay at home if you are sick to stop the illness spreading. ""We have set out our plans for testing and we will keep this under review."" The UK government said: ""It is up to employers to determine their sick pay policies and many employers choose to pay more than the minimum level of statutory sick pay. ""The welfare system provides a strong financial safety net to those who are unwell for longer periods or disabled.""

"A woman uses a fan to cool a child during the recent heatwave in India Two weeks of climate talks in Germany have ended in acrimony between rich and poor countries over cash for climate damage. Developing countries say they are reeling from climate change caused by richer countries' emissions over hundreds of years. They hoped to get compensation onto the official agenda for discussions by world leaders in November. But here in Bonn they couldn't get the US and the European Union to agree. ""The climate emergency is fast becoming a catastrophe,"" said Conrod Hunte, lead negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). ""Yet within these walls the process feels out of step with reality, the pace feels too slow,"" he told delegates at the end of the meeting. Sea level rise threatens 200,000 properties Green energy 'stagnates' as fossil fuels dominate Huge methane emission from Russian coal mine People being rescued from floods in China Developing nations say they need money to deal with the impacts of climate change, because they suffer the effects more than richer nations and have less financial capacity to cope. They argue that the climate change they are experiencing has been caused by carbon emitted by richer countries as they developed their economies. They say that Europe and the US have a responsibility now to compensate them for this. The US and Europe don't agree. They fear that if they pay for historic emissions it could put their countries on the hook for billions of dollars for decades or even centuries to come. The issue is termed ""loss and damage,external"" and has become a running sore in these negotiations. At last year's COP26 conference in Glasgow, island states and developing countries agreed to prioritise cuts to carbon emissions on the back of promises that richer nations would finally set up a compensation process this year. It was a compromise they hoped would pay off. But despite two weeks of discussions here in Bonn, they have been unable to get the issue of a funding facility on the agenda for the COP27 conference in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt in November. ""The compromise was based on an understanding that countries would be willing to start talking and taking decisions on dealing with how to get that finance flowing for loss and damage,"" said Alex Scott from E3G, an environmental think tank. ""And we haven't seen that come to fruition here. Instead, we've seen a workshop set up to talk about how we can fix some of the problems."" The EU in particular has come in for heavy criticism. ""The EU consistently blocked discussions on finance for loss and damage in Bonn,"" said Harjeet Singh, from the Climate Action Network International. ""The last two weeks exposed its hypocritical stance, with major countries like Germany sourcing new fossil fuels abroad while denying support to developing countries facing devastation from climate-induced superstorms and rising seas."" Firefighting in Spain Many participants from poorer regions of the world brought their own personal testimony of the impacts of climate change. ""We are already living with loss and damages for the last 25 years,"" said Adriana Vasquez Rodriquez from La Ruta del Clima, a Costa Rican environmental group. ""We have families who have lost their houses, their crops, their lives, and no-one is paying for that, we are running out of resources, and at the same time, we are depending on debt."" Bridging the divide between rich and poor on this issue will not be easy. While the question of a financial facility will now not be on the official discussions at COP27 in Egypt, developing countries are certain to continue to insist that their voices be heard on this question.

"An unnamed worker says he was beaten by the Taliban for working at the embassy More than 100 men who worked at the British embassy in Afghanistan remain in the country, with some telling the BBC they have been beaten and tortured. The men worked for the global security company, GardaWorld, and many had been in post for more than a decade. Several shared photos of injuries they say were caused by the Taliban. The UK government says it has evacuated more than 15,000 people since last year and is working to bring more to the UK. A spreadsheet listing the names of more than 150 men who worked at the embassy and still live in the country has been seen and verified by BBC Two's Newsnight. One man, who cannot be named to protect his identity, said he was recently beaten by the Taliban because of his previous job as a guard at the embassy. ""I was sitting outside when gunmen approached me, one of [them] attacked me,"" he said. ""They said you were working for the British embassy. They started beating me and they threw me on the ground. They attacked me again and again."" ""They attacked me again and again,"" one man said Another former guard said a militant hit him over the head with the butt of a rifle. He says he was only released after the Taliban was convinced he no longer worked for the British. This week, the UK government said the men would be able to apply to come to the UK from 20 June as part of its Afghan citizens resettlement scheme (ACRS), which is primarily targeted at those who assisted the UK efforts in Afghanistan. It was officially launched in January but application requests can only be submitted from next week. Critics say that is too little, too late. A separate government scheme, the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), aimed to relocate those who were employed directly by the British government, including interpreters who helped British forces. One Afghan who came to the UK earlier this year under ARAP said many of his former colleagues from the embassy were being threatened on a daily basis. He is not being named to protect his family who remain in Afghanistan. ""I feel like the British have been disloyal,"" he said. ""They made a promise - these men worked hard for them and now their lives are at risk. ""I can't sleep or eat without thinking of what they're going through.  They message me constantly asking for help."". How many Afghan refugees has the UK resettled? Father fears for safety of family in Afghanistan Terrified Afghan teachers still hiding from Taliban 'The more we wait, the more in danger we are' This week armed forces minister James Heappey told the Commons 9,500 Afghans have already been successfully relocated to the UK under the ARAP scheme. But he said thousands more still remained in Afghanistan. ""We think we've got about the same to go in terms of the number of people who are eligible,"" he said. The British Embassy in Kabul has suspended operations there since the Taliban takeover The human rights charity, Azadi, works to support and evacuate targeted Afghans. Sarah Magill, the charity's director, said there had been no explanation why it had taken so long to begin the next process. ""Through their inaction the government has caused incalculable trauma,"" she said. ""It is a deeply inhumane way to treat a body of staff entrusted to keep British ministers and civil servants safe."" The government has faced fierce criticism of its handling of the evacuation in Afghanistan last summer, with one group of MPs saying there had been a ""total absence of a plan for evacuating Afghans who supported the UK mission"". At the height of the Taliban takeover the government issued a statement, saying: ""We will help all those Afghan security guards contracted through GardaWorld to protect the embassy. ""They will be granted the right to enter the UK and we are now working through the challenging logistics of getting them out of Kabul."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""Our staff worked tirelessly to evacuate over 15,000 people to safety from Afghanistan within a fortnight in the biggest and fastest emergency in recent history. We are still working hard to assist the people of Afghanistan, having already helped over 4,600 individuals to leave the country since the end of the military evacuation. ""We have opened the Afghanistan Citizen Resettlement Scheme, one of the most ambitious resettlement programmes in the world and the first bespoke scheme in Europe to begin resettling evacuees and individuals."" GardaWorld added: ""Since the closure of the British Embassy in Kabul, we have been working tirelessly with the UK government to ensure the maximum take-up for our Afghan staff on the UK resettlement schemes.""

"France's President Macron says European leaders are supportive of Ukraine gaining ""immediate"" candidate status to join the EU Macron, Germany's Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi were earlier welcomed to the Presidential Palace in Kyiv by President Zelensky The EU leaders inspected war damage on a visit to the town of Irpin which Russian troops occupied at the war's start Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov defends Russiaâs actions in Ukraine, in an interview with the BBC Lavrov also criticises the UK for its policy towards Russia Meanwhile, 10,000 civilians are trapped in the embattled eastern city of Severodonetsk, a regional governor says We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for now. Today's updates were brought to you by Paul Gribben, Nathan Williams, Holly Wallis, Catherine Evans, Emily McGarvey, James Clarke, Chris Giles, James FitzGerald and Alex Kleiderman. President Zelensky welcomed France's President Macron to Kyiv Thanks for joining today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a quick look back at some of Thursday's key developments. Kyiv's EU bid backed by four leaders  Lavrov defends invasion  Other headlines  Russia's aggression in Ukraine is a game-changer, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said. Stoltenberg has been speaking in Brussels where defence ministers from member countries of the military alliance and a handful of other allies have been meeting to discuss the situation in Ukraine. He says progress has been made in many areas and, in a meeting with the Ukrainian defence minister last night, they discussed the ""imperative need for our continued support as Russia conducts a relentless war of attrition against Ukraine"". Stoltenberg says Ukraine's allies have announced additional assistance, ""including much-needed heavy weapons and long range systems"" and also discussed plans to support the country for the longer term and to step up Nato's ""presence, capabilities and readiness"". The Russian Orthodox Church has dismissed sanctions against its leader, Patriarch Kirill, imposed by Britain for his support of Moscow's military intervention in Ukraine. It targeted the 75-year-old cleric and ally of President Vladimir Putin two weeks after the EU dropped him from their own sanctions list after opposition from Hungary. ""Attempts to intimidate the primate of the Russian Church with something or to force him to renounce his views are senseless, absurd and unpromising,"" church spokesman Vladimir Legoyda said on Telegram. He added that the Church was ""the last bridge, a means of communication, which they are trying to destroy for some reason. ""This may be necessary only for those political forces that have the escalation of conflict and the alienation of peace as their important goal,"" Legoyda said. Vitaliy ShevchenkoReporting from Moscow Officials installed by Moscow in recently occupied areas of Ukraine say newly-born children there will be given Russian citizenship. This will apply to babies born in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reports. Currently, most of the two regions are under Russian occupation. The deputy head of the Russia-backed administration in the Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov,told RIA Novosti,externalon 16 February that newborns will be given Russian citizenship ""automatically"". Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Russia-backed administration in occupied parts of the Zaporizhzhia region,told RIA Novosti,externalthat the instruction to give Russian citizenship to newborns came from Vladimir Putin's office. In May, Putin issued a decree simplifying the procedure of obtaining Russian citizenship for residents of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions.The EU called it,externalpart of Russia's attempts to ""forcefully integrate"" parts of Ukrainian territory and said it will not recognise Russian passports issued there. The Russian military has been focusing its efforts on the Bakhmut area of the Donetsk region and a continued assault on Severodonetsk, Ukraine's General Staff said in a Facebook update earlier today. ""The enemy keeps trying to establish full control over the city of Severodonetsk. They are storming the city, and the fighting continues,"" the report says. The Russian army has opened fire on Ukrainian units in various areas in or near Severodonetsk and shelled a number of towns in the Bakhmut area - but also towns and cities in other parts of the country too. Ukrainian soldiers ""uncovered and destroyed an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group"" on the route between Yehorivka and Shevchenko in the Donetsk Region, the General Staff said. Macron speaking alongside Ukraine's President Zelensky earlier French arms manufacturer Nexter has been asked by President Macron to increase its production of Caesar howitzer weapons, a source close to the defence ministry tells Reuters. Nexter is being urged to work in a ""wartime"" mode, the source says. During a visit to Kyiv earlier, Macron pledged to send Ukraine another six Caesars on top of the 12 previously delivered. Separately, Macron says it's ""up to Ukraine to decide"" whether to accept any territorial concessions with a view to ending the war - speaking to French TV station TF1 after today's visit. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv The sister of the
Moroccan man who has been sentenced to death by a Russian proxy court in
eastern Ukraine says she feels his story is being ignored - and that he may be
forgotten. Brahim Saadoune was
sentenced alongside Britons Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner, who have received
much more coverage. Saadoune, 21, was studying in Ukraine but signed up to fight in the defence of Mariupol. When he surrendered
- he was put on trial, along with the other two, not as a soldier but a
mercenary. âAt first, when they captured all of them, then it was like different news about every person,â
Imane Saadoune says. âThere wasn't much
attention on my brotherâ¦ he was left aside a little bit.â The three men do
have a chance to appeal but the separatists have said they see no reason not to
put them to death. It has been left to Brahim's friends to campaign for his life. âHe has a lot of
support. His friends, they are real friends, just starting many campaigns for
him. I just want to tell him that he is loved. He's really loved.â Morocco's main national rights body has now condemned the sentencing, calling for Brahim Saadoune to be extradited to Morocco. Meanwhile, state-run MAP news agency is reporting comments by Morocco's diplomatic sources noting that he was being held by a body not recognised by either the UN or Morocco. Brahim Saadoune (R) was sentenced with Aiden Aslin (L) and Shaun Pinner (C) More now from the BBC interview with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov has insisted that courts in an
area of eastern Ukraine run by Russian-backed separatists are truly independent. He was being questioned about two Britons
recently given death sentences by a court in the self-proclaimed Donetsk
Peopleâs Republic â after being captured while fighting alongside Ukrainian
troops. Lavrov says he is ânot interestedâ in whether the West views
Russia as responsible for their fate. âI am only interested in international law,â he says. âAccording
to international law, mercenaries are not recognised as combatants.â The families of Aiden Aslin and Shaun Pinner deny that the
two men were mercenaries, instead saying they are long-serving members of the
Ukrainian military. Challenged with that claim, Lavrov responds âthis should be
decided by a court"". President Zelensky met European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in April Ukraine's hopes of swiftly joining the European Union received a boost earlier, as the leaders of the EU's three largest economies agreed during a visit to Kyiv that the country should get ""immediate"" candidate status. But that would be just the start of what's expected to be a long journey towards accession for Ukraine. The country's candidacy itself is something that would need to be agreed by all 27 of the EU's member states, following today's positive signals from Germany, France, Italy and Romania. That could happen during an EU summit on 23-24 June. There would then follow a negotiation stage, during which Ukraine could be asked to agree to reforms. These could see Kyiv asked to sign up to a set of values that align with the EU's own. It would likely be asked to stamp out corruption; an issue for which the country was notorious before the invasion. Other hopeful joiners, including a number of Balkan countries, have been stuck at the negotiating stage for years. And EU officials - as well as France's President Macron, who visited Kyiv today - have previously cautioned that it could even take decades for the process to be completed in Ukraine's case.

Olha Stefanishyna met France's President Macron and others earlier Ukraine's deputy prime minister says warm scenes during a visit by leaders of four EU nations earlier represent a ""historic breakthrough"" - but warns that Western countries have shown a ""gap [...] between promises and actions"" so far. Those leaders ""now know the price"" of not delivering the right weapons to Ukraine in a timely way, Olha Stefanishyna tells the BBC, in reference to the group's trip to the decimated city of Irpin. Following their visit, a refusal to grant Ukraine candidate status to join the European Union would cause ""enormous frustration amongst Ukrainian people,"" she tells Stephen Sackur on the HARDtalk programme.

This video can not be played EU leaders support Ukraine's membership bid European Union leaders have publicly backed Ukraine's ""immediate"" candidate status to join the bloc, following Russia's invasion of the country. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi spoke at a news conference in Kyiv, where they all reaffirmed their support for Ukraine joining the European Union. The White House says it is ""working very hard to learn more"" about two US citizens who are missing in Ukraine. Alexander Drueke, 39, and Andy Huynh, 27, both from Alabama, are feared by their families to have been captured after reportedly volunteering to fight as part of a Ukrainian army unit. Reuters reports the pair are thought to have been involved in an operation around the Kharkiv region, but did not return. They are said to have been out of contact with their relatives since 8 June. US officials say there is no confirmation that the two men have been captured by Russian forces. During questioning over the reports on Wednesday, a National Security Council spokesman advised Americans against travelling to Ukraine - urging them to find other ways to support the country. This video can not be played Russia's foreign minister has again defended Moscowâs
actions in neighbouring Ukraine, during an exclusive interview with the BBC. âRussia is not squeaky clean,â Sergei Lavrov admits in
answer to a question from Steve Rosenberg. âRussia is what it is. And we are
not ashamed of showing who we are.â The minister claimed the United Nations is âbeing used to
amplify fake news from the West,â after being read quotes from a UN report
detailing alleged Russian war crimes. Of the invasion itself, Lavrov says: âWe had absolutely no
other way of explaining to the West that dragging Ukraine into Nato was a
criminal act.â Russia has opposed the eastward expansion of Nato, a
30-member military alliance of Western nations. Read Steve Rosenberg's story here. Sergei Lavrov has been speaking to the BBC's Steve Rosenberg Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dared the UK
government to try to âdefeatâ Russia over its actions in Ukraine. In an exclusive interview with the BBCâs Russia Editor, Steve
Rosenberg, he says he doesnât think thereâs âroom for manoeuvre anymoreâ in
terms of relations between Russia and the UK. âBoth [UK PM Boris] Johnson and [Foreign Secretary Liz] Truss say openly that we
should defeat Russia, we should force Russia to its knees,â says Lavrov. âGo on then, do it!â he adds. Lavrov goes on to accuse the UK of âonce again sacrificing
the interests of its people for the sake of political ambitions.â He continues: âTheir politicians think only about the next
election and nothing else.â Like other Western nations, the UK has provided Ukraine with
weapons to fight Russian invaders â and has also targeted Moscow with
sanctions. Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Britainâs Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said âthe momentum is still in Ukraineâs favourâ in its fight with Russia. âThat doesnât mean the big Russian war machine is going backwards,â he said, âbut it is not advancing according to their plans"". In an interview with the BBC at a Nato ministerial meeting in Brussels, Mr Wallace said that in some places, Russian artillery outnumbered Ukraineâs by as much as 20 to one. But he said that western nations were now sending more heavy weapons to address the imbalance. Britain has already announced it will be sending Ukraine a small number of multiple rocket launchers â taken from the British Armyâs stock. But Mr Wallace confirmed that Britain would also be  sending 20 self-propelled  artillery  guns to Ukraine. Those artillery guns have been bought from a Belgian arms company to send directly to Ukraine. Mr Wallace said that Britain was still determined to help lead the contributions of weapons to Ukraine. But he said âwe donât have everything in our armed forcesâ. The defence secretary said western nations were also learning lessons about their own âvulnerabilitiesâ from the war in Ukraine - one of them was the need for stocks of ammunition. He added that one of the limiting factors for supplying Ukraine with weapons was âwhat people have on their shelvesâ. Joel GunterReporting from Momotove, near Kharkiv In a field about six miles from the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, the J9 army unit is doing its grim job - digging up bodies of Russian soldiers. In a shallow mass grave under a tree, there are six dead, piled on top of one another in a rough heap. No one here knows who buried them - local residents or retreating Russians. The bodies are swarmed by flies and the smell is overpowering, but the members of the J9 unit and the two diggers who help them are unfazed. They are used to it. The J9 soldiers and gravediggers, including Yurii (front right), carry the bodies out Yurii, one of the gravediggers, got this job after he found five bodies buried in his own garden in a different village, and called the J9 unit to dig them up. ""I helped them dig and they liked the way I worked, because I was a gravedigger before, so now I'm helping them,"" he said. That means going from village to village, every day, exhuming bodies - Ukrainians and Russians. These dead Russians will be taken to the morgue, sampled for identification, and eventually swapped for Ukrainian dead. Yurii served in the army in the Soviet Union. ""Someone is waiting for these men â their fathers and mothers, children,"" he said. âI understand that.â Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv On the fringe of the joint press conference, I
caught up with Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's foreign minister. I asked him whether the latest weapons
announced today are too little, too late considering weâre told up to as many
as 200 Ukrainian soldiers are being lost every day in Donbas. ""The announcements of new weapons
delivered to Ukraine should be made on a weekly basis. And these weapons should
be delivered in sufficient quantities. This is the reality. We appreciate
everything that has been done, we do not complain,"" he told me. ""But the truth is that we're still
outnumbered when it comes to artillery, multiple launch rocket systems and
defence systems, and we cannot make any big progress until we strike a balance
with Russia in the numbers on these three positions. ""So do not get me wrong. I'm not complaining. I appreciate
everything that has been done. I appreciate these announcements, but just to
strike the balance, as I said, these announcements should be made a weekly
basis and in sufficient quantities."" There was a joint press conference with the leaders from Ukraine, Germany, France, Italy and Romania We've been hearing from Ukraine's president and the leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Romania who've been in Kyiv for talks. Here's what we learned from their joint press conference:  Ukraine is ""ready to work"" to become
a full European Union member, President Zelensky said after meeting four
visiting EU leaders for talks in Kyiv. At a news conference in the Ukrainian capital
French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghi and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis all publicly backed
Kyiv's bid to join the bloc. EU leaders are holding a summit next week at
which Kyiv's application to become a candidate for membership is likely to be
given a green light. Zelensky said: ""Ukrainians have already earned the right to
go down this road and obtain this candidate status."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"An unnamed worker says he was beaten by the Taliban for working at the embassy More than 100 men who worked at the British embassy in Afghanistan remain in the country, with some telling the BBC they have been beaten and tortured. The men worked for the global security company, GardaWorld, and many had been in post for more than a decade. Several shared photos of injuries they say were caused by the Taliban. The UK government says it has evacuated more than 15,000 people since last year and is working to bring more to the UK. A spreadsheet listing the names of more than 150 men who worked at the embassy and still live in the country has been seen and verified by BBC Two's Newsnight. One man, who cannot be named to protect his identity, said he was recently beaten by the Taliban because of his previous job as a guard at the embassy. ""I was sitting outside when gunmen approached me, one of [them] attacked me,"" he said. ""They said you were working for the British embassy. They started beating me and they threw me on the ground. They attacked me again and again."" ""They attacked me again and again,"" one man said Another former guard said a militant hit him over the head with the butt of a rifle. He says he was only released after the Taliban was convinced he no longer worked for the British. This week, the UK government said the men would be able to apply to come to the UK from 20 June as part of its Afghan citizens resettlement scheme (ACRS), which is primarily targeted at those who assisted the UK efforts in Afghanistan. It was officially launched in January but application requests can only be submitted from next week. Critics say that is too little, too late. A separate government scheme, the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (ARAP), aimed to relocate those who were employed directly by the British government, including interpreters who helped British forces. One Afghan who came to the UK earlier this year under ARAP said many of his former colleagues from the embassy were being threatened on a daily basis. He is not being named to protect his family who remain in Afghanistan. ""I feel like the British have been disloyal,"" he said. ""They made a promise - these men worked hard for them and now their lives are at risk. ""I can't sleep or eat without thinking of what they're going through.  They message me constantly asking for help."". How many Afghan refugees has the UK resettled? Father fears for safety of family in Afghanistan Terrified Afghan teachers still hiding from Taliban 'The more we wait, the more in danger we are' This week armed forces minister James Heappey told the Commons 9,500 Afghans have already been successfully relocated to the UK under the ARAP scheme. But he said thousands more still remained in Afghanistan. ""We think we've got about the same to go in terms of the number of people who are eligible,"" he said. The British Embassy in Kabul has suspended operations there since the Taliban takeover The human rights charity, Azadi, works to support and evacuate targeted Afghans. Sarah Magill, the charity's director, said there had been no explanation why it had taken so long to begin the next process. ""Through their inaction the government has caused incalculable trauma,"" she said. ""It is a deeply inhumane way to treat a body of staff entrusted to keep British ministers and civil servants safe."" The government has faced fierce criticism of its handling of the evacuation in Afghanistan last summer, with one group of MPs saying there had been a ""total absence of a plan for evacuating Afghans who supported the UK mission"". At the height of the Taliban takeover the government issued a statement, saying: ""We will help all those Afghan security guards contracted through GardaWorld to protect the embassy. ""They will be granted the right to enter the UK and we are now working through the challenging logistics of getting them out of Kabul."" A UK government spokesperson said: ""Our staff worked tirelessly to evacuate over 15,000 people to safety from Afghanistan within a fortnight in the biggest and fastest emergency in recent history. We are still working hard to assist the people of Afghanistan, having already helped over 4,600 individuals to leave the country since the end of the military evacuation. ""We have opened the Afghanistan Citizen Resettlement Scheme, one of the most ambitious resettlement programmes in the world and the first bespoke scheme in Europe to begin resettling evacuees and individuals."" GardaWorld added: ""Since the closure of the British Embassy in Kabul, we have been working tirelessly with the UK government to ensure the maximum take-up for our Afghan staff on the UK resettlement schemes.""
